00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,119
You're underestimating me too much, P' Mor!

352
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,779
This is what they call cooking skill.

353
00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:35,399
I did it all myself for just about every dish.

354
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,899
Really?

355
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,619
Look at my Bicolor Stir-fried Veggies.

356
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,459
I didn't even use any MSG at all.

357
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,160
Give it a try.

358
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,500
Khao Neung, eat lots of veggies!

359
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,879
I don't like veggies, Khru.

360
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:56,239
Huh? Help yourself then. I can eat it by myself then.

361
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,859
But I'll tell you something, bicolor stir-fried veggies have lots of vitamins!

362
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,839
The more vitamins there are, the better vision I have. Right?

363
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,539
-What a liar!
-Liar!

364
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:09,199
What? Here, you can even try asking Chief or P' Mor!

365
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,733
Right?

366
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,659
Dude, Nong Tian has given me chills several times now.

367
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,719
Well you're the one who told me yourself didn't you, Ai Mor?

368
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:29,360
That young people like Tian and Nong Torfun might have some similarities.

369
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,979
Well that's also true!

370
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,830
But isn't it too much though?

371
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,499
Are you trying to say something, Ai Mor?

372
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,659
Are you saying that Torfun died, and her spirit is now in Tian's body?

373
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:45,479
Is that it?

374
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:47,500
I don't know either.

375
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,120
- It's done now.
- Thank you so much, Khru.

376
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,300
Sathu!
[T/N: Basically the Buddhist equivalent of "Amen"]

377
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,619
This is all on you, Ai Toa!

378
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,019
Didn't I tell you plenty of times?

379
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:17,359
Not to walk past Ghost Hill!

380
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,939
That's why the spirit in the woods is following us.

381
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:23,399
No more. Even if I'm being paid, I'll never go there again.

382
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:25,220
Ghost Hill.

383
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,659
That's right! But yesterday, Ee Sang was greeting me.

384
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,220
Greeted me, walked over, and, "Ai Choed, who is walking with you?"

385
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,579
Even though I was walking alone!

386
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,919
Oh my...

387
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,479
It's true! It's true!

388
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:42,039
I got chills! I got so many chills!

389
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,439
Please tell our villagers not to go to or pass Ghost Hill, alright?

390
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:49,439
The spirit is very vicious.

391
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:52,600
Just talking about it gives me the chills.

392
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,979
Listen to them, everyone...

393
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:56,879
Oh, Khru Tian.

394
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:59,080
When did you get here?

395
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,719
Hello, Khama.

396
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,979
Is Longtae here?

397
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:04,359
Longtae...

398
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:05,893
P'Tian!

399
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,510
Yes?

400
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,939
I really saw it.

401
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,339
Trust me.

402
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,319
Did the spirit appear before you?

403
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:20,780
Yes, I saw the whole body of it.

404
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,850
If you sneak out like this, won't the Chief scold you?

405
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,199
Actually, I don't really want anyone to see me.

406
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,560
I didn't expect Khama's home to have guests.

407
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,640
Oh, right. So what's this about?

408
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,500
It's Ai Toa and Ai Choed.

409
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,579
They wandered around Ghost Hill.

410
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,699
I don't know what they did that disrespected the spirits there.

411
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:46,319
When they came back, they caught a fever like they got possessed.

412
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:49,570
That's why they had Joma come to drive away the bad spirits.

413
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,599
Ghost Hill...

414
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,220
The Ghost Hill that's on the path to Pha Pun Dao cliff?

415
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,399
That's right, Phi!

416
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,719
But it splits to the opposite side.

417
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,199
So...have you ever been there, Longtae?

418
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,119
No! Never, Phi. I don't dare to either.

419
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,019
And those men just got haunted like that.

420
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:19,270
I'm sure no one would ever want to go near there for a while.

421
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,660
What about you?

422
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,339
How is it, sleeping at the Phaphirun Unit?

423
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:32,659
- Is it comfy there?
- Comfy, my butt.

424
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:35,059
I have to prepare meals.

425
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,660
Before going to sleep, I'm even used to give massages!

426
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,560
What are you smiling at?

427
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,279
It's nothing, Phi.

428
00:40:53,279 --> 00:40:56,960
Seeing you be able to smile, it makes me feel relieved.

429
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:08,279
I heard the inspector say that they found shirts stained with the same fuel that was found at the school.

430
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:12,280
If they don't confess, then just stick them in jail.

431
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,519
Why the hell are you helping them?

432
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,799
Setting the school on fire is one thing.

433
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:19,200
You also know just who they're working for.

434
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,259
To take down a giant like Por Liang?

435
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,760
With small fries like these, there's no way it can be done.

436
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,279
That's why I'm trying to offer them a deal.

437
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,559
If they're willing to be moles for us, then we can get more than this.

438
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,179
Are you really serious about this?

439
00:41:40,179 --> 00:41:41,659
And what if they end up blabbing?

440
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,119
We would be all screwed.

441
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,420
People who are afraid to die like this, they wouldn't dare. Trust me.

442
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,679
My informant told me that they're waiting to deliver a big order.

443
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,219
They're crossing to a new hotel on that side over there.

444
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,620
I really want to follow this matter more.

445
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,420
Aren't you afraid of stepping on the toes of someone in the Ministry?

446
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,890
I have nothing to lose.

447
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,440
And do you believe that they'd allow it?

448
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,193
Phu.

449
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,499
It's game over.

450
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:22,640
Your big fish has fled.

451
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,159
I think...by now, he's probably already crossed the border.

452
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,939
Por Liang?

453
00:42:28,939 --> 00:42:31,019
Shit!

454
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,879
Hey, take it easy.

455
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,659
I've already coordinated with the other side of the border. I think he probably won't get away.

456
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,780
I'm just afraid that it really will be game over then.

457
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:50,340
It's alright, man. I think that, at the very least, he won't be able to move as freely as before.

458
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,619
He probably won't come and cause trouble over petty matters in the village anymore.

459
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,220
Nong Tian should be safe now.

460
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,259
Woah! It's cold! Today's really cold, right?

461
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:08,119
It's better if you put on a jacket first, I think.

462
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,840
Or you'll get pneumonia!

463
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,539
Come, come. Let's drink...to our friend instead.

464
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,240
Cheers to our barking hill dog!

465
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,240
-Bottoms up? Bottoms up?
-Bottoms up!

466
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,079
No can do.

467
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,713
Ai Mor.

468
00:43:32,713 --> 00:43:34,959
I'll rat you out to Dr. Jib, your wife.

469
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,379
- My wife?
- Yeah!

470
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:38,379
Where, what wife? What wife?

471
00:43:38,379 --> 00:43:40,339
I don't see a wife.

472
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:41,539
I'm telling you,

473
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:46,579
Everyone in Chiang Mai knows that I'm...

474
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:48,013
Single!

475
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,620
Hey, can you repeat that?

476
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,479
Hey, I'm kidding. I was just kidding.

477
00:43:54,479 --> 00:43:56,259
Just kidding.

478
00:43:56,259 --> 00:44:02,099
Dr. Jib is the only woman in my heart.

479
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:06,819
All other girls around...they're just siblings!

480
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,799
That's inspiring!

481
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:12,859
Hey!

482
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:16,439
This sharp-looking (Naa Kom) guy's words should be our unit's motto (Kam Kom).
[T/N: Pun with the word "Kom" (Sharp/Clever)]

483
00:44:16,439 --> 00:44:17,639
Right, Chief?

484
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,619
What "we"?

485
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,820
For me... whoever I love, that's the one I'll truly love.

486
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,019
I'm begging you, please. I'm begging you.

487
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:27,599
Just love someone already.

488
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,580
Before you don't know how to "do it."

489
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,700
Ai Mor, you better watch it.

490
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,760
Chief, is your girlfriend pretty?

491
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,939
Our chief? He works from day to night.

492
00:44:47,939 --> 00:44:50,319
He just stays in the forest on the hill!

493
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:53,240
He's gonna end up getting a tree as his wife already!

494
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,199
Oh! Seriously, is that true?

495
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,500
What a waste.

496
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,519
Why is it a waste?

497
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,279
You are this good-looking.

498
00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:08,019
Don't think it's a waste. Don't think it's a waste.

499
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,980
I'll just tell you, you're not my friend's type.

500
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,219
Doctor, you're so mean!

501
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:20,370
To say that!

502
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,079
Let's get going and get drinking snacks instead.

503
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,559
Come on.

504
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,819
Huh? You're leaving already?

505
00:45:27,819 --> 00:45:31,059
- What?
- I'll go too, I'll go too.

506
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:33,360
Hey, hey, hey! Chang stay still, stay still.

507
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,099
Hey, did you know?

508
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:44,660
I...have something... about Nong Tian to tell you.

509
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,560
Well, it's...

510
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,579
It...Tian, he...

511
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,300
Used to...

512
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,159
Mor! Mor!

513
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:56,700
Ai Mor!

514
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,299
Wake up.

515
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,419
He's always such a lightweight!

516
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:03,959
Here. Here, put this in his mouth.

517
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,659
- It'll wake him up. Oh, really?
- He'll puke! Yeah.

518
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:11,319
- Where did you get this? It's delicious.
- Yes. Yes.

519
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:13,570
I've never had this before up in the hill.

520
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,500
It's yummy.

521
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,600
Keep going, Chief. It's was just getting beautiful.

522
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:25,740
