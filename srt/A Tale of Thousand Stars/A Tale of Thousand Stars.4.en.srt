- Well, someone who can't tolerate cheating, of course.

Then there's no need to buy or sell it anymore you bastard! You can just take it all back!

3
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:06,879
You! Hey, stop!

Khru Tian! Khru Tian! Khru Tian!

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,400
Does it hurt anywhere else?

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,439
Be gentle. It hurts.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:22,940
Everyone at Pha Pun Dao have gathered togehter to hold a blessing event for you, Khru Tian.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,190
Are you sober now, Pomeranian?

9
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,399
No need to be shy.

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,511
With our profession, we get even more scars than you.

11
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:00,720
- Do you want to see them?
- Hey! There's no need.

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,913
Does this one hurt?

13
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,303
No.

14
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,750
So aren't you going to ask...

15
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,450
just...how I got these scars?

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,573
No.

17
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:27,960
There's something else that I'd rather talk about.

18
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,983
What is it?

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,820
Why do you have Torfun's journal?

20
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,329
The foundation gave me Torfun's journal as an additional reference.

21
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,879
Lies.

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,280
What's your relationship with Torfun?

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,350
I had a heart transplant surgery,

24
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,670
and this heart... it was Torfun's.

25
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:19,350
So I came up here to return her favor for giving me a new life.

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,429
And why would you hide that from us?

27
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,880
So how should I have told them then?

28
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,029
Everyone...the Torfun that you all loved is dead now.

29
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,630
And I'm using her heart now.

30
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,910
How would everyone feel?

31
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,079
Just how disappointed would they be,

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,289
that the heart of such a good person like Torfun ended up with such a lousy person like me?

33
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,370
The people here wouldn't be angry.

34
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,790
If you spoke the truth.

35
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,900
I'm going to ask you one last time.

36
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,170
Tell the truth!

37
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,489
I said it all already.

38
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,189
No.

39
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,539
Ask yourself then, just what are you hiding from us?

40
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,479
Tell us the truth.

41
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,229
Tell the truth, Tian.

42
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,769
I said to say it!

43
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,349
Tell the truth!

44
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,199
Tell the truth, Tian!

45
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,330

P'Tian! Are you awake yet, Phi?

53
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,820
Oh, Longtae!

54
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,563
Let's eat.

55
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,629
Here, Phi. There was so much food left over from last night.

56
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,830
So my dad asked me to bring it to you, Phi.

57
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,150
Thanks a lot, Longtae.

58
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,229
My dad said that you were studying engineering, right?

59
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,470
Then you must be pretty great, Phi.

60
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,149
What great?

61
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,769
I was a back-in-the-class kid.
[T/N: Sits in the back and doesn't pay attention]

62
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,450
That I hadn't been expelled yet was already fortunate enough.

63
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,399
- And what about you? You're studying in Chiang Mai, right?
- Yes, Phi.

64
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,889
What field are you studying?

65
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,460
I'm studying Political Science, Phi.

66
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,129
And also...this. It may seem hard to believe, but I'm the photographer of the village.

67
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,779
Whenever there are important events,

68
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,719
I always get called up here to take pictures.

69
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,039
Like the ceremony for me last night?

70
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,529
That's right, Phi.

71
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,690
And there's also another event that's...

72
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,100
Eh...Oh! It's a wedding! It's the wedding for Khao Neung's big brother, Phi.

73
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,309
Where's the girl he's marrying from?

74
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,989
Here, Phi.

75
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,559
This couple liked each other for a really long time already.

76
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:26,919
But there was also a period when they separated for work.

77
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,669
They were apart from each other for many years.

78
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,819
It's pretty unbelievable too that they'd come back up here and get married.

79
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,259
Why? Don't other couples come back?

80
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,919
There are some, Phi. Separating to move to go work down there and have a better life like that,

81
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:41,089
If it were you, Phi, would you come back up here then?

82
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,319
It's much more comfortable living down there.

83
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,400
Yeah, that's true.

84
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,309
They said that the reason that this couple came back up here to get married

85
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,160
is because they made a wish at Pha Pun Dao Cliff.

86
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,670
So...how do they make a wish?

87
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,649
It seems that they say if you go make a wish at the cliff on the last day of the year,

88
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,149
count 1,000 stars, and wish for a blessing of love,

89
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,720
your wish will come true.

90
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,499
I've heard this tale since I was a little kid, Phi.

91
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,359
Whether it's true or not, I don't know either.

92
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,460

- Ai Mor.
- Hmm?

99
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,030
For scars on the chest... what do you think they could be caused by?

100
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,519
It could be caused by a lot of different things, dude.

101
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,770
They can be caused from surgery

102
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,429
or maybe...

103
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,370
an accident.

104
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,533
Why the heck are you asking?

105
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,550
Is it Nong Tian's scar?

106
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,659
Oh my! Just what exactly is the deal?

107
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,229
I've seen it several times already that my friend seems to be paying special attention to this teacher.

108
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,409
Is there anything going on?

110
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,149
Do you have such little work or something?

111
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,700
For you to be so free in being interested in other people's business?

112
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,560
If you really want to know about his scars,

113
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,109
then why the heck don't you just ask him himself then?

114
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,749
I know! But how the heck am I supposed to ask him?

115
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,850
What? Why?

116
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,119
The scars on his chest…

117
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,740
Don't tell me you've seen him naked.

118
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,919
The medicine is right here, right?

119
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,370
You know that.

120
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,370

Before we start our class today,

124
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,880
could I ask everyone to call me "Phi" instead?
[T/N: Phi used to refer to someone like an older brother or sister]

Well there are so many others known as "Khru" already.

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,109
I'd like to be your "Phi" instead.

132
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,389
This machine is called a weight scale.

133
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,949
So whenever we sell things,

134

we won't be able to get tricked.

135
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,919
Then I'll teach you how to read it, is that okay?

136
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,700
These little lines are called "keed".
[T/N: "Keed" means "line", but is also understood to mean 1 gram]

137

Ten lines are equal to 1 kilogram.

138
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,489
And whenever these needles point to any number,

139
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,600
it's showing that's how much it weighs.

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,520
Be careful. Watch out.

175
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,390
I told you to watch out.

176
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,540
I know now just what I'll give as a prize to the kids.

177
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,819
All right, everyone.

178
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,069
Today, I'm going to teach you all how to fold the giant bird.

179
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,940
-Who wants to try folding it? Do you want to fold it? Want to fold it?
- Me! Me! Me!

180
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,240
Alright...then everyone, get a piece of paper and put it down. Put it down.

181
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,539
Start with this part. Can you see it, everyone?

182
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,689
Fold it in the middle like this.

183
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,910
Alright, everyone fold it first. Fold it first.

184
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,680
Make sure you press the fold from one end to the other end firmly.

185
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,869
Let's see. Did you do it yet?

186
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,960
- Yes.
- Ah, very good.

187
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,720
Let's see, let's see. Whoever is done, show me.

188
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,909
- Here. Show me. Show me.
- Watch out for the big bird!

189
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,949
- Peck! Peck! Peck!
- Khao Neung! Khao Neung! What are you doing?

190
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,060
The giant bird is a kind giant bird, you know?

191
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,250
Because this giant bird protects our village from...

192
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,443
From…

193
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,550
The mean Green Giant!

194
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,739
Green Giant! Green Giant! Green Giant!

195
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,539
Oh?
 [Little Red Riding Hood]

196
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,340
I didn't bring the Green Giant doll with me today.

197
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,939
Chief!

198
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,473
Come here.

199
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,640
Come here first.

200
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,070
Alright everyone! Please give a round of applause for the Green Giant!

201
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,740
Come here.

202
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,830
Hurry up, Chief.

203
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,840
Once upon a time, there was a green giant.

204
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,440
He was always annoyed

205
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,260
and aggressive.

206
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,580
And this giant enjoyed destroying forests too!

207
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,310
But sometimes, this giant was also very kind.

208
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,280
He could be smiley and friendly.

209
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,870
But most of the time,

210
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,779
he was very grumpy and furious.

211
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,413
Torfun.

212
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,033
Thank you.

213
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,280
Chief!

214
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,299
Hey, Mr. Green Giant.

215
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,759
You dare to come all the way here?

216
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,799
Alright everyone, hold up your big birds.

217
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,219
And then...attack the Green Giant!

218
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,390
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Ouch! Ouch!

219
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,279
Hurry.

220
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,713
Ouch.

221
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,300
- Chief, I didn't do it.
- I also didn't do it.
- Who did it?

222
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,933
Who did it?

223
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,699
Alright everyone, we just happen to be out of time!

224
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,879
Everyone can go home then!

225
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,380
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry and grab your things!

226
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,650
- Chang Yod and Rang.
- Yes, Sir.

227
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,980
Send the kids off too.

228
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,240
Got it, Sir.

229
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,289
- Kiddos, let's go.
- Come on, kiddos. Let's go quickly.

230
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:49,600
Let's go.

231
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,630
Aai Rang, let's go eat!

232
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,980
Go, go, go.

233
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,239
Let's go. I'll buy you ice cream, alright?

234
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,040
Let's go.

235
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,353
Wait.

236
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,480
Did you need something?

237
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,249
What about you then?

238
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,400
Is there anything you'd like to tell me?

239
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,860
So what do you want to hear then?

240
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,340
Last night, when I took you home, I saw…

241
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,939
that you're almost out of things.

242
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,290
I happen to be going to the market today.

243
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,960
Would you like to tag along?

244
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,833
Of course, I'll go.

245
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,940
I just happened to want to buy some things.

246
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,313
Lead the way then.

247
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,300
Will you be able to sit on it?

248
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,190
You're underestimating me too much, Chief.

249
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,373
Hop on then.

250
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,103
Hold on.

251
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,633
Hold on!

252
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,250
Not there.

253
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,120
Whenever I tell you to do something, you say that I'm scolding you.

254
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,493
Hold on tight.

255
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,300
Tighter.

256
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,800
That's too tight.

257
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,920
♫ You're not like the person that I had dreamt of
 ♫

258
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:15,060
♫ And I may not be that person ♫

259
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:22,200
♫ But just us meeting, it's as if we had…had met before in a dream ♫

260
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,250
♫ My heart flutters unusually when I'm near you ♫

261
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:34,770
♫ In just a split second of being near you, this world has changed ♫

262
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:41,280
♫ Just having you beside me, that's all I need ♫

263
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,200
♫ I might not find a reason or any justification ♫

264
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,270
♫ For what everything between us is
 ♫

265
00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:00,700
♫ The story that's been told however many times is still the same ♫

266
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:07,240
♫ It's that I love you, love you. It has never changed ♫

267
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,730
♫ If perhaps the stars hear the words of the prayers within my heart ♫

268
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:24,600
♫ No matter how many thousands of times, I'll still ask for my heart to be near you ♫

269
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,983
Ai Phu!

270
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,719
If you already made plans with Dr. Nam, why would you invite me to come along?

271
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,900
No, he asked to tag along on his own. I didn't invite him.

272
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,460
I intended to bring you here already.

273
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,619
- Hello, Phi.
- Hi.

274
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:06,069
- Hey, Nong Tian.
- Hmm?

275
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,299
Ai Phu said that this evening you're going to make us dinner?

276
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,833
Huh?

277
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,909
Phi Mor?

278
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,199
I'm not good at cooking at all, Phi.

279
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,610
I only know how to make instant noodles.

280
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,999
No need to be so serious.

281
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,019
I can eat anything. I just ask for one thing... I ask that I don't have to make it myself.

282
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:38,729
Because in the past, Ai Phu here... always loved to use me to cook every meal for him! As if I were his wife!

283
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,549
Get water spinach too.

284
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,790
Ai Mor likes it.

285
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,223
Here.

286
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,080
I'd like two bunches of water spinach, please.

287
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,019
Hello, Chief and Doctor!

288
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,910
Who's the young man you brought? I've never seen his face before.

289
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,220
This is Nong Tian. He's the new teacher at the school.

290
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,519
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

291
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,900
Oh, and what about Nong Fun then? I don't see her with you.

292
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,249
She's pretty busy so she couldn't come with us.

293
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:11,039
Oh... then can you give Nong Fun these avocados?

294
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,329
They're Nong Fun's favorite.

295
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,163
-Oh, sure!
- Yes.

296
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:16,640
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, dear.

297
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:23,060
Eagle calling Star 2. Eagle calling Star 2. Return to base immediately.

298
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,300
Dude, some work came up.

299
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,570
- I'll hurry up back to base first.
- Okay, okay.

300
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,240
I'll see you later at the teacher's house then.

301
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,499
Okay.

302
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,529
See you.

303
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,730
- I'll look after him for you.
- Yeah.

304
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,270
I think you can just lead then, Phi Mor.

305
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,510
I think you can just choose yourself, Nong Tian. I can eat anything.

306
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,239
Let's choose what the Chief likes instead then, Phi.

307
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,240
Phi Mor, you should know what the Chief likes.

308
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,250
Even the Chief knows what you like, Phi Mor.

309
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,809
Hey! Wait, wait, Nong Tian.

310
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,769
Wait a minute... Nong Tian, why are you saying something that's coming off touchy?

311
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
It's not like that, Phi Mor!

312
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,299
Alright, Nong Tian, you're not the first person to think like that.

313
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,480
Even my girlfriend still ships me with Ai Phu!

314
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,469
You...you have a girlfriend, Phi Mor?

315
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,819
Of course! Here.

316
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,450
She's a pediatrician in Bangkok.

317
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,889
Let me brag a bit.

318
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,423
Isn't she pretty?

319
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,760
She's actually pretty.

320
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,780
So...what about Chief Phupha, Phi? Does he have a lover yet?

321
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,509
Someone like Ai Phu having a lover?

322
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,720
A stuck-up guy like him... How would he even know how to flirt with anyone?

323
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,199
As for things like being sweet...

324
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,979
Don't even bother mentioning it.

325
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,490
Anyone who'd be able to put up with him, I'd consider them to be a saint!

326
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:05,449
A saint... A saint like Khru Torfun or something like that, Phi?

327
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,799
That's right! Like Nong Torfun, she matches every requirement.

328
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,259
She's lovely and kind.

329
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,360
And she could get along with the people here.

330
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,949
Oh, right, Phi Mor?

331
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,810
The two of them...were they...

332
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,990
If they were a couple?

333
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,150
So it's like this, I also don't know if they were lovers or not.

334
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,099
But if you want to know, Nong Tian,

335
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,900
try asking Ai Phu then.

336
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,460
This one...we can get it later then.

337
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,900
For you to wait to this extent...

338
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,590
What are you hungry for exactly?

339
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,123
Ai Mor!

340
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:17,129
Oh, Mr. Chef! Please quickly start cooking.

341
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,779
Because right now my stomach is growling.

342
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,589
You got it, Phi.

343
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,723
Want me to help?

344
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:25,039
No need.

345
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Just help by staying still is enough.

346
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,330
Who cuts like that?

347
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,620
How should I cut it then?

348
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,820
Well, cut it for them to be even then.

349
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,039
However it's cut, it's still eaten all the same though.

350
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,969
They won't get cooked evenly.

351
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,020
Isn't that right, Ai Mor?

352
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,550
I think...I should take and wash the chicken instead.

353
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,050
Here, you should try cutting it like this.

354
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,259
I told you there's no need. I'll do it myself.

355
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:08,759
Slice it thinly. If it's too thick, it won't be cooked through.

356
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,649
No, give it here. I can do it myself.

357
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,320
Here. Why don't you try showing me?

358
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,040
That's too thick!

359
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,229
Chief! I said I could do it myself. Can you not get in my way?

360
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,769
- Hey, the water is boiling already.
- I know.

361
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,700
Tian! The eggs are going to burn already!

362
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,280
I know that already!

363
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,990
Get a plate. Bring a plate over.

364
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,370
Tian... the flame is too strong, Tian.

365
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,389
Well, it's because I've never made several things at the same time, Phi.

366
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,789
Then... This Kai Jieow, let's not eat it, alright?

367
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,423
Bring it here.

368
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,700
When in a forest, on a mountain...even one egg is precious you know?

369
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,729
Alright, alright. Come on, let's eat. Let's eat instead.

370
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,139
Oh, right, Dude!

371
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,330
Today, Nong Tian also asked me what's the relationship between me and you.

372
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,280
P' Mor!

373
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,600
What are you looking at?

374
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,310
I'm so full!

375
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,839
This meal was delicious. I have to find some alcohol to finish it off.

376
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,139
Are you okay with that, Ai Phu?

377
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,310
I rode my motorcycle here.

378
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,289
That's alright, though. You can just leave it parked here.

379
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,940
We can go in the same car. You can come get it tomorrow instead.

380
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,439
Fine, fine, fine.

381
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,089
Nong Tian, I'd like to thank you for this meal.

382
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,479
Whenever you come by our base, I'll cook for you too, alright?

383
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:14,099
You got it, P' Mor.

384
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,220
- Anyway, drive back home safely.
- Yes, sir!

385
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,540
I'll head back first then, alright?

386
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,983
Sure.

387
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,410
Oh, wait!

388
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,240
You forgot your stuff.

389
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,409
I didn't forget it.

390
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,510
The stuff inside is yours.

391
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,040
Before going to bed, did you set up the mosquito net like I taught you?

392
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,640
I did it already.

393
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,460
Can you not nag so much?

394
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,929
Can't you see that the mosquito net is old?

395
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,030
It's full of holes.

396
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,850
Hey. You've only just parted from that kid not too long ago.

397
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,879
Are you missing that kid already?

398
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,220
Yeah.

399
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:38,180
Hey! Woah! If that's it, I'll drive right back to him then!

400
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,420
Hey, I'm not thinking of him like that.
[T/N: "To miss" in Thai can also mean "To think of"]

401
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,130
Don't you feel like he reminds you of someone?

402
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,090
Like Nong Torfun?

403
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,270
You don't feel it?

404
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,899
Well, there are some times...

405
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,069
But, I also don't think it's strange.

406
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,979
They're young, city kids, and are idealistic.

407
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:05,190
Maybe they were the type to be involved with extracurriculars in school.

408
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,240
I was also like that before.

409
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,179
If that was all then that'd be good.

410
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,340
What? So what more could there be than that?

411
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,293
It's nothing.

412
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,289
Huh... So if that's the case, would my chief

413
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,850
feel the same as he did for Nong Torfun then?

414
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,619
Dude, just keep driving.

415
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,239
You're talking too damn much, dude. You'll swerve off the road.

416
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,860
Yes, Chief.

417
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,909
Aai Rang, do you want one?

418
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,889
It's alright, it's alright.

419
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,020
Aai Seetian!

420
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,279
What's wrong? Why didn't you come to class?

421
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,479
Are you sick?

422
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,369
Not at all.

423
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,269
Mom said to help look after them.

424
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,059
Huh? So what are they doing?

425
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,859
Here. Phi, do you remember what I had told you?

426
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,859
About the wedding, Phi.

427
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,009
- Oh.
- There's a tradition here

428
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,889
for the groom to build a palanquin to receive the bride from her home.

429
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,390
But this year is a bit special. They're trying to put a chair on it too.

430
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:19,580
It seems that the bride said sitting on a plain wooden board didn't feel very safe, Phi.

431
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,399
Done. Get on it.

432
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,050
Alright, go. Get on it.

433
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,400
Oh, we can't do it. We can't do it.

434
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,169
Why is it even worse than before?

435
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,340
That's how it is. The higher it is, the harder it is to carry.

436
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,869
I think that you'd have to change the layout.

437
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,950
This one doesn't work. It's not safe.

438
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,919
Right! You're studying engineering!

439
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,379
Then you'd be able to help us, Phi!

440
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,470
Hey! I don't know anything.

441
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,079
But you still know more than any of us here.

442
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,389
Give it a bit of a try, Phi.

443
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,649
We need to use it by tomorrow already.

444
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,040
Alright, alright. I can try then.

445
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,329
Everyone, this is the palanquin that I was talking about.

446
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,363
Can everyone see it?

447
00:32:08,363 --> 00:32:11,030
The palanquin will be fitted with poles, two of them.

448
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,879
and a chair in the middle.

449
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,690
As for the chair, we'll attach the poles between it to make it more balanced.

450
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,709
I think it's still not passable though.

451
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,729
The chair should be like bamboo though.

452
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,980
I heard Khama say that someone ordered to fix the palanquin.

453
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,350
Do you need more helpers?

454
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,280
Can you do it, Chang Yod?

455
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,419
We'll try lifting it then, alright?

456
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,510
One, two, three! Go ahead and lift!

457
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,810
Alright, try it. Try walking to see if it works or not. Alright, go.

458
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,880
Awesome, Phi!

459
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,560
-It's finally done.
-Do you want to see the pictures?

460
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,580
Do you want to see the pictures?

461
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,309
Oh, Chief!

462
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,149
Khama invited us to eat khao tom at his house.
[T/N: Rice porridge]

463
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,079
Are you going to come with us?

464
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,370
Chang, if you want to go then go. I'm not hungry.

465
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,790
Who's the one that told you, Khama, that I could build a plane?

466
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:57,379
It was a joke, Phi! So that the villagers could believe in you.

467
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:59,569
But your palanquin, Khru,

468
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:05,610
helped the bride sit comfortably that it wouldn't lose to a plane either!

469
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:12,229
Oh, right then... Khru, you should eat quickly and then quickly go inside your home, alright?

470
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,200
Tonight is the dog-howling night!

471
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,640
Dog-howling night? What's that?

472
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,029
Hey, hey! He doesn't know about the dog-howling night!

473
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:32,499
Right! Here, let's just say... tonight, Khru, you should quickly eat and quickly go inside your home.

474
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,789
And what's important is just don't come out and wander around, alright?

475
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,460
He doesn't know about the dog-howling night.

476
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,440
(What is it?)

477
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,260
I don't know either, Phi.

478
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,920
Well... The dog-howling night is the night before the wedding ceremony.

479
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,460
They don't allow kids to leave their homes at night.

480
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,570
Or could it be... it's related to the Pha Pun Dao tale?

481
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,900
Well, it's possible, Phi.

482
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:25,430
Hey, Longtae! Let's take a look then...to see what dog is howling.

483
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,373
-Let's do it, Phi!
Alright, let's eat.

484
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,269
Where is it, Longtae?

485
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,150
I don't hear a single dog howling.

486
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,150
There has to be, Phi.

487
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,070
- Hey! It's a person.
- Phi...

488
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,970
Is that P'Rang?

489
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,140
- P'Rang!
- Oh, that's P' Rang!

490
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,710
Nong Tian! Oh, Longtae!

491
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,269
Do you want to see something good? Come with me.

492
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,280
Are you sure?

493
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,160
- Yes.
- This way.

494
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,440
I know what it is now.

495
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,500
Keep your voice down and come up here.

496
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,699
- Shit! Phi!
- Keep it down.

497
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:13,590
I'll go first then, Phi. Bye-bye.

498
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,340
Goodbye.

499
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,320
Alright, just go back first.

500
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,440
Uh... I'll leave first then.

501
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,853
What?

502
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:44,359
Let go.

503
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,210
Did you have enough fun yet?

504
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,113
What fun?

505
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,080
I didn't see a thing.

506
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,169
Are you sure?

507
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,503
Yeah.

508
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,223
Hey!

509
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,879
Turn the light off.

510
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,513
Be quiet.

511
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,249
I thought you'd gone back to base already.

512
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,539
I suspected that people would be doing something that wasn't right.

513
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,179
And my thinking was right.

514
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:28,139
Well, who would have thought that the dog-howling night that they were talking about would be something like that?

515
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,280
I had thought it would've been related to the Pha Pun Dao tale.

516
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,069
Where did you hear that from?

517
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,070
You know about it too?

518
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,689
Longtae told me about it.

519
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,379
They say that on the last night of the year,

520
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,079
if we go up to Pha Pun Dao and count up to 1,000 stars,

521
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,049
we could make one wish for anything we'd like,

522
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,559
And then that wish will come true.

523
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:57,659
And Longtae also told me that the groom that's getting married tomorrow,

524
00:38:57,659 --> 00:38:59,419
He'd also gone up there to make a wish.

525
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,249
That he'd like to come back to get married.

526
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,650
And he really was able to come back to get married.

527
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,653
Oh, yeah...

528
00:39:08,653 --> 00:39:10,559
I heard that...

529
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,220
you had taken the previous volunteer teacher to the cliff already though.

530
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,083
So what of it?

531
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,553
Chief,

532
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,150
do you believe in the Pha Pun Dao tale?

533
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,179
You've arrived home now. Hurry up and sleep.

534
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,430
The ceremony tomorrow starts early in the morning.

535
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,189
You keep on about shooing me to go to sleep.

536
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,349
Why don't you just tell me a story then, that way I'll have sweet dreams.

537
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,269
What story would you like to hear then?

538
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,970
I'm being sarcastic.

539
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:16,630
Anyway, well... thanks, Chief, for accompanying me on the walk.

540
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,153
I'm going then.

541
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,013
Sweet dreams.

542
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,629
They're here! They're here! They're here!

543
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,219
Come, come, come, come.

544
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,290
Stop.

545
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,269
Alright, the mother should go bring the bride.

546
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:03,430
Slowly, alright? Be careful of falling off the palanquin.

547
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,219
Alright, the groom come here!

548
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,709
Groom, come greet your bride first.

549
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,070
Now hold each other's hands, alright?

550
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,699
I wish you a happy marriage and you'll be fruitful in producing children. Have one at the beginning of the year and the end of the year, alright?

551
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,280
Bow your head, bow your head. Yes!

552
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,369
Today is an auspicious day.

553
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,629
Receive the blessing.

554
00:41:29,629 --> 00:41:33,120
Alright, powder the faces first. Powder the faces first.

555
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,630
Gently. Ok, ok gently.

556
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,720
What did the bring the egg for?

557
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,770
It's as a prediction, Phi.

558
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,319
If they drop the egg, it means that they won't have kids.

559
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,219
Oh, that's pretty unique.

560
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,020
I've only heard that if they want kids, it'd have to be when the egg drops (Kai Dtok).
[T/N: Referring to the ovulation period (Chuang Kai Dtok)]

561
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,680
May you have a house full of children.

562
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,789
Woah!

563
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,899
Phi! Want to go see them play Chong?

564
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,849
"Chong"? What the heck is that?

565
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:22,870
Let's go.

566
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,270
Here it is, Phi.

567
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,630
This is what they call Chong.

568
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:35,779
This thing, where I'm from, we call it a spinning top.

569
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,460
Want to try it a bit? Just for fun.

570
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,619
Sure, why not?

571
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,469
Hey! Ayi, may I try?

572
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:43,239
Sure.

573
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,959
Ah, okay.

574
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,349
Compete with Khao Neung.

575
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:49,449
I'm competing against Khao Neung, right? Come here, Khao Neung!

576
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:52,769
- I'm the village's champion!
- The village's champion?

577
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:55,280
One, two, three.

578
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,210
Hey! You're really good, Phi!

579
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,009
Kalae!

580
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,629
Look.

581
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,479
Just look at your Nong Tian.

582
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,180
He's totally a kid from the hills now.

583
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,449
What about our bet then?

584
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,999
That Khru Tian wouldn't last here a month.

585
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,769
If it's like this, then who would get the money then?

586
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:23,269
- Right...
- Me, I'm getting the money.

587
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:25,039
Because I was already on Khru Tian's side!

588
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,089
I remember that very well.

589
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,689
Relax, there are still many days left.

590
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,379
Hey! Are...are you counting the days?

591
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,629
Why is it that for the other teachers, he never seemed to count them?

592
00:43:37,629 --> 00:43:39,450
- Didn't seem like it.
- Didn't seem like it.

593
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,059
Oh, Chief!

594
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,400
Chief, come here! Chief!

595
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,360
Chief, come help out a bit.

596
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,109
Are you teaming up against me?

597
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,709
Are you having fun?

598
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,430
- Hello.
- Hello.

599
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,109
Hi, P' Mor. Hi, P'Rang. Hello.

600
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,243
Chang, hi.

601
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,019
Chief, P' Tian is damn good.

602
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,379
Fight him for us.

603
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:11,140
Hey, no. I'd rather watch instead.

604
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,699
Come on.

605
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,949
Why?

606
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:16,900
Are you afraid, Chief?

607
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,870
Geez, it's just this and you're scared?

608
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,540
And if I win, what will you give me?

609
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,039
How about this?

610
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,649
Whoever wins, can make one demand of anything they'd like.

611
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,983
Is that enough?

612
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,150
Khao Neung, give me your spinning top for a bit.

613
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,650
I'd like to practice a bit. I haven't played it for a while.

614
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,440
Go for it.

615
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,290
Show him what you got.

616
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,579
You're cheating.

617
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,369
Your rope is better than mine.

618
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:11,609
Why?

619
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,960
Are you afraid of losing, Khun Khru?

620
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,599
Khru Tian, beat him!

621
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,660
Beat him, Tian.

622
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,870
Tian, Tian. Yeah!

623
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,103
Eighty then?

624
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:31,030
A hundred! A hundred!

625
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,579
What are you doing, Phi?

626
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,459
I'm making this rope rougher so it'll create more friction on the spinning top.

627
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,629
He's going to lose anyway.

628
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,340
He can't beat Phupha's strength.

629
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,419
Are you ready?

630
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,189
Are you ready?

631
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,200
One, two, three!

632
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,540
Hey, Chief! Hey!

633
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,929
Get it from P' Mor.

634
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:24,830
All right, tell me what you want.

635
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,480
I want to go to Pha Pun Dao cliff.

[Santhong Aid Foundation | Miss Torfun Chareonpon]

I hope I'll make it before the end of the year.

639
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,239

640
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,640
to make it more flavorful.

Hmm... Chief!

642
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,509
You showered and smell so nice today!

643
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:45,339
Are you going to a party somewhere?

He even used this doctor to get soap from the city.

645
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,989
I don't think he's going to a party...

646
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:52,490
It's more like he's going on a date!

Ai Mor!

648
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:56,179
A date? What is "a date"?

649
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:01,179
A date is when two people go out and act lovey-dovey together.

N-n-no, Sir.

653
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,460
I apologize, Sir.

654

What are you laughing at, Chief?

670
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,660
Because you tripped.

671
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,079
Wait, Khun.

672
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,430
That way leads to Ghost Hill.

673
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,810
Oh, this one is Ghost Hill?

674
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,019

Hold on, Tian.

00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,970
What is it, Chief?

677
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,079
They're still fresh.

678
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,580
That means that someone just came by.

Smugglers?

680
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:05,849
It's possible. Or it could be the villagers who came to forage in the forest.

00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,943
Let's go.

Are you okay?

00:52:32,423 --> 00:52:34,480
I am okay, I'm okay.

Here. We can share.

685
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,449
Is it much further, Chief?

686
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,250
We're almost there already.

687
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,819
It's been "Almost, almost, almost" so many times already.

00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,620
Can I even believe you?

689
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,909
When you're in the woods, if you can't believe the guide, then who would you believe?

690
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:37,659
Are you sure you are okay?

691
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,959
Do you want to get on my back?

00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,370
Is your exhaustion gone?

695
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:23,980
Yeah.

696
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:38,130
When I was a kid, my dad took me up here before.

697
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:41,320
Dad told me that his work was

698
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:45,050
to protect all the trees that we could see.

699
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,223
Then one day,

700
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,660
dad was out patrolling,

701
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,823
and dad got shot.

702
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,640
To this day, we still haven't caught the guy who did it.

703
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,969
Back then, I was so angry at dad.

704
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:11,990
I was angry that my dad traded his life for these trees.

705
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:17,250
And I was mad that my dad left me and my mom.

706
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:23,380
But today, I was able to come back and stand here.

707
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:28,099
It's made me finally understand my dad's feelings and just how my dad felt.

708
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:37,860
This forest is like a home,

709
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,959
it's like a resource to earn a living,

710
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,350
it's the life of the people here.

711
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,710
If I have to die like my dad,

712
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,430
I won't regret it.

713
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:56,130
But don't you forget to think of the people behind you.

714
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,479
I know.

715
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,020
Everybody loves their lives,

716
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:06,089
but if we don't do it, then who will?

717
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:21,963
Chief,

718
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,310
I'm sorry about your father.

719
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:37,619
Both of my parents have passed away.

720
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,670
There's no one I need to worry about.

721
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:44,279
What about you though? You came up here.

722
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,530
The people down there aren't going to be upset?

723
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:53,879
If you mean a lover, I don't have one.

724
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:00,169
If you don't believe me, that's your business.

725
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:05,519
I don't believe it either. That someone like you wouldn't have someone who'd worry about you.

726
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:09,480
The majority of guys like you guys have a wife in just about every city, no?

727
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,050
There's still the minority around too.

728
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:19,379
If you got to know me more, you'd know that I'm not like those people.

729
00:57:19,379 --> 00:57:21,103
Trust me.

730
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,010
Do you want to get to know me?

731
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:40,180
So...what about them saying you being close with the previous volunteer teacher?

732
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,723
Why?

733
00:57:42,723 --> 00:57:44,750
Did you want to pursue me?

734
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:50,490
No, I just wanted to know is all.

735
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,920
If you don't want to answer, then you don't need to.

736
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:02,063
For me...

737
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:06,190
Torfun is like the little sister that I love the most...

738
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:07,923
Forever.

739
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,849
I've already talked a lot about myself.

740
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:19,830
It's my turn to ask you too.

741
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,080
What do you want to ask?

742
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,100
The scars on your chest.

743
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,450
I thought you'd never ask.

744
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:48,340
These scars, are scars from heart surgery.

745
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:53,970
Back then, I thought that I wouldn't have made it.

746
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,560
But it was still fortunate that I was able to make it.

747
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,760
It was as though I was born again,

748
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,800
I got a chance to redeem myself.

749
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,250
Let's go back home.

750
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,399
Once it's dark, it'll be difficult to walk.

751
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,033
Wait, Khun.

752
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,770
I want to ask one more question.

753
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,010
What's your relation to Torfun?

754
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,440
[Directed by Noppharnach Chaiwimol]

755
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,590
- What?
- Shush.

756
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,910
Those are hornbills. Have you ever seen them?

757
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:19,839
I have,

758
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,740
but I saw them on the Discovery Channel or something like that.

759
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:28,230
Only undisturbed natural forests would have something like this.

760
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:33,420
Are you trying to say that you're taking good care of it?

761
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:40,109
Hornbills are monogamous.

762
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:42,469
When a hornbill finds its partner,

763
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,970
they will be together for the rest of their lives.

764
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,070
And what if its partner dies?

765
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:54,390
If its partner dies,

766
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:58,930
the one that's left will wait for it's partner in the same place

767
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,770
until it dies.

768
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:08,000
It's actually pretty romantic.

769
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,823
Hm?

770
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,900
I meant the hornbills.

Where did Tian go?

773
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:42,369
His friend came to see him in the city center.

774
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:43,439
Hey, Ai Tul!

775
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,689
Ai Tian!

776
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:48,649
So then the person who's making your heart flutter and not want to go home...

777
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,420
It's a guy?

778
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:53,739
Who's that at the table over there, Phi?

779
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:56,489
Oh... That's Por Liang Sakda.
