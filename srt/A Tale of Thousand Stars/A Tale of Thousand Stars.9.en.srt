[Previously]
Khru Torfun has already departed from us.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,273
Just leave.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,540
I don't want to see your face again.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,819
But Tian got sent to the hospital around midnight though!

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,799
So that means that there's no way that Nong Tian was driving the car that hit Nong Torfun!

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,439
They know the villagers are too afraid to come here,

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,090
so they're using this place to store their illegal goods.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,200
Hey!

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,413
Chief!

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,710
Chief! Chief!

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,140
Chief, it's my turn to ask you now.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,000
So does that mean you also believe in the Pha Pun Dao tale, Chief?

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,979
Of course I believe it.

14
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:56,600
Did you know, that my mom had also come here to wish for a son.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,210
So Chief, that's why you're named Phupha (Mountain).

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,739
Is it lame?

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,340
No. It's actually pretty cool.

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,219
Beautiful, isn't it?

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,720
It's such a shame that taking a picture wouldn't even be as pretty as what we see with our eyes.

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,759
That's why all of us dedicate our lives to protect the forests as long

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,040
and as best as we can.

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,180
I really applaud your dedication.

23
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,200
We have only forests and wildlife on our minds.

24
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,540
Don't you want to have someone, too?

25
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,240
Torfun, I know how you feel about me.

26
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,319
- But I—
- Hold up.

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,139
Can't you just give it some thought?

28
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,439
If my heart is to be broken,

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,940
at least spend time on it.

30
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,473
Please.

31
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,759
When I come back from Bangkok next time,

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,710
I'll ask for your answer again.

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,819
Our work involves clashing with timber smugglers.

34
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,479
Death is just a tip of the finger that pulls the trigger.

35
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,859
But I'm never scared of dying, you know?

36
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:53,260
When I think about dying, I don't feel anything.

37
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,579
What's more scary is the time like when

38
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,499
I had to see my mother waiting for my father every day

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,320
without knowing if there was a tomorrow for him.

40
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,500
For those who are left behind, I know how suffering it is to live

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,660
as the memory of someone has never disappeared.

42
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,760
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,960
I felt sorry for my mother.

44
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,540
I don't want anyone to live in agony like her.

45
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,320
Perhaps, you haven't found someone you truly love yet.

46
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,800
On the last day of the year,

47
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,130
can you bring me back here again?

48
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,160
- Doc!
- Doc! Doc!

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,339
This way! Take him to the bed!

50
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,579
- Please help him!
- Take him to the bed!

51
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,400
Take him to the bed!

52
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:22,099
Chief! Chief!

53
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,959
Help me put his feet up. Help me put his feet up!

54
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,059
- Chief.
- A pillow! Give me a pillow!

55
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:30,019
Dr. Nam, I have called the hospital. They will come get him right away.

56
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,879
Okay. Let's take the bullet out first.

57
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,779
We need to stabilize his condition for the transfer.

58
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,119
Help me prep a surgery kit.

59
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,839
Also call the hospital asking for AB type.

60
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,319
- He lost so much blood.
- Got it.

61
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,919
Make way for me.

62
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,759
Doc, he's bleeding.

63
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,139
Doc.

64
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,279
My blood type is AB. You can use mine.

65
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,299
Tian, you've just had an operation. It's too risky.

66
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,699
Also, the medications you take make your blood ineligible.

67
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,179
If we give it to Phu, he will die. Calm down.

68
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:01,739
Ai Phu! Yod, keep pressing.

69
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,999
Ai Phu, don't sleep. Don't sleep!

70
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,199
Don't fall asleep, Chief!

71
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,799
Don't fall asleep, Phu!

72
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,700
Is the kit ready, Nurse?

73
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,959
- Ai Phu!
- Ai Phu, stay with me.

74
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,399
- The bleeding doesn't stop!
- Keep pressing it!

75
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,900
Nurse!

76
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,560
Chief!

77
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,219
Ai Phu, stay awake.

78
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,020
Don't fall asleep!

79
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,880
Blade, please.

80
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,120
Give me a gauze pad and forceps.

81
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,390
His blood pressure is dropping.

82
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,920
Hang in there, Chief.

83
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,399
It's only temporary.

84
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,450
You need to have an X-ray at the hospital again to be sure.

85
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Thank you, Doc.

86
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,859
His condition is stable now.

87
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:52,060
The ambulance should be here soon.

88
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,580
Doc.

89
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Can I stay with him a little longer?

90
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,940
Thank you, Chief.

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,030
How is Chief doing?

99
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,759
Wow. If he heard you,

100
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,499
he would be happy to know you are so worried about him.

101
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,600
What about you? How are you feeling?

102
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,130
I'm not going to die twice.

103
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,160
If you can joke about that, I'm sure you are okay now.

104
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,180
By the way, Tian.

105
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,699
I want to ask you something.

106
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,620
Why didn't you tell me about Torfun at that time?

107
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,900
I didn't know.

108
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,280
I didn't know how other people would think about it.

109
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,780
I didn't know if they could accept it.

110
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,550
The longer I live in the village,

111
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,740
the more I feel guilty.

112
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,300
So I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone.

113
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,700
But there are no secrets in this world, right?

114
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,433

115
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,540
I'm sorry.

116
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,100
What are you sorry for?

117
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,660
It was me who told Ai Phu about you and Torfun.

118
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,980
But I didn't think he would be so impulsive and ask you like that.

119
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,040
Don't worry about it, Phi.

120
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,499
Sooner or later, I had to reveal it.

121
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,140
I intended to do so.

122
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,500
Don't be mad at him.

123
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,299
If you want to be mad at someone, it should be me.

124
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,820
I'm not mad at you, Phi.

125
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,379
So...

126
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,760
how is Chief doing?

127
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,240
He is still under a doctor's close care.

But visiting is not permitted at the moment.

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
Doc.

131
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,180
Do you want me not to be mad at you?

132
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,580
Can you do me a favor?

133
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,680
So you are not mad at me now, right?

134
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,420
I'm sorry, Chief.

135
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:29,440
You were injured because of me.

136
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,740
I'm sorry...

137
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,540
for lying about Torfun.

138
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,260
I was in the wrong

139
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,690
for not telling everyone the truth.

140
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,580
I only thought of...

141
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,360
what I could do

142
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,320
to redeem this guilt I have.

143
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,040
So I chose to live Torfun's life

144
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,660
and did everything she wanted to do.

145
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,660
In the end,

146
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,050
I realized that it was not right.

147
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,080
Deep down, I'm probably just afraid.

148
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm afraid of losing everything I have right now.

149
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,840
I feel like I have taken away the life...

150
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,070
that was supposed to be hers.

151
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,140
The more I say, the more it makes me feel guilty, huh?

152
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,800
Thank you, Chief.

153
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,180
Thank you for taking such good care of me.

154
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,540
Wake up already.

155
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,500
I know you are incredibly strong.

156

00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,130
I'm never afraid of anything, you know?

158
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,440
Just wake up already.

159
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,530
Wake up to take care of me again.

Thank goodness, it's not a serious injury.

163
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,939
I was so worried about you.

164
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,740
Sit down.

165
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,380
How did you get here?

166
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,960
I came right after I heard about the incident.

167
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,640
What about Mom?

168
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,179
Your mother doesn't have a clue.

169
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,859
If she knew, she would be frantic.

170
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,800
But I don't know how long I can keep this from her.

171
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,580
What do you mean?

172
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,400
So you have known all along where I am and what I am doing.

173
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,260
That's why.

174
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,680
But how come you still let me stay there and do something like this?

175
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,313
Tian.

176
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,690
Ever since you were little,

177
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,610
have I ever really forced you to do anything?

178
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,479
That's because you have to do what your mom wants you to.

179
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,730
And that alone should make you tired already.

180
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,960
I just never thought that

181
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,619
you could endure the hardship this long.

182
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,439
I thought that when you got bored and it wasn't fun anymore,

183
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,360
you would go home.

184
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,620
"Fun"?

185
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,479
What do you mean by "fun"?

186
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,539
I ran away from home. I almost died.

187
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,980
It wasn't even close to fun.

188
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,619
If it wasn't for fun, why did you run away from home?

189
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,253
Huh?

190
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,640
All right. Tell me what you want.

191
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,680
I just want to do what I have never done before.

192
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,990
If I hadn't seen you having fun from what you were doing,

193
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,579
you would have been sent home a long time ago.

194
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,340
You should know that.

195
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,080
Yes, I should have known.

196
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,220
I never have freedom in this life.

197
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,800
You know what, Dad?

198
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,840
Since I was born,

199
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,140
I never felt proud of myself.

200
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,459
My life has always been comfortable.

201
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,920
Be it school or college, you put me in there easily.

202
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,200
When I was on the hill,

203
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,899
I got to teach kids how to wash clothes or brush their teeth.

204
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,580
I got to cook for myself.

205
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,379
And you know?

206
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:28,079
It made me realize that I'm actually capable of doing many things.

207
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,480
And I feel very proud of myself.

208
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,019
Really?

209
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,739
So you ran away from home just to do the things you had never done

210
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,680
and feel proud.

211
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,573
It's just that?

212
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,640
Can I ask you something?

213
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,300
The fact that I got to have a heart transplant

214
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,039
was because of our last name.

215
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,200
It was because of your money, right?

216
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,399
What's the point of bringing that up now?

217
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,780
How does it have to do with you running away from home?

218
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,099
I'm just curious.

219
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,599
I just want to be sure that even this new life of mine

220
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,079
was made possible because of your money.

221
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:36,779
Listen, Tian. Don't burden yourself with it.

222
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,039
The duty of a father and a mother

223
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,719
is to find the best thing for their children.

224
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,699
Whatever I can do, I will do it for you.

225
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,299
And the fact that we have money to spend,

226
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,059
it helps make things go smoothly. You also know that.

227
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,259
I'm not trying to argue with that.

228
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,239
I know that having a rich and comfortable life is desirable for many people.

229
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,080
Then what more do you want?

230
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,999
I just want to be sure

231
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:13,640
that I made the right decision to go up there in the village.

232
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,460
At least,

233
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,380
I could do something...

234
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,280
for Torfun.

235
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,200
You knew.

236
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,413
Yes.

237
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,813
I knew

238
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,459
about this heart and the accident.

239
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,120
It's good that you knew.

240
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,099
All right, then.

241
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,300
Let's go home together.

242
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,053
Dad.

243
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,600
I know that I have to go home sooner or later.

244
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,660
But there's still another thing I want to make happen.

245
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,200
At least,

246
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,060
if I get to do it,

247
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,520
it might more or less

248
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,820
ease the guilt I feel.

249
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,310
Can you let me do it?

250
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,750
Where's the patient in this room?

251
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,440
Did you know how dangerous it was?

252
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:22,660
I knew that you would come to save me eventually.

253
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,493
Tian.

254
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,200
What if I hadn't been there in time, what could have happened to you?

255
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,320
I'm sorry, Chief.

256
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,500
I'm truly sorry.

257
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,779
I promise I will not make you go through something like this again.

258
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,950
Listen to me carefully.

259
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,320
About Torfun,

260
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,700
I know all of it.

261
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,080
Stop blaming yourself.

262
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,040
Whatever I did,

263
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,520
I could not erase the guilty feeling I have in my heart.

264
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,260
Torfun would never forgive me.

265
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,460
How do you know?

266
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,600
The moment I thought that I might die,

267
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,520
do you know what I was thinking?

268
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,560
I wasn't mad about what you did at all.

269
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,879
I only thought about the people I know,

270
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,680
the villagers,

271
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,539
Dr. Nam, Yod,

272
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,440
and Rang.

273
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,300
And other people I care about.

274
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:13,220
The Torfun that I know would think the same as I do.

275
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,360
All these times,

276
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,399
you have proven to everyone

277
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,600
how much you have done for them

278
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,100
and for Torfun.

279
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,760
Maybe Torfun was the one who chose...

280
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,270
to give this heart

281
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,020
to you.

282
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,060
That's why she brought you here.

283
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,140
I'm sorry, Chief.

284
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,420
I'm sorry.

285
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,553
It's okay.

286
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,640
I also believe that Torfun herself

287
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,860
would forgive you

288
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,700
like I did.

289
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,600
I'm not good at consoling.

290
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,100
You can smile now.

291
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,133
Smile.

292
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,280
Does it hurt?

293
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,280
You look awful.

294
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,280
It doesn't hurt.

295
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,980
What about you? Does it hurt?

296
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,600
I'm not going to die easily.

297
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,620
Why? Are you worried about me?

298
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Yes, obviously.

299
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,270
What if something really happened to you,

300
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,120
how would I live?

301
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,190
Just knowing that someone is caring about me

302
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,520
I feel better.

303
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,340
Let's go back inside.

304
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,099
- Tian.
- Hm?

305
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,560
I told you...

306
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,399
the moment I thought I might die...

307
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,079
Yes?

308
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:19,180
Do you know what else I was thinking of?

309
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
What were you thinking of?

310
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,900
I was thinking of you too.

311
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,440
That was from me.

312
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,980
Mr. Tirayut.

313
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,699
On the right is the route to Naga Cape.

314
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,219
Another beautiful spot.

315
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,959
Do you want to check it out?

316
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,520
No.

317
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,739
I'm going to stop at the market.

318
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,339
Do you want to get anything there?

319
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,240
No. Thank you.

320
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,380
What's wrong? You can tell me.

321
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,900
I don't have anything to tell you.

322
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,600
What about you? Do you have anything to tell me?

323
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,980
Thank you so much for taking care of my son so diligently.

324
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,239
From now on, if you ever need my help, don't hesitate to tell me.

325
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,140
I'll be happy to help you.

326
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,730
Thank you very much, Sir.

327
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,100
- P'Seetian!
- Hi, P'Seetian!

328
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,979
Be careful, you guys!

329
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,520
Tian!

330
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,559
Tian.

331
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,979
- P'Seetian.
- Hello, P'Seetian!

332
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,940
Careful. This still hurts.

333
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,340
Give me a hug, everyone.

334
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,559
- Does it hurt?
- It does.

335
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,799
But I'm okay now. You don't need to be worried.

336
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,300
What is this?

337
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,939
This is called...

338
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,359
a robot transformer!

339
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,699
Look.

340
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,639
P'Seetian.

341
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:37,359
My father told me there was a shooting with real guns, but you were not harmed.

342
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,919
It's because you had Chief who is like a big giant protecting you, right?

343
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,860
Of course.

344
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,219
Yes.

345
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:53,160
Grandma told me you helped fight the bad guys to keep our village safe.

346
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,619
That's right. Everyone, say thank you to the chief.

347
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:02,099
Thank you!

348
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:08,059
Because Chief does his duty so well and takes care of everyone diligently.

349
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,813
Tian.

350
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,273
Tian.

351
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,290
Why are you walking away from me?

352
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,979
I'm home now.

353
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,000
It's safe here.

354
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I know.

355
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,319
You can be off duty.

356
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,859
You may leave.

357
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,499
What's wrong?

358
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,420
We need to talk.

359
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,550
How did you know my father?

360
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,060
He was my former commander in the ministry that my department is under.

361
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,319
So you knew all along.

362
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,620
You have always known who I am.

363
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,519
Now it all makes sense.

364
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,880
No matter who you are,

365
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,980
it's my duty to take care of you.

366
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,193
"Duty," you say?

367
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,919
So what you have done for me was out of duty, huh?

368
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,779
Someone like me doesn't have that much free time to teach you how to boil water or wash clothes.

369
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,000
Thank you very much, Chief Phupha.

370
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,839
You have done your duty so damn faultlessly.

371
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,340
My father will surely hear about it.

372
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,039
Then prepare to go home.

373
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,200
Your fun time is over.

374
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,973
"Fun"?

375
00:37:55,973 --> 00:38:00,439
Why does everyone think that I came to teach here just for the sake of having fun?

376
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,499
Are you saying that a rich boy like you

377
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,279
takes everything here seriously?

378
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:08,930
Didn't you see what I've done at all?

379
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:24,040
If everyone thinks that I'm here just for the sake of having fun,

380
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,819
I won't go home yet!

381
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,353
Tian.

382
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,740
Do your duty and keep on taking care of me,

383
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,090
because I'm still having fun.

384
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,720
[Birth, Old Age, Sickness, and Death are unavoidable.]

385
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,419
Eat up, Mr. Tian.

386
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,800
The food at the hospital is not as good as our home-cooked food, is it?

387
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,800
Khama.

388
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,280
Please accept my apology once again

389
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,919
for risking Longtae's life like that.

390
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:22,499
It's all right, Mr. Tian.

391
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,180
Everyone coming back safely is good enough.

392
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,639
And my son is a tough boy.

393
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,300
I'm sure he could pull through.

394
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,259
But look at you.

395
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,540
For a small guy like you,

396
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,999
you are pretty gutsy.

397
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,519
Honestly, Phi.

398
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,420
Weren't you afraid at all?

399
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,119
A gun was pointed at my head like that, I was scared as hell.

400
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,420
Right, you should not have asked that.

401
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,320
Eat. Eat up.

402
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,099
By the way, Mr. Tian.

403
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,239
It makes sense now

404
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,839
that you asked me about Pha Pun Dao cliff.

405
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:15,579
Because only the people who have been there know about that place.

406
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:20,799
Also, about the villagers, don't worry about them.

407
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,960
I'll help explain it to them for you.

408
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,180
Thank you so much, Khama.

409
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,293
I'll help, too.

410
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,970
Help yourself first, Longtae.

411
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:38,099
Birth, old age, sickness, and death are unavoidable indeed.

412
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,120
Even for those you see every day.

413
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,600
But this seems like destiny.

414
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,020
What do you mean, Dad?

415
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:52,359
Even though Miss Torfun has passed away,

416
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:58,320
her heart is still back here and close to us,

417
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,813
right?

418
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,139
Phi, you have done the best you could.

419
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:13,773
Yes.

420
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:27,400
But we cannot do good things to pay for the bad things we have done.

421
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,033
Listen.

422
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,133
Mr. Tian.

423
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,260
You told me

424
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:46,379
you came here to redeem yourself

425
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,380
and that you wanted everyone here to forgive you, right?

426
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:02,940
Do you know what it is that is much harder than apologizing?

427
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,119
It is forgiveness,

428
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:15,120
especially to learn to forgive yourself.

429
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,033
Because...

430
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:22,739
no one can tell you what to do

431
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,600
except yourself.

432
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,399
Now I know why you look after him this good.

433
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,399
It's because of his father.

434
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,280
You should have told me, too.

435
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,040
It's an order given to me.

436
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,719
Are you telling me that you taking care of him so specially

437
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:04,039
is all because of a high-ranking official's order?

438
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,579
Bullshit.

439
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:07,680
I don't buy it.

440
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:14,700
And you spoke to him harshly like that.

441
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,070
He might tell his father about you.

442
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,860
You could have just explained to him nicely.

443
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,059
If I asked him nicely,

444
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,760
someone like Tian wouldn't want to leave easily.

445
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,219
So?

446
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,659
You decided to use hurtful words

447
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,620
and became hurtful like this yourself?

448
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,859
Though it hurts, it will end soon.

449
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,753
Phu.

450
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:54,560
You have come this far with him

451
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,199
You have never been like this with anyone else.

452
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,260
I'm sure Nong Tian is caring about you, too.

453
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:14,080
Do whatever you want to do.

454
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,679
so you won't regret it later.

455
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,413
Got it?

456
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,979
For something that can never be possible,

457
00:44:28,979 --> 00:44:31,520
I'd better end it.

458
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,799
What a classic problem.

459
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,740
Social class differences.

460
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,399
Okay. It's up to you.

461
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,133
Come on.

462
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,219
Everyone, tomorrow, don't forget to bring some banana stems and leaves.

463
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:10,840
We'll learn stamping art tomorrow.

464
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,739
It's time. You may go home.

465
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,739
No. I would like to listen to a story.

466
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,179
I want to listen to the "Kind Green Giant" story.

467
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:26,280
Last time, it ended at the part where Green Giant put out the fire at the village.

468
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,553
Okay.

469
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,179
But in today's story,

470
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:39,919
the kind Green Giant that guarded the village

471
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,779
and was loved by the villagers became a mean giant.

472
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,820
How come?

473
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,219
Actually, in the beginning,

474
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:57,080
the Green Giant took care of everyone in the village out of love and sincerity.

475
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,900
But one day, an eagle came to him.

476
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,700
It asked the Green Giant,

477
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,760
"Can I trade my wings with your heart?"

478
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,940
And the Green Giant gave his heart to the eagle?

479
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,233
Yes.

480
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:25,560
The Green Giant didn't mind giving his heart in exchange for the eagle's wings

481
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,539
so that he could fly.

482
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,240
Why did he want to fly?

483
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,240
That was because...

484
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,630
he didn't sincerely love the villagers.

485
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,779
He only wished to stay in a beautiful castle,

486
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:48,059
even though he had to give up his heart to the eagle.

487
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,980
He only wanted the wings of the eagle

488
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,660
to fly away and live his life happily

489
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:03,020
and let the villagers get attacked by the eagle.

490
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,879
The giant became a bad guy. I don't like him anymore.

491
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,359
Yes. I don't like him now.

492
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,459
Time to go home, kids.

493
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,519
Don't forget to bring a gift to exchange at the New Year's party.

494
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,019
Phaphirun Unit will host a New Year's Eve party

495
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,770
which will be a farewell party for Mr. Seetian.

496
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,119
In the new year, he will leave here.

497
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,559
Are you really leaving?

498
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,639
Do you really have to go?

499
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:36,799
Is it true?

500
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,759
Can you stay?

501
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,310
Wait here, kids. I'll be back to you.

502
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,873
Chief.

503
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,199
What do you mean by "in the new year"?

504
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,639
How hard is it to understand that?

505
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,779
There will be another teacher to replace you.

506
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,499
Do you have to go this far?

507
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,320
What did I do?

508
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,400
How much money did my father offer to you to take care of me?

509
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,859
Or...

510
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,340
did he offer you any promotion

511
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,819
so you go all out like this?

512
00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:18,539
Tian.

513
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,839
You should not think less of your father.

514
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,899
What do you know?

515
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,259
This is what my family likes to do.

516
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,379
They use money to get everything.

517
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:30,139
Even my new life, they used money to jump the queue for me.

518
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:33,799
Tian! Get yourself together.

519
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,990
Just be honest and tell me.

520
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,320
Do you take care of me

521
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,400
because it's just a duty to do and nothing else?

522
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,700
You don't feel anything at all, right?

523
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,610
My father must have offered you a lot of money.

524
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:26,100
You do your duty so well.

525
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,320
Would you stop insulting me?

526
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,140
Or is this a chance to get ahead? It is, isn't it?

527
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,073
Yes.

528
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,520
What's wrong if a poor state officer like me wants to get ahead in his career?

529
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,260
It's good that you know.

530
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,639
P'Tian.

531
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,173
Phi.

532
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,420
Are you really going home this new year?

533
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,160
Who told you?

534
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,259
Chief Phupha told my father.

535
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:36,899
Everyone here probably knows, too.

536
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,900
They are preparing the farewell party for you.

537
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,520
If the chief said that, then it should be that.

538
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,899
What a pity.

539
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,339
I think of taking you to the other side of the border after my exam.

540
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:01,039
The wild Himalayan cherry trees there are not in full bloom yet.

541
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,500
When they are, I'm sure you will like them a lot.

542
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,779
Anyway, do the kids know?

01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:58,070
♫ It's that I love you, love you. It has never changed ♫

906
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:04,620
♫ If perhaps the stars hear the words of the prayers within my heart ♫

907
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:16,050
♫ No matter how many thousands of times, I'll still ask for my heart to be near you ♫
