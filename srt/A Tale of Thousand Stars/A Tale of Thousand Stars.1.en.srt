In the past,

2
00:00:07,763 --> 00:00:12,718
I used to think that people's lives were like a fun video game.

3
00:00:17,946 --> 00:00:20,441
Before we could pass each stage,

4
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:23,690
there's a chance that we could die over and over,

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,794
and then we'd be granted a new life to start again

6
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:32,258
So I had never thought about death before.

7
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:36,958
Even though the fact is, life is not like in a game

8
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,434
because people can only die once.

9
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:45,374
So why is it that people are never willing to think about death?

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,902
Have you ever imagined how you would die?

11
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:55,990
Or have you ever thought for fun, what it would be like...

12

00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,189
A selfie like that is difficult.

181
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:55,006
Oh, alright.

182
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:56,537
Do I look good yet?

183
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:58,469
You do.

184
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,154
Let me do a composition really quick.

185
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,397
Oh, Nong Fun! The camera. The camera's this way. Look right into the camera.

186
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:08,229
P' Mor, just do like...a candid.

187
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:09,289
Like a candid.

188
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,119
- A candid?
- Yeah.

189
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,866
Sure. A candid, right? Just a moment, alright?

190
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:24,981
Smiling this much...

191
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:26,805
Maybe it's not candid then.

192
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,709
Ai' Phu!

193
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,440
- P' Mor!
- There's someone that wants to take a picture with you, man.

194
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,750
Torfun wants a picture with you.

195
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,240
Uh... get closer. Get a bit closer, a bit closer.

196
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:43,449
The camera frame is small.

197
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,000
Are we close yet?

198
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,249
Is this okay?

199
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,149
Woah. It has such a great composition.

200
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:53,577
Beautiful.

201
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:57,338
One, two, three!

202
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,713
Hey, Mor. Let me see.

203
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,514
It hasn't developed yet.

204
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,169
Let me see it first.

205
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,618
Give it here!

206
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,009
I hope your girlfriend doesn't love you.

207
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,118
What the hell...

208
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,043
Chief!

209
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:06,354
If I had just come down and given her a ride myself...this probably wouldn't have happened.

210
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,538
Chief, don't blame yourself.

211
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,200
She's resting in peace now, man.

212
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,514
Yeah, I know.

213
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:23,881
I'm just pissed at the person who did it.

214
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:27,034
This kind of thing...nobody intended for it to happen, man.

215
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:30,500
The other party also said that it was an accident.

216
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,162
Having money can settle everything. Easy isn't it?

217
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:44,281
I'll never forgive the person who did it.

218
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:46,362
Come on, Phu...

219
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,282
[Five months later]

220
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:08,026
- Here, Son. Of course.
- Thank you, Mom.

221
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,249
Mom. Actually, you don't need to always keep an eye on me.

222
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,217
I'm not a bedridden patient.

223
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:17,833
Well, I'm just afraid that you won't do as the doctor tells you to.

224
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:21,285
Today, you were able to walk longer and you didn't pant as much as yesterday either.

225
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:23,161
On a scale of 1 to 10, how exhausted are you?

226
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:25,289
- Around five.
- Five?

227
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:27,976
Is "five" risky? Or should we reduce the amount he walks?

228
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,410
Mom.

229
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:32,329
Or maybe...should we take a break from it for one day?

230
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,553
Mom. That's enough...

231
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:38,024
Actually, I recommend that you keep doing this regularly every day.

232
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:39,494
The walking distance may be reduced.

233
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:43,081
Apart from that, it's just a matter of taking the medications on time.

234
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:44,569
Please don't skip any medications, alright?

235
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,329
Listen to her. Alright, Son?

236
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:51,257
It's so fortunate that Khun Tian was able to receive a matching heart in time.

237
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:53,845
Something like this is really called a miracle.

238
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:55,626
- Yes.
- "A miracle"?

239
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:01,121
Wait, wait, Tian. Where are you going, Son?

240
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:02,966
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

241
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,443
Alright.

242
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,565
Ai' Tian! I'm really happy to be able to hear your voice, man.

243
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:30,445
Being home is so damn boring.

244
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:33,161
Well, damn. It's because you haven't updated shit.

245
00:21:33,162 --> 00:21:36,389
If I were to type "R.I.P." on your Facebook,

246
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,825
Dude, would you believe me that either way, everyone would believe that you actually died already.

247
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:43,705
Well, I don't know either. I don't feel like doing anything.

248
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:45,397
Do you want me to go see you then?

249
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:46,841
Hey, no need.

250
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:48,321
I was actually just thinking of going outside to see you.

251
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:51,209
Being home, my mom keeps following me around.

252
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,465
Have you completely recovered already to come see me?

253
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:56,317
Well, it's enough anyway. I'm able to go there and scold you anyway.

254
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:59,801
There it is. Then invite your mom to come out with you, dude.

255
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,753
Then why don't you invite your Pops out too then?

256
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,469
Hmm...then this must mean my friend is fully recovered for sure.

257
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,890
- Hey, see you later, dude.
- See you, man.

258
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,414
- Come on friends!
- Cheers!

259
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,386
Hey, guys. What's up?

260
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:19,489
Hey, Tian, my buddy!

261
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:21,299
Sit down first. Sit down first.

262
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,809
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- Geez.

263
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,888
Hey! Who the heck dressed you?

264
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,281
You didn't tell me that we'd be coming out to this place, you ass.

265
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:31,241
- Hey! Wait, I think that you...
- What? What's with you?

266
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:33,641
I think... haven't you gotten too skinny, man?

267
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:37,042
Well, I've only had clean, healthy foods. Just look, man. I'm all slim now.

268
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,439
Sia Tian, I thought that you wouldn't be coming anymore.

269
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,682
What took so damn long?

270
00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:43,354
Well, it took so long for a ride to come get me.

271
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:47,079
Dude, did you know that my mom and dad just suddenly sold and got rid of my car?

272
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,289
I don't get why the hell they're so worried about about me.

273
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,265
But I think that...selling it was the right thing, man.

274
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:55,049
- Right?
- Yeah, that's right.

275
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:56,617
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

276
00:22:56,618 --> 00:22:59,769
I think that you and water...really don't freaking match.

277
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,025
It's the wrong vibe. Come here.

278
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:03,317
That's enough, dude. That's enough.

279
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:05,718
I've been told not to do this or that for like a hundred things you know!

280
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:09,113
My mom even went as far as hiring a personal nurse to take care of me.

281
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:11,239
It's like I'm a kindergartner.

282
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:15,130
Dude... so has your life changed?

283
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,754
Yeah, Tian. So how's your wound?

284
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,183
You want to know?

285
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,890
Want to try touching it then?

286
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,193
Does it hurt?

287
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:33,399
-It doesn't hurt.
- Hey.

288
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,450
And like...how does it feel to have someone else's heart inside your own body?

289
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,401
I don't really feel anything though.

290
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:46,905
Hey, and like...has there ever been like a split moment, like...

291
00:23:46,906 --> 00:23:48,906
There was someone residing in you?

292
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:52,634
What nonsense from both of you.

293
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:56,665
Tian, you really don't want to know who the owner of the heart was?

294
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,178
That's right.

295
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,506
And how did they even die?

296
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:06,297
-Don't let it go. You really need to know.
- If it were me, I'd really want to know who gave me their heart.

297
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:09,465
Look, you've changed. You drank water.

298
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:11,189
Normally, you'd drink this.

299
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,923
Prove it.

300
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,889
But I really want to know, man... Just who was the owner of your heart.

301
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,229
That's right!

302
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,601
Dude, do you really not want to know?

303
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:21,882
You need to know though.

304
00:24:21,883 --> 00:24:23,509
But I also really want to know too, man.

305
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,065
How could you not know though?

306
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,580
This is your matter that you need to know, man.

307
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,880
-You can't miss out regarding this matter.
- Either way, you need to know.

308
00:24:27,881 --> 00:24:29,116
You can't.

309
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:30,909
Don't forget to find out who is the owner of this heart.

310
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:33,310
If it were me, I'd want to know, man.

311
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,761
What's wrong?

312
00:24:38,762 --> 00:24:41,369
Tian! Are you okay, man?

313
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,378
Hey, you okay?

314
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:44,437
Is something wrong?

315
00:24:44,437 --> 00:24:46,662
Hey, guys. Sorry, I think I should head back first.

316
00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:48,618
- Huh?
-Are you ok though, man?
- Hey!

317
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,390
Tian!

318
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,609
Tian, you're back now?

319
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,178
Why did you just get back this late, Son?

320
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:01,429
Why didn't you answer when I called?

321
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:03,081
I went to eat with Tul and the gang.

322
00:25:03,082 --> 00:25:06,329
Next time, tell me first, Son. And answer my calls too, alright?

323
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,742
If I told you beforehand, would I even get to go?

324
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,553
So what did you go and eat, Son?

325
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,933
Didn't the doctor say to be careful about what you eat?

326
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:17,189
Mom! I know already!

327
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,033
I've been eating like this for months already, Mom!

328
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:21,609
Why would I not know what I can or can't have to eat?

329
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,143
Tian, you punk.

330
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,019
You only reek of cigarettes.

331
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,897
You drank alcohol again then.

332
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:32,745
Mom. If you're asking like this, it's not to get an answer.

333
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:34,792
You already believe that I'd gone to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol.

334
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:36,120
So why would you bother asking me then, Mom/

335
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:37,889
Tian, you punk.

336
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,073
Is it alright to speak to your mom like this?

337
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:42,022
Well look at mom then.

338
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,869
I feel smothered, Mom.

339
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,113
Well, I'm just worried though, Tian.

340
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:50,010
I don't want you to go back and do that again, Tian.

341
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,560
Don't create any more trouble.

342
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,579
Act in a way that's more befitting of having received another chance.

343
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,738
Because not everyone is as blessed as you are.

344
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,766
Who was it, Dad?

345
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,130
Who was the one that donated this heart to me?

346
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:20,849
I don't know.

347
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,537
It's the hospital's protocol.

348
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:24,569
They won't tell.

349
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,945
Just tell me already, Dad.

Why did someone like you choose to teach in Pha Pun Dao, Khru?

595

It's such an impoverished area.

So Khru, are you here to search for a meaning or search for some sort of answer?

598
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:18,505
Because... the previous teachers from before also mentioned that to me.

00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,759
And the others that came here, they came searching for meaning...

605

♫ If perhaps the stars hear the words of the prayers within my heart ♫

691
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:08,010
♫ No matter how many thousands of times, I'll still ask for my heart to be near you ♫
