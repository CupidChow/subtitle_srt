My team has already patrolled from here to here.

179
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,330
We also found some tools that had been left behind.

180
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,589
They should have known that the route to Pha Pun Dao cliff

181
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,290
is a route that we patrol frequently.

182
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,090
So why the hell did they still think of using this route?

183
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,569
Chief, Sir.

184
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,509
The other day, Ai Choak's team saw traces of truck wheels,

185
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,389
but none of the trees were cut down.

186
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,470
I think that it's pretty strange, sir.

187
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,989
This could be their plan to distract our attention.

188
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,509
Anyway, during this time, I'd like everyone to monitor especially closely.

189
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,789
Especially the route to Pha Pun Dao cliff.

190
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,149
If you find anything suspicious, report it to me immediately.

191
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,789
- Does everyone understand?
- Understood!

192
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:50,349
- Go.
- Go! Go! Go!

193
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,843
Ai Chang! Here!

194
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,589
- Ai Noi, take this! Aai!

195
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,310
Let's go! Hurry!

196
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,070
Ai Phu, where is Nong Tian?

197
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,049
I had him go back to the teacher's house already.

198
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:11,250
Why the hell are you being so hasty?

199
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,469
If you came to talk about this, then I don't have time for it.

200
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:17,329
Ai Phu!

201
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,529
And what if I told you that Nong Tian wasn't the one who killed Nong Torfun?

202
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,569
Would you have time to talk to me then?

203
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,950
How could it not be?

204
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,869
Here.

205
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,029
In here are documents about Nong Tian's heart transplant surgery

206
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,089
and also documents regarding Nong Torfun's organ donation.

207
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:38,529
It's also recorded though that Nong Torfun got hit by a car at 1 a.m.

208
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,369
So what the hell about it?

209
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:45,369
Dude! But Tian got sent to the hospital around midnight though!

210
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:49,370
So that means that there's no way that Nong Tian was driving the car that hit Nong Torfun!

211
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,370
[Medical Certificate for Heart Transplant Patients]

212
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,170
[...required a heart transplant due to myocarditis]
[April 9, (00:15 a.m.)]

213
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:09,450
If you didn't hit her, Phi... then who hit her?

214
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,069
That bastard will soon learn that he shouldn't mess with my friend.

215
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,670
He doesn't know what your car can do, right?

216
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,203
Tian,

217
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:28,149
I don't think this is going to work anymore.

218
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:29,709
Just cancel it.

219
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:32,460
If I back out I'd be a chicken then,

220
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,063
right?

221
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,949
Ai Prem,

222
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,649
you can take care of him for me, right?

223
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,289
Sure I can. Easy.

224
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,670
Then go for it,

225
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,890
if you win against him, then take his damn car.

226
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,223
Deal.

227
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:20,830
Hey, Ai Tul. I'll be right back, alright?

228
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,209
You're okay, right?

229
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,030
Hey, I'm okay.

230
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,489
Hey, Ai Tian!

231
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,729
Ai Tian!

232
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,909
Hey, Dude!

233
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:11,869
Tian!

234
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,609
Hey! Tian!

235
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:18,009
At that time when I was taken to the hospital for heart transplant surgery...

236
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,910
That night, it was Nong TIan's friend who drove the car that hit Nong Torfun.

237
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,709
And he used money to silence this case.

238
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,910
Nong Torfun's aunt admitted it to me herself.

239
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,963
Hey, Ai Phu!

240
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,909
Then why didn't you tell everyone the truth, Phi? That you didn't do it?

241
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:54,889
For me... it's not important who was the one that hit her.

242
00:34:54,890 --> 00:35:00,970
Because in the end, I'm the one who gave the weapon that hurt Torfun either way.

243
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,830
You are right.

244
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,123
P'Tian,

245
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,930
can I punch you?

246
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,830
So we'll be even.

247
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,723
Go ahead.

248
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,310
Geez!

249
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,650
That was for not revealing the whole truth to me.

250
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,550
We are even now, alright?

251
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,190
Thanks.

252
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,829
But I'm not sure if other people will understand you like I do.

253
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,130
Just this... makes me happy as it is.

254
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,430
So what are you going to do next, Phi?

255
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,309
I think that...

256
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,160
there probably won't be anyone who'd want to send their kids to study with me anymore.

257
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,450
Does that... Does that mean you're going back then?

258
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:53,550
Not at all. I can't go back yet.

259
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,170
There's still one more matter that I still have to do for Torfun.

260
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,010
I'm going to go up to make a wish at Pha Pun Dao cliff.

261
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:13,330
And did you already know, Phi, what P'Torun wanted to wish for?

262
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,903
I don't know.

263
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,910
And there will probably never be a day where I'd know either.

264
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,220
The Chief already took the journal away.

265
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,369
But I think that no matter what Torfun would've wished for,

266
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:32,430
I'd still go up and make a wish for her...for her wish to come true.

267
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:42,090
But, Phi, if you need me to help with anything, tell me. Alright?

268
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,400
You don't need to tell me. I was about to ask anyway.

269
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,050
Longtae, take me to Pha Pun Dao cliff.

270
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,090
I'm going to go up at the end of the year. That way I'll remember the way.

271
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,410
That might not be a good idea, Phi.

272
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,770
The villagers just got haunted there.

273
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,689
Joma also ordered everyone not to enter the forest

274
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,970
until the guardian spirits of the forest and mountain forgive us, Phi.

275
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:17,330
I'm going to Pha Pun Dao cliff, not Ghost Hill or anything.

276
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,370
Come one. Help me out a bit.

277
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,970
Consider it as doing it for P' Torfun.

278
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,910
Fine then, Phi.

279
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,349
So...

280
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:36,229
when do you want to go there?

281
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,329
Right now.

282
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,849
What?

283
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,489
Let's go right now. Nothing is certain anymore.

284
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,440
I want to go there as soon as possible.

285
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,750
Okay, Phi, I understand.

286
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,670
Then let me go back and get a flashlight from home first.

287
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,570
Phi, wait for me here, alright?

288
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,989
Ai Choed, I've checked that no one is following us.

289
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,449
What if a ghost is following us?

290
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,109
Don't say that.

291
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,369
Come on. We need to hurry or else we won't be able to deliver the stuff in time.

292
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,570
I'm scared of ghosts, too. Damn it.

293
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:38,289
Please warn everyone not to go to Ghost Hill.

294
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:41,110
The spirit there is very vicious.

295
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,089
Choed, come here. Who helps you feed your kid?

296
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,109
I let Saeng take care of that. I'd rather finish this job.

297
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:16,050
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let's go.

298
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,689
Is that a human?

299
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,409
Come on, who would dare to get in here?

300
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,489
Hey, if it's a person then we're screwed.

301
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,649
Hurry up. We are late.

302
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,290
Let's go, let's go.

303
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,403
Hey!

304
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,030
- Longtae!
- Phi, I told you to wait outside―

305
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,009
Keep it down!

306
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,729
Why?

307
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,989
Because I saw Toa and Choed sneaking into the forest,

308
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,250
so I followed them in of course.

309
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,549
- Phi, are you sure?
- Yeah.

310
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:19,089
Right now, no one would dare to enter the forest, especially those two.

311
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:22,309
Exactly! That's why it's even more suspicious.

312
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:25,310
I have a gut feeling that something bad is going to happen though.

313
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,869
If... If that's really the case, shouldn't we go get the Chief first?

314
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:33,529
It's already too late.

315
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:37,789
If we don't hurry and follow them now, we'll end up losing them.

316
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,149
I don't want anything bad to happen to the village anymore.

317
00:42:41,149 --> 00:42:43,109
- Are, are you serious, Phi?
- I'm serious.

318
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:45,050
Come on. Let's go.

319
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,889
But that's the way to Ghost Hill.

320
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:52,890
Yeah, just come already.

321
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,090
Phi, wait up!

322
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,903
Tian.

323
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,683
Tian.

324
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,309
They are shrewd, I'll give them that.

325
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,989
They know the villagers are too afraid to come here,

326
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,690
so they're using this place to store their illegal goods.

327
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,970
Phi, what do think is inside there?

328
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:51,029
This place must be their storehouse before they sell it off across the border.

329
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,843
Is that Por Liang?

330
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,770
Why can't I be right when buying the lottery like I am with this?

331
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:11,069
With such a big matter like this, shouldn't we go get the Chief, Phi?

332
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,609
By the time we go there and get here,

333
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,510
Those guys will probably already happen to run away with their goods.

334
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,170
P-Phi, what are you doing?

335
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:26,270
At the very least, we'll have evidence incriminating them.

336
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,723
Shit!

337
00:44:35,723 --> 00:44:37,770
- Run!
- Get him!

338
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,483
Khama?

339
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,669
- Khama?
- Yes?

340
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:58,430
Khama, is Tian here?

341
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:06,109
Khru, he... stopped by since early this morning and left a long time ago.

342
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,730
Is that so?

343
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,969
Have you gone down to check the waterfall yet?

344
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,529
I went to look already and he wasn't there.

345
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:16,670
He's not at the school either.

346
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:19,929
Ai Longtae isn't home either.

347
00:45:19,929 --> 00:45:23,610
Otherwise, I'd have Ai Longtae help you look for him.

348
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,069
So, where did Longtae go?

349
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,149
I don't know either, Chief.

350
00:45:29,149 --> 00:45:32,510
I haven't seen his face since around the afternoon.

351
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,509
I know you guys are hiding around here.

352
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:48,460
Are you guys going to come out nicely or do you want me to drag your corpses out?

353
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,629
Longtae,

354
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,030
they don't know that there are two of us.

355
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,109
How about this,

356
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:58,729
Longtae, you go and run first, alright? And take the phone with you.

357
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,929
I'll lure them away for you.

358
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,990
No way, Phi. I'm not leaving you, Phi.

359
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,610
I know.

360
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:09,909
Hey, Phi! Phi! Phi!

361
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:11,729
Help me! Help!

362
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,563
Stop!

363
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,550
Hey, Phi, easy. Let's talk about this first.

364
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,590
You run fast, don't you?

365
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,923
Ouch!

366
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,403
Ouch!

367
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,970
Drag him up here.

368
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:24,229
Well, well.

369
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,410
Look who's here.

370
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:31,109
In actuality, it's Khru Tian, the hill top teacher with a fiery passion himself.

371
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:35,290
Last time, it was so fiery that it set the school on fire. Did that not discourage you yet?

372
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:41,349
Or could be that this time, the entire village needs to be set on fire?

373
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:44,530
Damn it!

374
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,610
And your cellphone?

375
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,143
I don't have it.

376
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,970
You don't have it, huh?

377
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:01,090
Do you have it now?

378
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,989
I don't know.

379
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:05,270
Maybe it fell.

380
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,529
- Do you want me to look for it, Sir?
- No need to.

381
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,840
This area wouldn't have any outsiders enter it anyway.

382
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,729
Just make it so that he can't get out of here to snitch on us.

383
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,790
With that, it'll be finished.

384
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,020
Who'll be finished exactly?

385
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,670
Do you know who I am?

386
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,289
My father is the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.

387
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,669
If anything happens to me,

388
00:48:37,669 --> 00:48:39,870
it's sure to get sticky for you Por Liang.

389
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:51,789
I can assure you, that if you let me go, Por Liang,

390
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:54,420
things will definitely go much smoother for you.

391
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,509
I don't give a damn about how powerful your father is.

392
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:04,089
What a waste of time.

393
00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:05,723
Finish him off.

394
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:10,910
If anything happens to me, my father won't let you go for sure!

395
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,909
Do you have any idea who the hell you're talking to?

396
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:19,329
I can guarantee you this, your father won't even know that his son is dead.

397
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,203
Kill him.

398
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,210

If I hadn't been here,

422

Chief, you yourself, wouldn't have to go through the trouble to taking care of me.

423
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,030
But I'm happy to.

424
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,629
I told you already...

425
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,880
I have a duty to take care of you.

426
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:41,070
Just think of this place as your home, alright?

427
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,449
Let's stay here together for a long, long time.

428
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,090

429
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,363
Can you?

00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:11,069
Hornbills are monogamous.

433
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,369
When a hornbill finds its partner,

434
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,870
they will be together for the rest of their lives.

435
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:20,470
And what if its partner dies?

436
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:24,849
If its partner dies,

437
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:31,329
the one that's left will wait for it's partner in the same place until it dies.

What happened?

441
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,890
And is he safe?

442
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,389
Watch him for me.

443
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:32,640
I'll go up there as fast as I can.

444
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,690
We've already caught the perpetrators that set fire to the school.

445
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,689
Who are they?

446
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:50,190
Well, they're Por Liang's men, of course.

447
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,689
As for Por Liang, it's game over for him already.

448
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,640
Right now, the police in pursuit of arresting them.

449
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,903
And also…

450
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,000
there shouldn't be anyone who'd dare to mess with you now.

451
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:06,850
So... the village should be safe now then.

452
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,750
And you are as well.

453
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:18,090
Then... I probably don't have any need to inconvenience you any longer, Chief.

454
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:24,890
Have I ever said that you inconvenienced me?

455
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:40,370
This place is also... not that far from the school.

456
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,810
There's also water and electricity, ready to be used.

457
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:46,920
It should be more convenient.

458
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:49,963
And?

459
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:54,870
In case you'd like to continue staying here...

460
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:01,250
Chief, is this a question or an invitation?

461
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:11,769
We're late. Hurry up and eat.

462
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,529
There's somewhere I need to take you to.

463
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,729
Chief, tell me clearly.

464
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,150
Chief, do you want me to continue staying here?

465
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,663
I do.

466
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:42,710
I think, that if you stay here,

467
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,549
then you'd probably be able to better prepare your teaching plans.

468
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:51,010
And also... it would probably be good for the kids too.

469
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,070
Just that?

470
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,490
Well, if I come home

471
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,870
and have someone waiting to give me a massage,

472
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:10,870
then it'd probably be nice.
