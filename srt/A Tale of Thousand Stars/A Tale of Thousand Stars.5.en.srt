00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,120
But most of them know that these guys...they're involved in grey (illegal) business.

176
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,639
He donates to the forestry department,

177
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,589
but is involved in the illegal wildlife trade.

178
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,620
Very contradicting.

179
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,470
Like those who'll plant a forest, but have elephant ivory in their home, Phi?

180
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,499
You have quite a sharp tongue there.

181
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,350
It's no wonder why trouble always finds you.

182
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,749
Who would dare to go against him?

183
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,390
Phu's own unit...it's also supported by Por Liang too.

184
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,019
Doing good to erase what's evil.

185
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,120
That can't be though, right, Phi?

186
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,640
Phu himself also isn't really happy about it either.

187
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,370
But he can't say anything.

188
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,120
I understand, Phi.

189
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,760
I probably really am a damn trouble magnet.

190
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,069
Sorry, Phi.

191
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,499
That's alright, that's alright.

192
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,719
But...just try not to look for trouble with him.

193
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,719
If you can avoid him, just avoid him.

194
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,153
Alright?

195
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,490
Miss?

196
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,669
The bill, please.

197
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:02,520
There was someone who already paid it for you.

198
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,423
- Full!
- Full!

199
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,939
I'm so full, Phi.

200
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,439
Is there anything else you want to go eat next?

201
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:30,390
How about dessert then?

202
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,679
Thank you for this meal, Por Liang Sakda.

203
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,489
Thank you, sir. You shouldn't have.

204
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,249
It's no problem.

205
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,179
This restaurant is well...owned by an acquaintance of mine.

206
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,699
Doctor, you go to take care of the people of Pha Pun Dao.

207
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,719
It's like you're taking care of the people for me too.

208
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,850
This is just a small matter.

209
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,009
Yes, sir.

210
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,909
If you're missing anything, you can just go ahead and let your boss know, Doctor.

211
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:02,300
Consider it as trying to help each other out.

212
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,113
Of course, sir.

213
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,929
This... His name is Khru Tian, sir.

214
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:18,489
He's the new teacher up in the hills.

215
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:20,059
Good.

216
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:25,830
A young man, someone of the younger generation, with compassion to help others.

217
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,599
But it can be a bit difficult up there.

218
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:34,180
I hope you're able to adjust yourself, Khru, to match with the villagers who've been there before you, alright?

219
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,690
I'm trying.

220
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,200
I'd like to thank you, Khru, on behalf of the villagers as well.

221
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,780
Someone like you, Khru...is hard to find.

222
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,590
You should stay around for a long time, alright?

223
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,799
I'll get going first then, Doctor.

224
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,330
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

225
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,909
Hello, Ai Tul?

226
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,119
Huh?

227
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,829
Dude, you've already arrived in Chiang Mai?

228
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,640
Oh...yeah, yeah. Alright, alright. See you.

229
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,833
P' Mor?

230
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,780
For today... could I not go back to Pha Pun Dao yet?

[The Loft Café]

232
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,949
Hey! Ai Tul!

233
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,483
Ai Tian!

234
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,760
Hey! How've you been, dude? Give me a hug.

235
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,269
I can't believe that you'd come to see me!

236
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:07,580
I told you, I'm a man of my word!

237
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,690
Ai Tul, you shit. I missed you, Dude.

238
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,819
-Hey, are those your words your opinion, Dude?
- Yeah.

239
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,209
Alright then.

240
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:17,260
Ai Tian, you ass.

241
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,889
If it's like that... That must mean that you also missed me then.

242
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,330
Of course, my dear friend.

243
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,380
And, Dude... what the heck are you wearing?

244
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,519
Why?

245
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,699
Would you have another one for me? That way I can just change into it!

246
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,193
Here.

247
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,039
To my best friend, who has fulfilled his wish of being a teacher on a hill.

248
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,609
Ha! You're confused, right, Dude?

249
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,970
They say that if you drink it, it's good for your body's health.

[V Boost]

252
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,480
It really is good for the body's health, dude.

253
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,140
What the heck is with you?

254
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,373
Nothing.

255
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,439
Oh, right, Dude.

256
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,480
And...did my mom ever call you worrying about me?

257
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,293
Let me count real quick.

258
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,939
Just once, Dude!

259
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,449
Why did you even bother counting, Dude?

260
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,979
Yeah, but I didn't tell her anything!

261
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:47,579
Your mom, she just hung up.

262
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:50,429
Well, at first...I thought that your mom would grill me more.

263
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:54,609
Yeah...that's good then. You better not tell her anything.

264
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,729
So when I get back, I can just get an earful once.

265
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,490
Sure. And what about you? How have you been?

266
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,829
Me?

267
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:05,080
Absolutely amazing, Dude.

268
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,259
Dude, just imagine it.

269
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,479
On a day when the power at your house goes out... Damn, it's as quiet as that.

270
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,309
Like... Once the sun goes down, it's like that every single day.

271
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,859
And did you know? The first day when I arrived,

272
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,369
I couldn't eat anything at all.

273
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,909
So I had to just force myself to eat, Dude.

274
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,699
And you know? I've just become friends with mosquitoes!

275
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,769
I get bitten by them every day!

276
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,249
And like, there was one day where I...was hurting...

277
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,480
hurting to take a dump.

278
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,319
I was hurting so bad!

279
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,739
So I held a lantern from the house and went to the toilet

280
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:37,879
But, damn, the toilet and the house are like 30 meters apart, Dude.

281
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,899
The path was so damn dark too. I was just walking and holding as I went.

282
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:42,759
Once I put it down,

283
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,519
That was it. I was in the middle of letting it out...

284
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,929
And once I looked up at the ceiling, Dude... I was facing a tokay gecko, right?

285
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,879
Dude, think about it. A tokay gecko! Shit, man!
[T/N: Tokay Gecko is a large gecko that constantly makes a "tokay" sound. People are terrified of them and their bite.]

286
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:57,329
So I was like, "Alright..." I quickly pulled my pants, grabbed the lantern, and ran right out.

287
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,100
What are you smiling at?

288
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,810
I'm just thinking that...

289
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,130
If it's that difficult, then just why are you staying?

290
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,099
It's just...

291
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,310
It's also good, Dude.

292
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,543
Like...

293
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,540
We probably won't come across something like this in our actual lives.

294
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,510
So...what's it for then?

295
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,083
Well...

296
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,290
I think...

297
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,169
I probably wanted to find something new to experience in my life.

298
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,329
That can't be true.

299
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,029
A guy like you, Dude... If you were thinking of doing something new in your life,

300
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:54,569
by now you would've gone back home a long time ago, Ai Tian!

301
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,839
There must be something more to that.

302
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:58,479
You better say it.

303
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,113
Right now.

304
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,759
I said, "Say it."

305
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,989
Hey, it hurts!

306
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,030
Hurry up. Say it.

307
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,203
Chief!

308
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,489
Chief, are you here to see Khru Tian?

309
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,759
That's right. Uh... not at all.

310
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:23,670
The vendor at the market asked me to bring food to Khru Tian.

311
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

312
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,930
- Ai Rang, Ai Rang.
-What?

313
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,229
Chief!

314
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,050
Did you come to wait for Khru Tian all the way at his house?

315
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,683
No!

316
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,329
That must mean that the Chief probably has something really important.

317
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,100
Yeah, that's right.

318
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,659
Help him.

319
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,910
Should... Should I help?

320
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,263
What's the rush?

321
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,469
You're not drinking alcohol either.

322
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,349
You've changed just as I said, right?

323
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,739
Even though you complained how you're struggling,

324
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,290
your face seems to be pretty happy though.

325
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,179
Well, I'm actually happy, Dude.

326
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,489
The people there are so damn sweet.

327
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,109
Are you going to move houses and just stay here then?

328
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,440
A house? You never know.

329
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,649
Ai Tian, Let me tell you.

330
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,639
This isn't your real life, Dude.

331
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,500
How the hell is it not real?

332
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,159
Well, if you wanted to just test your life

333
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,979
on just how difficult it can be just to take a picture to upload on Facebook,

334
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:48,129
I could understand that.

335
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,359
But if it's your actual life, Dude,

336
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,299
could you really life without having electricity... not having a phone, not having internet?

337
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,039
With your life just continually looping like that.

338
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,469
Would you really be able to do that?

339
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,419
But other people are also able live their lives like that.

340
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:03,649
Dude.

341
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,059
Dude, don't you think that if they could choose, would they really want to have that kind of life?

342
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:10,910
Everyone wants to have a comfortable life.

343
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,359
But there are also people who choose to live their lives like that for real though.

344
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,669
Who?

345
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,329
Well...people with a purpose in life.

346
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,669
People who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others.

347
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,259
Like damn, that's freaking cool.

348
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,560
Are there still people like that?

349
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,779
At the very least... I know one person.

350
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,413
There we go.

351
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,019
- I understand now.
- What the hell?

352
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:36,149
That damn happiness that you mentioned...

353
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,639
Well, it's not because of the village. It's not because of the profession of being a teacher, Dude.

354
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,100
It's because of that person, man!

355
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,879
Here he is.

356
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,960
Speaking of the devil.

357
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:02,109
Chang Yod was telling me that you were being cranky with him all day, Dude?

358
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,089
Ai Mor. When did you arrive?

359
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,009
Wow. Look.

360
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,019
We have finished many bottles.

361
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,879
Here, Chief.

362
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,150
I think that a gulp or two gulps would be good.

363
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,640
This helps you relax.

364
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,723
Ai Mor.

365
00:25:20,723 --> 00:25:23,489
If you arrived a long time ago, then where did Nong Tian go?

366
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,123
Look.

367
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,429
Just as he sees my face. Bam. He asks about Nong Tian instantly.

368
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:30,639
Right away.

369
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,209
Just as he sees my face, B-b-b-bam. I-i-instantly, he asks about Nong Tian.

370
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:36,540
B-b-b-bam. I-i-instantly.

371
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,170
Nong Tian didn't come with me.

372
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,879
His friend came to see him in the city center.

373
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:47,339
So he's going to come back tomorrow instead.

374
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,729
Who gave him permission?

375
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,119
There he goes again. It's all about permission and permission,

376
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,990
nothing but that all day, all night.

377
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,100
Alright, alright, alright. Drink some alcohol instead.

378
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,619
No need to be cranky, friend!

379
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,089
Come on.

380
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,609
Hey, I'm not frustrated with you, Dude.

381
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,339
I just want to knock some sense into you is all.

382
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,659
Yeah. Thanks, Dude.

383
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,330
And so? This happiness of yours... who is it?

384
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,113
Ai Tul... How would you feel

385
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,310
if I told you that...

386
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,313
I like men?

387
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,669
That's your business, of course.

388
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,559
Woah! That's it?

389
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,779
Huh? So how did you expect me to feel?

390
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,339
I thought that you might be... more shocked than this.

391
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,479
- So if I told you that I liked women, would you be shocked?
- Well, no.

392
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,919
Yeah, so why the hell do I need to be shocked?

393
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,919
When it's just you getting to know yourself better.

394
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,569
Which I think... that's pretty ok though.

395
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,169
Dude, but it's not the same at all.

396
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,079
How, how is it not the same?

397
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,259
It's just like you like liking dogs while I like cats.

398
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,809
It's still just a preference though. Isn't that right?

399
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:09,749
They're totally different matters, Dude.

400
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,819
Wait. Hold up.

401
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,949
So then the person who's making your heart flutter and not want to go home...

402
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,940
It's a guy?

403
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,159
But it's pretty strange, right? That Ai Nong Tian could stay here this long.

404
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,370
He'll be going back home soon.

405
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,120
He'll be dearly missed then.

406
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,369
Besides Khru Torfun,

407
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,109
it's this teacher... that's suitable for...

408
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,410
Pha Pun Dao village.

409
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,849
Ai Chang, well said!

410
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,899
Of course! I'm good at talking!

411
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,999
I can say it right now that...

412
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,779
Just about everyone adores him.

413
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,700
Even myself, I also like him.

414
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,359
What about you, Mor? Mor do you like him?

415
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,779
- Khru Tian?
- I like him.

416
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,259
Ai Rang! And you, do you like him?

417
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,110
I like him. I like him.

418
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,559
What about you, Dude?

419
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,319
Do you like him?

420
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,429
I might just be feeling good with him is all, Dude.

421
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,159
The feelings that I have for him

422
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,789
I don't even know if it started from myself,

423
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:29,169
or if it started because of Torfun, or...could it be because I'm gay?

424
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:31,029
Are you crazy? Feelings,

425
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,649
they're born from your own brain, man. Not from someone else's heart.

426
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,029
Ugh! I don't know anymore!

427
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,639
Damn it.

428
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,519
The thing is, you need to separate them into different matters, Dude.

429
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,969
The matter of whether you're gay or not is one matter.

430
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,179
And the matter of if you like him or not is another matter, Dude.

431
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:47,649
Ai Tul! They're the same matter.

432
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:50,959
If it's the same matter, then that means that you're gay and that you like him!

433
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,869
You like men, then that means you're gay.

434
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,789
But I'm okay with it, Dude. Because you're my friend.

435
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,223
That's that.

436
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,233
Hey!

437
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:04,469
And when did I tell you that I liked him?

438
00:29:04,469 --> 00:29:07,339
I saw the signs from you ever since the first day he came here.

439
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,169
You never seemed to bother taking care of others as well as you do with him.

440
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,603
Right?

441
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,400
I'm just doing my duty.

442
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,469
You guys, both of you are the same.

443
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,520
So tight-lipped!

444
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,969
Ai Mor.

445
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,539
What did you say to him?

446
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,779
He was just talking about you.

447
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,229
So I just told him about you.

448
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,260
So what did he say about me?

449
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,029
He just yells at me, Dude.

450
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,110
Did you know? On the first day, he just suddenly threw water in my face.

451
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,829
And another day he just pushed me in the water. Like, damn.

452
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:44,449
Him yelling at you, Dude...

453
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,419
That's what made you like him?

454
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:48,729
Such a Thai Lakorn. Damn.

455
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,770
You're such a pain in the ass.

456
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,269
- So where are you going, Dude?
- To take a piss.

457
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:57,919
- Are you shy?
- Shy, my ass.

458
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,153
Hey!

459
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,420
What's up, Khru Doi?
[T/N: Khru = Teacher, Doi = Hill]

460
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,720
Is your dad not here to protect you today?

461
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,660
So what the hell do you want?

462
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,820
To knock your head off, you son of a bitch!

463
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,530
You bastard!

464
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,550
Do you think you're so great?

465
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,220
Let go! You asshole!

466
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,713
Shit! Hey!

467
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,023
Run!

468
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,009
Run faster!

469
00:30:57,009 --> 00:30:58,743
I know!

470
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,750
Come this way!

471
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,089
I'm damn exhausted.

472
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,399
I now believe that you really live up to your nickname

473
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:21,300
Tian, the trouble magnet.

474
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,470
I may be the trouble magnet,

475
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,330
but YOU brought the trouble to me!

476
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,289
So are you going to be screwed then?

477
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,010
I think that...those guys will definitely follow you to get back at you up there.

478
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,359
Screw them. I'm not scared anymore.

479
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,850
I have someone protecting me anyway.

480
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,429
You got the guts to say that.

481
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:47,440
I really want to see the face of this Chief of yours now.

482
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
[Phaphirun Unit]

483
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,899
Here, Dude. These are strawberries.

484
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:56,649
Wash them with a bit of water and they're good to eat.

485
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,579
They're from Pha Pun Dao, you know!

486
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,290
They're organic, for sure. Trust me.

487
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,569
As for these... Moo Yau.
[T/N: Sausage of pork paste that's been wrapped in banana leaf and then boiled]

488
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:05,710
Don't eat too many, Dude.

489
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,349
Dude.

490
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,400
And...about what you told me last night,

491
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,380
You don't need to overthink it, man.

492
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,130
I understand you.

493
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,630
Thanks, man.

494
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,439
And then I'll go and tell Ai Mark, Ai Lin, and Ai Ood. All of them.

495
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,179
Ai Tul, you shit. You really...

496
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:30,040
Just go back. Go.

497
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,419
Oh, dude...

498
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:37,240
And about Torfun,

499
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,600
I think that you should find a way to tell him.

500
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,290
Trust me.

501
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,580
Before it's too late.

502
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,603
Yeah.

503
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,710
Before I go back,

504
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,590
Let me get a selfie with you, just one picture, friend.

505
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,123
Come here.

506
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,929
Hey, Ai Tul. Don't be nosey and post it, Dude.

507
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:05,920
Yeah, I know already.

508
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,479
I'm leaving then. If the friends ask,

509
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,100
I'll just tell them that you're stuck to a guy.

510
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,790
Ai Tul.

511
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,490
(Piss off.)

512
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,330
Huh, Chief?

513
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,860
Why? I can't come pick you up?

514
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,659
Okay, Chief.

515
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,149
From now on, if I'm going to go somewhere,

516
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,169
I'll inform you every time, Chief.

517
00:35:25,169 --> 00:35:26,603
Okay?

518
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,233
What are you even saying?

519
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,080
Geez, well it's because you're being this quiet, Chief.

520
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,230
Chief, just go ahead and lecture me.

521
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,660
Where have you been?

522
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,800
Well, my friend came on a trip to see me, like pretty suddenly.

523
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,300
I just wanted to go hang out with my friend for a day.

524
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,039
Next time...

525
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,399
It's you! Try to talk nicely to him sometimes.

526
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,000
You only ever make a stern face and always speak with an authoritative tone.

527
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,700
Next time...you can just invite your friend to come up and visit up here.

528
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,040
So where has your friend gone now?

529
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,990
My friend went back home already.

530
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,770
So...have you eaten anything yet?

531
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,399
O-Oh...Not yet. Not yet.

532
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:24,490
I'm not really hungry yet.

533
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,390
You! You should learn to be considerate of others sometimes.

534
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,929
Nong Tian came up here to teach in the hills.

535
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,379
Once he's done teaching, he just goes home.

536
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,110
Did you know that he might want to go around to see things too?

537
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,290
Hey, Chief.

538
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,290
This is not the way back to Pha Pun Dao village.

539
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,839
I'm going to take you on a trip.

540
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,373
Huh?

541
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,390
Chief, YOU taking me on a trip?

542
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,130
Or do you not want to go?

543
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,970
I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. Let's go.

544
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,573
Wow.

545
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,950
It's so damn beautiful, Chief.

546
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,250
This weather is so nice.

547
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,010
Here.

548
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,020
Eat this as a snack for now.

549
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,020
Thank you, Chief.

550
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
So, Chief, you're not going to eat any?

551
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,529
Here.

552
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,163
Let's share.

553
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,160
Come on.

554
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,450
No one else is around. You don't need to act cool.

555
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,029
Here, eat it all.

556
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,730
You just go ahead and eat it.

557
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,913
Chief.

558
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,079
Hey, Chief.

559
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,939
Do ever have any other expressions, other than the stuck-up one you make at me?

560
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,480
My face is just like this to everyone.

561
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,140
Do you have to make a stern face all the time?

562
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,669
I'm a supervisor.

563
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,449
If I smile too much, what subordinates would take me seriously?

564
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:49,690
But right now, there aren't any subordinates around though.

565
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,180
Can you not be a chief for a moment?

566
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,880
So what do you want me to be?

567
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,580
To be a Phi, maybe?

568
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,380
So call me Phi then.

569
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,923
P'Phu.

570
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,000
No. It's cringe.

571
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,599
Oh, Chief.

572
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,639
So...when you're happy, what kind of face do you make?

573
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,673
Can you show me?

574
00:40:20,673 --> 00:40:22,333
I smile like this, of course.

575
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,209
Then...when you smile for someone you like, such as smiling for a lover...

576
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:30,020
Do you not know how to smile?

577
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,460
No wonder why you don't have a lover.

578
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,060
There it is! A smile like that!

579
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,450
How come you know how to smile like that now?

580
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,690
What picture are you looking at?

581
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,123
Let me take a look too.

582
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,560
Let me see.

583
00:41:37,033 --> 00:41:38,589
Wow, you're just going to put it away?

584
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,920
Fine, I won't look at it.

585
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,670
I'll go somewhere else then.

586
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,370
I'll...

587
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,240
go inside the house first then, alright?

588
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,193
Yeah.

591

Ai Phu, you're about 30 now!

592
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,370
Make some moves. Don't just sit on the fence.

593
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,483
No.

594
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,653
It's nothing.

595
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,623
I'll get going then, alright?

596
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,819
Dude, if you're not sure about how he feels about you,

597
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,920
just make the first move on him.

00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,999
We are young. We are bold.

599
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,400
Go for it. Don't waste time.

00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,223
Huh?

602
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,270
Tomorrow...want to go fly kites together?

603
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,863
Kites?

604
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:12,720
What I mean is, tomorrow, I'm going to teach the kids to make a kite.

605
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,639
If you're free...then come do it together.

606
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,153
"Do it together"?

607
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,840
I mean, tomorrow, come and create a kite together.

608
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,723
Okay.

609
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,750
You should go back now.

610
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,550
You should go inside the house already too.

611
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,029
Are you cold, everyone?

612
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,069
Yes.

Make sure you clean everything thoroughly.

614
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:52,340
- Are you okay, Aai?
- I'm alright, I'm alright.

615
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,020
When I went into the woods just now, there were so many snakes.

616
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,733
You need to look around carefully, alright?

617
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,810
We're here.

618
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,579
- Ayi.
- Yes?

619
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,290
Come here.

620
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,189
Are you not sweeping properly, huh?

621
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,809
- Are you not sweeping properly?
- I am.

622
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,500
Look at him.

623
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,269
At first, I thought he wouldn't last more than 3 days for sure.

624
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,510
And I'd have to drive him back to the bus terminal for sure.

625
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,550
But look at him now.

626
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:22,000
He seems like one of the people here.

627
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:33,180
When I think about it, I feel sad. That soon, Khru, will have to return to Bangkok already.

628
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,300
My true feelings are that I'd like him to stay here longer.

629
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,890
Chief, can't you help talk to Khru Tian?

630
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:46,390
I can't, Chang.

631
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,910
He still has a future ahead.

632
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,860
He hasn't even finished school yet.

633
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,623

00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,540

Come on, come on. Let's put it away.

00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:35,009
- So we cut this bamboo for you to teach the kids to build kites.
- Come on, come on. Put it away.

641
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,899
Yeah, that's true. I completely forgot about it.

642

-Sure.

Everyone! Today, I'll be teaching you all how to make kites!

652
00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:03,049
What is a kite?

653
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:04,729
A kite?

654

00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,510
It's a tiny big bird, of course!

657
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,919
Alright, alright. No need to be confused, everyone.

658
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,190
Let's just get right into making it. Come on.

659
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:22,479

660
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:24,909
One each. Come on. One each.

661
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,639
And then...have you picked a paper yet? Have you picked a colored paper for the kite yet?

662
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,009
Apply the glue thinly.

663
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:35,609
If you put it on too thick, the kite won't be able to fly.

664
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,730
A plane can go up though.

665
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,849
It's not the same though, right? Here, take a look here.

666
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:47,339
A plane, alright, has wings that help it to be able to be lifted in the air.

667
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,150
With the principle that

668
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:52,279
it allows the air to flow over towards the end of the wings at high speed.

669
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,110
It makes it generates enough force to make the plane

670
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:59,300
be able to float up, just like this.

Huh?

677
00:49:30,773 --> 00:49:33,279
If you knew how to make a kite, why didn't you say so?

678
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,880

Well, you've never asked me about kites though.

682

I'm a rural boy.

683
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,410
What does being rural have anything to do with it?

684
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:55,230
Well, I didn't have remote control cars. I didn't have games to press and play.

685
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,660

00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,150
Alright, everyone. Hurry up and follow me.

699
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,669
Hey, Longtae!

700
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,129
Oh, P' Tian!

701
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,269
- Are you here to take photos for fun?
- That's right.

702
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:18,099
- Are you free?
- What's up, Phi? I'm free, Phi. What's up?

703
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:19,759
Can you help the kids with their kites?

704
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,810
Sure, Phi.

705
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,550
Hi, Yod. Hi, Rang.

706
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,180
Hey! Come on, come on.

707
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,190
Chief Phu?

708
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,449
What do you want?

709
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:40,850
Calling me by my full title like that...

710
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,580
How do you fly a kite?

711
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:10,013
Everyone, gather right here.

712
00:52:10,013 --> 00:52:13,020
Come, come, come.

713
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,920
We're going to get in pairs, alright?

714
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,799
One person holds the rope.

715
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,759
And the other person will send the kite to the sky.

716
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,760
Once we count one, two, three...

717
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,339
The person holding the rope will run this way.

718
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,189
while the person with the kite pushes it up in the opposite direction of the wind.

719
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,060
Understood?

720
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,980
- Do you guys understand?
- Yes, Sir.

721
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,230
Go on, kids. Let's try it out.

722
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:34,940
Let's go! Let's do it! Let's do it!

723
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:57,323
Tian!

724
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:59,850
Tian!

725
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,640
P'Tian!

726
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,320
Aai Seetian!

727
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,749
Tian! Tian!

728
00:54:09,749 --> 00:54:11,850
Tian! Tian! Tian!

729
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:16,863
Tian!

730
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,063
Ai Mor!

732
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,660
I thought you would've taken me to see the scenic landscape.

733
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,949
I'm sleepy.

734
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:03,100
So I was looking for something to drink to combat my sleepiness.

735
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,000
Do you want one, too?

736
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,409
I want it. I want one cup.

737
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:09,399
I'll make it for you. Go and have a seat first.

738
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,459
Hey, hey, hey! Chief, you go sit. I'll make it for you.

739
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,293
Move over.

740
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
You went out of your way to drive a long way to pick me up, no?

741
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,893
Chief.

742
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:11,463
How is it?

743
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,060
It's good.

744
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,089
Chief, did you know?

745
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:21,240
Chief, you're the first person I've made coffee for.

746
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:35,949
It's a bit intense. Do you like it?

747
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,990
Yeah, I tend to like it pretty intense.

748
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:42,810
I'm also intense.

749
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,429
I meant the coffee though.

750
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:51,279
I also meant the coffee.

751
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,180
What are YOU thinking of?

Heart surgery and a heart transplant surgery are completely different things though.

760
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:59,360
And such a big matter like this... Why didn't you tell us, Phi?

761
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,359
Ayi told me the villagers hadn't harvested tea leaves for several weeks.

762
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,009
It's because I had an argument with those guys, right?

763
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:08,810
There's not even a month left and your period will be ending.

764
