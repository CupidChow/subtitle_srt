My name is Tian. You can call me Khru Tian.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,059
Where are all the children?

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,160
They've all gone home already.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,749
At this time?

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,659
Khru! Kalae is drowning! Khru! Khru!

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,759
-Khru!
-Kalae!
-Hey! Kalae!

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,519
If you think that coming to this village is already a great sacrifice

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,089
and doing things carelessly without any preparations of what to teach them like this,,

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,170
then you'd better go back.

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,320
I'll be a volunteer teacher that completes the three months.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,220
I'll wait and see.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,410
Shit! I'm tired already!

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,350
Lately, I get exhausted so damn easily.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,870
Dude, I think that...it's more like you're weak, friend. Hey!

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,989
Damn it, Tian.

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,290
Didn't you say you were exhausted already though?

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,139
By the way, were you able to read the road trip plan I sent you?

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,749
The road trip in the US?

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,280
I read it already, and I'm down to go with you too.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,413
- For real?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,859
But my Ba... He's pressuring me so damn much.
[T/N: Thai-Chinese term for Dad]

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,909
He's determined to have me study over there for sure.

23
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,959
And, Dude, you know what?

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,250
How many people have gone to study there and all end up unemployed?

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,660
Ai Tul!

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,780
What are you bringing up studying now for?

27
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,029
This is a road trip in the USA, for goodness' sake.

28
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,579
It's a dream trip on my bucket list.

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,189
Before I die, shouldn't I go at least once?

30
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,840
Of course, that's a sure thing, friend! And...

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,039
You should ask your mom to follow and study with me over there, Dude!

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,920
Understand?

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,220
Alright, I won't beat around the bush then.

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,330
Tian, you have symptoms of myocarditis that's caused by a virus.
[T/N: Inflammation of the heart muscle]

35
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,190
Are you ready, dude?

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,620
Hey! Tian!

37
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,249
Ai Tian!

38
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,969
Are you okay?

39
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,079
-Hey! Hey, please help! Please help!
- And this disease...

40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,779
There still isn't any treatment method.

41
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,880
The only option is to have to undergo surgery to change the heart.

42
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,470
Can it be found right away?

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,090
And will you be the one to help your nephew yourself?

44
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,920
Well… before we can perform a heart transplant,

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,929
There needs to be someone who's donated a heart.

46
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,809
And what's important,

47
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,779
that heart must be compatible with Tian.

48
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,500
And just how long do we have to wait?

49
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,850
I can't answer that either.

50
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,149
But the best thing you can do right now is...

51
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,679
Tian, you yourself must take care of your body for it to be strong.

52
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,920
You shouldn't do anything that would overexert your heart.

53
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,049
And just be prepared.

54
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,430
If there's a day that there's a heart that's compatible with your body,

55
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,360
we will be able to operate immediately.

56
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,100
Do you any questions?

57
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,143
Tian?

58
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,043
Tian?

59
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,740
And how much time do I have left?

60
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,710
♫ The story that's been told however many times is still the same ♫

61
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:26,280

66
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,210
What is it, Chief?

67
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,810
While you're here, be careful of where you're coming and going.

68
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,260
Because animals love their lives too.

69
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,413
Right?

70
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,730
Joma is currently performing a ritual.

71
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,493
"Joma"?

72
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,910
You'll know soon.

73
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,790
(Shaman reciting an incantation)

74
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,630
-Hello, Chief.
- Hello.
-Hello, Khru.

75
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,480
Hello.

76
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,779
Tomorrow, take this holy water to bathe.

77
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,639
Sprinkle it on the head for three days.

78
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,329
And recite this incantation for three nights as well.

79
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,399
It chases away the spirits and lessens his misfortune.

80
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,659
Thank you so much.

81
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,393
I'm done here.

82
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,829
Joma, this is Khru Tian.

83
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,730
He's a new teacher at the education center.

84
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,650
Let me see your palm.

85
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,469
Good morning.

Tangled palm lines.

88
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,529
Very complex.

89
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,180
This fortune looks like there are two people,

90
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,729
as if you were about to die, but didn't die.

91
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,020
It's as if you have another person inside you.

92
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,353
Very confusing.

93
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,740
A hot fortune, a cold fortune completely overlapping.

94
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,140
Well, that's it. My reading.

Tomorrow, share this Holy Water with him.

-Sprinkle it on his head as well for three days.
- Yes, sir.

97

I'm leaving then.

00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:19,130
- I'm going back now.
- Goodbye.

99
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,649
I'll send you off, sir.

100
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,599
Come on. Let's go to Kalae.

101
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,239
Kalae!

102
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
Come and let the doctor take a look.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,179
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

104
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,501
Kalae, how are you now?

105
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:32,330
-Hello.
- How are you? All better yet?/ What's on your face?
- Let me check your temperature.

106
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,610
Here. Let me check it for a bit.

107
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,979
How are you holding up, Kalae?

108
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,499
I'm all better now, Khru. I can go to the waterfall again.

109
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,030
Sir. Ma'am.

110
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,820
I truly apologize…

111
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,250
for taking Kalae and having him fall in the water like that.

112
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,429
I'm fully recovered. The spirits have taken the sickness away already.

113
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:58,680
I can go to school now.

114
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,269
Get sprinkled with the holy water for three days.

115
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,620
Then we will talk about that.

116
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,999
Kalae, you're quite strong and healthy too.

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,790
You don't have a fever anymore!

118
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,790
But if at nightfall you get feverish,

119
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,070
I'll have some pills prepared for your parents, alright?

120
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,839
- Can you take them? The pills.
- I don't want pills.

121
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,999
What? Hold on, hold on. Just hold on.

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,150
You don't want pills?

123
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,270
Oh...I think...that I'm out of liquid medicine though.

124
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,099
I don't want pills. Don't want them.

125
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,119
I don't want pills.

126
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,530
Mom, talk to him for me. I don't want pills.

127
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,979
Come on, Kalae. Hey, your friends can take pills too though, right?

128
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,349
Have you had it before? Anyone who's taken pills before, raise your hands!

129
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,700
- Me! Me! I can! I can swallow pills!
- I can swallow pills!

130
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,529
-See? You can start taking pills now.
- It's easy.

131
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,199
- It's easy. You'll get better soon.
- I don't want to take pills though, Mom.

132
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,339
Try it. Try it, alright?

133
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,073
Kalae.

134
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,010
I also take pills though.

135
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,590
And the people who take pills are grown-ups.

136
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,769
Kalae, do you want to be a child or a grown-up?

137
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,520
To be a grown-up...

138
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,210
Well, if you want to be a grown-up, Kalae, then you have to take pills.

139
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,439
Okay. Then...

140
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,609
I'll leave these pills with Dad and Mom, alright?

141
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,889
Excuse me. It'll be one pill, alright?

142
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,170
Come here. I'm going to listen to your heart a bit, alright?

143
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,060
To see if you're healthy yet.

144
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,809
I'll listen to everyone's. Do you want that?

145
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,519
Let's see. Come here, our amazing Kalae.

146
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,509
How are you doing now?

147
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,360
Breathe in, please.

148
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,100
Breathe out.

149
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,860
One more time. Deep breaths in.

150
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,469
Tian, this is Dr. Wasan.

151
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,660
He's the regular doctor here.

152
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

153
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,550
And this is Tian, the new volunteer teacher.

154
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,789
You can just call me Dr. Nam.

155
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,489
And about the other day, I'm sorry.

156
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,940
For having startled you.

157
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,300
It's alright, Phi.

158
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,470
So how is it? Are you able to stay here at Pha Pun Dao village?

159
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,649
Well, it's pretty unfamiliar, Phi, but I'm getting used to it.

160
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:21,539
Just look,

161
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,880
even an actual doctor has to step aside for a spiritual doctor (shaman).

162
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,809
But it's a belief, right?

163
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,780
There's nothing right and nothing wrong though.

164
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,669
But just don't go against their beliefs is all, then you'll be fine.

165
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:37,480
But...how he greeted me gave me goosebumps, Phi.

166
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,350
That's alright. Don't overthink it.

167
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,759
If you need anything, just tell Ai Phu, alright?

168
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,610
Because I also go down into the city pretty often.

169
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,150
Then can I ask you to buy a phone signal, Phi?

170
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,739
"A phone signal"?

171
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,289
You're actually a funny guy.

172
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,709
I'm kidding, Phi.

173
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,150
But if you really need to use it, you can go to the forest ranger's unit.

174
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,939
- The forest ranger's unit has one to use.
- It's just used when necessary.

175
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:02,810
It's not there for someone to cry like a baby to those at home.

176
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,470
Then can I use the phone to order pizza, Phi?

177
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,080
Can we go back yet?

178
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,740
My duty is not to guard only you.

179
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,460
- Then I'll get going first, Phi.
- Alright.

180
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,569
Hurry up and get going! Careful, the guardian is strict.

181
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,303
Got it, Phi.

182
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,050
[Pha Pun Dao School]

183
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,809
The kids probably don't want to learn with me anymore.

184
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,420
Yeah. So what's next?

185
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,330
Do you want to just go home then?

186
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,040
Do you want me to go home that badly?

187
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,043
No.

188
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,950
Someone told me he would be here for the entire three months.

189
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,480
Why the hell is it so hard to be a good teacher?

190
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,450
So what's a good teacher like?

191
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,960
Well, it's probably a teacher who can teach that's understandable, maybe?

192
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,669
And what if the teacher can teach them to understand it but the kids can't make use of it at all?

193
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,920
Would that still be a good teacher?

194
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,619
Then what is your definition of a good teacher?

195
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,253
Like you.

196
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,709
I mean…

197
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,880
You're just one teacher with your own style.

198
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,399
There's no need to compare yourself with anyone.

199
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,070
The kids here, for the most part, don't need knowledge for exams or anything.

200
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,929
And knowledge doesn't always need to start with A-Z learning.

201
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,099
They just want to see a broader world from you.

202
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,629
If the word "teacher" is too heavy for you,

203
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:14,230
then you can try to be an older sibling to them instead.

204
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,679
It's probably up to you now,

205
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,030
whether you want to see them as your family or not.

206
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,570
Where are you going?

207
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,520
I'm going to see my family, of course.

208
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,089
Hello.

209
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,790
I'm the new volunteer teacher.

210
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,830
Is Khao Neung home?

211
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,960
Oh, Khru!

212
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,519
I just came to know that your family ran a chicken farm.

213
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,639
Yes.

214
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,120
My father said the restaurants in the city use our eggs.

215
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,860
Wow. Oh, hey. Give it here, I'll help.

216
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,669
Khru Tian!

217
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,870
Ah Ma (Grandma), hello.
[T/N: Thai-Chinese term for Grandma]

218
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,400
I asked for some vitamin C from Dr. Nam for Kalae.

219
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,630
Thank you, Khru.

220
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,999
Here, Kalae. It's from your friends.

221
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:52,319
Thank you.

222
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,153
Get well soon, alright?

223
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,239
My name is Khru Tian.

224
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,860
I think...it's better if I help.

225
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,919
Bring it here. Ah Ma will teach you.

226
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,480
Here. Then pass it through again.

227
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,843
Ah Ma?

228
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:17,939
Ah Ma, can you teach me to stitch as well?

229
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,040
I want to be able to do it too.

230
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,059
Khru, try holding it.

231
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,340
Huh... Hold it?

232
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,160
Hey! Hey! Hey!

233
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,360
[Khru Seetian, Khao Neung, Inta, Ayi, Meejoo, "Get well soon, Kalae."]

234
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,560
-Hold it like this, Ah Ma?
- That's right.

235
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,099
How is it, Ah Ma? Is it good enough?

236
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,710
Oh, what did you do?

237
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,710
Am I handsome yet, Ah Ma?

238
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,289
How are they picked?

239
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,770
Well, just break off them off from the buds.

240
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,789
Like this, right?

241
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,923
Yes.

242
00:17:17,923 --> 00:17:21,190
I can put it in here then. I'll help.

243
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,919
Meejoo!

244
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,919
- Khru Seetian!
- Hello. Hello.

245
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,459
- How are you?
- Well, I was missing you, Khru Seetian.

246
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:41,569
If you missed me, then why haven't you been going to school?

247
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,039
I don't know.

248
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,690
Ayi doesn't go. So I don't go, either.

249
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,729
Huh? So where did Ayi go?

250
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,089
He's at the plantation. Khru, do you want to go there?

251
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,589
- Of course. Let's go there.
- Then I'll take you there.

252
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,729
- Oh, Khru! Hi.
- Hi, Ayi.

253
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:10,839
- Mom. Meejoo.
- It's 4 kg.

254
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,691
What are you guys doing?

255
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,750
They came to buy tea leaves, Khru.

256
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,449
So, how do you sell them?

257
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:24,530
Uh… well… I... I also don't know either. It's, well...

258
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,639
It's 4 kg. Go.

259
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,749
So, Ayi, does your dad know how much 1 kilogram is?

260
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:38,930
Uh… Well, what is "kilogram"? I don't understand.

261
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,319
So, how do you charge them?

262
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,980
Well, that guy writes the numbers on the paper.

263
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,790
Khru...Khru Tian...

264
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,179
- It's 4 kg.
- That's 5.4 kg!

265
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,999
- Khru Tian...
- Who the hell are you?

266
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,639
Well, someone who can't tolerate cheating, of course.

267
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,849
What cheating?

268
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,430
Saying that is discrediting us!

269
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,009
Well, it can clearly be seen that it's 5,

270
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,520
but you wrote just 4 though.

271
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,380
How the hell could this not be called cheating?

272
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,249
Hey, watch your mouth, Young Man.

273
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,039
Hey, we've been doing business for a long time and there's never been any problems.

274
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,409
Who the hell are you to stick your nose in?

275
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,609
Well, it's obviously seen as wrong.

276
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,659
How about this? Let's weigh it again.

277
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:28,570
And I'll get my phone to take pictures as evidence of everything.

278
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,049
If it doesn't match with what's written,

279
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,050
we'll go to the police station together.

280
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,739
Then there's no need to buy or sell it anymore you bastard! You can just take it all back!!

281
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:41,710
You! Hey, stop!

282
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,649
Khru Tian! Khru Tian! Khru Tian!

283
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:47,009
Dad! Dad! Help Khru Tian!

284
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,080
-Khru Tian!
-Stop! Stop! Let go!

285
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,700
-Let go of me!
-Hey! Stop!

286
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,249
- Damn it! You're damn nosey!
- Hey! Hey, stop!
- Khru Tian!

287
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,099
What's so great about you, asshole?

288
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,633
Khru Tian! Khru...Tian...

289
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,040
Chief! Chief is here.

290
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,670
Go! Go! Go!

291
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,490
The tea leaves! Oh no!

292
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,029
Are you alright, Khru?

293
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,180
I'm alright.

294
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,059
Chief! Go capture them!

295
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,089
They tried to cheat the villagers though!

296
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,139
Cheating is cheating!

297
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,369
But it's not your place to handle it yourself!

298
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,779
If I hadn't come in time, what would you have done?

299
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,859
So you want me to just stand still and watch the villagers get scammed then?

300
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,110
And what you just did, does it even help them?

301
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,810
Tian.

302
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,109
A smart guy like you…

303
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,109
can find a better way to help them than by using violence.

304
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,449
Plucking actual tea leaves isn't like in the movies at all!

305
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,149
It's still pretty to take pictures,

306
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,829
but I wouldn't be able to stay longer than three hours.

307
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:56,569
Even now, I still can't tell the differences between Oolong and Assam tea trees.

308
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,259
They all look the same.

309
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,939
But the tea flowers smell pretty nice.

310
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,490
I just found out that they can be used to make perfumes too.

311
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,013
Tian!

312
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,999
What's the matter?

313
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,189
What are you here to yell at me for now?

314
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,440
Didn't I already say that I was sorry?

315
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,350
Are you hurt anywhere?

316
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,863
Huh?

317
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,270
I asked for medicine to be brought by Dr. Nam for you.

318
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,100
Please send Phi Mor my thanks then.

319
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,823
And what about me then?

320
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,853
Thank you.

321
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,020
Whenever you're looking for trouble, try to speak softly like this too.

322
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,710
Didn't you say you didn't come here for a lecture?

323
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,069
Here.

324
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,503
Hey!

325
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,170
Give it here. I'll do it myself.

326
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,470
Be gentle. It hurts.

327
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,480
Does it hurt anywhere else?

328
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,559
It hurts on my head here.

329
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,810
I don't know if I cracked my head or not.

330
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,309
- Come here.
- Hm?

331
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,810
Bring your head here. I'll check it for you.

332
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,489
Find anything?

333
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,123
It's cracked though.

334
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,749
Take off your shirt.

335
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,159
What?

336
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,893
Why take it off?

337
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,650
So I can look for you and see if you have any other wounds.

338
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,640
I'm alright now. There aren't any.

339
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,590
What did I teach you?

340
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,550
Thank you!

341
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,990
You can go back now. Go. I'm going to go to sleep now.

342
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,120
Did I say that I would go back?

343
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,000
You're being funny now, Chief.

344
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,410
Why would you sleep over here?

345
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,970
Well didn't you see what those guys were like?

346
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,560
Fortunate or not, they might come back tonight to get back at you.

347
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,000
Are you sure that you don't want me to stay over with you?

348
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,720
If you're not afraid, then suit yourself.

349
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Hey! Hey! Wait!

350
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,280
So how would we sleep then?

351
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,963
You can't sleep?

352
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,073
No.

353
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,170
Before going to bed, did you set up the mosquito net like I taught you?

354
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,179
I did it already.

355
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,079
When sleeping over at someone else's place, can you not nag so much?

356
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,709
Can't you see that the mosquito net is old?

357
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,610
It's full of holes.

358
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,463
Tian.

359
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,470
What did you have for dinner?

360
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,090
Pad Kana and Kai Jieow.
[T/N: Stir fried Chinese broccoli and Thai omelette]

361
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,803
Why do you ask?

362
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,470
I wanted to talk with you.

363
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,930
So you know how to speak nicely too.

364
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,110
Tian, what kind of person do you see me as?

365
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,503
Strict.

366
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,510
Strict with me only.

367
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,109
You're stubborn.

368
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,660
If you're stubborn, then I need to be strict.

369
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,079
Don't be stubborn.

370
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,980
That way I'll speak nicely.

371
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,693
Are you cold?

372
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,673
Not really.

373
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,423
Liar.

374
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,530
Just say whatever you feel then.

375
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,179
It's better that you cover yourself. I'm already used to the cold.

376
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,960
Thank you, Chief.

377
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,880
You'll freeze to death.

378
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,890
Are you worried about me?

379
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,099
What? I'm going to sleep now.

380
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:07,269
If I wake up late tomorrow and end up teaching late, you'll scold me again.

381
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,390
Tomorrow is the weekend though.

382
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,340
Oh... Right...

383
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,970
Do you want to continue talking?

384
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,000
What did eat for dinner this evening?

385
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,183
How is it?

386
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,950
Can it beat your bread and sunny-side-up eggs at home?

387
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,593
It can't.

388
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,440
The breakfast at home can't beat this at all.

389
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,150
Aren't you going to leave some for me?

390
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,539
Being a chief...then you must sacrifice, isn't that right?

391
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,270
I'm not such a hero like that.

392
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,070
Here. I'll share it with you.

393
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,153
You can go ahead and eat it.

394
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,670
I can give mine to you.

395
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,903
That's good then.

396
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,550
I'm going to go take a bath first, alright?

397
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,800
What are you searching for?

398
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,470
I ran out of clean, of course.

399
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,623
Here.

400
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,250
It's my shirt. You can wear it for now.

401
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,199
This is a forest ranger shirt though.

402
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,839
If I wear it, wouldn't it be illegal?

403
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:24,773
It is not.

404
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:27,980
The officers' wives here wear them out pretty often.

405
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,140
I am not your wife though!

406
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,480
Do you want to wear it or not?

407
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,599
What are you waiting for?

408
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,300
Do laundry.

409
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,583
Here.

410
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,899
Do you really know how to wash clothes, Khru?

411
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,259
I think you should let my wife wash them for you instead.

412
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,809
Oh, no way, Khama.

413
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,580
Just letting me borrow this makes me feel so bad.

414
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,499
That's good then.

415
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,530
I also have to do my own laundry.

416
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,720
Thank you, Khama.

417
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,729
You have to do your own laundry because you don't have a wife yet.

418
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,369
Therefore, you need to at least find a wife, Chief.

419
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,209
Oh, Khama. No thanks.

420
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,529
Someone like me lives with the forest and mountains.

421
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:28,829
Who would want to be with me?

422
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,830
Then Khru Tian can help you find someone.

423
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,100
I can't give recommendations, Khama.

424
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,600
I don't know what exactly is the Chief's type.

425
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,460
I'll be going first, Khama.

426
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,359
- I'll be going first, Khama.
- Ah, sure, sure.

427
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,420
Here. I'll help.

428
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:16,569
- Do it like this.
- Hey, hey, hey!

429
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:18,839
If you do it like that, my shirt will be ruined then.

430
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,849
It's pretty expensive too.

431
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,439
Are you crazy?

432
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,030
I'll do it myself.

433
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:23,889
If it's expensive but not durable like this,

434
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,869
why would you pay so much for it?

435
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,970
You are nagging again.

436
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,110
Do as you please then.

437
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,550
Oh? Hey!

438
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,570
Here. I'll help.

439
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,829
Chief!

440
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,639
What the hell are you doing?

441
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,269
Well, I saw that you were feeling hot though.

442
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,629
And don't forget to return the bucket to Khama too.

443
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,580
I'll be heading back to my unit first.

444
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,639
Hey! Where are you going?

445
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,140
Hey! Chief! Wait a second!

446
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,540
Hey! You giant!

447
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,310
Uh… Sir...

448
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,559
Khama?

449
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,339
Yes?

450
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,940
I came to return the bucket.

451
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,399
Just how exactly did you do laundry?

452
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,670
You're soaking wet all over.

453
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:39,940
Oh! Do you have any dry clothes to wear for now?

454
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,099
Ah, I get it now.

455
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:48,549
That's why Chief Phupha told me to prepare traditional clothes for you too.

456
00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:50,280
So this is why.

457
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,980
Wait just a moment.

458
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,429
Here. This is Ai Longtae's.

459
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,300
I think that you should be able to fit it perfectly, Khru.

460
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,330
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

461
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,719
Khama?

462
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,170
The incident with the tea yesterday,

463
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,100
I apologize.

464
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,919
Oh... Right, I also happened to want to talk about this matter as well, Khru.

465
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,059
This evening, come and meet me at the village square.

466
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:34,579
I have a matter I'd like to consult with you, Khru.

467
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,029
Actually, you can talk about it right now.

468
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,839
Let's leave it to the evening instead.

469
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,060
It's quite a formal talk. Okay?

470
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,393
Alright then.

471
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,369
So, Dude? Have you decided?

472
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,330
I don't know.

473
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,979
Which one should I pick?

474
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:12,830
They are both nice.

475
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,840
I think I'll go for this one instead.

476
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,639
- I'll sell it to you.
- I don't want it.

477
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,069
It's 5,000. Take it or leave it.

478
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:35,279
- Five thousand?
- Yeah.

479
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:37,179
Damn it, Dude. That's one hell of a deal.

480
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,939
- So do you want it, dude?
- Yeah, I want it..

481
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:40,750
Yeah, that's it.

482
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,760
Nong Tian! Nong Tian!

483
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,653
Nong Tian.

484
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,019
- Oh, P' Rang.
- I came here to take you to see Khama.

485
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,639
Oh, right.

486
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,073
Wow.

487
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,239
Oh, wow. You became a kid from the hills.

488
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:29,629
- Wow.
-Do I look good, Phi?

489
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,339
Not as much as me though.

490
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,629
I'm the most handsome within these ten thousand kilometers.

491
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,309
Come on. Shall we go now?

492
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,970
Let's go, Phi.

493
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,269
Just follow me, I'll take you there.

494
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:45,269
Yeah, it's pretty nice tonight, right?

495
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,199
It happens to be a moonlit night.

496
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,820
The moon. The moon. Isn't it pretty?

497
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,180
Ah, the waxing moon.

498
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,769
Right, P'Rang, did you know?

499
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:00,379
I hadn't looked up to look at the moon like this for a long time now, Phi.

500
00:42:00,379 --> 00:42:01,799
It's pretty, right?

501
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,949
Oh! Right!

502
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,449
Around where you live there are only lights from the skyscrapers, right?

503
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:10,200
And all the traffic lights at the intersections, Phi.

504
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,759
They are not as beautiful as the moonlight.

505
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,529
Yeah, isn't it strange?

506
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,789
City people want to see the moonlight,

507
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,590
while hill people want to see the city lights.

508
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,220
Isn't it flipped?

509
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:31,129
Right, Phi, do you know what it is that Khama wants to talk to me about?

510
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,889
I don't know, but I reckon it'll be pretty important though

511
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,940
because he's the village chief.

512
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,599
But it's alright. No need to be serious.

513
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,880
Now that you live here, you are his people.

514
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,559
Oh! I completely forgot!

515
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,539
I forgot to turn off the electric generator!

516
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,929
You can probably go without me.

517
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,489
Walk there and turn left to go into the dense forest.

518
00:42:56,489 --> 00:42:59,119
It's a bit dark but the shortest route.

519
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,839
You'll be fine. Just walk there. I have to go now or else the chief will kill me.

520
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,299
- Hey! P'Rang, wait!
- I gotta go first! I gotta go first!

521
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:45,620
­Come up here.­­

522
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,259
Well...

523
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:59,629
Everyone at Pha Pun Dao sees that, Khru…

524
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:03,259
you have been with us for quite some time already.

525
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,159
So we've gathered together

526
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,789
to hold a blessing event for you, Khru Tian.

527
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:16,250
and to officially welcome you to our village.

528
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:23,150
But I just caused problems.

529
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,219
As for that matter,

530
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,779
all villagers already understand very well that you, Khru

531
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,609
are concerned for the villagers and have good intentions.

532
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,159
The villagers also know that if it they didn't have you, Khru

533
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,439
then the villagers would've been taken advantage of continually til who knows when.

534
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:46,299
Therefore on behalf of all the villagers of Pha Pun Dao,

535
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:52,610
with this opportunity, we'd all like to thank you, Khru Tian, very much.

536
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,970
Thank you, Khama.

537
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:02,189
From now on, I wish you to live well with happiness,

538
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,899
good health and prosperity from now on, Khru.

539
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:11,789
Here, all of us villagers here at Pha Pun Dao welcome you to our village. Right?

540
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:14,070
Welcome!

541
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,260
Thank you.

542
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,949
Thank you so much, everyone.

543
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,910
Thank you.

544
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,079
Alright then.

545
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,559
Now our host is ready.

546
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,939
And we've all started to get hungry now,

547
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:38,149
But not hungry for food though... Hungry for home-brewed whiskey!

548
00:46:38,149 --> 00:46:40,410
Alright!

549
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,760
- I'm parched.
-So parched!

550
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,560
Today, our Phaphirun forest rangers are the hosts of welcoming Khru! Yay!

551
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:57,320
-Let's go!
- Go on! Go on!

552
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,369
Alright, alright. Come on. Extend your hand out, alright?

553
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,619
Uh...which side?

554
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,150
The right hand rids bad luck. Tying it on the left hand brings in good luck.

555
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,319
Thank you, Mr. Tian, for choosing to come here,

556
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,830
even though you know that it's uncomfortable. Right?

557
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,829
I have no problem living here, Khama.

558
00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:21,039
Sure, I hope so.

559
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,570
Alright. Go ahead. Go ahead.

560
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:31,100
Then I hope that you stay here happy and healthy, Nong Tian.

561
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,990
Thank you, Phi, for ditching me in the middle of way though.

562
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,650
Then, Khru, I hope that you'll be able to live here and can adapt quickly.

563
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,639
-Thank you, Chang.
- Sure.

564
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,179
I have plenty of things I'll have to bother you with, Chang.

565
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,680
Happy to oblige. If you need anything, just let me know!

566
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,950
He's got you now.

567
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,299
- Nong Tian.
- Yes?

568
00:47:59,299 --> 00:48:03,020
Anyway, I'll leave the kids in your care, alright?

569
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,109
Both the little kids...and the big kid.

570
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,110
What's there to be taken care of?

571
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,829
- Thank you, Phi.
- Then it's considered that the blessing ceremony is done, right?

572
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:31,319
Now it's time for a fun night of celebration.

573
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,030
Party time!

574
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,170
Let's go, go, go!

575
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,610
The elders, our party is outside.

576
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:01,819
See?

577
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:04,220
You only have an attitude with me.

578
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,460
So what position do you have then?

579
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,190
Your guardian, of course.

580
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,130
Is that still not enough?

581
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,680
I would've thought you were some family's son-in-law.

582
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,890
Not yet.

583
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:30,669
I still haven't fond someone I'm fond of yet.

584
00:49:30,669 --> 00:49:32,403
But almost.

585
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,440
You used such an old term.

586
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,499
Well, I'm someone who's old though.

587
00:49:39,499 --> 00:49:42,200
That's why I can give you a blessed string bracelet.

588
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,090
Just think of this place as your home.

589
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:48,180
Stay here together for a long long time.

590
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,653
In the past,

591
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,380
I had never called any place home

592
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:17,110
because I had considered all the forests to be my home.

593
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,520
Until I met this place.

594
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,070
That's why I can dare to truly call this place home.

595
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:44,240
Just look at those guys's smiles.

596
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:49,940
I think it's more important than a "home" that's a shelter.

597
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,260
Where we feel safe and happy,

598
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:58,700
that place is home.

599
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,740
I think I understand what it means now.

600
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:26,670
This is the first time I've seen you smile like that towards me.

601
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,039
You, too.

602
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,590
You just love to pull a stern face.

603
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,690
So what face do you want me to make?

604
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,539
Mr. Host!

605
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,359
Come on. Now our party is ready.

606
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,329
The food is already on the table.

607
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:54,989
- Are you ready to get wasted yet?
- Let's go.

608
00:51:54,989 --> 00:51:57,050
You're ready, right? If you're ready, then let's go!

609
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,503
- Here we go!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-5-5

610
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,023
Goodbye.

611
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,119
At first, I thought that you'd be bigger than this, Phi.

612
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,339
We're about the same size though, Phi.

613
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:23,249
That shirt, my mom gave it to me as a gift for passing the university entrance exam.

614
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,583
Are you Longtae?

615
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:31,953
That's right, Phi.

616
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,290
And you are…

617
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,069
P'Tian!

618
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,403
Yeah.

619
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,030
My dad told me so much about you.

620
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:50,970
If you need anything, Phi, you can just tell me.

621
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,870
Longtae, did you know?

622
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,459
Ever since I came to live here, I've heard that phrase about ten times already.

623
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,069
Then let's change it to...

624
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:07,710
If I need anything, I'll let you know instead.

625
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,600
Yeah, sure.

626
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,700
They're having such a blast.

627
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,019
Huh? Are you alright, Chang?

628
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,809
I'm alright!

629
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:22,609
Come on. Go join us over there.

630
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:25,670
- We're waiting for you! Come on! Come on!
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

631
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,440
I'll go first!

632
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,659
Come on, Khru! Come, Ai Tae! Ai Tae, come!

633
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,099
Chang, walk straight then!

634
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:33,740
We're here now!

635
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,819
Cheers!

636
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,850
Make a toast for Khru Tian!

637
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:47,839
Bottoms up. Gotta drink bottoms up.

638
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:52,869
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up. Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

639
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:55,380
Just watch. Just watch.

640
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,160
Are you alright, Khru?

641
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:10,340
I'm totally fine.

642
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:19,890
Give it here. I'll open it for you.

643
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,800
If an elder opens it for you, then don't waste their sincerity.

644
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,799
Hey! Let's change the vibe a bit!

645
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,319
I think it's too quiet!

646
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:55,369
- Be careful, Chang!
- Be careful of falling!

647
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:57,710
- Are you drunk?
- Watch your head!

648
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,230
- Hey, Chang. Dude!
- Where are you going?

649
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,763
Shush.

650
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,489
Hello? Hello?

651
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,090
Ah, hello, everyone!

652
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,270
Tonight, we have a big sponsor.

653
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:24,159
We have Karaoke and an electric generator from Phaphirun Unit!

654
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,660
Courtesy of our very own Chief Phu!

655
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:33,279
All right! Up next then!

656
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,899
I'd like to invite Chief Phu to come up and sing a song

657
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,600
in honor of Khru Nong Tian!

658
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,960
Alright, a round of applause for the Chief!

659
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:56,110
Come on, Chief. Khru Nong Tian, prepare to listen carefully, alright?

660
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,320
Is the Chief smiling?

661
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,159

Tian.

677
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:25,340
Tian. Stay still!

678
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,340
- Let go...
-Tian.

679
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,960
Tian, stay still.

680
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,700
Chief, you're scolding me again.

681
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:41,270
You can't scold anyone else, right?

682
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:44,200
So that's why you like to scold me instead.

683
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,773
Right?

684
00:57:46,773 --> 00:57:48,413
Am I right?

685
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:51,099
No wonder.

686
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,620
That's why the Chief doesn't have a wife.

687
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:58,219
The Chief doesn't have a wife.

688
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,879
You're talking too much already.

689
00:58:00,879 --> 00:58:04,119
Who said I was scolding you? I'm smiling right now though.

690
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:07,363
- You're smiling?
-Yeah.

691
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:09,689
This is you smiling already?

692
00:58:09,689 --> 00:58:10,859
That's right.

693
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:15,750
Where? I don't see you smiling at all, Chief.

694
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:20,320
To smile, you gotta smile like this.

695
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:25,359
Smile. Like this.

Here. I'll teach you how you're supposed to smile.

698
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,430
- Tian.
- Stay still.

699
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,960
To smile, you smile like this.

- What?

701
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,530

01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,153
Hey, Chief.

704
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,960
Why are you so strict?

705
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:18,230
You like to make a stern face like a fierce dog.

706
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:21,079
You like to make a face like a giant too.

707
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,080
So am I a dog or a giant?

708
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,130
You're a giant dog.

709
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,849
A giant black dog.

710
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:32,069
A big black dog.

711
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,670
You black dog.

712
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,879
If I'm a black dog, what dog would you be?

713
01:00:37,879 --> 01:00:39,433
Me?

714
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,540
I'm a Pomeranian.

715
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,669
A teeny Pomeranian.

716
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:47,970

You're actually pretty handsome...if you don't make a stern face.

723

You're even more handsome than me.

724

Chief Phupha and Khru Torfun, were the two of them…
