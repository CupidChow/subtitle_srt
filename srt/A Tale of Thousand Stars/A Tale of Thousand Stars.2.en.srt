What happened to me?

00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:09,244
You've just undergone a heart transplant.

00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:11,676
I want to know who gave me this miracle.

00:00:11,676 --> 00:00:17,143
Miss Torfun Chareonpon. Volunteer teacher, Sangthong Aid Foundation.

00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:21,036
Chief, this is Khru Tian, the new volunteer teacher.

00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,869
Excuse me, I came to apply to be a volunteer teacher.

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,790
We're closed today. Why don't you come again on Monday, alright?

10
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,913
Hey, young man.

11
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,289
Are you in a rush?

12
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,440
Can you help me carry this?

13
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,013
Sure.

14
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,150
Place it over there, son. Come on.

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,060
There. Thanks.

16
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,499
Come and wash your hands. Here.

17
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,033
Over here.

18
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,329
Thank you.

19
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,163
All done.

20
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,830
Sorry that I've made your hands all dirty.

21
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,470
Don't mind it.

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,300
So you want to be a teacher?

23
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,053
Yes, Sir.

24
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,670
Then come and follow me.

25
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,770
Here. This is the application form.

26
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,089
Where did you graduate from?

27
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,089
I'm currently studying Engineering,

28
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:46,039
but I'm taking a break at the moment. And this…

29
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,190
is the confirmation of my academic leave.

30
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,810
Hmm... Your last name is somewhat familiar.

31
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,810
Like I might've seen it in the newspaper before.

32
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,259
My father used to be the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.

33
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,879
If it's like that, you don't need to be a teacher and tire yourself out.

34
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,679
Just your snack money for one month alone

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,930
can pay a volunteer teacher for a whole year.

36
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,469
But that's my family's money, not mine.

37
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,840
And where do you want to go to teach?

38
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,020
Pha Pun Dao village, Sir.

39
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,480
Wow. Do you know how very difficult it is there?

40
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,230
Yes, I've heard a little about it.

41
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,910
Then that must mean you've lived somewhere without a water supply and electricity before, right?

42
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,583
Never, sir.

43
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,109
Have you ever cooked for yourself?

44
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,843
Never, Sir.

45
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,170
Then how about this,

46
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,150
Have you ever lived without a servant?

47
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,623
Never, Sir.

48
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,749
You know what?

49
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,960
Just bringing a teacher up there is not an easy matter.

50
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,780
There are expenses.

51
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,819
And there are also people who have to sacrifice their time to look after them.

52
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,239
If you think you can go up there briefly and then just head on down,

53
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:40,679
it'll become a waste of time for both sides.

54
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,139
If you want to take a picture to post on social media,

55
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,540
or to put it your portfolio resume,

56
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,530
I think that you should go somewhere more comfortable than this, no?

57
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,943
No, Sir.

58
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,810
It has to be this place only.

59
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,370

Khru, why are baby chickens called "chicks" (look jiap)?

138
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:29,789
Well, it's because chicks cry out "jiap jiap". 
[T/N: "Jiap" is the sound of chirping in Thai]

139
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,639
Huh? Then why are baby frogs called "tadpoles"?

140
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,190
And why are baby mosquitoes called "mosquito larvae"?

141

How about this then? I'll go make Kai Jieow for you to eat, alright?

142
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:42,619
And then we can talk later, alright?

143
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,489
Why is an omelette called an "omelette"?
[T/N: Kai Jieow literally means "beaten/whisked eggs"]

144
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:47,609
My, you really do ask so many questions.

145
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,389
Hey, try to cook as well as you do asking me questions, alright?

146
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:54,810
Alright, so what do you want to continue learning today?

147
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,890
What the heck should I do?

148
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,839
How about this instead?

149
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:21,339
I'll have you all draw a picture of your family each and hand it into me.

150
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:22,743
Do you agree?

151
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,250

153

Hand these out to your friends, alright?

Who's this?

155
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,230
Chief Phupha and Khru Torfun, Sir.

156
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,689
Uh...I asked you to draw your family, didn't I?

157
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,849
My father said Chief Phupha and Khru Torfun helped our people a lot

158
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:08,129
So they're part of the same family too.

159
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,149
Then I want to draw Chief Phupha and Miss Torfun too.

160
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:13,289
Let me draw them, too. Give me the green crayon.

161
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,159
Khru, I'm done drawing already.What's next?

162
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,169
Wait just a moment, alright?

163
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:21,960
- Chang, Chang.
- Yes?

164
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,893
Yes?

165
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:25,349
What is the study program here?

166
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:31,869
Oh, here? Well, teacher you'd teach immediately after the national anthem until noon.
[T/N: The Thai national anthem plays nationwide at 8 am]

167
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:34,899
In time to take a noon break for the kiddos to eat lunch and get a drink.

168
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:38,400
And around the afternoon, it'd be recreational activities.

169
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,420
Ah, recreational activities.

170
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:48,379
But if today, you still don't know what to teach then you can let the kiddos go home first.

171
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:51,170
Because today's the first day, right? So it should be fine.

172
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,799
How about this, kids?

173
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,379
After finishing drawing, let's play a game instead.

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,989
I'll act out various animals and have you guys try to guess what animals they are, alright?

175
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,419
Let's start with the first one, alright?

176
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,580
This one. See? This one, this one.

177
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,363
Hey, kids...

178
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,403
Hey...

179
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,100
Hey, where are you guys going?

180
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,610
Where are the kids going, Chang?

181
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:33,769
This is...normal, sir.

182
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:37,059
Especially for Ayi. He...He's the leader of the group.

183
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:41,009
If that kiddo doesn't like to learn, then he just goes home.

184
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,599
It's alright, Khru.

185
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:50,179
Uh...Khru, then... I'd like to excuse myself to go check Ai Tao at the mechanic's.

186
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,080
It should be done now.

187
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,460
I'll be going first then.

188
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,260
You can go home too, Khru!

189
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,189
What else now?

190
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:22,140
Where are all the children?

191
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
They've all gone home already.

192
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,870
At this time?

193
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,299
What do you want to lecture me about now?

194
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,999
Is dragging me here and humiliating me in front of the children not enough?

195
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,729
Do you want me to pack my stuff and just go home?

196
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,263
Pack your stuff.

197
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,710
Hey! Are you serious?

198
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,010
You still haven't showered yet though, right?

199
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,109
Don't tell me that…

200
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,529
That's right.

201
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:11,849
The people here all bathe right here.

202
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,189
Are you able to bathe here?

203
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,349
Or do you need me to take you down into the city to bathe?

204
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,310
No need. I can bathe here.

205
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,929
Go do whatever you need to do.

206
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,289
I also don't want to waste my time guarding you, alright?

207
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:30,859
If not for the fact that the other side of this stream is a vulnerable border with frequent clashes.

208
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:35,219
That's why your foundation wants me to safeguard you. I can leave as you want.

209
00:16:35,219 --> 00:16:37,320
Hey, hey! Hold on, hold on!

210
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,030
It's alright if you stay.

211
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,610
But you don't need to watch me that closely, alright?

212
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,743
Chief.

213
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,020
Have you ever brought young female teachers here?

214
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,500
There've been some. Why?

215
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,410
Then...you must've taken every one of the volunteer teachers up here, right?

216
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,809
No.

217
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,909
Just the ones that like to cause trouble.

218
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:42,220
If they fall in and drown, I'd be in trouble then.

219
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,949
If you're done then hurry up and get out.

220
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,450
I don't have time to look after you all day.

221
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,603
Tian.

222
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,543
Khun.

223
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,853
Tian!

224
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,823
Tian!

225
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,153
Do you hear me?

226
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,423
Khun!

227
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,443
Khun!

228
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,513
Tian!

229
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,069
Tian! Tian!

230
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,059
Tian!

231
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,010
What's up, Chief?

232
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,109
Are you calling me?

233
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,943
Hey, Khun!

234
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:47,200
What?

235
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,029
I wasn't teasing you at all. I just dove in for fun for a bit.

236
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,360
The water is cool, don't you think?

237
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,600
Chief! I've got a cramp! Ouch!

238
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,570
- Khru!
- Oh, Chang.

239
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,309
I brought a lunch box to give to you.

240
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:47,839
Thank you, Chang.

241
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,889
And...where did you all go swimming?

242
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:53,639
I went to go bathe at the waterfall.

243
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,249
Huh?

244
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,739
Well, you have a bathroom right in the back of the house though.

245
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,840
I just asked the villagers to fill in the water tank for you.

246
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,249
Hurry up and get changed.

247
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,669
In the evening, I'll come pick you up to take you to Khama Biang Lae.

248
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,870
He's the village chief here.

249
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,670
Understood, Chief.

250
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,103
Shit!

251
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,899
My apologies, Khru.

252
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:30,080
Chief already told me to fix it, but I forgot.

253
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,780
It's all right, Chang.

254
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,759
It's better to hurry and fix it, Chang.

255
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,160
Or the teacher might end up going back first.

256
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,189
It's alright, Chang.

257
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,190
I'll fix it myself.

258
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,950
Either way, I'm not in a rush to go back anyway,

259
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,993
Khama?

260
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,560
Khama? Khama? I've brought the teacher to see you.

261
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,010
[Birth, Old Age, Sickness, and Death are unavoidable.]
[T/N: Buddhism's First Noble Truth; Thailand is predominantly Buddhist]

262
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,760
(Lanna script)
[T/N: Northern Thailand was once a part of the Lanna Kingdom]

263
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,190
"Birth, Old Age, Sickness, and Death are natural matters."

264
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,480
That is written in the ancient Lanna script.
[ T/N: Northern Thai has its own dialect and traditional alphabet]

265
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,709
- Hello, Sir.
- Hello.

266
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:06,199
I'm Tian, Sir.

267
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,879
I'm a teacher from the foundation.

268
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:10,090
Ah, I see.

269
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:12,379
And what about Khru Fun, Chief?

270
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:15,380
Didn't she say she'd come back up here to continue teaching?

271
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,119
Fun still hasn't finished her business.

272
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,160
So she couldn't make it in time for this term.

273
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,149
That's fine then.

274
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,699
Let's see the new teacher. Yeah, your arms and muscles are pretty good.

275
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,409
You're still young and well-built.

276
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:34,119
So how is it? Have you met the students yet?

277
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,520
Oh, I just taught my first day, Sir.

278
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,910
The kids all seem pretty cute.

279
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,349
You don't need to fake praise at all.

280
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,530
Every one of those kiddos are like rambunctious devils.

281
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,520
But don't worry about it. You'll get used to them after some time.

282
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,639
Pork Laab, Sai-Ua, and Gaeng Hung Ley.
[T/N: Northern Thai dishes- Spicy minced pork salad, Northern Thai sausages, and Northern Pork Curry]

283
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:00,519
Honey, what else do we have?

284
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,029
Oh, we have a lot.

285
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,619
Do you still have anything else to serve, Honey?

286
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,559
Is there anything else? Bring it all out.

287
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,699
Oh, here.

288
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:12,429
Today, my wife prepared a huge feast, a full-course, just for you Khru!

289
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:13,909
Go ahead. Help yourself.

290
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:16,819
The menu here is special. Very special.

291
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:18,409
Especially this one right here.

292
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,919
It's not easy to have this dish, you know? Here!

293
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,553
Yes, Sir.

294
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,473
Wow.

295
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,980
Is this Kai Toon?
[T/N: Steamed egg]

296
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:36,220
It's pig brain. Oink, oink!

297
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,719
How is it? How's the taste?

298
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,650
It's strangely good.

299
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,159
Your body accepts the new heart quite well.

300
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,709
But however, your body considers it to be something strange and foreign still.

301
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:59,889
So you need to take medication to suppress so that there won't be any rejection.

302
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:02,929
Here. Take them every day at the same time.

303
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:05,819
You must not skip them, not even one day. Do you understand?

304
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,653
Yes, Sir.

305
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:10,009
And this medicine has side effects, alright?

306
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:12,779
It'll weaken your immune system.

307
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,179
Therefore, from now on, you must stay in hygienic places.

308
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,389
and only eat foods that are healthy and benefit your body.

309
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,700
All those foods that are spicy and extremely seasoned are absolutely prohibited.

310
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,939
This is Gaeng Hung Ley. And this is Tam Kanun.
[T/N: Northern Thai pork curry and Spicy Jackfruit Salad]

311
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:29,559
Pork Laab, Sai-Ua.
[T/N: Spicy minced pork salad and Northern Thai sausage]

312
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,110
Are you able to eat them?

313
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,500
I can. I can, Sir.

314
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,699
I think…

315
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,599
I think...let's have Kai Jieow instead!

316
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,069
There's no need, Khama.

317
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,329
The teacher can eat them for sure.

318
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,080
There are only delicious things.

319
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,730
Yes, I can eat them.

320
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,700
Good. He seems to enjoy our food.

321
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,999
Khru, I'd like to ask you a little something, alright?

322
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:16,030
Khru, have you ever been here before?

323
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,881
I never have, Sir.

324
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:21,859
Never?

325
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:28,209
It's strange. I feel very strange. I have this feeling like I feel very familiar with you.

326
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:31,540
It's probably just all in my head.

327
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:37,339
Another thing is… Khru, I think you're probably around the same age as my son.

328
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:43,469
My son, Ai Longtae, is studying at the university over in the city.

329
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,089
If he comes home this weekend,

330
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,769
I'll tell him to take you around the village.

331
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,219
There are many interesting places to see.

332
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,339
What kind of places do you like to go to?

333
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,880
Waterfalls, do you like them? Do you like waterfalls?

334
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,560
There's someone who already took me there, Sir.

335
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,073
Really?

336
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,179
- By the way, Khama?
- Yes?

337
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:12,719
Is Pha Pun Dao cliff far from here?

338
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:16,189
Pha Pun Dao cliff isn't far,

339
00:26:16,189 --> 00:26:19,579
but it's also not near. But the path there is really difficult.

340
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,819
It has to be Longtae. Longtae, my son, he's very familiar with the route.

341
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,809
- If he comes home I'll ask him to take you to the cliff, alright?
- Yes, Sir.

342
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:34,729
But, Khru, if you're in a rush to go up there first...then it has to be this guy!

343
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:37,449
It has to be Chief Phu. Chief Phupa can take you there first.

344
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:43,039
Because Chief Phu is very familiar with the area!

345
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,930
With the Chief, I wouldn't dare to bother him.

346
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,469
No need, no need to be afraid. Go ahead and bother him.

347
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,459
Just bother him. Go ahead and just bother him.

348
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:55,819
The Chief is always bothered by the villagers already.

349
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,619
Whenever any of the villagers have problems, they always bother the Chief too.

350
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:02,999
Because the Chief is able to solve just about any problem for the villagers.

351
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,659
Even though I'm the village chief,

352
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,219
I'm about to quit already!

353
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,429
You are exaggerating, Khama.

354
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,930
I'm not.

355
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,630
He's great, great.

356
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,770
I just found out that forest rangers have to walk and send volunteer teachers all the way home?

357
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,709
Who said I was going to send you?

358
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,860
This is the way to my base.

359
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,699
Didn't you say you'd never been here before?

360
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,100
So how do you know about Pha Pun Dao cliff?

361
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,099
Well, because I have to come teach here,

362
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:41,979
I'd have to research beforehand, right?

363
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,439
There are plenty of other places. Why did you choose to do it here?

364
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,470
I just happened to arrive home.

365
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,939
Anyway, thank you for walking me home.

366
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,373
Wait.

367
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,263
What now?

368
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,949
What did you do?

369
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,269
Why are there so many red spots on you?

370
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,720
These?

371
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,199
I was attacked by the mosquitoes in your village, of course.

372
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:16,949
Had I known, I would have brought some mosquito repellent from Bangkok.

373
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,749
Hey, don't tell me that...

374
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,659
You didn't use the mosquito net.

375
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,069
The mosquito net?

376
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:23,799
There's a mosquito net too?

377
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:26,000
It's hanging in in the corner of your room.

378
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,180
You know how to set it up, right?

379
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,583
Let me seriously ask you... Is there anything you can actually do?

380
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,383
Do it like this.

381
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,699
Do you understand?

382
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,219
Yeah.

383
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,120
Here, try doing it.

384
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,663
This?

385
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,329
- Where to hang it?
- The nail up there.

386
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,503
How to tie it?

387
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,643
Come here.

388
00:29:24,643 --> 00:29:26,690
It's like this.

389
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,099
With just that, it's done.

390
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,959
All that's left is...

391
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,629
If you're afraid of mosquitos getting through,

392
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:05,640
grab the edge of the net and tuck it in under the mattress.

393
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,523
Like this.

394
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,639
Huh? But wouldn't that be like trapping the mosquitos inside the net?

395
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:22,889
If there are any mosquitos inside, you can just use your pillow to swat them out.

396
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:28,220
And then tuck the edge of the net in again.

397
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,249
Like this.

398
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,199
You can do it, right?

399
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,649
Then it's...just about finished, right?

400
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:39,183
That's right.

401
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,210
Thank you so much, Chief.

402
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,559
Chief, you're just so amazing.

403
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,900
Hey, you. I'm not your friend.

404
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,370
Don't take everything out here lightly.

405
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,019
Then why don't you try setting it up yourself?

406
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,889
Hey, come on!

407
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,329
Well, you already just tied it up. Why would you take it down?

408
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,480
So you can try it yourself.

409
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,543
Here.

410
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,133
If you don't go to bed early...you might just meet something.

411
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,170
You don't need to frighten me. I'm not scared.

412
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,309
Why didn't you write a warning that your chief is as fierce as a dog.

413
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,240
Why do I have to go now?

414
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,139
In horror movies, we tend to hear dogs howling when a character is alone at night.

415
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:35,650
But here, it's so quiet that I feel that it'd be better to hear howling, at least.

416
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,290
[Phaphirun Unit]

417
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,289
Here.

418
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:32,140
As thanks for helping me tell a story to the children yesterday.

419
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,799
A khlui?
[T/N: Thai bamboo flute]

420
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,269
Yeah.

421
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,220
Well, Dr. Nam told me that you knew how to play it.

422
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,699
Didn't you even win first place in a contest?

423
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,179
Play it for me.

424
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,880
I forgot it all already.

425
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,220
Chief. No way. Play it for me first.1

426
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,229
I really did forget it all.

427
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:55,430
No way, I want to listen to it.

428
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,470
Yeah, I know already, Chief. Just a sec.

429
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,750
Why are you knocking so much?

430
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,739
I hear you, Chief (Hua Na).
[T/N: "Hua" means "head"]

431
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:22,729
Oh.

432
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,960
Uh... The Chief isn't available, so it's this head.

433
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,509
Could it be this head every day, Chang?

434
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:31,789
Well, that's how it's probably going to be.

435
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:35,989
Because usually, the Chief is busy with work just about every single day.

436
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,309
But yesterday, the Chief put off his work to take care of you instead.

437
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,959
So the unit was totally confused.

438
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,049
Let's go. We should go quickly because the kiddos are waiting.

439
00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:48,310
Let's go, Khru. Come on, come on.

440
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,809
For the most part, the villagers around here plant and grow tea.

441
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:59,239
And I'll let you know, the tea here

442
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:01,339
it's amazingly aromatic too!

443
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:03,040
If you don't believe me…

444
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,940
Here. Smell it.

445
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,109
Wow. It really is aromatic, Chang.

446
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,629
It's the best. I told you.

447
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:14,949
And the second occupation here is sewing.

448
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,929
While the rest may collect mushrooms and herbs for selling.

449
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:24,329
But they can't do much. Because the area around here is close to the border.

450
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,359
- Chang.
- Yes?

451
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:30,449
And where is Pha Pun Dao cliff?

452
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:32,969
Oh, it's actually on this hill.

453
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,839
But it can only be reached by foot.

454
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:37,799
The thing is, the walking path is quite confusing and tricky.

455
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,189
If you are lost and get into Ghost Hill, you're screwed, Khru.

456
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,069
Ghost Hill?

457
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,599
Yes. With Ghost Hill, the villagers here believe that

458
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,149
it houses the guardian spirit of the forest.

459
00:36:53,149 --> 00:36:56,069
If anyone gets lost in there without a permission-asking ritual,

460
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,439
their life could be taken, you know?

461
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,900
Ai Chang!

462
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,079
This damn brat.

463
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,329
Why didn't you wait for me?

464
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,289
I'm this close to you, and still!

465
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,169
What's with the yelling and fussing! You can keep it down, Ai Rang! Geez!

466
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:13,479
Khru, this is Ai Rang. He's another forest ranger at the unit.

467
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:17,530
He'll come and help take care of you in my place when I'm not available, Khru.

468
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,699
- Hello, P'Rang.
- Happy to welcome you, Sir.

469
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:21,879
Yes.

470
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:23,460
So have you introduced him to the villagers?

471
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,040
- No, not yet.
- Really?

472
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,469
- Then I'll introduce him, alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

473
00:37:26,469 --> 00:37:27,589
Then, Ai A first then.

474
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:32,349
Ai A, Ai A. This is the new teacher.

475
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:35,240
- Hello.
- This is Ai A, alright?

476
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,269
Hey, don't mind it.

477
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:44,889
Before this, he wouldn't even look anyone in the face.

478
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,729
People here are friendly.

479
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:50,519
They just don't know you well yet. This kind of thing just takes time.

480
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:55,789
Uh… I heard the kids talk about the previous teacher that's named "Khru Torfun."

481
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:58,290
What kind of person was she?

482
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,260
And what did you hear, Khru?

483
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,139
I just know that I came here after her.

484
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:17,889
Well, Khru Torfun...the thing is, she was here until the end of her term.

485
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:20,119
And she wanted to continue staying here.

486
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,559
Even both the kiddos and the villagers adored her as if she was their family.

487
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:27,063
That's right.

488
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,359
But, Khru...she unfortunately passed away while taking care of business in Bangkok.

489
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,230
Because she was hit by a car.

490
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,750
A good person like her...had such a short life.

491
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,899
Then, the villagers here must be terribly sad.

492
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:48,119
About that...the villagers don't even know yet.

493
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,629
We also don't know when they'll know. The Chief had ordered us not to.

494
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:53,519
Yes, our lips are sealed.

495
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,900
Yes, I also feel sorry for the villagers for not knowing the truth.

496
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:06,920
Oh...what me and Ai Rang said, it wasn't to pressure you, Khru.

497
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:13,199
But me and Ai Rang here believe that either way you'll win the hearts of the villagers

498
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,380
just like Khru Torfun did for sure.

499
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,009
That's right, that's right.

500
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,459
It'll be easy.

501
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:19,239
You can do it.

502
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:23,589
Today, I'm going to teach you the Thai alphabet.
[Pha Pun Dao School]

503
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:27,419
How about this? Everyone, once I say something, repeat after me.

504
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,879
Let's start with the first letter.

505
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,410
Gor-Gai like a chicken (Gai).

506
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,689
Gor-Gai like a chicken (Gai).

507
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:34,429
The next letter is…

508
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,899
Kor-Kai like the eggs (hai) in the coop.

509
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,639
Huh? You've already learned it before?

510
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:40,759
Yes, Sir!

511
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,349
Khru Torfun taught us all the way to Hor-Nok Hoo.
[T/N: Last letter in the Thai alphabet]

512
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:47,100
Khru Seetian, you wrote and switched the letters "Do-Dek" and "To-Tao".

513
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,169
What about A-Z? Have you learned them?

514
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:58,420
Yes, Khru Torfun also taught us that already.

515
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,219
This is not as fun as when Miss Torfun taught us.

516
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,399
Khru Seetian, when will Khru Torfun come back?

517
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,749
Then, how about this?

518
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,459
Have you all learned numbers yet?

519
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,900
Khru Torfun also taught us that already.

520
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,100
Oh, hey! Wait, wait a minute!

521
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,310
And has Khru Torfun taken you out on a field trip?

522
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,650
What is a field trip?

523
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:45,440
A field trip is to study outside the classroom.

524
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,399
Uh, Khru, Sir?

525
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,019
Would that be a good idea?

526
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,639
Of course it's good, Chang!

527
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,259
Ai...Ai Rang!

528
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,180
Go talk Khru Tian out of it.

529
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,279
Otherwise, we're going to get chewed out by the Chief.

530
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,479
And why does it have to be me?

531
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,180
It must be you. You are my junior, you must do it.

532
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,410
Uh… Khru Tian, Sir?

533
00:41:07,379 --> 00:41:09,109
I have an errand to run.

534
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:13,089
A pig at the base has diarrhea. I have to check on it first!

535
00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:14,910
- Ai Rang!
- It's a really important errand!

536
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,269
You little…

537
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,159
Who wants to go to the waterfall? Put your hands up!

538
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,349
Khru, me! Khru, me! Me! Me!

539
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:22,459
Let's go! Follow me.

540
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:24,489
Come on, Ai Chang.

541
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,620
-Let's go to the waterfall. Let's go, let's go!
-Let's go to the waterfall!

542
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,553
Try breathing in a bit.

543
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:39,209
I think that your overall condition

544
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:41,560
it's actually okay now, man.

545
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,800
If other patients could recover as fast as you do, I think it'd be great!

546
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,750
Oh, right! And that new volunteer teacher of yours, how is he?

547
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,383
"Of mine"?

548
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,670
Well, I mean that he's under your care.

549
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:02,999
I heard that on his first day of teaching,

550
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:05,829
you drove and picked him up all the way to his house.

551
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:09,340
Normally, I've never seen you make such an effort like this.

552
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,319
I'm just worried about the kids.

553
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,020
And that "kid", is there anything to be worried about?

554
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,719
Well, it's as you can see,

555
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,299
A picky eater and can't adjust.

556
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,319
He probably won't last more than a week.

557
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,489
Oh, well who could beat that Nong Tongfun of yours.

558
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:30,210
That one, she was ready to be a daughter-in-law here already.

559
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,370
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

560
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,740
I was just joking.

561
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,319
You don't need to worry about Nong Tongfun, man.

562
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,570
I think that by now, she's probably become an angel already.

563
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,220
What's more worrisome is that you should worry about the one under your care.

564
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:03,039
I still find it strange. A young master like that...why the heck would he come up to a difficult place like this?

565
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,789
Dead, dead. I'm totally going to be dead.

566
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:10,189
If Chief Phu knows that I played along with you

567
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:13,289
and brought the kiddos on a walk like this, I'll be dead for sure.

568
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,689
Who said I brought the kids here for a walk, Chang?

569
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,719
I brought the kids to learn.

570
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,199
Alright, kids. Do you see the trees?

571
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,569
What color are the trees?

572
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,739
"See khieow."

573
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,990
Do you know what "See khieow" in English is?

574
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,079
You guys don't know it, right?

575
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,150
"See khieow" in English is "green."

576
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,510
Green.

577
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,100
Yeah, repeat after me. Green.

578
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,589
Green.

579
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:40,419
And Ayi's hair, what color is it?

580
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,589
"See dum."

581
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,119
"See dum" in English is "black."

582
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:45,690
Black?

583
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,679
That's right.

584
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:48,729
Black. Repeat after me. Black.

585
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,163
Black.

586
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,939
Come here, come here.

587
00:43:52,939 --> 00:43:55,039
Chang, come here. Come here.

588
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,679
Ah, there! That flower is "see leuang."

589
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:01,369
In English, it's called "yellow."

590
00:44:01,369 --> 00:44:03,049
Yellow?

591
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,249
Here. The clouds that are "see khao", it's called "white."

592
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:07,380
- White?
- White.

593
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,480
- White? White?
- White.

594
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,329
- White.
- White? White!

595
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:15,669
Come on. Kids, let's go to the waterfall instead.

596
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,459
How about this? Along the way, we'll go over it again.

597
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,359
- "See dam" is?
- Black!

598
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:22,229
Hey, very good!

599
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,529
"See leuang"?

600
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,940
- White.
- Yellow!

601
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,100
Oh, come on, Khao Neung.

602
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,300
We've now arrived at "nam tok." Yay!

603
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:40,110
Kids, "Nam tok" in English is "waterfall."

604
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,559
Waterfall.

605
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,019
Alright, say it one more time. Waterfall.

606
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:48,060
- Waterfall.
- Star 2.

607
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,209
Star 2. This is Eagle. Come back to the unit immediately.

608
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:51,469
Roger.

609
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,199
Eagle. This is Star 2.

610
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,579
We are going back now.

611
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,410
Okay. See you at the unit.

612
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,820
Everybody,

613
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,799
it's time now. Let's go.

614
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,319
Let's go home.

615
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,709
What?

616
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:08,830
- We haven't taken a dip yet.
- Come on, Chang! We're here already!

617
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,209
We can't not play!

618
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:12,850
If we don't get to play, it'd be such a pity!

619
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:16,309
Khru Seetian, can we play in the water?

620
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:18,760
Please, Khru!

621
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,769
How about this?

622
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:26,020
Then...promise me first, that if I let you play in the water,

623
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,550
Tomorrow, you can't run off home first. Alright?

624
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,059
Promise!

625
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,990
-Promise!
-Okay. Very good

626
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:37,339
Then, guys...let's go play in the water.

627
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,899
Khru, is this a good idea?

628
00:45:39,899 --> 00:45:40,759
Yes?

629
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,119
Would it be good? It might not be good though.

630
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,879
Of course, it's good, Chang.

631
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,199
It's alright. I'll look after them myself.

632
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,529
Chang, you don't need to worry.

633
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,299
But the Chief ordered me to...

634
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,209
Don't tell him then, Chang.

635
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:54,379
Come on. Nothing will happen, Chang.

636
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:55,889
I'll look after them myself.

637
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:57,790
Chang, you can go ahead and leave first.

638
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,343
Trust me.

639
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:10,929
Can you handle this, Khru?

640
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,359
Absolutely.

641
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,359
Okay.

642
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,793
Fine.

643
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,289
- Please take care of the kiddos.
- Sure.

644
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:20,020
You better be good.

645
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,810
-Yes! Yes!
-Kids, kids!

646
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,989
Come on. Let's go play in the water! Hurry up! Hurry up!

647
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,830
Yay! Come on! Come on!

648
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,190
That's enough!

649
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:44,550
-Enough! Enough!
-Get him, Ai Kalae!

650
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,410
Enough!

651
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,739
- Mr. Seetian.
- Yes?

652
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:55,999
Khru, do you have an English name?

653
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,079
Me? I don't have one.

654
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,460
Huh? How come? "Nam tok" even has one.

655
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,740
You've got a point.

656
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,469
My Thai name is Tian, right?

657
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:12,609
My English name is Tony then.

658
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:14,830
What about Chief Phupha?

659
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,640
Chief Phupha?

660
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,359
This person's is a bit special then.

661
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:27,279
He likes to make a stern face and is always in his uniform.

662
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:28,899
He's so strict too.

663
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,230
So we'll name him "Green Giant" then!

664
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,889
Green Giant.

665
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:38,069
Green Giant means "Yak Khieow".

666
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:41,879
Alright, everyone. Repeat after me, "Green Giant".

667
00:47:41,879 --> 00:47:44,289
Green Giant!

668
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,050
Very good.

669
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,580
Come on, kids. Let's go home.

670
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,219
- Whose bag is this?
- It's mine.

671
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,519
And this one.

672
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,053
Mine!

673
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,319
Geez, Khru! Can't we stay a bit more?

674
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,409
Enough. We can come back another day, okay?

675
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,429
Khru Seetian, tomorrow, I would like to go to the forest.

676
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:18,639
The forest?

677
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,480
Sure! I'll take you everywhere!

678
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,999
Khru! Kalae is drowning! Khru! Khru!

679
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:27,449
-Khru!
-Kalae!
-Hey! Kalae!

680
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:30,000
Kids! Get someone to come help first!

681
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,640
Kalae!

682
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,029
Kalae! Come here!

683
00:48:37,029 --> 00:48:38,563
Kalae!

684
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:45,359
Kalae! Kalae! Kalae!

685
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,920
- Kalae!
- Kalae!

686
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,193
Kalae!

687
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,189
Chang Yod, take care of the other kids too!

688
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,439
- Kalae!
- Kalae!

689
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,743
Kalae! Are you okay?

690
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,099
Kalae!

691
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,850
-He's conscious now! Take him to the health center! Hurry!

00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,129
Well, as of now, Nong Kalae is safe now.

697
00:49:40,129 --> 00:49:42,449
I'll let him rest a bit.

698
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:43,700
Thank you so much.

699
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,133
Yes, sir.

He's safe now.

701

Now all that's left is another person for you to be concerned about.

702
00:49:57,969 --> 00:49:59,603
Who?

703
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,630
Your volunteer teacher, of course!

704
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,129
Didn't you see the kid's face?

705
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,580
He's probably still in shock.

706
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,519
As he should be.

707
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,919
I was kind enough not to scold him right there.

708
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:12,489
Come on, man!

709
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:15,490
No one wants this kind of thing to happen, no?

710
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,640
You're here to swear at me, right?

711
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,369
And isn't what you did deserving of being sworn at?

712
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:58,119
I just only wanted the kids to be interested in learning.

713
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,969
By taking their kids to risk their lives?

714
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:03,409
It's already bad that you can't teach properly.

715
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:06,410
Now you can't even look out for the kids' safety.

716
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,300
Don't even call yourself a teacher again.

717

without any preparations of what to teach them like this,

720
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,260
then you'd better go back.

721
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,119
Fine.

722
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,479
I'll leave for sure!

723
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,480
I don't need you to chase me away.

724
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,070
You already made a mistake and you're just going to run away?

725
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,269
Yeah.

726
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:15,270

733

It was as though I was born again.

737
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:16,810
So I want to use this opportunity to do something for others for a change.

742

to the point that you want to give up.

743

744
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:45,530
