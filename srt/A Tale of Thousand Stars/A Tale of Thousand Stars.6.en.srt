I don't know.

178
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,890
I haven't done it in a while.

179
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,600
Ayi told me the villagers hadn't harvested tea leaves for several weeks, is that right?

180
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,940
It's nothing, Khru. You don't need to worry.

181
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,740
It's because I had an argument with those guys, right?

182
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,419
Well, ever since that day, those guys haven't come to buy tea leaves from our village at all.

183
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,570
It's the been same for the other villages below us too.

184
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,180
Then...should we try selling them somewhere else?

185
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,180
It's not that easy, Khru.

186
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,320
It's because of Por Liang Sakda, right?

187
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,739
P' Mor Nam told me about it already.

188
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,200
That those guys belong to Por Liang.

189
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,940
Por Liang is someone who is very influential.

190
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,799
If he doesn't want us to sell our tea leaves,

191
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,159
then I think that there's not a factory anywhere that would dare to buy tea leaves from us, Khru.

192
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,639
How about this then?

193
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,359
Tomorrow, I'll try to negotiate with the factories in Lampoon.

194
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,439
I don't know what those in Lampoon will say though,

195
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,200
but it's still better than letting them pile up like this.

196
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,920
Yeah, yeah. That'd be good. That'd be good.

197
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,100
- Khru?
- Yes?

198
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,280
You don't need to worry too much, alright?

199
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,719
Actually, I had already been aware of this matter before

200
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,060
but I couldn't do anything.

201
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,520
So I just covered my eyes and ears and let the issue continue to this point.

202
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,299
Truthfully, I should actually be thanking you, Khru, for knocking some sense into me.

203
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,820
From now on,

204
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,470
although it may be difficult,

205
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,180
but it's what we must do for what's right.

206
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,660
[Phaphirun Unit]

207
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,899
Honestly, I also didn't want to bother you, Chief,

208
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,250
if it wasn't really important.

209
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,620
Who are you going to call?

210
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,193
My friend.

211
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,590
The friend you went down to meet with?

212
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,079
Chief,

213
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,180
so are you going to let me borrow it or not?

214
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,773
Here.

215
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,320
Not for too long though, alright?

216
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,853
Thank you.

217
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,273
Ai Tul!

218
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,260
Yeah, it's me, Tian.

219
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,220
Alright, Dude, can you not ask so much yet?

220
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,300
I'd...like to ask for a bit of help.

221
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,800
Dude... transfer about 50,000 baht to me.

222
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,200
I want to buy tea leaves from the villagers.

223
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,860
And don't let my dad know, alright?

224
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,280
Hey!

225
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:32,260
Chief, what are you doing?

226
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,893
Hey!

227
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,880
I should be the one asking you that.

228
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,500
Khama told me everything already, Tian.

229
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,260
Do you think doing something like this will make the villagers happy or something?

230
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,650
So, Chief, do you want me to just stand still?

231
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,020
Chief, you weren't the one who started the problem.

232
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,240
So of course you can say that, Chief.

233
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,470
I'm also not telling you to just stand still.

234
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,210
But this isn't the solution.

235
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,380
Tian... you can't help them by buying it forever.

236
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,413
How about this then?

237
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:28,819
I'll help you think of something.

238
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,680
But for now, go home first. I'll give you a ride.

239
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,053
Let's go.

240
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,593
Come on.

241
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,180
Hey!

242
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,940
This is my tea sachet.

243
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,539
I'd been looking for it for so long. So this is where it was.

244
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,690
I'd just been planning to give it back to you.

245
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,219
If it was left out around like this,

246
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:16,179
the nice fragrance has probably already faded.

247
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,899
You just bought it.

248
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,800
How could it fade already?

249
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,280
Here. The nice fragrance is all gone already!

250
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,560
That's my hand.

251
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,540
Well, it smells pretty nice.

252
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,919
If it smells nice, then you can keep it and use it yourself, Chief.

253
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,760
But the tea flowers smell pretty nice.

254
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,460
I just found out that they can be used to make perfumes too

255
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,779
Chief.

256
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,039
What is it?

257
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
Are you free tomorrow?

258
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,973
Yeah.

259
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,620
There's something I'd like your help with for a bit.

260
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,273
Sure.

261
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,959
Have you been waiting for long, Phi?

262
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,279
I just got here too.

263
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,339
Should we just get going then?

264
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,900
-Let's go.
- Let's go.

265
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,199
This place is the souvenir center of our province.

266
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,039
Every tour bus has to stop by here.

267
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,180
And other than chili paste and Sai Oua,
[T/N: Northern Thai style sausages]

268
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,600
there are also handmade crafts from our village, Phi, that sell really well.

269
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,379
Phi, do you see that shop?

270
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,800
That shop sells really well. Tour groups come by every day.

271
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,119
Want to try checking it out?

272
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,753
- Sure, let's go.
- Let's go.

273
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,300
Those can be wrapped for you. Feel free to ask me anything.

274
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,020
Pretty Je,
[T/N: Je is a Thai-Chinese term for "Older sister"]

275
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,099
the two of us are from Pha Pun Dao village.

276
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,619
We'd like to present our fragrant tea sachets to sell at your shop, Je.

277
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,139
Here. This is a sample.

278
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,500
The real ones are even prettier than this.

279
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,799
Geez, Nong. No thanks.

280
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,199
My store has plenty of these already!

281
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,579
Nong, you should just go ask the other shops.

282
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,920
Come on, Je. Your shop has so much space left though.

283
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,420
Let us leave some of ours with you.

284
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,720
Please? Can't we leave some of ours to you?

285
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,220
It's alright, Phi. We can try the other shops.

286
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,400
Oh! Isn't this Nong Longtae?

287
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,699
Phi, do you know me?

288
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,519
Oh! Of course I know you! I remember

289
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,899
you had been my volunteer guide when I went up on the hill.

290
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,659
I still kept the photo. I'll show you, I'll show you.

291
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,300
What a cute pair. Here, have a look.

292
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,721
Oh! That's right, that's right.

293
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:27,271
I remember now, Phi!

294
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:32,059
Je! This fragrant tea sachet is straight from Longtae's village.

295
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,979
And this? Longtae made it with his own hands. Isn't that right?

296
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,739
That's right, Phi.

297
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,919
Is that so? And you didn't even tell me!

298
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,199
Then I'll clear up some space.

299
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,959
I'll put them there and really promote them.

300
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,659
The customers will come, turn to see them, and buy them instantly.

301
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,480
You should have told me sooner.

302
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,340
We got it! 20 sachets!

303
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,120
- This is awesome, Phi!
- We did it!

304
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,860
We're done with one.

305
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,380
Hey! How about this, Longtae.

306
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,100
Then, Longtae, you go over on that side and try talking to the shops there.

307
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,760
And when you're done, we'll meet up here. Okay?

308
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
You got it, Phi.

309
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,899
Oh! Today is a weekday.

310
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,950
You don't need to go teach, Phi?

311
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,660
Today... I already have my assistant teacher teaching for me instead.

312
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,819
[Pha Pun Dao School]

313
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,039
Good morning, Chief.

314
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,980
You may be seated.

315
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,920
Today, I'll be teaching in place of Khru Seetian for a day.

316
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,120
Who's able to do this equation?

317
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,560
Where is Aai Seetian, sir?

318
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,740
I don't know either.

319
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,840
Did he also go to the city like Khru Torfun?

320
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,673
No.

321
00:27:08,673 --> 00:27:10,400
Everyone, you don't need to worry, alright?

322
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,050
Let's keep studying instead.

323
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,359
He must be going for a long time for sure. It's because you like to yell at Aai Seetian, Chief.

324
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,540
- Said who?
- Aai Seetian.

325
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,779
And what else did he say?

326
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,280
He said that you like to make a face like a giant, Chief.

327
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,533
Who did?

328
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,939
Does everyone think that I'm strict?

329
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,080
Yes!

330
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,559
Chief, can you please not be so harsh on Aai Seetian?

331
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,559
I'd like him to continue staying here.

332
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,659
That's right,

333
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,060
he has to go soon.

334
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,480
Chief, don't you want him to continue staying here too?

335
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,700
It's not up to me though.

336
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,219
It's up to P'Seetian.

337
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,359
Perhaps, he may have something else to do.

338
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,399
Chief, can't we have you go ask Aai Seetian if he'd like to stay longer?

339
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,440
But I think that he'd continue staying here for sure.

340
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,140
If the Chief doesn't give him a hard time.

341
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,260
Can you promise?

342
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,190
What a demanding kid.

343
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,099
Promise me too.

344
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:41,940
Promise me too. Promise me too. Me too.

345
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,760
Okay, I give you my word.

346
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,519
So who can solve this problem?

347
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,799
Me! Me!

348
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,040
Me! Me! Me!

349
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,900
What are you doing?

350
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,599
Aai Seetian!

351
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,720
What's up, kids? How are you?

352
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,959
So? Did you guys get scolded by the Chief today?

353
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,919
We didn't.

354
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,420
We made a promise already.

355
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,920
Everyone, that's all for today, alright?

356
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,780
It's about to rain already so go back home.

357
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,779
What?

358
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,459
I haven't finished my drawing yet.

359
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,980
Go on, go on. Everyone go home first, alright?

360
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,439
- See you later.
- See you.

361
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:32,459
Bye-bye, kids. Get home safely.

362
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,420
We are leaving.

363
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,000
-I'll come teach you tomorrow, okay?
- We'll be leaving then.
- Bye-bye.

364
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,433
- We'll be leaving.
- We'll be leaving.

365
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,810
I thought you had gone alone.

366
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,640
Did you know? I was so fortunate to have Longtae go down with me today.

367
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,480
Longtae... he's very hot (popular), you know?

368
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,100
It's not to that extent, Phi.

369
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,540
So the business that you went to do, did it go well?

370
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,440
We had brought fragrant tea sachets to present and sell at the market.

371
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,160
The good news is that right now we have orders for fifty bags!

372
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,880
Fifty bags? That's not even one sack though!

373
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,170
This is just the beginning.

374
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:24,259
We'll surely get more orders once people know about our tea.

375
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,800
And when will that be?

376
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,380
We can't store tea leaves like this for too long.

377
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,060
And the price goes down every day.

378
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,799
Um...oh!

379
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,500
The factories in Lampoon... what did they say?

380
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,600
Once they heard Por Liang Sakda's name being mentioned,

381
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,539
the people in Lampoon didn't want to get involved with us anymore.

382
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,659
Actually, yesterday Por Liang's people contacted me as well.

383
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,060
They were thinking of coming up to buy our tea,

384
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,260
but... they asked to buy it only at half the price.

385
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,180
Then that would mean that we'd be at a loss.

386
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,659
What can we do though?

387
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,860
If we don't sell them, we won't get anything at all,

388
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,340
But if we give in now, then we'd have to give in forever.

389
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:30,120
But I really believe it! That these tea sachets can help us.

390
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,899
That's right! I believe it too!

391
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,280
You can try to think it over, alright?

392
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,939
If you're really interested in doing it, you can give the tea leaves to me.

393
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,679
The people here like what they're familiar with.

394
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,900
Just give them a bit of time.

395
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,940
But there's almost no time left though.

396
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,620
You told them to believe.

397
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,670
And what about you? Do you believe in yourself yet?

398
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,780
And the time before when you almost made their kid die,

399
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,840
you were able to still manage to make them trust you again.

400
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,160
So how come this time you can't be able to do it?

401
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,320
Yeah, that's true.

402
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,580
And now... you're not alone anymore.

403
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,880
Yeah! That's right!

404
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,620
How could I forget that Inta's family knows how to embroider?

405
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,220
Anyway, thanks so much, Chief.

406
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,740
I'll get going then.

407
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,140
Sorry to bother you, Ah Ma.

408
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,159
I don't know who else to consult anymore.

409
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,479
Ah Ma, it's enough if you just teach me.

410
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,780
And for the rest, I'll do it myself.

411
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,520
Will you be able to handle it, Aai? You'd have to make fifty of them first.

412
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,550
Even if I can't handle it, I'd have to handle it.

413
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,620
Come, sit here.

414
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,400
Thank you.

415
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,799
- P'Tian! P'Tian! P'Tian!
- Aai Seetian!

416
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,400
Inta!

417
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,319
Oh, where did you guys come from?

418
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,239
I finally brought reinforcements to help, Phi.

419
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,473
Hm?

420
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:49,799
They look like this, but every one of them isn't ordinary.

421
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,439
When they were little kids, each and every one of them made their own toys.

422
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,220
When it comes to handicraft skills, you can trust them!

423
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,299
- That's right!
- Right! Right!

424
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,120
You can just trust us!

425
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,220
Please trust me!

426
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,859
Are you all ready, everyone?

427
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,880
- Ready!
- Yes!

428
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,459
Another one is done!

429
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,039
Oh! I've got ten already though!

430
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,299
Oh, I also got ten already.

431
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,960
- Geez, you're so slow.
- Hey!

432
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,280
Over here, we've got three or four already, Phi.

433
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,479
Woah...how fast...

434
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,299
See, Phi? I told you that the kids in our village aren't ordinary.

435
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,939
Oh! You're not doing it right. That's not what I taught you.

436
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,700
Oh, I just embroidered my name so you can tell that I'm the one who decorated it.

437
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,360
You can't do that, Inta.

438
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,099
We're going to sell these. You can't embroider your name, alright?

439
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,640
Inta, can I see?

440
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,240
Wow! Isn't it pretty, Aai?
[Inta]

441
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,880
Inta, you did really great! Keep doing it.

442
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,580
Everyone, listen to me.

443
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,239
Everyone, embroider your names.

444
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,479
Huh? Huh?

445
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,259
Come on. Go ahead and do it, everyone. Just do it!

446
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,860
Very good, Inta.

447
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,560
Why, Phi?

448
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:22,420
Je, our tea sachets are more unique than anyone else's.

449
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,060
Because each sachet will have the name of the person who made it embroidered right on it.

450
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,880
The kids really put their heart into it.

451
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,410
[Inta]

452
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,480
Do you have any more?

453
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,680
We have a lot more, Je!

454
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,140
Here. There are names on every sachet.

455
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,160
I know that ,Khama, you don't want us to sell our tea to Por Liang Sakda.

456
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,680
We also don't want to.

457
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,300
But what other choice do we have?

458
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,900
I think let's put a vote to it instead.

459
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,080
If the majority is for selling it, then that's what we should go with, Khama.

460
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,499
Here, these have the names of the little kiddos who make them embroidered on them.

461
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,539
Hey! It worked!

462
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,159
It does.

463
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,579
This tea is from Pha Pun Dao!

464
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,339
It's bad, Khama!

465
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,760
Dad! Dad!

466
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,460
Ai Longtae, what's wrong? Were you not able to sell any tea sachets at all?

467
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,260
Not at all.

468
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,260
We just happened to have a customer from Bangkok,

469
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,040
they ordered our tea sachets... 1,000 sachets!

470
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,600
But... the kids and I... We probably won't be able to make them in time.

471
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,420
So?

472
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,360
You guys are voting, right?

473
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,140
If that's the case...

474
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,259
Whoever wants to help Khru make tea sachets...

475
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,960
Raise your hands!

476
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,300
So what will it be?

477
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,680
Huh? Come on.

478
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,780
Very good!

479
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,500
- Very good! Yours is really pretty.
- And then just stitch it.

480
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,620
As for you, Longtae, follow me.

481
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,639
Is it difficult, kids?

482
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,380
- It's not hard.
- It's not hard, sir.

483
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,679
198, 199, 200!

484
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,400
Everyone, we finally got it all!

485
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,359
Yay!

486
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,460
Great job, kids!

487
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,559
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for coming to help.

488
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,661
Alright, kids. Come sit and pair up.

489
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:54,720
We'll massage each other's hands. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Hurry up!

490
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,080
Here. Ayi, come here. Come.

491
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
We're all paired up, right? You guys are in pairs now, right?

492
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,979
Alright, now then, take turns massaging each other's hands.

493
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,819
Okay, any of you can start first. Hurry.

494
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,319
Grab it and then massage, okay?

495
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:08,720
Massage! Massage! Massage! Massage! Massage!

496
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,201
- Does it feel good?
- It feels good.

497
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,500
It feels good, right?

498
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,161
Massage! Massage! Massage!

499
00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:15,790
What about everyone else? Do you guys feel good?

500
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,220
And then,

501
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,280
switch partners! Hurry!

502
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,939
Massage, massage, massage.

503
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,680
Massage, and the other person wait, alright?

504
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,739
Massage, massage, massage.

505
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,799
- (Go sit over there.)
- Massage, massage, massage.

506
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,460
Does it feel good?

507
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,599
It feels good, right? Aright then, everyone.

508
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,140
In that case... one, two, three! Switch!

509
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,520
It was vacant here. I can't sit here?

510
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,450
Give me your hands.

511
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,660
Hey.

512
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,880
Don't tell me that the reason why you stopped by here was only just to massage my hands.

513
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,679
I brought Ai Mor to hand out medicine to the villagers.

514
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,030
So I stopped by to see your tea sachet business for a bit.

515
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,640
Hey, did you know?

516
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,440
We were so very lucky that the villagers came to help.

517
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,690
So I was able to fulfill the orders in time.

518
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,070
Bring that side over here.

519
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,460
Are you tired?

520
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,500
Khru! Khru!

521
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,499
I saw that one sack was not enough yesterday, so I just brought three sacks today.

522
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:15,520
Thank you so much.

523
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,239
Dad! Dad!

524
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:20,899
Dad! Dad! Isn't it beautiful? It has my name, Meejoo, on it too!

525
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:23,199
Good, good! You embroidered your name very prettily.

526
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:25,479
Oh, and don't forget to embroider Khru Torfun's name too, alright?

527
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:27,519
In case Khru comes back.

528
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,419
I'll stitch Khru Torfun's name myself!

529
00:40:29,419 --> 00:40:31,119
Let me embroider it. I embroider the prettiest.

530
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,000
- No, I'll embroider it myself. I'll embroider it myself.
- I'll get going first, alright, honey?

531
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,300
No, no, no! I'll embroider it! I'll embroider it!

532
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,720
Are you okay, Phi?

533
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,119
Hm?

534
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,140
Oh... Of course, I'm okay. Just this much is no sweat.

535
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,540
That's not what I'm talking about.

536
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,610
I've already made my mind up.

537
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,939
Once the matter with these tea sachets is finished,

538
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:21,190
I'll tell the truth to everyone myself.

539
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,593
Ai Phu.

540
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:35,099
I'm done. Should we just go back then?

541
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:36,533
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

542
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,139
So have you talked to Nong Tian about extending his stay for the kids yet?

543
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:47,973
Not yet.

544
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:49,440
Huh? Why?

545
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,519
You didn't go ask him just now?

546
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,139
I didn't ask him. He seemed pretty busy with Longtae.

547
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,100
Oh, seemed pretty busy...

548
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,959
He'll probably be pretty busy during this time. Because of being busy with the tea sachets.

549
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:01,899
If that's the case, then that's good.

550
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:03,919
More like they'll lead each other into more trouble.

551
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:06,659
Hey, aren't you overthinking it, Dude?

552
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:10,139
The kids are the same age and speak the same language.

553
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:13,019
Isn't them getting close something pretty normal?

554
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:14,599
Well, sure.

555
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,550
Who'd want to talk to such a strict guy like me?

556
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,820
What are you snapping at me for, Dude?

557
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,199
I didn't.

558
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,019
What do you mean you didn't?

559
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:29,400
I just saw it though.

560
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,359
Hey!

561
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,079
These kinds of actions...

562
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:37,059
I think that you...

563
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,420
are being jealous over him right now, right?

564
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,200
- I'm not being jealous!
- Oh, is that so?

565
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,579
Oh, Nong Tian!

566
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,380
Nong Tian, where are you going?

567
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,719
I'm going to Khama's house, Phi.

568
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:51,879
I'm going to borrow a motorcycle to have these tea sachets delivered.

569
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:54,659
Oh! Ai Phu just happened to be heading down into the city right now!

570
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:56,679
Maybe you should run an errand for Khru?

571
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,079
- Uh... I think that...
- Sure.

572
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,599
Then I'll leave this with you, alright?

573
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:04,740
I leave it to you.

574
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,760
Drive safely!

575
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,380
Here, I'll help put it in the car.

576
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,299
Oh, here.

577
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,000
This is the address of the shop.

578
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,660
As for this...it's the receipt.

579
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,900
And please also tell the shop that I'll send the rest tomorrow.

580
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,120
Aren't you coming with me?

581
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,179
I was thinking of going at first,

582
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:37,640
But I think... I should keep helping with the work here.

583
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,080
Oh, and hey,

584
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,579
could I ask you to buy some snacks for the kids?

585
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,960
Here, I've already had it all written down.

586
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,179
Oh, Longtae!

587
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:54,099
Give the tea sachets to the Chief, alright?

588
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:56,079
He's going to deliver them for us.

589
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,550
Thank you so much, Chief!

590
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,079
Then, come on. Let's get going.

591
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,759
Tonight...is going to be a long night.

592
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:08,600
Let's get to it, Phi!

593
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,761
Hello.

594
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:30,859
Oh, Chief Phu! Did you come here yourself today?

595
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,519
Put them down here, put them down here.

596
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:35,039
There isn't enough people so we're helping each other out.

597
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,939
So how has it been? Were they able to be sold?

598
00:44:36,939 --> 00:44:39,299
Oh, there's not enough to be sold actually! Here.

599
00:44:39,299 --> 00:44:42,139
Especially the ones embroidered with the name of who made it. Just about everyone wants it.

600
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:44,219
The customers really like them.

601
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:46,119
Here they are.

602
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:50,259
They're tea sachets from Pha Pun Dao made by the people living in the hills themselves.

603
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,120
What a great idea, huh?

604
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,500
Hello, Por Liang.

605
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,440
Oh, Chief Phu.

606
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,219
Lately, the tea being sold by the villagers hasn't been able to sell well.

607
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:09,039
So we've had to find something else to do.

608
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,500
Here, I've also brought them to be delivered.

609
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,900
But I think that it shouldn't have any impact on your tea business, Por Liang.

610
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,339
My, Chief Phu, you're exaggerating.

611
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:25,360
I myself am just someone looking to make a living each morning and night, just like anyone else.

612
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,260
[Tian]

613
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,893
Tian.

614
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,040
This teacher has such a strong passion.

615
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,099
Well, it's just like any other kid from Bangkok, Por Liang.

616
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:41,500
Soon, he'll get bored and head home already.

617
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,260
In that case, I'd like permission to buy all of this here.

618
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,380
And this too.

619
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,440
Along with this.

620
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,040
Consider it as helping one another.

621
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,399
Okay, put them all in a bag, alright?

622
00:45:59,399 --> 00:46:02,060
Thank you.

623
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,459
Pun Dao, fight, fight!

624
00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:05,819
Pun Dao, fight to the end!

625
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:08,360
Pun Dao, keep going, fight to the end! Fight, fight!

626
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,619
Everyone, hurry!

627
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:11,519
We still have a long night to go tonight, kids.

628
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,260
Do your best.

629
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,260
Oh, Chief.

630
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,259
Thank you so much.

631
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:26,520
Alright, everyone! The provisions are finally here!

632
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,680
Alright, then... Here, Longtae.

633
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,840
A snack.

634
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,019
Oh, thank you!

635
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:34,419
Alright, this is for you, P' Mor Nam.

636
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,459
And please share these with Chang Yod and P' Rang, too.

637
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,920
- Oh, okay. Yes.
- Thank you!

638
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,040
As for this... it's for the kids. I'll do it for you, okay?

639
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,520
Open your mouth, hurry.

640
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,860
Let's fuel up your energy a bit.

641
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,113
Another one? Here.

642
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,519
Here. Khao Neung, do you want some too?

643
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:07,140
Kalae, do you want some?

644
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,500
Everyone, open up your hands. Open up your hands, hurry.

645
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,640
It's yummy.

646
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:28,220
Open up your hands. Open up your hands.

647
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,493
Chief!

648
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,990
Did you want to try some?

649
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,760
If everyone else hasn't had any yet, then it's alright.

650
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,380
Everyone else has already tried it. There's just you left, Chief.

651
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,493
It's all gone though.

652
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,660
Then next time, I'll buy it for you, alright?

653
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,080
Yeah.

654
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,319
Here, Dude. You can have mine for now.

655
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:19,053
- I don't want it.
- Meejoo, is it tasty?

656
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,499
Dude! You're so freaking slow.

657
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:26,000
- If it's like this, how are you supposed to grab him in time?
- Keep it down!

658
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,140
Then I'll ask Nong Tian for you.

659
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,180
- Ai Mor!
- Just stay still.

660
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,919
- Nong Tian?
- Ai Mor!

661
00:48:34,919 --> 00:48:38,959
Nong Tian, would you happen to have... any tea sachets left over?

662
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:44,200
It just happens... that my friend would like to ask for one to keep in his closet.

663
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,360
They've all already been reserved for selling, Phi. Sorry.

664
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,339
Thank you so much.

665
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,199
Thank you.

666
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:05,799
Right, the boxes can be left in there for now, alright?

667
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:08,139
Then tomorrow morning, we'll come get them.

668
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,280
- Thank you, Chang!
- Sure, sure, Khru.

669
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,000
It's really unbelievable, huh?

670
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,920
That's right, Phi. I thought that we wouldn't have made it in time.

671
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,533
No.

672
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,999
I mean... It's really unbelievable...

673
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:29,560
that I could be able do something like this.

674
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,880
You must feel proud, right, Phi?

675
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,099
Hey, Longtae, if you had met the previous version of me first,

676
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:42,880
Longtae, you could have probably hated me.

677
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:54,780
The act of doing something for others... so this is the sense of happiness it gives.

678
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,219
Oh, right, Phi!

679
00:50:01,219 --> 00:50:04,570
My dad made Khao Tom for everyone. Would you like to eat it together?
[T/N: Rice Soup]

680
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:07,659
Longtae, you can go first.

681
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:11,680
I want to count them one more time, just to reassure myself.

682
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,080
Okay, Phi. Then hurry and come too, alright?

683
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,580
Chang! Chang!

684
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,319
Wait up!

685
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:21,880
[Storage room]

686
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:29,700
500, 600... 800, 900, 1000, 1100…

687
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,020
It's all accounted for already.

688
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,790
I've seen you count it with Longtae so many times already.

689
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,059
You didn't go to eat with everyone else?

690
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:42,510
I had something I wanted to talk with you about first.

691
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:48,180
I heard that you had tattled to the kids...that I'm strict?

692
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:56,000
Even if I didn't tattle, everyone else can see it already.
