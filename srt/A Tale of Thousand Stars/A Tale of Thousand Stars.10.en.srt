Do you know what's much harder than apologizing?

00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,200
It's forgiveness.

You have time now.

I used to think that I didn't have much time left,

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,780
so I never thought about what I'd like to do or what I'd want.

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,889
When I was in the village,

180
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,499
I found my happiness there,

181
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,489
but my parents eventually dragged me down here

182
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:14,449
and told me, that that life wasn't for me.

183
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,390
So I really don't know what I should do next.

184
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,319
Well, then,

185
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,720
I think you can just go back to college and finish that.

186
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,509
Did my mother tell you to convince me?

187
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,809
Your mother is worried about you

188
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,219
and she wants you to complete your degree.

189
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:33,620
Don't you think I'd know that I should finish my degree?

190
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,609
I'm just not sure whether I want to continue with engineering.

191
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,143
Why?

192
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,859
I chose engineering because of my mother.

193
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,530
What? What the hell?

194
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,430
You are so damn strange.

195
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,369
Sometimes you don't know what you really want

196
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,490
until you try it.

197
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,670
That's how you know if it's right for you or not.

198
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,370
Then answer me this.

199
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,480
What do you think is right for you?

200
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,790
I don't know either,

201
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,950
but definitely not engineering.

202
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,779
Seriously, just get it done. No need to think too much about it.

203
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:31,249
In the end, we have to take over our family's business anyway.

204
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,150
You're thinking too much about it.

205
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,869
- Ai Tul.
- Yes?

206
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,589
Before going home, could you drop me off somewhere?

208
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,470
Good evening, Sir.

209
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,639
We are closed today.

210
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,690
Can you come again on Monday?

211
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,073
It's me, Sir.

212
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,079
Hello, Tian.

213
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,389
Good evening, Sir.

214
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,580
- Hello, hello.
- This is my souvenir from Pha Pun Dao.

215
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,559
Thank you. How are you doing?

216
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,409
I'm doing fine. What about you?

217
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:15,143
I'm fine.

218
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,169
This tea is from Pha Pun Dao village.

219
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,929
I helped the villagers harvest the tea leaves and I can guarantee that it's chemical free.

220
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,929
It's aromatic.

221
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:34,240
Very nice.

222
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,390
How were you doing there?

223
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,030
Did you manage to find the thing you were looking for up there?

224
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,879
I'm not sure.

225
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,589
At first, I thought there would be something I could give them there.

226
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:59,150
In the end, it was me who got something from them.

227
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,160
Maybe it was Torfun, who wanted you to get that.

228
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,930
Before this,

229
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:14,250
I was only thinking about what I could do to repay Torfun.

230
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,809
Now that I got everything done,

231
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:22,170
I don't know what I should do next.

232
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,599
What to do next?

233
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,119
This is the million-dollar question to young people these days,

234
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,779
and most of the time, they would say that they want to follow their passion.

235
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,920
Isn't that a way to do things?

236
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,870
If we could only follow our passion

237
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,050
and do what we love to do,

238
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,419
then I should only be staying home instead of breaking my back while gardening.

239
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,889
You've got a point there.

240
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,339
Look.

241
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:59,380
See that plant?

242
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,539
Isn't it the one I helped you with the other day?

243
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,273
Yes.

244
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:10,469
At first, I was afraid that it would be too hot for it in the sun,

245
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,040
so I moved it to the shade, but it withered.

246
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,149
So I moved it back to get both the sun and the rain,

247
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,700
and after that, it's constantly blooming beautifully.

248
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,549
Sometimes, you just need to find a place that fits you.

249
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,580
How do I know which place fits me the best?

250
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,989
There, look over there.

251
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,560
The place that fits you will make you grow.

252
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,673
Mom,

253
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,790
I have made up my mind.

254
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,130
I will go back to studying.

255
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,399
Really?

256
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,599
Then let's get you a new car tomorrow,

257
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,429
since you'll need a car to drive to your college.

258
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,399
But I don't want to study engineering now.

259
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,649
Oh, why?

260
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:21,450
I want to study something that can help people.

261
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:27,049
How about med school then?

262
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,200
I'm not smart enough to study at med school.

263
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,813
Mom,

264
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,360
I want to study to become a teacher.

265
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,539
Tian,

266
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,690
do you still think about that?

267
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,789
Why do I have to stop thinking about it?

268
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:50,610
I just realized that teaching kids makes me so happy.

269
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,989
Tian, but studying education is not as fun as what you experienced up there.

270
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,419
What I experienced up there wasn't that fun either, Mom.

271
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,989
Why does everyone think that it was a fun thing?

272
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,809
I know very well that it's difficult.

273
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,439
So?

274
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,149
If you know it's difficult, why do you want to study it?

275
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,509
Why don't you choose something that─

276
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:15,759
That you can show off to other people, right?

277
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,879
Tian.

278
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,399
Isn't it true?

279
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,819
Being born into the Sophaditsakul family,

280
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,070
I must take my family's reputation into account in whatever I do.

281
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,010
All this time,

282
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,179
I've been doing everything you wanted me to.

283
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,030
But this time,

284
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,060
can't you let me do what I want, just for once?

285
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,489
Nong Tian, would you like cooked rice or rice porridge?

286
00:29:58,489 --> 00:30:00,809
No, thanks, I'll have it outside.

292
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,370
She agreed to let you study education.

Really?

294
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,710
Thank you, Mom.

295
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,660

Yes, even though I don't want to be away from you,

298
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,209
but this institution is known for their education degrees.

299
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,840
Many of my friends' kids couldn't get into this place.

300
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:58,409
But Mom, there are many good institutions here in Thailand. I think─

301
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:02,659
Tian, your mother already agreed to let you study education.

For this matter,

303
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,690
don't argue with her.

00:36:03,979 --> 00:36:06,559
- We rented these suits from the market.
- That's right.

358
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:08,189
I spent almost all of my salary on this.

359
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:11,290
I'm all ready to work my flirting skills here.

360
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,779
What's the rush?

361
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,789
He's not here yet.

362
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,879
Don't you want to see him?

363
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,980
I'm here for your wedding.

364
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,459
Well then, let's take a picture.

365
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:24,169
Come on, let's take a picture.

366
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,160
Make us look good in the picture.

367
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,060
One, two, three.

368
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,810
Yeah!

369
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,360
[J & N]

370
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,689
Good evening.

371
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,229
Thank you for coming.

372
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:35,063
Thank you.

373
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,990
Please excuse us.

374
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,043
Nong Tian.

375
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,110
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

376
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:15,209
Look at you, I can't remember you as a teacher in the village anymore.

377
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,869
Let's take a picture.

378
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,929
Yes, Phi.

379
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,980
Take a photo of us, please.

380
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,363
Thank you.

381
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,680
You look so handsome tonight, Phi.

382
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,590
P'Aof!

383
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,870
That's my senior, P'Aof. Let me go greet him.

384
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,820
Let me go greet him. I'll be right back.

385
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:39,409
- Please enjoy yourself.
- Thank you.

386
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:40,973
P'Aof!

387
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,690
Are you looking for my friend?

388
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,903
Yes.

389
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,720
He was here,

390
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,489
but something urgent came up, so he had to leave.

391
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,490
He just left a moment ago.

392
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,150
What was it that was so urgent?

393
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,819
I don't know what it was.

394
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:19,653
He didn't say.

395
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:28,970
Maybe, he doesn't want to see me.

396
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,130
Come on, Tian.

397
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,523
You know what?

398
00:39:36,523 --> 00:39:41,670
He told me to forget him,

399
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,649
but now, I think he's probably doing the same.

400
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,823
Nam.

401
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,399
Please excuse me,

402
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,969
but can I have your number?

403
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,590
You have really deactivated your Facebook.

404
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,489
Can I? Just in case.

405
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,123
Absolutely.

406
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,840
Okay.

407
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,600
Thank you so much for coming.

408
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,310
Congratulations, Phi.

409
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,910
Good evening.

410
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,099
Hey!

411
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,060
Mr. Tian!

412
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,669
I didn't expect to see you here.

413
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,999
Good evening, you guys.

414
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,209
Wow, you look handsome today.

415
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,330
You can say that again.

416
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,259
How are you doing? Are you doing fine?

417
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:50,439
I am. What about you? And P'Rang?

418
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:52,390
Are you doing fine?

419
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,059
We are fine. The kids have all grown up.

420
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,099
That's right.

421
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,150
Speaking of the kids,

422
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,040
Kalae, he's getting chubbier.

423
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,889

455
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,479
Chief.

456
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,590
This is probably my last letter to you.

457
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:33,650
I'm going to study in the USA.

458
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,390
Here.

459
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,580
Are you taking this with you?

460
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,223
Yes.

461
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:51,510
It may not keep me as warm as those expensive sweaters,

462
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,250
but it'll keep my heart warm.

463
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,589
All right. Let's pack it too.

464
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:01,610
At first,

465
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:07,239
I thought the distance could make me forget something up there.

466
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,030
But then, I realized

467
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,900
that the distance

468
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,280
was probably not far enough

469
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,730
to make me forget you.

470
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:39,160
I hope this next step of mine…

471
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,020
I hope this next step of mine

472
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,870
will make me eventually forget everything that happened,

473
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:52,469
and make me think of it as a tale, that makes me sleep soundly,

474
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,670
but never really existed.

475
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,129
Wow.

476
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:11,109
This coffee is quite strong. Do you like it?

477
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:14,110
Yes, I like it strong.

478
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,980
I'm also strong.

479
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,589
I'm talking about coffee.

480
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,429
So am I.

481
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,430
What else were you thinking of?

482
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:06,470
[International Departures]

483
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,153
Ai Tian!

484
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,979
Good morning.

485
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,780
What's up, buddy?

486
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,120
Why do you look disappointed to see me?

487
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,269
Don't be an ass here.

488
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:25,299
Stop getting on my nerves for once. I'm leaving soon.

489
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:29,650
Come on. At least, I get to send you off this time.

490
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,159
Thanks.

491
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,893
Give me a hug.

492
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,539
Good luck, man.

493
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,819
Don't be so hard on yourself while you're over there.

494
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,719
I'm sure there are plenty of handsome men for you to choose.

495
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,653
Damn it, Tul!

496
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,690
What's wrong?

497
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,910
You are the one who's sending him away.

498
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,710
I know.

499
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,420
Tian.

500
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,039
Have a safe trip, dear.

501
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:08,280
Take care of yourself.

502
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,939
Take care of yourself, too.

503
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:20,360
You, too. Do call me every day.

504
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,939
Okay, I will call until you're sick of me.

505
00:49:23,939 --> 00:49:26,590
I will never get sick of you.

506
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,960
Safe trip, Dear.

507
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:40,409
Take care of yourself, Son,

508
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:42,260
and have a safe trip.

509
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,173
Thank you, Dad.

510
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,240
Take care of yourself, too.

511
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,673
Dad,

512
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,000
I'll go inside now.

513
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,569
See you, man.

514
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:34,939
See you.

515
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:36,940
All right, Dad. Mom.

516
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,593
Goodbye.

517
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,663
Hello.

518
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,593
Tian.

519
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,893
Chief.

520
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,393
Good luck.

521
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,563
Chief,

522
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,770
is that all you've got to say to me?

523
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,753
I miss you.

524
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,400
I want to send you off.

525
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,570
Why are you so hard to please?

526
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:12,490
If you do this, how could I ever forget you?

527
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,690
Do you think I could?

528
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:23,010
Can you forget about what I asked you to forget?

529
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,340
What exactly do you want, Chief?

530
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,509
Will you change your mind again later?

531
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,043
Hm?

532
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,380
No, I won't.

533
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,733
Tian,

534
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,419
you're going to miss your flight.

535
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,953
Okay.

536
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,589
Chief.

537
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,023
Hm?

538
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,080
Can you wait for me?

539
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,660

Honey, who is that man?

546
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:46,300
The person who took care of our son in Pha Pun Dao.

547

Take care of yourself.

[Two years later]

565
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,520
[Green Vitamin Garden]

566
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,879
Once upon a time,

567
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:27,820
there was a puppet who was granted a magical wish from an angel to become alive.

568
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:37,330
The angel gave this puppet a mission to change the mean Green Giant to be kind.

569
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:57,089
If you were this puppet, how would you change him?

570
00:59:57,089 --> 00:59:58,479
I would share snacks with the giant.

571
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,570
- What else?
- I would take him to play together.

572
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,859
Anything else?

573
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,050
I would cheer him up with fun talk.

574
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:07,330
The puppet used up all the methods.

575
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:12,560
In the end, the mean Green Giant became a kind giant.

576
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:18,269
Organic farming is chemical-free agriculture,

577
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:20,339
that is safe for our body for consumption,

578
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:24,149
because there will be no toxic residues left in us.

579
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,459
Therefore, we get healthier.

580
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,439
After the angel saw what the puppet did,

581
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,550
she turned him into a human.

582
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:42,329
Then the puppet travelled around the world

583
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:45,580
to change all the mean people to be kind, too.

584
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,020
Chief, where is the puppet now?

585
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,279
I have no idea.

586
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,149
In the USA probably?

587
01:00:57,149 --> 01:01:01,009
Yeah, it must be that.

588
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:03,369
The puppet is Mr. Seetian,

589
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:06,010
and the Green Giant is the Chief.

590
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,350
It's just a metaphor story.

- All right, Sir.

01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:25,879
Yes.

719
01:12:25,879 --> 01:12:28,880
You must have missed me a lot, right?

720
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,470
It's very precious to me.

721
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,030
Why are you smiling?

722
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:43,670
I'm just thinking.

723
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,920
How did you know

724
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:50,370
that I like you?

725
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:58,140
Just with the look you gave me the first time we met,

726
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,063
I knew.

727
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:02,619
You are wrong.

728
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,870
I didn't like you back then yet.

729
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,083
What about now?

730
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,920
Why are you smiling?

731
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:26,380
Do you know what my opponent will get when he lets his guard down?

732
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:28,200
What will he get?

733
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:31,763
Checkmate!

734
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,113
No.

735
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:41,320
Hey, Chief!

736
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,450
What's that sound?

737
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,683
Chief!

738
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,880
The house is shaking.

739
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,179
Chief, Sir! Is everything all right?

740
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,113
Chief, Sir!

741
01:13:56,113 --> 01:13:59,729
Chief, is everything all right?

742
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,590

[A Tale of a Thousand Stars]

747
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:39,430
♫ The story that's been told however many times is still the same ♫

748
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:45,890
♫ It's that I love you, love you. It has never changed ♫

749
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:52,350
♫ If perhaps the stars hear the words of the prayers within my heart ♫

750
01:14:52,350 --> 01:15:03,350
♫ No matter how many thousands of times, I'll still ask for my heart to be near you ♫

751
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:18,270
♫ If perhaps the stars hear the words of the prayers within my heart ♫

752
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:29,760
♫ No matter how many thousands of times, I'll still ask for my heart to be near you ♫
