00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,433
Hello.

6
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:15,933
Hey, come here quickly.

7
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,766
Let's sit together.

8
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,133
What's up with the comments

9
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,166
on that post?

10
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,266
I am a diplomat.

11
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,066
What's wrong?

12
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:43,600
She startled me.

13
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:51,933
Hello.

14
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,200
Let's drink happily.

15
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,033
-Cheers! -Cheers!

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,666

Cheers.

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,500
I heard you lived in Paris before. Where did you stay?

19
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,500
At first, I lived in the 15th arrondissement, then at a friend's near Belleville Park.

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Really? Belleville Park is great.

21
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
Much better than the 15th arrondissement.

22
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,266
Why did you choose French as a major?

23
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:38,766
Because I like Camus.

24
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,666
Camus was Algerian.

25
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:44,166
The Outsider.

26
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,433
So you shouldn't have majored in French. Ahh this guy.

27
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,566
Isn't the novel written in French?

28
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,266
Hey, Hey.

29
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,600
If you play football with general-level people in the army,

30
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,866
-Let's go smoking. -Can't block the ball.

31
00:03:57,866 --> 00:03:59,266
You can't just keep giving the ball away.

32
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,166
-Hey, hey -I'm going too! I'm going too!

33
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,966
Let's go together. Let's go together.

34
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,333
I want to go too. I want to go too.

35
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:05,333

36
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:05,933
I'm going to the toilet.

37
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,600
-Let's go together. -Let's go together.

38
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:11,366
-Aren't you going to the toilet? -Where are you going?

39
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:16,566
I like Camus too.

40
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:17,666
The Outsider.

41
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
Mom passed away today.

42
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:35,266
No, it could have been yesterday. I’m not sure.

43
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:40,366
They sent me the remaining money
from the nursing home.

44
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,866
‘A Dieu’ is a compound of the preposition ‘A’ and ‘Dieu’, which means God.

45
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,666
In English, it means “to God”.

46
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,633
Implying being together with God.

47
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:58,066
It's like saying, “Even though we are separated now,
Let's meet again by God’s side in the future.”

48
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:00,966
In Korean, it means

49
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,933
“Let's never see each other again until death, you bastard.”

50
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,866
Are you studying hard?

51
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:09,066
The midterm exam is coming soon. Study hard.

52
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,666
[Sangkyu] Isn't she just so cool?

53
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,733
[Sangkyu] That confidence is totally European.

54
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,266
[Jongkyu] Doesn't feel like a European, just seems like she wants attention.

55
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:36,500
[Haekyu] Totally agree.

56
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,266
[Cheolkyu] Anyway, she's mine. Hehe

57
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:48,266
But is that true with Oliver?

58
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:48,966
I have no idea.

59
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,066
But I heard that there was another person who did the research for her.

60
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,566
Computer engineering majors.

61
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,400
Really?

62
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,666
She's smoking freely.

63
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:57,966
Her life seems chill.

64
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:01,233
But didn’t she also wear the same clothes yesterday?

65
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,833
Just go ahead and eat him!

66
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:45,533
Hello.

67
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,066
Let's grab a drink together.

68
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,900
I don't drink with women.

69
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,066
Hey.

70
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:08,600
Do you want to do a group project with me?

71
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:10,666
Why?

72
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,700
Do you think you’ve found my weakness?

73
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,733
What did you say?

74
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,033
I have no interest in being taken advantage of.

75
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,366
Go find someone else.

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,366
Oliver: [Itaewon at 10? OK]

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Heungsoo: [11?] [adieu]

78
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,800
[Outing]

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,100
The term refers to one's sexual identity being exposed against one's will. It began when Michaelangelo Signorile, a member of the gay and lesbian group ‘Queer Nation’,
published an article titled “The Gay Life or Malcolm Forbes” in the March 1990 issue of Out Week.
It was later popularized by the [Time] magazine.

[Painless suicide]

81

Also comes with other physical impairments,

82
00:07:56,366 --> 00:08:00,466
albino animals often face exclusion from their group.

[Solomon's Children]

84
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:04,900
Albino animals with pure white coats may look
glamorous and mysterious,

85
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,200
they were even once considered sacred.

86
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:07,933
-But actually,  -Mom?

87
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:11,133
Due to their fragile nature and
lack of care, often has low survival rates.

88
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:13,066
Do you have money?

89
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:14,733
What's wrong?

90
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,900
It seems like I have to go and live in the United States.

91
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:17,566
Why?

92
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,566
Nothing. I find it difficult to live here.

93
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:24,000
Then you should've majored in English from the start.

94
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,600
Then I'll go to France.

95
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,933
Just hurry up and do your military service.

96
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:38,533
Hey, did you hear about that?

97
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,166
It’s really a big deal.

98
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:42,533
I really didn't expect it.

99
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,633
Hey, have you heard?

100
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:49,066
What's the meaning?

101
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:50,166
Really?

102
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,600
No way!

103
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:54,366
Did anyone else see it?

104
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,066
It's true.

105
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:03,166
What nonsense are you talking about?

106
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,533
-What is it? -He's saying strange things.

107
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,133
I'm not lying, it's true.

108
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,433
You mean you really saw it?

109
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,866
Hello, I can see clearly with 1.1 and 1.5 vision eyes.

110
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,366
Are you saying Oliver is gay?

111
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:15,666
No, I saw him entering the hotel,

112
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:16,866
and he was with a man.

113
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,833
It was in Itaewon.

114
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,066
So gross.

115
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,033
Wasn't It just a woman with short hair?

116
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:21,766
Right. Right.

117
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:23,666
Not at all.

118
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:26,666
He was tall, skinny, and his face...

119
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,600
What's wrong?

120
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:29,666
Why? What's wrong?

121
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,300
He has a thin face and no double eyelids,

122
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:35,566
like that face.

123
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:40,133
Hey, I took this yesterday.

124
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,966
You were so funny yesterday.

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,733
I laughed so hard even in my sleep because of you.

126
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:47,900
You were so funny.

127
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,266
Laugh, laugh quickly.

Last time, we finished the class by talking about Arthur Rimbaud.

138
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:14,466
Rimbaud is one of the most important figures in modern French poetry.

139
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,266
I'll have a beer.

140

141
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,400
Why?

142
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,266
Are you mad?

143
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,300
I'm not mad,

144
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,833
just embarrassed.

00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:48,566
It's not mine.

[Tomorrow doesn't work, sorry. Too much homework, Okay so where do you want to go? I want to go to the mall.]
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,700
[Basic Living French Course.] [French Major] [Student ID 2010201112] [Name: Koo JaeHee]

180
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:11,466
Hey, quiet.

181
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:15,866
What?

182
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,166
What is she going to do?

183
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:20,966
Take a good look.

184
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:24,766
No moles, full-cup A. Fuck.

185
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
So It's not her.
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,900
Later, it was known as the infamous “Koo Jaehee's Incident” in the French Department.

186
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:45,066
JaeHee's nickname evolved from KJH to 'Crazy Bitch'.

187
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:56,933
Let's go drinking.
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,200
Heungsoo : [What the hell are you rat's dick-sized assholes even making a fuss about.]

188
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:36,666
Here.

189
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:40,466
Marvelous.

190
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:41,233
Jaehee, who was born in Daegu

191
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,266
-and spent her high school years in Paris, France. - Bless you!

192
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:45,200
Although she's forgotten her dialect,

193
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,400
But whenever she drank, she would start rambling on in French and sing French pop songs.

194
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,566
If she ran out of alcohol, she would even sell her scooter just to drink.

195
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,200
Showing how strong her desire was.

196
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:55,200
She would check the hygiene of the night club bathroom every day.

197
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,500
She's an honest girl.

198
00:14:59,366 --> 00:14:59,766
Hey.

199
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,566
Where did you learn to be so cold?

200
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,733
What are you saying?

201
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:07,833
Weren't you like that then?

202
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,500
“Why? You think you've found my weakness?”

203
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:15,766
When did I say that?

204
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:18,433
Jang Heungsoo,

205
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,066
Why is it a weakness for you?

206
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,466
How could it ever be a weakness to simply be yourself?

207
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,933
Hey, cheers.

208
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,833
Cheers.

209
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:35,366
Materially speaking.

210
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,766
It plays a protective role.

211
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,700
Our naturally outsider personalities and love for entertainment

212
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,666
made us click.

213
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,166
All we have is our youth and energy,

214
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,633
so let's use them freely, without calculations

215
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,866
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

216
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,666
Crazy bitch meets a gay man.

217
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,866
That's how the animal life begins.

218
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,900
21 Years Old

219
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,033
What's the monthly rent here?

220
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:45,366
I have no idea.

221
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,566
This is a full deposit. I'm not sure.

222
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:48,366
Why?

223
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:49,666
Nothing.

224
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,333
I can't eat anymore.

225
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:02,900
I should quit drinking.

226
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,933
Me too, Just thinking about alcohol makes me want to throw up.

227
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:08,366
I'll never drink again.

228
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:10,400
If I drink again, I'm no longer a human being.
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,500
I'm not a human.
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
[Soju]

229
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:27,333
Hurry up. Hurry up.

230
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:28,900
Hurry up, Hurry up, Hurry up.

231
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,666
Are Parisians opened about gay people 

232
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,933
just like they are in the movies?

233
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:36,466
There are idiots everywhere.

234
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:37,866
It's just that the density is lower over there.

235
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:39,366
The density is way too high here.

236
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,266
So, did you stay at someone else's place there?

237
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,200
Like a dormitory?

238
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:01,666
Your parents must’ve been so worried.

239
00:19:04,966 --> 00:19:07,500
When I was there, my parents never looked for me once.

240
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,566
Four years?

241
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,800
Not even once?

242
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,566
My parents don't really care about me.

243
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,333
They are immersed in their own world.

244
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:21,933
Why?

245
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,200
Do you feel sorry for me?

246
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:24,866
No.

247
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,466
I envy you so much.

248
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,866
I wish my mom didn't care about me either.

249
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:32,466
Just pay me the house deposit for a place to live alone.

250
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,800
As a condition of living alone, you need to earn your own pocket money.

251
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:40,966
You still get allowance money, right?

252
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:49,266
Is it the DJ?

253
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,833
How have you been lately? I miss you.

254
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:55,166
Bullshit.

255
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:57,966
Just say you met a big shot.

256
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:00,566
How can you say that?

257
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,066
His love is not over yet and he is still hurt.

258
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:04,666
Love? What love?

259
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:08,366
Oppa, lend me some money.

260
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:10,333
Hey, Are you crazy?

261
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,166
Give it to me quickly.

262
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,633
How much do you want?

263
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:17,466
100.

264
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,966
Why isn't he reading it?

265
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,966
What a stingy jerk.

266
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,666
Here's your coffee, Miss.

267
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,366
Thank you.

268
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,300
I'm watching. Just throw it away.

269
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,166
There's someone there.

270
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,933
Sorry, my friend didn't catch the ball I passed.

271
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,166
No, what are you doing?

272
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:44,733
Let me buy you coffee.

273
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:49,600
What’s so good about being a model student?

274
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:53,400
What model student? He's the president of the basketball club.

275
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:55,166
Just sleep with him once.

276
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,166
Why must you be in a relationship? How tiring.

277
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:00,466
I haven't found anything more interesting than relationships.

278
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,666
Hey, relationships are like red clothes.

279
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:08,133
You only wear it two or three times in a month when you're in a good mood.

280
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,566
But in the eyes of others, you wear it every day.

281
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:12,566
Isn't that a loss?

282
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,600
Everyone is counting how many men you have dated,

283
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,966
gossiping eagerly.

284
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:20,733
They don't know that you're too dumb even to break up properly.

285
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:23,600
So what?

286
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:25,666
It's enough that you know.

287
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:31,133
Rather than caring about that kind of thing,

288
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:33,333
I'm going to use the time to do everything I want.

289
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:35,966
I don’t want to regret not doing it in the future.

290
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:44,566
Hey, do you really have to throw up?

291
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:45,500
No, no.

292
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,533
My stomach hurts after lunch.

293
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,400
Didn't you say you want to buy a t-shirt?

294
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,366
Won't you try it on?

295
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,966
Everybody, all night!

296
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
-All night!

297
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,566
-Starting now, find someone good.

298
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,866
Is this your first time drinking impromptu?

299
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,200
What?

300
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,833
Is it your first time here?

301
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:13,000
My stomach doesn't feel good. Wait a minute.

302
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:14,266
Look. Look.

303
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,266
Now it’s rock, paper, scissors, whoever loses…

304
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:19,666
Hello, cutie.

305
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,366
The loser will be punished today.

306
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:25,666
Rock, paper, scissors.

307
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:32,766
Are you okay?

308
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:39,333
Sorry, what should I do?

309
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:40,300
It's okay.

310
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,600
I was planning to throw it away anyway because I don't like it.

311
00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:45,766
The Gucci sneakers?

312
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:19,766
Why did you hold my hand without my permission?

313
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,233
Sorry.

314
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:22,933
I just like you so much.

315
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:26,200
I'm the style to express my feelings first to the person I like.

316
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,366
Nevermind.

317
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,266
I'm just sensitive to this kind of thing.

318
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,800
[Jang Heungsoo : Call me]

320
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:38,366
Hey.

321
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:40,166
Hey.

322
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:43,166
Do you know what he said when he sent me home today?

323
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,366
What?

324
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:45,666
Did he ask to borrow money?

325
00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:48,266
He asked me if he could hold my hand. Isn’t that so cute?

326
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,866
He has no imperfections at all.

327
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:54,300
It seems like you're progressing slower than expected.

328
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,433
So sweet.

329
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:57,466
He smells like soap.

330
00:24:57,566 --> 00:24:59,133
I was so excited that I almost threw up.

331
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,066
I really threw up.

332
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:00,733
Why?

333
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,500
Shut up for once, Sis.

334
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,233
People will think you're my mom.

335
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,066
Is there someone next to you?

336
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,300
Yeah, that's right.

337
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:10,500
I'll be back early.

338
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,966
My sister is mad. I’ll leave first.

339
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:20,033
What about you?

340
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,566
My name is Suho, Kwon Suho.

341
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,766
Let's leave together. I'll see you off

342
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:26,800
Where is your car?

343
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,600
I'll pay you back for the shoes.

344
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,466
Forget it, It's fine.

345
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,033
No.

346
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:40,666
I'll pay you back for sure.

347
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:16,533
I can touch my elbow with my tongue.

348
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:23,066
Ah.

349
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:36,166
Someone was watching through that window.

350
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:38,066
One of my underwear also went missing.

351
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:40,500
Isn't this the third floor? Don't exaggerate.

352
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,633
No way.

353
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,433
Didn't you only go drinking? What are you taking a shower for?

354
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:56,100
I threw up.

You are much prettier than my sister.

526
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:28,433
What are you doing?

527
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:30,766
Jang Heungsoo,

528
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,433
I think I'm in love.

529
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:39,966
Okay, next patient.

530
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,266
Hey, that's all just a dopamine trick.

531
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,433
How can you tell whether it's love or not?

532
00:37:55,466 --> 00:37:56,866
What is the difference anyway?

533
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,966
Honestly, I don't know how much you have to like someone for it to be considered love.

534
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:09,200
But, I miss him.

535
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:14,066
I think the words "I miss you" are more genuine than "I love you"

536
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:18,266
Love is too abstract and hard to understand.

537
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,366
But missing someone is so clear.

538
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,933
I miss him.
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,000
That person.
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,000
So much.

539
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,166
Professors and Seniors who have graduated are all coming

540
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:42,900
and everyone is so nervous.

541
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,133
If you are busy, should I go and help you?

542
00:38:45,466 --> 00:38:47,666
There are many people here.

543
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:49,866
I don't want you to come and suffer.

544
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:53,566
Okay, then call me when you're done.

545
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:54,466
Good.

00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,600
It's a guitar club.

547
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,333
It'll be fun.

548
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:32,600
Not bad, right? Isn't the rice wine pretty good?

549
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,833
Sunwoo oppa.

550
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,800
You have plenty of people, but maybe not enough snacks?

551
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:46,466
Who is she?

552
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,833
Ah, you must be Sunwoo oppa's older sister.

553
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,466
Hello, Nice to meet you.

554
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,666
Didn't you say she is your sister?

555
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,733
Your real sister.

556
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:39,433
Hey! When did I ever say that?

557
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:43,266
Sorry, this is so embarrassing so I'm leaving.

558
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,766
I'll wait for you in the car. Clean up the scene and come over later.

559
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,366
Noona, it's not what you think.

560
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:50,866
I was just a little nice to her, and she misunderstood.

561
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,600
It's not like that. Really. I can explain…

562
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:05,466
Hey!

563
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:08,666
Weren't you just fooling around with me?

564
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,466
What?

565
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,100
Damn it.

566

You think you're the only one allowed to act cool?

567
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:20,566
Hey, if you were me, would you date someone like you?

568
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:22,866
Someone like me?

569
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,833
What's wrong with someone like me?

What kind of person am I?

00:41:37,766 --> 00:41:39,433
Stop beating around the bush. Just tell me.

What's wrong with someone like me?

573

Didn’t you show your breasts in front of the guys in your classroom?

A club girl. Going through guy after guy.

Damn it. Who did this?

684
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,733
When I was a freshman in high school, I liked a senior.

685
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,400
For the first time, I wrote a novel just to give it to him.

686
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:40,066
So, that’s what you’ve been writing every day.

687
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,500
If I don't write something, I feel like I’ll go crazy.

688
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:54,966
The book had our names

689
00:49:55,266 --> 00:49:57,533
and also a scene of us kissing at the doorstep.

690
00:49:58,766 --> 00:50:00,266
But my mother saw it.

691
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:03,066
Then what?

692
00:50:04,866 --> 00:50:06,933
My mother didn't say anything.

693
00:50:08,266 --> 00:50:09,766
Just acted like nothing happened.

694
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:14,466
But the next day, she started going to church regularly.

695
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,300
Every night when my mother came into my room to pray,

696
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:20,566
I really thought I’d go insane.

697
00:50:22,566 --> 00:50:25,566
But if I didn’t let her do it, I thought she might go crazy instead.

698
00:50:27,366 --> 00:50:28,500
So I didn't say anything.

699
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,466
Did you ever think about dying back then?

00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,833
No.

701
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,566
I just didn’t want to be alive.

702
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:46,933
In middle school,

703
00:50:47,866 --> 00:50:51,766
There was an art assignment where we were asked to draw a milk carton.

704
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,166
Out of 30 students, only one person drew a crumpled milk carton.

705
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,900
The teacher had been giving the same assignment for 20 years.

706
00:51:01,366 --> 00:51:05,366
She praised the drawing as It was the first crumpled milk carton she’d ever seen.

707
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,866
That teacher sounds so cool.

708
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,766
Right? The art teacher was really cool.

709
00:51:10,566 --> 00:51:12,966
She pasted the drawing on the back wall of the classroom.

710
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,500
Every time she saw it, she praised it.

711
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,100
That kid must’ve become a painter, right?

712
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,333
No.

713
00:51:20,866 --> 00:51:22,266
She was ostracized by her classmates.

714
00:51:23,266 --> 00:51:24,666
Her locker

715
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,966
was always full of spoiled milk.

716
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:30,366
She dropped out in the end.

717
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,833
That’s just how it is.

718
00:51:38,066 --> 00:51:40,866
Whenever people see someone different from themselves,

719
00:51:40,966 --> 00:51:43,766
They believe the other person is inferior. It makes them feel good about themselves.

720
00:51:45,466 --> 00:51:47,866
They don’t know that they're the inferior ones.

721
00:51:49,966 --> 00:51:51,166
Damn it.

722
00:51:52,966 --> 00:51:55,766
That's right, damn it.

723
00:52:27,766 --> 00:52:28,666
What is this?

724
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:40,966
Hey! Koo Jaehee, What are you doing there?

725
00:52:42,766 --> 00:52:43,833
Hey!

726
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:47,266
Wake up, get up quickly.

727
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,500
Hey!

728
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,900
Hey, hey, what is this?

729
00:52:52,066 --> 00:52:53,366
What’s this tattoo?

730
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:55,900
I don't remember… What is it?

731
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,933
Jang Heungsoo.

732
00:53:00,866 --> 00:53:03,966
You’re my family, my brother!

733
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,600
No matter what anyone says, I will always be on your side.

734
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:07,433
Got it?

735
00:53:07,566 --> 00:53:09,066
Okay, Brother!

736
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,633
If you do, I'll do it too.

737
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:12,566
Bring it on!

738
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:14,000
Oppa.

739
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,600
Say hi, this is my friend.

740
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,266
He's the closest person to me in this world,

741
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,600
-Hi. -For me.

742
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,666
You didn't even answer my calls.

743
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,600
Get over here.

744
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,700
Don't hurt him.

745
00:53:25,766 --> 00:53:26,666
Alright, Alright.

746
00:53:26,766 --> 00:53:28,366
He’s really afraid of pain.

747
00:53:29,566 --> 00:53:30,800
No! No!

748
00:53:31,066 --> 00:53:31,400
Hold still.

749
00:53:31,566 --> 00:53:32,200
Hold still.

750
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,866
I told you to hold still.

751
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,066
Hey!

752
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,666
Your name is Koo Jaehee, so it's fine.

753
00:53:37,766 --> 00:53:38,466
But my name is Jang Heungsoo,

754
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:40,266
why the hell would I get JH tattooed?

755
00:53:40,366 --> 00:53:42,866
I need to change it to S.

756
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:44,266
You can't.

757
00:53:44,966 --> 00:53:46,366
He said If I ever show up in front of him again,

758
00:53:46,366 --> 00:53:47,933
he'll kill me.

759
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:49,966
What? Why?

760
00:53:49,966 --> 00:53:53,533
Before you could tattoo the S, you said you didn't want to do it.

761
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:55,266
I also sent the texts to him for you.

762
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,266
What's the fuss about?

763
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,366
Just drop it.

764
00:54:00,766 --> 00:54:02,666
Otherwise you will get holes in your wrists.

765
00:54:10,566 --> 00:54:11,566
Drink this.

766
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,766
After that,

767
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:21,066
I suffered the side effect of getting a tattoo after drinking 

768
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,300
and had no choice but to give up on the S tattoo.

769
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,733
Mom, do you only want to eat dumplings for the rest of your life?

770
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:35,966
Your dad liked dumplings.

771
00:54:36,466 --> 00:54:38,000
Mom, do you still think about Dad?

772
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,866
Of course, every time I see you, I think of him.

773
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,500
Your dad was also very good at pissing people off.

774
00:54:45,566 --> 00:54:48,966
How else would his nickname be “Banghwa-dong Frying pan?”

775
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:51,066
That cousin Jongtae from Uncle’s family.

776
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,800
He passed the civil service exam this time.

777
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,233
He said he’ll have an interview later.

778
00:54:54,466 --> 00:54:56,366
Wasn't he a fine arts major?

779
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,066
Yes.

780
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:00,066
Why even go to college? What a waste of money.

781
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:02,066
He must’ve figured it out.

782
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:03,866
The interview will probably cut half the people.

783
00:55:03,866 --> 00:55:07,266
And I heard that these days civil servants have to kiss up to everyone.

784
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:08,766
Heungsoo,

785
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,466
just go to the military.

786
00:55:10,866 --> 00:55:12,366
I heard the food there is really good these days.

787
00:55:13,866 --> 00:55:16,266
You've never been there, why do you keep asking me to go?

788
00:55:20,266 --> 00:55:21,266
Heungsoo.

789
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:34,933
Koo Jaehee, come in.

790
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,533
Relax.

791
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,933
Lift up your skirt.
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:09,200
[Gucci] Okay, see you later.
- Actually I don't think we can meet today. Sorry.

792
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,200
You Lady!

793
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,066
-Can you come in for a second? -Why can’t you understand what I said?

794
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:15,866
Me?

795
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:16,966
Hurry, hurry.

796
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,200
This is the result of your life, do you understand?

797
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:22,833
I said I would be responsible for the result.

798
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,566
Just tell me if I can do it or not.

799
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:26,166
Responsible. How can this be responsible?

800
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:27,066
This is obviously irresponsible.

801
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,933
Don’t you understand that a woman’s body is sacred?

802
00:56:30,066 --> 00:56:32,166
I really can't listen to this anymore!
.

803
00:56:32,266 --> 00:56:33,433
Hey, Jaehee.

804
00:56:33,466 --> 00:56:34,533
Calm down, calm down.

805
00:56:37,966 --> 00:56:38,666
Jaehee.

806
00:56:38,766 --> 00:56:40,166
-Jaehee! -It's all because of you.

807
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:41,533
Because of you!

808
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,766
It's not me!

809
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:43,866
Let's go.

810
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:44,800
Sorry.

811
00:56:44,866 --> 00:56:45,566
Boy!

812
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,933
You can't just leave like this.

813
00:56:47,066 --> 00:56:49,766
Jaehee has always been a sprinter since middle school.

814
00:56:52,566 --> 00:56:54,433
You can't just leave like this.

815
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,266
Just ignore whatever the old lady said.

816
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,766
Give it to me. I'll return It.

817
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,700
Give it back. Let’s just go to another hospital.

818
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,466
Let go! What are you doing?

819
00:57:27,066 --> 00:57:28,600
Am I really that easy?

820
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:30,066
Hey, Koo Jaehee.

821
00:57:31,566 --> 00:57:34,866
Why would Chae Sunwoo ever genuinely date me?

822
00:57:35,466 --> 00:57:37,866
Even the doctor said this is the result of my life.

823
00:57:39,366 --> 00:57:40,400
Is that really true?

824
00:57:43,366 --> 00:57:44,933
So, I’m a slut,

825
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:47,666
a woman who's like a dirty rag.

826
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:50,766
Does that make it okay for everyone to curse me openly?

827
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:53,033
Just because I’m easy,

828
00:57:54,866 --> 00:57:57,266
do you think it won’t hurt me?

829
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:58,466
Why?

830
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,300
Why do they judge and curse others so easily?

831
00:58:03,466 --> 00:58:05,300
Why is it so easy for them?

832
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,166
Why is it so easy for everyone to make a judgement?

833
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,600
But for me,

834
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,300
I...

835
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:17,466
I don’t even know myself.

836
00:58:17,566 --> 00:58:19,966
Why is everyone always like this?

837
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:41,466
Heungsoo,

838
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,433
I'm so scared.

839
00:58:45,766 --> 00:58:47,533
I'm so scared.

840
00:58:48,266 --> 00:58:51,800
What should I do?

841
00:59:38,066 --> 00:59:40,966
Later, Jaehee retook her exams for a business major.

842
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Started studying hard and went looking for a job.

843
00:59:44,866 --> 00:59:47,233
I won a small prize in the recruitment competition.

844
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,000
While I continued to submit my works to competitions after that.

845
00:59:50,066 --> 00:59:51,666
Congratulations!

846
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:52,666
Why didn't you tell me?

847
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,833
It's not a big competition and the prize money isn't much.

848
00:59:56,066 --> 00:59:57,566
There was a rumor at school that we lived together

849
00:59:57,966 --> 01:00:00,033
and even had an abortion.

850
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:01,766
Jaehee and I

851
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:05,366
learned the power of collective intelligence.

852
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:08,200
If you keep living like this,

853
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,200
you'll die alone!

854
01:00:12,566 --> 01:00:13,466
That's right.

855
01:00:14,066 --> 01:00:16,633
I think I’ll die alone too.

856
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:21,666
So go meet someone nice and live happily.

857
01:00:25,466 --> 01:00:26,866
It's nothing serious,

858
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,500
we just had sex a few times.

859
01:00:28,566 --> 01:00:31,066
Just slept together a few times. You're exaggerating, you know?

860
01:00:32,766 --> 01:00:34,166
You Jerk!

861
01:00:34,366 --> 01:00:35,700
Treating love like It’s a game.

862
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:39,466
You useless piece of a rag.

863
01:00:43,066 --> 01:00:45,400
Let's go have a drink without him.

864
01:00:45,466 --> 01:00:46,766
What is your name?

865
01:00:47,466 --> 01:00:49,966
He really likes you.

866
01:00:50,766 --> 01:00:53,100
It’s time for you to start dating for real.

867
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,200
Then what?

868
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,166
Get married to him in the future?

869
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,600
Introduce him to my mom?

870
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,600
Say hi, Mom,

871
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,166
This is my boyfriend

872
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,100
He’s solid, isn’t he?

873
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,933
He's got a big dick, too.

874
01:01:02,266 --> 01:01:04,133
So gross!

875
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:06,700
Heungsoo,

876
01:01:07,866 --> 01:01:11,500
How about we live together for the rest of our lives?

877
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:13,300
If that’s the case, I’d rather get a dog.

878
01:01:14,766 --> 01:01:15,666
What's wrong?

879
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,900
Then I will live even more like a dog.

880
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,633
Mmm, you already do.

881
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:30,033
Later, Jaehee said school was boring without me

882
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,366
and went to Australia to study abroad.
01:01:43,00 --> 01:01:45,250
To Heungsoo,
Hello. I'm feeling excited just imagining what it would be like to write a letter to my beloved you. I'm really curious about your military life.
How's the food in the military? You're a picky eater, so if you happen to find delicious food in the military, let me know about it. If there's anything tasty, you should let me enjoy it too through the PX (Post Exchange).
I'm curious if you're meeting wonderful friends there. Just thinking about it makes me smile.
I miss you so much. While I miss you, I'm also imagining your smiling face. 
Just thinking about it makes my heart flutter.

883
01:01:46,566 --> 01:01:50,266
Suho sometimes writes me a letter under Jaehee’s name
01:01:49,00 --> 01:01:50,000
[Suho]
01:01:53,00 --> 01:01:55,000
[Heungja Noona]
01:02:26,00 --> 01:02:29,100
[Degree Certificate]

884
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,800
[Name: Koo Jaehee]
I believe the most important ability for a marketer is initiative.
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Because it allows one to have a different perspective on mundane things.

885
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:54,066
You’re here?

886
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:57,866
I’ve been discharged.

887
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,600
Do you work at a funeral home?

888
01:03:02,766 --> 01:03:04,966
Yeah, should I bring you to visit?

889
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:06,800
No way!

890
01:03:07,866 --> 01:03:09,566
Ah I'm starving! What do you want to eat?

891
01:03:09,566 --> 01:03:11,066
Whatever you want to eat. Just tell me.

892
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,700
Young man.

893
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:15,700
Yes!

894
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,033
Come here.

895
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,000
27 Years Old.

896
01:03:28,466 --> 01:03:29,633
Come in.

897
01:03:30,866 --> 01:03:32,166
Attention, everyone.

898
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,466
Our company finally has new recruits.

899
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:37,700
Attention!

900
01:03:38,366 --> 01:03:39,866
Say hello.

901
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,633
Please take care of us.

902
01:03:50,566 --> 01:03:52,166
Welcome.

903
01:03:54,066 --> 01:03:55,633
I'm covering someone’s shift.

904
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,566
The boss is super busy.

905
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:57,333
What would you like to drink?

906
01:03:57,666 --> 01:03:59,300
I'll have a tequila.

907
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:03,900
Is this wine okay?

908
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,366
Are you a regular customer?

909
01:04:09,866 --> 01:04:12,366
Yes, I live nearby.

910
01:04:15,266 --> 01:04:16,266
Are you a student?

911
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:17,900
Yes.

912
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:19,966
I envy you so much.

913
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,500
Students can do whatever they want.

914
01:04:22,566 --> 01:04:23,733
Welcome.

915
01:04:23,766 --> 01:04:24,800
Hello.

916
01:04:28,066 --> 01:04:30,466
Hurry up and finish your drink then let’s go to Cheonggyecheon.

917
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:31,466
Why Cheonggyecheon?

918
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:32,466
To go buy a gun.

919
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,066
I want to shoot my manager.

920
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,466
[Kim Jiseok, Lawyer]
Let me know when you shoot the minister.

921
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,466
29 Years Old.

922
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,533
“In Search of Lost Time”? 

923
01:05:08,466 --> 01:05:11,166
I think it is a work that focuses solely on human beings,

924
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,100
I can really feel the author's passion and dedication…

925
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,200
You don't just read the persistence

926
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,500
but also get to experience it.

927
01:05:17,866 --> 01:05:21,666
Then why did you apply to our company?

928
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,433
You're not interested in working, right?

929
01:05:24,966 --> 01:05:26,966
If the direction is wrong,

930
01:05:27,266 --> 01:05:28,566
the speed is meaningless.

931
01:05:32,966 --> 01:05:36,466
My Head Manager always asks me to do everything twice.

932
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,566
Can't he just be clear with what he wants?

933
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,366
Does he want me to read his mind?

934
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,500
That's because you haven’t mastered the basics of the job yet. 

935
01:05:43,766 --> 01:05:44,833
No!

936
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:46,666
He'd always say “figure it out yourself”

937
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,533
and then torture me.

938
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:51,433
Catering to the boss’s preferences is also one of the professional skills.

939
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,366
So, do you two see her often?

940
01:05:56,966 --> 01:05:57,666
No.

941
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,900
He came to my door and caused a scene after drinking.

942
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,933
We've met like twice? I'm not sure.

943
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,266
No, but Heungsoo's friend

944
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,666
came to your house drunk?

945
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:07,166
That was…

946
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,066
We had a study group.

947
01:06:08,466 --> 01:06:09,533
That's right!

948
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,966
We stayed up all night making PPT at my place.

949
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:15,966
Heungsoo was just sleeping.

950
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,033
Then he came and made a scene.

951
01:06:19,766 --> 01:06:22,466
What study group? Why would you bring them home?

952
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,000
Even bringing guys to your home?

953
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,066
We're all just friends, it's fine.

954
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,033
Ji-eun was also there.

955
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,866
If Ji-eun is at home, ask her to come over.

956
01:06:31,766 --> 01:06:33,533
She’s a vegetarian.

957
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,833
The last time we went to the potherb restaurant, 

958
01:06:36,866 --> 01:06:38,366
didn't you say she was a meat lover?

959
01:06:38,966 --> 01:06:41,766
Ah… she quit eating meat after that.

960
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:43,366
Said she has fatty liver.

961
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,600
No, what’s with this Ji-eun?

962
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:49,466
Is she a cat? Only stay at home?

963
01:06:49,466 --> 01:06:50,833
Even cats meow sometimes.

964
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:52,066
But whenever I call you,

965
01:06:52,266 --> 01:06:54,466
I never once heard her voice.

966
01:06:54,466 --> 01:06:56,733
Then is she supposed to be noisy

967
01:06:57,166 --> 01:06:58,400
when Jaehee's on the phone?

968
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,166
She’s always been quiet.

969
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:07,066
You shouldn't leave your glass empty when you're eating meat.

970
01:07:08,266 --> 01:07:09,866
Why aren't you drinking?

971
01:07:10,966 --> 01:07:11,800
I'm good.

972
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,500
I have to go to court tomorrow morning.

973
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,233
Jaehee,

974
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,733
you should not drink too.

975
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,400
Don’t you have to prepare meeting materials?

976
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,266
He really takes care of me.

977
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,333
He's so obsessed!

978
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,966
She keeps rejecting him,

979
01:07:38,966 --> 01:07:40,833
but he still insists on meeting her.

980
01:07:40,866 --> 01:07:43,066
If she doesn't answer the phone, he'll make a scene.

981
01:07:43,466 --> 01:07:45,466
It seems that he really likes Jaehee.

982
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:48,200
Obsession  is love too.

983
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:51,966
How can obsession be love? It's clearly a mental illness.

984
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:04,433
Heungsoo, I’ve decided.

985
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,266
I want to officially come out as.

986
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,500
I already told my younger brother.

987
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,633
He's not surprised at all.

988
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,500
Said he had already guessed it.

989
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,033
Just leave.

990
01:08:30,566 --> 01:08:32,166
Don’t come to see me anymore.

991
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,433
You're just gonna break up with me like it's nothing?
01:08:44,566 --> 01:08:47,433
If you come out, what will happen to me?

992
01:08:48,466 --> 01:08:50,066
Have you thought about it?

993
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,300
Have you considered my position?

994
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,500
What's about to happen,

995
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,566
can you really handle it?

996
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,266
You know what.

997
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,900
Heungsoo, I…

998
01:09:16,566 --> 01:09:18,866
The wall you put up hurts more

999
01:09:19,466 --> 01:09:21,533
than the insults people throw at me.

1000
01:09:22,566 --> 01:09:24,433
So let's not see each other again.

1001
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:32,033
Alright.

1002
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,200
Let's not see each other again.

1003
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:38,933
I'm tired too.

1004
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:13,666
That's pretty.

1005
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:15,833
Try it on.

1006
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,966
I can't wear this kind of clothes to work.

1007
01:10:19,766 --> 01:10:21,266
Wear it when you're not working.

1008
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,233
You haven't worn high heels lately.

1009
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:26,466
Oppa doesn't like it,

1010
01:10:26,466 --> 01:10:27,866
said I look taller than him.

1011
01:10:28,966 --> 01:10:30,266
Why doesn't he just grow taller?

1012
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:33,966
Why do you always accommodate him?

1013
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:36,166
You're so boring lately, you know?

1014
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:37,933
Also a bit annoying.

1015
01:10:39,066 --> 01:10:40,166
He wants to marry me.

1016
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,833
He’s not young anymore.

1017
01:10:42,866 --> 01:10:44,366
I said I’ll think about it.

1018
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,200
I'm starting to enjoy working.

1019
01:10:47,566 --> 01:10:50,300
Do I have to get married now? I don't know.

1020
01:10:52,266 --> 01:10:55,266
It's not that you're afraid of getting married, you just don't trust him.

1021
01:10:57,066 --> 01:10:59,466
Going with the flow isn't always the right thing, right?

1022
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,666
You too, don't just go with flow thinking about getting a job.

1023
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,566
Can’t you still go to grad school?

1024
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,500
Since you finished your service,

1025
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,833
I haven't seen you write anything.

1026
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,866
Do you know what is the saddest thing in the world?

1027
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,000
A broke gay guy.

1028
01:11:13,966 --> 01:11:15,266
I want to make money.

1029
01:11:16,966 --> 01:11:19,366
Being able to do what you love well is a blessing.

1031
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:27,766
[Heungja Noona] Hey.

1032
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:29,633
[Heungja Noona] Come home.

1033
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,000
[Heungja Noona] Hurry up.

1034
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:32,766
[Heungja Noona] Your mother is here!!!!

1035
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,766
Mom, why are you here?

1036
01:12:54,266 --> 01:12:55,500
Didn't you ask me to send you winter clothes?

1037
01:12:56,066 --> 01:12:57,866
I originally wanted to mail it, but I just decided to send it in person.

1038
01:12:58,266 --> 01:12:59,766
I wanted to see how you're living.

1039
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,500
I also want to give you some kimchi.

1040
01:13:03,266 --> 01:13:04,166
Mom, I...

1041
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,933
- What's actually happening is… - I know.

1042
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,066
Best friends.

1043
01:13:09,466 --> 01:13:11,866
Heungsoo didn't tell me anything about school.

1044
01:13:11,866 --> 01:13:13,866
I didn't even know he had such a good friend.

1045
01:13:14,866 --> 01:13:17,166
You already entered a good company.

1046
01:13:17,666 --> 01:13:19,166
Take care of our Heungsoo, okay?

1047
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,833
Don't worry, Ma'am.

1048
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,633
A fortune teller once said

1049
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:24,166
I have the destiny of a president’s wife,

1050
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,766
and the men around me will be successful no matter what.

1051
01:13:26,766 --> 01:13:27,666
Oh my, really?

1052
01:13:27,766 --> 01:13:28,666
Yes, ma'am!

1053
01:13:30,466 --> 01:13:31,300
Definitely!

1054
01:13:36,066 --> 01:13:36,800
Eat,eat.

1055
01:13:38,366 --> 01:13:39,766
Don’t you like pork liver? Here.

1056
01:13:41,466 --> 01:13:44,133
I’m so happy to eat the food you made, auntie!

1057
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:45,066
Do you want to come to my house?

1058
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,800
Can I, auntie?

1059
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,366
There's no need, I'm working part-time.

1060
01:13:51,366 --> 01:13:52,966
Buy some meat too.

1061
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,600
It'll help you become smart.

1062
01:13:55,266 --> 01:13:56,966
Treat Jaehee to some delicious food too.

1063
01:13:59,266 --> 01:13:59,800
Heungsoo,

1064
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:03,633
I knew your illness would be cured.

1065
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:36,666
What's wrong? Is the heater broken?

1066
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:38,666
Yeah.

1067
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:42,166
Sleep here.

1068
01:14:42,766 --> 01:14:43,666
No, it's fine.

1069
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,866
You don't even have an electric blanket.

1070
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,700
Your mom is such a kind person.

1071
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,100
Very gentle.

1072
01:15:07,766 --> 01:15:09,066
My mom said you're pretty too.

1073
01:15:11,366 --> 01:15:12,266
Must be her presbyopia.
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,700
[Jiseok Oppa]

1074
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,700
Did you sleep well?

1075
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,100
Motherfucker. 
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,700
*Si Bel Homme in French sounds like 씨발놈 (ssi-bal nom) in Korean.

1076
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,433
Jaehee,

1077
01:15:50,566 --> 01:15:51,466
did you eat shit?

1078
01:16:01,366 --> 01:16:02,866
Get off me quickly.

1079
01:16:03,566 --> 01:16:05,933
No, your back is so warm.

1080
01:16:05,966 --> 01:16:06,800
Ugh. Damn it.

1081
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:11,866
Get off me. Why are you acting crazy so early in the morning? Ugh!

1082
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:13,966
- Bad temper! Bad temper! Bad temper!

1083
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,900
Go get milk.

1084
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,000
Did you gain weight?

1085
01:16:20,566 --> 01:16:22,733
-No -Why do you feel heavier?

1086
01:16:24,866 --> 01:16:26,966
It's because you haven't pooped. Drink some milk.

1087
01:16:29,866 --> 01:16:30,266
Oppa.

1088
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:35,266
Damn it, who are you?

1089
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:40,866
-You bastard. -Oppa!

1090
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:42,933
Oppa!

1091
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:46,766
-I'll explain to you. Listen to me. -You get out.

1092
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,800
Jaehee.

1093
01:16:49,766 --> 01:16:50,433
Are you okay?

1094
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,533
Don't touch my woman, you bastard

1095
01:16:54,566 --> 01:16:56,066
- Damn it. - He's gay.

1096
01:17:01,666 --> 01:17:02,666
Heungsoo, he’s gay.

1097
01:17:03,066 --> 01:17:04,100
He likes men.

1098
01:17:04,566 --> 01:17:05,700
He’s Ji-eun.

1099
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,966
But really living with him is the same as living with a girl!

1100
01:17:09,566 --> 01:17:10,566
Ji.. Ji-eun?

1101
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:14,266
- Are you gay? Huh? - Let’s go outside.

1102
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,900
-Let's talk outside. Let's talk outside. -Are you gay?

1103
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:19,566
-Hey, are you gay? -Come outside.

1104
01:17:45,066 --> 01:17:46,466
Sorry, I lied

1105
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:49,466
It's not a lie. You completely tricked me.

1106
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:51,966
If you act like this, I can't date you.

1107
01:17:52,866 --> 01:17:54,366
Do you think this makes sense?

1108
01:17:57,266 --> 01:17:58,066
I get it.

1109
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,100
I'll talk to Heungsoo.

1110
01:18:01,066 --> 01:18:02,166
Give me some time.

1111
01:18:02,266 --> 01:18:03,533
What do you need some time for?

1112
01:18:03,566 --> 01:18:05,066
Just kick that guy out immediately and don't contact him again.

1113
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,033
Weren't you close with Youngwoo oppa?

1114
01:18:09,466 --> 01:18:10,366
Didn't you say he was precious to you?

1115
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:13,000
Didn't you say that you can donate your liver and kidneys for him?

1116
01:18:13,666 --> 01:18:15,300
That's what Heungsoo is to me.

1117
01:18:15,466 --> 01:18:16,533
How can that be the same?

1118
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,000
Are you that dumb?

1119
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:21,866
-Is that even comparable?! -Oppa.

1120
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:24,000
Don't contact that bastard again!

1121
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,366
You’re laughing? Is this funny?

1122
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:36,633
Is this a joke?

1123
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,500
I like ice.

1124
01:18:47,066 --> 01:18:48,166
What are you talking about?

1125
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:49,433
Fine.

1126
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:51,400
Let's break up.

1127
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:54,666
Fuck it.

1128
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,066
Hey.

1129
01:19:01,966 --> 01:19:02,466
Hey!

1130
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:29,900
I'm sorry.

1131
01:19:31,866 --> 01:19:33,766
That wasn't my intention.

1132
01:19:36,066 --> 01:19:37,266
Then what was your intention?

1133
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:39,733
Are you mad?

1134
01:19:40,466 --> 01:19:40,866
No.

1135
01:19:41,566 --> 01:19:43,233
Why would I be mad? I am gay, right?

1136
01:19:45,966 --> 01:19:47,333
You laugh when you’re mad.

1137
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:55,700
Then why ask if you already knew the answer?

1138
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:03,566
Hey,

1139
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:07,666
I can't even tell that to my mother.

1140
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:11,766
I can't even tell that to the mother who gave birth to me.

1141
01:20:12,466 --> 01:20:13,833
Who are you to tell that guy? Fuck.

1142
01:20:16,166 --> 01:20:18,500
Because he was beating you.

1143
01:20:19,166 --> 01:20:21,066
-I didn’t want you to be beaten up. -How about you just let him beat me?

1144
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,133
Then I wouldn't feel like shit now.

1145
01:20:25,566 --> 01:20:26,766
I understand you.

1146
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,466
Who are you to understand me?

1147
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,200
Because you are a normal person?

1148
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:34,866
Really stop being so hypocritical.

1149
01:20:34,866 --> 01:20:36,766
Just say it's none of your business. So you're not interested.

1150
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:39,233
That would be more acceptable.

1151
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,466
Then how long are you going to hide?

1152
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,633
Are you going to spend your whole life just hanging out with me?

1153
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,366
Your graduation, your novel, your life?

1154
01:20:50,366 --> 01:20:52,866
How long are you going to put them off? How long are you gonna keep hiding?

1155
01:20:52,866 --> 01:20:54,433
If I had rich parents like you

1156
01:20:54,466 --> 01:20:55,533
I won't live like this either!

1157
01:20:56,666 --> 01:20:57,866
You living like this,

1158
01:20:58,066 --> 01:20:59,066
acting like you're so strong.

1159
01:21:00,266 --> 01:21:02,366
That's all because you have someone to rely on, no?

1160
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,400
And how exactly am I living?

1161
01:21:08,766 --> 01:21:11,466
Don't let yourself be dragged around by a man, live properly.

1162
01:21:12,966 --> 01:21:13,966
That's not you.

1163
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,900
You think you're the most miserable and pitiful person in the world, don't you?
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,000
[Suho]

1164
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:55,833
Jang Heungsoo!

1165
01:22:01,866 --> 01:22:03,566
If you want love, you have to let your guard down first.

1166
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:04,866
You coward.

1167
01:22:28,566 --> 01:22:31,066
The growth of franchised coffee shops is declining.

1168
01:22:31,366 --> 01:22:34,466
Office workers drink a cup of coffee in the morning

1169
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,400
each cup costs 3,000 won to 5,000 won

1170
01:22:36,466 --> 01:22:37,700
which is a bit hard to afford.

1171
01:22:37,766 --> 01:22:39,166
If it’s just takeout,

1172
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:40,433
there is no need to go somewhere expensive.

1173
01:22:40,466 --> 01:22:42,800
Instead, we'll just buy from cheaper brands.

1174
01:22:42,866 --> 01:22:44,566
Although coffee shops are experiencing a downturn in individual business,

1175
01:22:44,666 --> 01:22:46,566
it maintained impressive sales volume

1176
01:22:46,566 --> 01:22:49,766
but lost its position due to the competition against big companies.

1177
01:22:49,866 --> 01:22:51,866
I’m OBC News’ Lee Jiwon.

1178
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,066
Next up is news about literature.

1179
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:00,900
A movie has been attracting movie-goers lately,

1180
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,166
it is "Call Me By Your Name".

1181
01:23:03,866 --> 01:23:06,366
This movie tells the story of 17-year-old Elio who

1182
01:23:06,366 --> 01:23:08,666
meets 24-year-old Oliver,

1183
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,566
 a story of a first love that is hotter than summer.

1184
01:23:12,366 --> 01:23:15,366
Elliot goes on summer vacation with his family…
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,533
[Suho]

1185
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,533
If obsession is not love,

1186
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:49,100
then I've never been in love.

1187
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:18,400
Thank you, Father.

1188
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,500
In this chaotic world,

1189
01:24:20,966 --> 01:24:23,166
Take this fragile person from your arms

1190
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:26,166
- and guide him to the right path. Thank you, Father. -Mom.

1191
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,366
I'm gay.

1192
01:24:33,066 --> 01:24:33,866
Mom, I...

1193
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,700
the person I love…

1194
01:24:42,766 --> 01:24:43,666
is a man.

1195
01:25:41,366 --> 01:25:41,933
Where are you going?

1196
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,800
Where are you gonna go?

1197
01:25:45,566 --> 01:25:46,300
See a movie.

1198
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:47,466
At this hour?

1199
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,133
Alone?

1200
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,366
Mom?

1201
01:26:27,966 --> 01:26:28,666
Mom!

1202
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:33,866
Mom, are you here?

1203
01:26:39,266 --> 01:26:44,366
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1204
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:48,033
What's wrong, mom?! Wake up, mom!

1205
01:26:57,366 --> 01:26:58,000
This is medical aid. What can I do for you?.

1206
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,433
My mom fainted.

1207
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:02,900
She’s bleeding a lot now.

1208
01:27:02,966 --> 01:27:05,466
-Please hurry up. -Okay, calm down.

1209
01:27:05,966 --> 01:27:09,000
-Where's the address? -Mom! Mom! Please.

1210
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,033
-Please tell us your address. -Mom!

1211
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:16,266
How long has she been bleeding? Hello?

1212
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:21,466
- Raspberry? - What? Is she stabbed in the belly?

1213
01:27:21,466 --> 01:27:23,066
Mom, did you drink raspberry wine?

1214
01:27:23,566 --> 01:27:24,700
She's stabbed by what?

1215
01:27:26,266 --> 01:27:26,766
Hello?

1216
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,633
Please tell us your address and we'll be there right away.

1217
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,100
Hello? Hello?

1218
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:37,833
Can you hear me?

1219
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:42,066
Can you hear me? Hello?

1220
01:27:42,666 --> 01:27:44,966
No. I'm Sorry.
01:28:21,00 --> 01:28:23,966
Call Me By Your Name (Digital)

1221
01:28:43,266 --> 01:28:43,833
Sorry.

1222
01:28:45,966 --> 01:28:47,366
Excuse me…

1223
01:28:53,766 --> 01:28:55,166
Tony Leung is here for you.

1224
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,166
What? What Tony Leung?

1225
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,400
-How are you doing? -Long time no see.

1226
01:29:06,366 --> 01:29:07,066
You look good.

1227
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:10,566
So do you.

1228
01:29:10,866 --> 01:29:12,633
I originally wanted to contact you too.

1229
01:29:14,966 --> 01:29:15,966
I also have something to say to you.

1230
01:29:16,966 --> 01:29:18,700
Really? What is it?

1231
01:29:22,266 --> 01:29:23,666
What did you want to tell me?

1232
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:29,800
Nothing important.

1233
01:29:33,266 --> 01:29:34,166
You say it first.

1234
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,133
I have a boyfriend.

1235
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:42,366
The man you saw in the office just now

1236
01:29:47,366 --> 01:29:48,433
That one...

1237
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:55,566
Great. Congratulations!

1238
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,166
I just want to tell you,

1239
01:30:00,766 --> 01:30:01,966
I think I should.

1240
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:13,300
Here…

1241
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:31,866
I'll leave first.

1242
01:30:40,066 --> 01:30:41,766
The sound of the Team Leader farting just now

1243
01:30:43,366 --> 01:30:44,366
it's so funny.

1244
01:30:44,366 --> 01:30:45,200
I heard it too. I heard that.

1245
01:30:45,566 --> 01:30:48,233
Youngwoo, I told you not to laugh like that.

1246
01:30:48,266 --> 01:30:49,366
Like gay.

1247
01:30:54,066 --> 01:30:55,300
What does ‘like gay’ mean?

1248
01:30:57,566 --> 01:31:00,433
Hey, you were just joking right?

1249
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,166
Why would you joke like that?

1250
01:31:03,866 --> 01:31:04,966
What’s wrong with being gay?

1251
01:31:06,366 --> 01:31:07,866
So what if someone's gay?

1252
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:09,866
Jaehee, are you drunk?

1253
01:31:10,566 --> 01:31:12,233
Youngwoo was just laughing. What's with you?

1254
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:14,133
Just because he's laughing doesn't mean it's okay.

1255
01:31:14,866 --> 01:31:16,466
Some people just laugh it off

1256
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,733
because they don't wanna get embarrassed

1257
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,200
or they don't know how to vent their anger

1258
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,600
like a fool.

1259
01:31:24,066 --> 01:31:26,266
What? Why do you have to be so serious?

1260
01:31:26,766 --> 01:31:28,266
Why do you have to dwell on such a small thing?

1261
01:31:28,266 --> 01:31:31,466
Don't ask me why I‘m dwelling on this!

1262
01:31:32,466 --> 01:31:33,700
Why can't you just treat that thing as if

1263
01:31:33,766 --> 01:31:34,866
it is as important as someone’s life?

1264
01:31:38,866 --> 01:31:40,266
I'm leaving first.

1265
01:31:41,366 --> 01:31:42,100
Koo Jaehee.

1266
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:53,800
Here.

1267
01:31:54,966 --> 01:31:56,100
Let me get you a taxi for you.

1268
01:31:56,266 --> 01:31:57,666
It's dangerous for a woman to walk alone at night.

1269
01:31:58,866 --> 01:32:00,866
You can go home first, Sir.

1270
01:32:00,966 --> 01:32:02,366
If men would just go home early,

1271
01:32:02,366 --> 01:32:04,500
wouldn't it be safer for women to walk alone at night?

1272
01:32:12,366 --> 01:32:13,266
She is a genius.

1273
01:32:33,666 --> 01:32:34,200
Heung!

1274
01:32:40,366 --> 01:32:42,700
The password is you two birthdays.

1275
01:32:44,966 --> 01:32:45,766
How cute.

1276
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,166
Are you drunk?

1277
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,333
I thought it over. I thought about it.

1278
01:32:55,066 --> 01:32:56,466
That bastard is not gay.

1279
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,266
You cheated on me and lied, right?

1280
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:05,866
You’re drunk.

1281
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,733
Let’s talk after you sober up.

1282
01:33:08,766 --> 01:33:10,666
You two worked together to fool me.

1283
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:11,266
No?!

1284
01:33:18,166 --> 01:33:19,966
Jaehee, it’s okay.

1285
01:33:20,366 --> 01:33:20,966
It’s fine.

1286
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:25,033
I will forgive you because I love you.

1287
01:33:25,066 --> 01:33:26,933
Jaehee.  Jaehee.

1288
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,566
I will forgive you. Let's be together again.

1289
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:32,800
No.

1290
01:33:34,566 --> 01:33:35,066
What?

1291
01:33:40,766 --> 01:33:41,466
I said no.

1292
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,633
Get out of my house now.

1293
01:34:05,166 --> 01:34:07,266
You damn woman! Damn you!

1294
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,933
Damn you!

1295
01:34:10,966 --> 01:34:13,266
I told you I would forgive you!

1296
01:34:13,466 --> 01:34:15,833
Why! Why!

1297
01:34:20,766 --> 01:34:21,400
Where.

1298
01:34:22,166 --> 01:34:22,766
Damn it!

1299
01:34:42,366 --> 01:34:45,166
The number you dialed is busy now. Please leave a message after the beep…
01:34:48,166 --> 01:34:49,000
[Heungja Noona]
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:56,000
[Kim Jiseok]
(Accept) (Hang up)

1300
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:06,466
Hello?

1301
01:35:08,866 --> 01:35:09,466
Heungsoo.

1302
01:35:12,766 --> 01:35:13,666
Where are you? What's wrong?

1303
01:35:16,666 --> 01:35:20,366
Jaehee. Go to the police station! I’m on my way now.

1304
01:35:21,666 --> 01:35:24,866
Jaehee! Stay calm! Don’t cry.

1305
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,133
I'll go there right now, okay?

1306
01:35:28,066 --> 01:35:29,566
-I'll go now. -Yeah.

1307
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:13,566
Gotta get the ball here.

1308
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,033
The goal is right in front of him!

1309
01:36:16,166 --> 01:36:19,466
-Quick! - Go! Go!

1310
01:36:19,766 --> 01:36:20,766
-Go!

1311
01:36:23,366 --> 01:36:25,066
-Goal scored! -Goal scored!

1312
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,300
-They made it!

1313
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,533
Turn left. Turn left! It's faster here.

1314
01:36:38,566 --> 01:36:39,466
Wait a minute! Wait!

1315
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:40,766
Stop! Stop!

1316
01:36:47,466 --> 01:36:48,333
Kim Jiseok!

1317
01:36:57,666 --> 01:36:58,733
Son of a bitch!

1318
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,766
- What's going on? -He attacked me.

1319
01:37:28,066 --> 01:37:28,766
I’m the victim!

1320
01:37:28,766 --> 01:37:30,066
Looking like a soaked chicken in the rain,

1321
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:30,933
- so fucking annoying! -Damn it!

1322
01:37:30,966 --> 01:37:32,800
- Let go. What are you going to do?
- Why are you…

1323
01:37:32,966 --> 01:37:34,666
- Damn it, I'm going to sue this guy. - Please calm down.

1324
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:35,700
I’m a lawyer.

1325
01:37:35,766 --> 01:37:36,500
- What? Damn it. -Damn it.

1326
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:37,233
Then go on and sue!

1327
01:37:37,466 --> 01:37:39,066
Officer, they both took off their clothes and

1328
01:37:39,066 --> 01:37:40,433
were sticking to each other tightly.

1329
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,200
My woman hides it from me that

1330
01:37:42,266 --> 01:37:43,166
she’s living secretly with another man.

1331
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,466
And I have been deceived like this for years.

1332
01:37:45,466 --> 01:37:47,466
Is there a man in this world who wouldn’t be angry?

1333
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:49,466
And I was beaten up!

1334
01:37:49,466 --> 01:37:52,066
Like this. Look here! It’s true.

1335
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:54,933
- It's too much. - It's too much.

1336
01:37:54,966 --> 01:37:56,200
Right, it's really too much.

1337
01:37:56,266 --> 01:37:57,466
I even got beaten like this.

1338
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,866
But when I caught them red-handed,

1339
01:37:59,866 --> 01:38:01,366
do you know what they said to me?

1340
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:03,300
They said they were just friends

1341
01:38:04,066 --> 01:38:05,366
and he’s gay. Gay!

1342
01:38:05,766 --> 01:38:07,466
Hey, are you gay?

1343
01:38:08,266 --> 01:38:09,000
If you are gay,

1344
01:38:09,066 --> 01:38:10,700
give me proof that you're gay.

1345
01:38:11,266 --> 01:38:14,066
I asked you to show photos of you having sex with men!

1346
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:16,000
- You bastard! - What?

1347
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
- Hit me! Hit me! - You damn bastard!

1348
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,100
- Hit me! - Quiet! Quiet!

1349
01:38:20,166 --> 01:38:21,866
- Just hit me. - Calm down, the two of you.

1350
01:38:22,066 --> 01:38:23,233
Please sit down, please sit down

1351
01:38:23,566 --> 01:38:26,366
That is to say, your girlfriend is

1352
01:38:27,266 --> 01:38:29,400
living secretly with this man behind your back.

1353
01:38:29,966 --> 01:38:32,966
He lied about being gay and violently assaulted you?

1354
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,200
Yes, that's right.

1355
01:38:35,866 --> 01:38:36,933
Is he telling the truth?

1356
01:38:39,266 --> 01:38:40,533
Answer him!

1357
01:38:41,766 --> 01:38:43,600
You did cheat on me!

1358
01:38:43,966 --> 01:38:45,466
- Yes, I'm a slut! - Yes, I'm gay!

1359
01:38:48,366 --> 01:38:50,200
- Why are you a slut?

1360
01:38:51,166 --> 01:38:52,433
It's true that I'm gay. 

1361
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,533
Jae Hee and I are just friends.

1362
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:01,333
She knows me best in this world!

1363
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,600
And I know her. The Jaehee that I know

1364
01:39:06,466 --> 01:39:08,466
is definitely not that kind of person.

1365
01:39:09,666 --> 01:39:10,766
We’re just...

1366
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,133
real best friends, even my mom knows!

1367
01:39:17,266 --> 01:39:18,666
Best friends can live together, you know?

1368
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,933
The house rent in Seoul is fucking expensive!

1369
01:39:25,466 --> 01:39:30,033
I know we look weird to others.

1370
01:39:31,366 --> 01:39:32,133
I know that.

1371
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,733
But we're not weird at all.

1372
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:40,700
Are we weird?

1373
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:47,700
No.

1374
01:39:48,966 --> 01:39:49,700
Not at all!

1375
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:55,266
Bravo! Bravo!

1376
01:39:55,266 --> 01:39:56,466
Wonderful!

1377
01:39:57,066 --> 01:39:58,066
It's not weird.

1378
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:03,433
Great!

1379
01:40:09,966 --> 01:40:10,733
Be careful. Be careful.

1380
01:40:11,666 --> 01:40:12,433
Sit here.

1381
01:40:24,466 --> 01:40:26,166
If I had known earlier, I would have listened to you.

1382
01:40:26,866 --> 01:40:27,900
Why am I like this?

1383
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:29,300
That’s just you,

1384
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,200
fearlessly facing all the challenges, breaking into pieces

1385
01:40:32,966 --> 01:40:34,166
yet will still do it with a smile.

1386
01:40:34,966 --> 01:40:36,366
The most clumsy girl in the world.

1387
01:40:36,866 --> 01:40:39,566
Why do your compliments sound like insults?

1388
01:40:39,566 --> 01:40:40,266
Hey, Koo Jaehee

1389
01:40:41,066 --> 01:40:42,766
You being yourself can never be your weakness.

1390
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:48,666
It hurts.

1391
01:40:55,666 --> 01:40:56,433
So cold!

1392
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:59,433
Jaehee.

1393
01:41:01,666 --> 01:41:02,933
Suho left me.

1394
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,366
He said he got a boyfriend.

1395
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:17,200
I thought he'd always be there.

1396
01:41:19,866 --> 01:41:21,233
He was always there.

1397
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,133
So I never even once said that

1398
01:41:26,466 --> 01:41:27,300
I missed him.

1399
01:41:34,566 --> 01:41:35,666
But I really miss him.

1400
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:44,666
Just cry, dummy.

1401
01:41:45,266 --> 01:41:46,266
You can cry.

1402
01:42:21,166 --> 01:42:21,966
You said you didn't hear it?

1403
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:23,900
The presentation is in 20 minutes.

1404
01:42:23,966 --> 01:42:25,500
Do you think you can get away with it?

1405
01:42:26,266 --> 01:42:27,666
- Where is Chief Jang? - Yes!

1406
01:42:28,066 --> 01:42:28,733
Come here quickly.

1407
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:30,133
Hey, Jang Jungwoo.

1408
01:42:30,266 --> 01:42:32,866
Have you told her what I said yesterday?

1409
01:42:33,966 --> 01:42:34,966
Yes, I have.

1410
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:37,200
You have? But look at this!

1411
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,766
Look at this! Damn it!

1412
01:42:39,666 --> 01:42:40,666
Are you sure you told her everything?

1413
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,466
Cancel the presentation today!

1414
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,533
Prepare another one for tomorrow. Understand?

1415
01:42:46,066 --> 01:42:46,566
Yes.

1416
01:42:48,266 --> 01:42:49,900
Damn.

1417
01:42:50,466 --> 01:42:52,200
Sir, I didn’t hear it.

1418
01:42:52,266 --> 01:42:53,366
I told you everything!

1419
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,166
I told you in the meeting.

1420
01:42:56,966 --> 01:42:59,133
Write a new one and send it to me as soon as possible. Do you understand?

1421
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:02,133
But how would we know

1422
01:43:02,166 --> 01:43:03,566
what they talked about?

1423
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,033
Every time we ask them to tell us the requirements,

1424
01:43:05,066 --> 01:43:06,366
they just turned a deaf ear to it.

1425
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:09,066
It seems I have to learn to smoke too.

1426
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:11,500
But I'll get scolded for smoking.

1427
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,733
Right. I feel sad for you. Damn.

1428
01:43:13,766 --> 01:43:15,933
When can we receive accurate information?

1429
01:43:15,966 --> 01:43:17,766
As a senior, I still got

1430
01:43:17,766 --> 01:43:19,366
shouted at by the director because of that.

1431
01:43:20,466 --> 01:43:21,466
Do your job well!

1432
01:43:21,566 --> 01:43:22,566
Don't let me hear those things anymore.

1433
01:43:23,466 --> 01:43:24,200
Did you see it just now?

1434
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:28,900
Whether it’s a report or PPT material

1435
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,566
check it again before handing it in.

1436
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:35,400
Use a larger font size for the slides.

1437
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:37,866
The management asked for it.

1438
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,600
I didn't know the meeting room was here.

1439
01:43:41,866 --> 01:43:43,066
You should have told me.

1440
01:43:43,366 --> 01:43:44,733
If everyone had known it,

1441
01:43:45,066 --> 01:43:47,100
what happened just now wouldn't have happened.

1442
01:43:47,466 --> 01:43:48,366
Isn't that right, Chief?

1443
01:43:50,166 --> 01:43:54,200
Now that I know, I won't miss the meeting.

1444
01:43:55,966 --> 01:43:57,966
The weather is so nice.

1445
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:01,466
We will have meetings here from now on, right?

1446
01:44:02,366 --> 01:44:04,566
It turns out we were lingering at the wrong place.

1447
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,266
Such a pity.

1448
01:44:07,066 --> 01:44:08,066
It feels so great!

1449
01:44:08,066 --> 01:44:09,766
Did you see the Chief's face?

1450
01:44:13,866 --> 01:44:17,366
Don't say I'm old!

1451
01:44:17,466 --> 01:44:22,366
I'm 28, I'm still young.

1452
01:44:32,566 --> 01:44:36,233
So happy! I'm so happy!

1453
01:44:36,666 --> 01:44:39,366
Since I'm so happy, let me just say one thing.

1454
01:44:39,466 --> 01:44:44,666
Today's newcomers spend all their energy looking for a job.

1455
01:44:44,866 --> 01:44:48,366
After joining the company, they no longer have the energy to burn.

1456
01:44:48,366 --> 01:44:49,766
When I was young...
01:44:53,366 --> 01:44:57,000
[The Joy of Love]

1457
01:45:09,066 --> 01:45:11,166
Step aside, step aside

1458
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:13,066
Get inside.

1459
01:45:21,566 --> 01:45:22,766
I don't like her.

1460
01:45:40,066 --> 01:45:42,133
Yes, that's right.

1461
01:45:43,066 --> 01:45:44,766
It's understandable that the director doesn't like her.

1462
01:45:45,966 --> 01:45:48,666
Her nickname is Moment Koo

1463
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:51,400
Koo Jaehee who only lives in the moment.

1464
01:45:56,266 --> 01:45:57,266
She's quite beautiful.

1465
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,266
and Cool!

1466
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:02,500
Cool! So cool!

1467
01:46:04,166 --> 01:46:04,866
I like her so much.

1468
01:46:05,566 --> 01:46:06,366
What should I do?

1469
01:46:07,966 --> 01:46:08,400
No idea.

1470
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:11,166
I came out to smoke now. Now I have to go in.

1471
01:46:12,166 --> 01:46:12,833
Bye, then-
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,500
I'm hanging up.

1472
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:33,500
33 Years Old.

1473
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:39,866
So why? Out of so many crazy things,

1474
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:40,800
why would you choose marriage?

1475
01:46:41,666 --> 01:46:43,200
We've been dating for about 3 years.

1476
01:46:43,266 --> 01:46:44,800
the only thing left to do now is getting married.

1477
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,566
Didn't I tell you?

1478
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:47,566
I'll do everything I can.

1479
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,300
You'll do everything you can. I know that.

1480
01:46:50,566 --> 01:46:51,733
But getting married is still…

1481
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:53,900
Why?

1482
01:46:55,166 --> 01:46:55,733
Are you hurt?

1483
01:47:00,766 --> 01:47:02,500
Hey, is this from that mama's boy?

1484
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:05,066
Wow, this is…

1485
01:47:06,166 --> 01:47:06,666
Try it on.

1486
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:08,233
I think it suits you very well. Try it.

1487
01:47:08,266 --> 01:47:09,700
This suited you quite well back then.

1488
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:10,966
No, you can fit yourself in this. Try it.

1489
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:11,866
It really suits you.

1490
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,100
Hurry up and put it on.

1491
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:14,000
Okay, just throw it away.

1492
01:47:22,166 --> 01:47:22,666
So,

1493
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:26,066
do you rank first in his heart?
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
[Minjun]

1494
01:47:41,766 --> 01:47:42,666
Hi, darling.

1495
01:47:45,666 --> 01:47:47,866
Yeah, I'm packing up now.

1496
01:47:48,666 --> 01:47:49,866
Heungsoo is helping me.

1497
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:53,166
Really?

1498
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,100
So beautiful!

1499
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:42,466
Yeah, she's really beautiful!

1500
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:45,200
So beautiful!

1501
01:48:45,966 --> 01:48:46,866
So stunning!

1502
01:48:59,666 --> 01:49:02,966
Coming next is the congratulatory song.

1503
01:49:04,766 --> 01:49:05,366
Thank you.

1504
01:49:08,966 --> 01:49:12,366
The song will be performed by Jaehee’s most cherished friend,

1505
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,933
Mr. Jang Heungsoo.

1506
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:23,666
Jaehee,

1507
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:32,366
I wish you a good life.

1508
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:46,000
You don't know me. You don't know me.

1509
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,166
You don't know me. You don't know me.

1510
01:49:48,166 --> 01:49:51,466
So shut up boy. So shut up boy.

1511
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:55,066
So shut up boy. So shut up, shut up!

1512
01:49:55,466 --> 01:49:59,466
You couldn't say a thing in front of me.

1513
01:49:59,466 --> 01:50:03,066
but you talk badly about me behind my back.

1514
01:50:05,166 --> 01:50:07,333
I'm dumbfounded.

1515
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,566
Hello, Hello, Hello

1516
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,500
A girl like me,

1517
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,366
It seems like you are seeing it for the first time.

1518
01:50:15,566 --> 01:50:19,966
Why do you judge me?

1519
01:50:19,966 --> 01:50:23,066
Perhaps, Are you afraid of me?

1520
01:50:23,066 --> 01:50:26,766
A bad girl on the outside but a good girl on the inside

1521
01:50:26,766 --> 01:50:28,766
You don't even know me well.

1522
01:50:28,766 --> 01:50:30,666
You just see what's outside.

1523
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:34,100
Think of me as a pitiful woman,

1524
01:50:34,166 --> 01:50:37,166
I find your gaze to be funny.

1525
01:50:37,166 --> 01:50:38,900
When I dance, I'm a Bad Girl.

1526
01:50:38,966 --> 01:50:40,766
When I love, I'm a Good Girl.

1527
01:50:40,766 --> 01:50:42,966
You become mesmerized

1528
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,666
when you watch me dance.

1529
01:50:44,666 --> 01:50:47,166
But after you are done, you speak ill of me.

1530
01:50:47,466 --> 01:50:49,866
No wonder parents said it's unbearable

1531
01:50:50,066 --> 01:50:51,766
to see their daughter smiling so wide at her own wedding.

1532
01:51:01,666 --> 01:51:03,900
You’re even more tacky.

1533
01:51:06,066 --> 01:51:07,966
Hello, Hello, Hello

1534
01:51:08,066 --> 01:51:09,166
If you don’t have confidence

1535
01:51:09,166 --> 01:51:11,666
Just get behind me

1536
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:14,033
You just need to take a step back.

1537
01:51:14,066 --> 01:51:18,800
Don't you know that you heart can be clearly seen?

1538
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:23,133
A bad girl on the outside but a good girl on the inside

1539
01:51:23,166 --> 01:51:25,266
You don't know me very well.

1540
01:51:25,266 --> 01:51:27,266
You only see what's outside.

1541
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,466
She came into my life

1542
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:37,800
and recognized me.

1543
01:51:38,766 --> 01:51:40,800
We openly shared our pain

1544
01:51:40,966 --> 01:51:42,866
and gave everything to each other without question.

1545
01:51:43,966 --> 01:51:45,866
She remembers the moment I loved

1546
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,700
and my facial expressions then.

1547
01:51:49,566 --> 01:51:51,900
She showed me that I am enough as I am.

1548
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,000
The memory drive of my 20s.

1549
01:51:55,966 --> 01:51:57,833
Farewell, Jaehee.

1550
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,466
If obsession is not love

1551
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,266
then I have never loved.

I forgot to tell you just now.

Do you want to go on a blind date?

Where did the blind date come from all of a sudden?

1561
01:53:44,966 --> 01:53:46,133
Who is he? Is he handsome?

1562
01:53:46,166 --> 01:53:47,666
How about a police officer? What do you think?

1563
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,566
Better than a criminal of course.

1564
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:52,366
Okay, then I'll make the arrangement.

1565
01:53:52,366 --> 01:53:54,766
