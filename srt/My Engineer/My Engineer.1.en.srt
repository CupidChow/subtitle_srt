[My Engineer]
[Episode 1]

2
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,625
That's him, ladies.

3
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,800
That is Bohn, the Man of the Moon last year!

4
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,800
I wonder what he does at home
at night with that handsome look.

5
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,050
Let me know when you decided.

6
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,776
He is a womanizer.

7
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,102
He is the pinnacle of bad boys.

8
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,350
He punished the freshmen to run around
the field with only underwear.

9
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,850
Hey! Run faster!

10
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,475
Did you forget your breakfast or what?

11
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,450
Frong, join us.

12
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,650
If you want a husband that you like,

13
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,075
Frong is your best choice.

14
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:42,325
He was also one of the Men of the Moon last year.

15
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,225
I wish I could spend a night with him.

16
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,350
Frong and Bohn got almost the same
number of votes last year.

17
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,375
But sadly,

18
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,300
he lost to Bohn in the last round.

19
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:54,725
Since then, they've been
competing against each other.

20
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,900
Okay, the individual portrait is done.

21
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,450
Next, we'll have a group photo.

22
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,850
Can't you edit my picture into it?

23
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,500
So that you need not take my pictures.

24
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,750
Well...

25
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,850
It must be exhausting working for
someone so unprofessional, right?

26
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,775
Who says I am not taking the photo?

27
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,350
Okay, let's carry on.

28
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,075
Okay, we're done with the still pictures.

29
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:34,850
Next, we'll take some photos with a sexier style.

30
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,516
I don't want to cheer for Frong anymore.

31
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:58,425
I just want to be Bohn's biggest fan!

32
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:00,875
Hashtag: Team Bohn!

33
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,375
Bohn, here is your uniform and bag.

34
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:22,600
Thank you.

35
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:23,225
You're welcome.

36
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:28,700
Bohn, Frong, come over here.

37
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:33,725
Everyone, take a rest.

38
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:35,625
We'll have another session this evening.

39
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,575
At the meantime, let's wait at the coffee shop.

40
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:38,600
I have the reservations.

41
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,275
Sure.

42
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:41,800
Never mind, I don't like coffee anyway.

43
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:44,200
Okay.

44
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,400
Who on earth would sleep here?

45
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,625
Hey!

46
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:10,200
Are you Sleeping Beauty?

47
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,075
That giant lizard will bite your head off.

48
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:15,925
[Beware of Giant Lizard]

49
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:17,325
Oh, no!
[Same sound as "Lizard" In Thai]

50
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:23,875
Hey, wake up!

51
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,700
Hey!

52
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:28,950
Wake up! Wake up!

53
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,425
Ah!

54
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:46,575
What were you thinking?

55
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,725
What were you doing to me?

56
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,925
Are you trying to violate me?

57
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:51,225
Oh, no!

58
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,425
Hear me out!

59
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:55,000
I want nothing from you.

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,172
Stop making excuses.

61
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:57,300
I saw everything.

62
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:00,625
Hold on, listen up!

63
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:02,525
I wasn't trying to do anything!

64
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:04,150
That giant lizard was trying to eat you.

65
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,275
So I woke you up!

66
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:06,350
What giant lizard?

67
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,825
I always take my nap here.

68
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,950
I've never seen one around.

69
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:10,075
Then what is that thing?

70
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,425
Oh, no!
[Same sound as "Lizard" In Thai]

71
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,575
I am sorry for punching you just now.

72
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,150
Oh!

73
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,800
Your nose is bleeding.

74
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,925
Curse it, the bleeding won't stop.

75
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,525
Hey, what do you want?

76
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,925
Cleaning up your nose.

77
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,225
The blood will stain your shirt.

78
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:46,300
I don't need it.

79
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,875
Do it yourself.

80
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,450
The bleeding will stop eventually.

81
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,975
I can't go to the shooting in this shape.

82
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:06,675
Pooping? What pooping?
[Same sound as "shoot" in Thai]

83
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,325
Do you need to poop?

84
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:09,575
Shut it!

85
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,175
Hello?

86
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,100
Miss,

87
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,500
I ran into some accident,

88
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,775
I can't join the shooting session.

89
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,675
I am terribly sorry.

90
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,425
Well...

91
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:37,275
Did I just ruin your job?

92
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,700
Don't worry, it's that important...

93
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:44,450
It's very important!

94
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,775
I've been preparing for one whole year for it!

95
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:49,850
And now you single-handedly ruined it.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,750
Oh, I am so sorry.

97
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:53,255
But you are at fault too.

98
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,800
Your face came so close to me,

99
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,325
anyone else would think that was for a kiss.

100
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,883
Who would want to kiss you?

101
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,100
Are you out of your mind?

102
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:00,550
Fine, this is my fault.

103
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,750
What are you doing?

104
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:11,225
Compensation for your loss.

105
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,725
Is this enough?

106
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:15,025
Just keep your money.

107
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:19,100
There is another way you can make up for me.

108
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:23,400
What do you need of me?

109
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,610
Well...

110
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,975
Take me to a hospital.

111
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:30,642
What?

112
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,383
It was just a nosebleed,

113
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:33,600
is it necessary?

114
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:34,800
Are you insane!

115
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,675
Are you going to run away?

116
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,950
It was you who punched me.

117
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,800
Ouch! It hurts!

118
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,625
The bleeding has not stopped.

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,125
I thought you were taking me
to a private hospital.

120
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,600
Who knows...

121
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,975
you brought me to the school's clinic.

122
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,725
It's just a nosebleed.

123
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,625
Do I need to send you into the ICU?

124
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,200
You should be grateful you are in a clinic.

125
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,700
Who are you?

126
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,550
What school are you from?

127
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,950
Why haven't I seen you before?

128
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,575
Why do you want to know?

129
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,375
Well...

130
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,375
I'll just call you "Roach".

131
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,500
What is that supposed to mean?

132
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:32,050
Wait,

133
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:33,900
are you saying I am a cockroach?

134
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,975
No!

135
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,899
That was a compliment for you.

136
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,125
You look all clean and shiny.

137
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,675
You are nothing like a cockroach.

138
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:47,625
Fine, then I'll call you...

139
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,025
Lizard Man!

140
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,550
Lizard? What lizard?

141
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,575
You are insane.

142
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,290
I don't care.

143
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,025
Your face looks like a lizard.

144
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,750
Isn't that right?

145
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,975
Lizard Man.

146
00:09:57,525 --> 00:09:58,478
Fine!

147
00:09:58,825 --> 00:09:59,475
Roach!

148
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,525
Lizard Man!

149
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,550
Roach!

150
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,400
Lizard Man.

151
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,225
Roach.

152
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:06,500
You are the Lizard Man!

153
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,300
Hello, Duen.

154
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,625
Hello.

155
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,450
Thara.

156
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,700
Are you on duty today?

157
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:30,025
Yes, I am.

158
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:31,725
I've been busy lately.

159
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,275
I couldn't make it back to school.

160
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,175
I see.

161
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,800
So you are Duen.

162
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,375
You are a Medical student.

163
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,825
None of your businesses.

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,075
You look familiar to me.

165
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:45,700
Are you Bohn?

166
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:49,647
Oh!

167
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,250
You are the Man of the Moon
from Medical College.

168
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:56,375
We've met on the inter-college
Star and Moon Contest.

169
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,659
Oh!

170
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:02,725
You made it into the contest
with that awful face?

171
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,575
And you get to be a doctor with your face.

172
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,225
Hold on.

173
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,900
Do you know each other?

174
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,625
Such a small world.

175
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:12,475
I don't know this man. We were just...

176
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:14,950
He was walking and he tripped himself.

177
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,275
He is mentally challenged.

178
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,625
So you two are friends now?

179
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,325
What?

180
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,775
He and I?

181
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,100
No in a million years.

182
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,710
But he wasn't being formal at all.

183
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,150
Bohn is a sophomore, right?

184
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:34,700
You don't need manner for someone like him.

185
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:37,150
He doesn't mind the lack of formalities.

186
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:38,950
So he is just a "dude" for me.

187
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,026
I see.

188
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,625
See you.

189
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,138
Sure.

190
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:45,450
See you next time.

191
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:45,800
Yes.

192
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:46,600
Goodbye.

193
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,050
Okay.

194
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:05,975
What are you laughing at?

195
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,250
That nosebleed caused brain damage?

196
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,125
I was laughing at your name.

197
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,700
Duen, it means moon.

198
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:14,100
It's like a girl's name.

199
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,575
And your name means "ranting".

200
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:19,275
Maybe because you were so noisy as a kid.

201
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:20,350
So your mother gave you that name.

202
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,375
That's enough!

203
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,625
I am not going to argue with
Medical student who uses violence!

204
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,825
Fine, I want to get away from you anyway!

205
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,350
You are annoying.

206
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:34,250
Here, take this.

207
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,271
This is not over yet.

208
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:43,564
I haven't taken my medicines.

209
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,075
Do you want me to feed you?

210
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,782
No.

211
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:50,575
But I can't take it on empty stomach.

212
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,250
So you need to treat me to a meal.

213
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,875
I am not your personal driver.

214
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,842
I could have enjoyed my meal...

215
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:03,775
at the shooting set peacefully.

216
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,350
But a Roach came out of nowhere...

217
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,575
and punched right at my nose.

218
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,125
And I had to be in this little rustic clinic.

219
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,050
Fine.

220
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,875
This is over after you got your meal, okay?

221
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,150
What do you have in mind?

222
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,840
Good.

223
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,782
This is a shop...

224
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,950
you would love.

225
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,600
Look at the menu first.

226
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,250
I need to use the washroom.

227
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,075
Fine.

228
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:06,750
Hello, Brother Ta.

229
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:08,950
Hello, Bohn.

230
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,771
Hey,

231
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:15,450
I can see it.

232
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:17,475
You abducted another fresh young man.

233
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,250
I thought you don't fancy this stuff.

234
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,435
Back then when Mike was wooing you,

235
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:25,050
why weren't you interested at all?

236
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:26,700
This guy is just a junior.

237
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,500
I am not his cup of tea anyway.

238
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:32,255
He likes men like your style.

239
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,625
Really?

240
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,500
I am making my move now.

241
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,135
Really?

242
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:41,200
He came here with me just to see you.

243
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,125
Are you sure?

244
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:43,025
Of course.

245
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,850
I am serious.

246
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,800
What took you so long?

247
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,775
I've already chosen dozens from the menu.

248
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:17,425
I am starving.

249
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:18,700
Don't bothering ordering.

250
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:20,400
I made the order for you.

251
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,350
What is this nonsense?

252
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:23,350
Why are you wasting my time here?

253
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,525
Crab-sticks and fried eggs.

254
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,200
A special recipe for a special someone.

255
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,925
This is delicious!

256
00:15:57,325 --> 00:16:00,275
It's been ages since I had fried eggs this good.

257
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:01,550
Do you like eggs?

258
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:03,975
Yes, I love eggs.

259
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,025
We are the same.

260
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:08,975
I love eggs too.

261
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:11,546
This is odd.

262
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,130
When I fry eggs at home,

263
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,725
why couldn't it be so delicious?

264
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,773
The eggs...

265
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,225
taste delicious if someone made them for you.

266
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,850
But why?

267
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,450
If you wish to know,

268
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:24,450
come with me to the kitchen.

269
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,725
Can I?

270
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,075
I'll show you how it's made.

271
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:29,025
Thank you.

272
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,100
Let's go.

273
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,350
Wait, hold on.

274
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,250
I think you can show him
your recipe some other day.

275
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:37,025
My friend here is hungry.

276
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,750
But you said you aren't interested.

277
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:43,025
Hold on,

278
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:44,850
I really want him to show me how it's done.

279
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,500
Trust me on this.

280
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,575
You don't want to see how he made them.

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,625
What?

282
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,775
Next time, perhaps.

283
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:54,465
Fine.

284
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:56,450
Whatever.

285
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,650
Are you out of your mind?

286
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,850
Do you really want to see his kitchen?

287
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,050
I just wanted to know
how he made the eggs so delicious.

288
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,800
How is that a problem?

289
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,575
The eggs he meant is not these eggs.

290
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,725
Idiot.

291
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,875
So what is it then?

292
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:20,750
Or is it...

293
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:22,850
some kind of special pan he uses?

294
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,900
This is amazing!

295
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,975
Hey!

296
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:30,675
I should have fed you to the lizard back then.

297
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:38,950
What is wrong with you?

298
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,050
You went to the doctor and had your medicine.

299
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,625
I have made up for you.

300
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,175
Lizard Man.

301
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,700
Not yet. You have to take me somewhere.

302
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:05,125
Back to my house.

303
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:08,025
This request is way too much.

304
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:11,075
Oh, no! It hurts!

305
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,716
I can't drive with this pain.

306
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,225
Fine, it's over after I sent you home.

307
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,950
Curse it, I shouldn't have slept there.

308
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,925
Handsome big brother, buy some flowers.

309
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,225
I haven't sold any flower today.

310
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,425
No, thanks.

311
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,100
Come on, Roach.

312
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:38,075
Mother, I couldn't sell any flower.

313
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,000
I can't buy you any food tonight.

314
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,450
Hush, don't cry. How much is this?

315
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:50,225
20 baht each.

316
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,175
20 baht each?

317
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:52,925
I'll take all of them.

318
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:55,150
And you can keep the change.

319
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:56,325
Here is the money.

320
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,250
Thank you, handsome big brother.

321
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,950
But on one condition.

322
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,000
Can I give you a little kiss?

323
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,725
Fine, just one kiss.

324
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:09,675
Okay.

325
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,200
This big brother here can't kiss you.

326
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,400
Because he is my boyfriend.

327
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,075
Hey!

328
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,100
What? A guy can't be with another guy!

329
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,525
You don't believe it?

330
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:24,550
Watch closely.

331
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:33,900
My goodness! You are kissing a boy!

332
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,800
What was that all about?

333
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:46,625
It's an honor to be kissed by me.

334
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,225
All the girls in school wish I could kiss them.

335
00:19:50,225 --> 00:19:51,325
But they never get the chance.

336
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:53,025
But I don't want your kiss!

337
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:56,925
Actually,

338
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:59,150
I just don't want the girl to bother you.

339
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,350
I am sure you know why.

340
00:20:00,525 --> 00:20:01,875
She was forced to sell those flowers.

341
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,850
But at least let her make a living.

342
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:08,875
We can't choose how we are born.

343
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,600
But if I ever see her again,

344
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,650
I will still try to help.

345
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:22,075
Fine, you don't need to drive me home.

346
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,925
I have another request.

347
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,900
What is it?

348
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,775
For the next 30 days,

349
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,525
each and every morning,

350
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:42,025
you must buy a flower from those kids
and send them to me.

351
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,375
It's done.

352
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,700
Hey.

353
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:05,275
Welcome home, Dad.

354
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,225
Who is the good girl we have here?

355
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,903
You helped your mother out with dinner too.

356
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:10,850
Such a great daughter.

357
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:13,375
My good girl indeed.

358
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,850
We are having a feast tonight.

359
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,975
These look delicious.

360
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:22,650
Don't start eating yet, we must wait for Brother.

361
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,955
Here he is.

362
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:28,975
Dad, Mum.

363
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:29,975
Welcome home.

364
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:31,624
Hello, Brother.

365
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,350
Welcome home, Duen.

366
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,325
Good girl.

367
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,950
The dinner is ready, join us.

368
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,925
I had my dinner outside.

369
00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:47,550
Daonua, your big brother is a little tired today.

370
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,850
I need to charge up my energy.

371
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,000
Here, a hug.

372
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,800
Okay. My battery is charged.

373
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,950
I am taking a shower.

374
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,050
You are adorable.

375
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:04,750
Off I go.

376
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:12,750
What's wrong with Duen?

377
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,325
Judging from his look, he had a fight
with his girlfriend.

378
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:18,925
He has grown into a real man.

379
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:21,700
He was always focusing on study.

380
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,125
I thought he would be a lonely scholar.

381
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:26,900
Speaking which, what does
his girlfriend look like?

382
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,725
I wonder if she is as pretty as his mother.

383
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,125
Honey.

384
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,650
Let's have dinner.

385
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,600
Place the dishes properly.

386
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,907
Right here.

387
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,915
Just place it there.

388
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:52,425
For the next 30 days,

389
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:58,575
you must buy a flower from those kids
and send them to me.

390
00:22:58,825 --> 00:22:59,725
You are crazy.

391
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,050
How is that possible?

392
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
You just said you wanted to help that little girl.

393
00:23:07,175 --> 00:23:08,325
You are nothing but all talks.

394
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:10,050
That is totally different from

395
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,100
sending you flowers.

396
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,825
I did save you from that giant lizard.

397
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,125
I don't care.

398
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
At 9 a.m. tomorrow,

399
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:24,525
send the flower to Engineering College.

400
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,325
This is crazy.

401
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:45,775
Come in.

402
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,625
Little Dao, what's wrong?

403
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,550
Can you lend me your hairdryer?

404
00:23:58,825 --> 00:24:01,850
Sure, do you need to dry your hair?

405
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:02,975
I can do it for you.

406
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,675
I am not using it to dry my hair.

407
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,150
So why do you need it?

408
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:25,850
It was raining today, my friend
helped me keep my toys away,

409
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:27,750
so his bag was drenched.

410
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,775
So you need this to dry his bag?

411
00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:42,600
But it's already so drenched.

412
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,925
Isn't it better to get a new one?

413
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,125
No!

414
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
I made my friend a promise.

415
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,725
I need to keep my promise.

416
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,575
Doanua, tell me,

417
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,300
what if your friend...

418
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,875
wants you to do something silly
to make up for him,

419
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,675
would you do it for him?

420
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,400
Even if it's silly,

421
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,074
if I don't do it,

422
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,550
I would break my promise, right?

423
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:42,200
I've told you we'll each pay our own bill!

424
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,900
No.

425
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,900
I want you to owe me a favor.

426
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,625
But I don't want that.

427
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,025
Here, it's for my share of the food.

428
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:53,575
No.

429
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,225
My family is rich enough.

430
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:58,225
What? So you are a rich kid?

431
00:26:59,175 --> 00:27:00,900
Does your family own an oil field?

432
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,150
How do you know?

433
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,600
My family is in the petroleum business!

434
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,500
Or are you...

435
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,875
prying on my personal life?

436
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:16,425
Did you punch me...

437
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:17,850
just to approach me?

438
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:19,875
This is not funny.

439
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,875
Take it.

440
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,375
Now, we are even.

441
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:31,250
You are too stubborn.

442
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,400
Hey! What was that for?

443
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,675
Returning the money.

444
00:27:35,525 --> 00:27:36,950
You could have put it somewhere else.

445
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:38,475
That was unnecessary.

446
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,025
I won't know it unless I did that.

447
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:42,868
Your...

448
00:27:45,425 --> 00:27:46,175
That was tender.

449
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:47,375
Bohn, you jerk!

450
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:51,800
Stop running!

451
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:13,925
Here.

452
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,325
Don't you think this is odd?

453
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,500
How is it odd?

454
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:25,425
Why would two grown men
give each other flowers?

455
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:29,125
We are not a couple.

456
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:33,775
Hold on,

457
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,450
or did you...

458
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:37,800
want me to send you flowers every day...

459
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,775
because of some ill intention?

460
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:46,050
So, you finally feel it.

461
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,700
I like you, Duen.

462
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:54,775
Hey!

463
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:58,455
I'll trade my Buddha's hands with your lemon,

464
00:28:58,455 --> 00:28:59,900
Don't trade it for your sister,

465
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:01,525
because my friend here likes crab!

466
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,325
Hey!

467
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,871
-Kiss him!
-No!

468
00:29:10,871 --> 00:29:12,016
No!

469
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:35,825
Why are you up so early?

470
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:38,000
I have something to do at school today.

471
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,950
I am skipping breakfast.

472
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,225
You should at least eat something.

473
00:29:42,225 --> 00:29:43,625
I made some porridge.

474
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,125
There are sandwiches too.

475
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:46,125
Come on.

476
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,450
Sure, Mum.

477
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:48,300
Over here.

478
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,575
Take a few bits.

479
00:29:50,575 --> 00:29:51,800
I'll have a sandwich.

480
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,375
Sure.

481
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,775
I am headed to school now.

482
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,700
Give me a hug.

483
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,425
Hug.

484
00:29:58,425 --> 00:29:58,800
And a kiss.

485
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:02,025
Oh.

486
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,650
Right, your aunt said...

487
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,250
Thara has left his coat here.

488
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,025
It's over there.

489
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:10,150
Will you bring it to him later?

490
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:10,925
Sure.

491
00:30:11,425 --> 00:30:12,675
Okay, another hug.

492
00:30:14,475 --> 00:30:15,275
See you.

493
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:16,075
-See you later.
-Goodbye.

494
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:17,300
Okay.

495
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,375
Goodbye, son.

496
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,650
Okay.

497
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,600
Well.

498
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,375
What are you looking at?

499
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:38,450
Nothing.

500
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,575
Nothing? Your mind is wondering off.

501
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,900
Hey, who else could he be looking at?

502
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,225
It must be some cute freshman girls.

503
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:51,675
They will surely come to us to sign up
for the cheer-leading team.

504
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,657
They are like salmons
looking for a place to lay their eggs.

505
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,925
And we'll be like the grizzly bears.

506
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:03,875
The moment they come up, we'll catch them!

507
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,996
The fish are here.

508
00:31:05,996 --> 00:31:07,225
Put on your smoldering look.

509
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,825
Well...

510
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,100
Seniors,

511
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:15,925
can we have your autographs?

512
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,825
Of course, my dear juniors.

513
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,775
I am Boss, I am a sophomore.

514
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,225
Stop staring at me or you might
get charmed by my look.

515
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,025
Oh, these are all my friends.

516
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,800
He is King, the Mighty King.

517
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,450
He is so mighty in his study.

518
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,525
But he has one flaw.

519
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,332
He is too geeky, so we can't understand what he says.

520
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,775
This is Mek.

521
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,525
So handsome and striking, right?

522
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,975
He is like a mute and he barely speaks.

523
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,250
-And this is...
-I am Tee.

524
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:53,900
I am extremely gentle, and I love uniforms.

525
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,800
Most importantly,

526
00:31:55,325 --> 00:31:57,175
I am still single.

527
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,375
Unlike Boss,

528
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,725
he has a husband.

529
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,950
It's Mek.

530
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:06,725
Here is something you don't know.

531
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,625
In the Engineering College,

532
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:12,000
they are the Mute Husband and the Annoying Wife.

533
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,175
Curse you, Tee.

534
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,550
I can sign the autographs for you.

535
00:32:16,825 --> 00:32:21,575
Who is the guy sitting on the table?

536
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,025
That kid got the attention again!

537
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:31,375
His name is Bohn.

538
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:33,150
He is the fearsome one.

539
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,625
You might get charmed by him.

540
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,350
He is a pervert!

541
00:32:37,075 --> 00:32:39,325
Yes, don't fall for him.

542
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,724
What are you staring at?

543
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:44,300
You came asking for autograph
without knowing our names?

544
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,675
You deserve punishment for that.

545
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,725
What? You want the girls to wear boxers?

546
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,750
I am a reasonable person, so I won't do that.

547
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,700
The girls can wear what they have now.

548
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,375
They will run ten laps on the field...

549
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,450
while wearing boxers on the outside.

550
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,175
What?

551
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,050
20 laps!

552
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,650
54 laps!

553
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,325
That number sounds so familiar.

554
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,475
It would be raining after they finished the run.

555
00:33:20,225 --> 00:33:21,425
Hold on.

556
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,650
You want the girls to wear boxers?

557
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,025
But they don't have the "thing".

558
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:30,150
They don't have to wear it.

559
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,050
I am happy enough that you want to know our names.

560
00:33:35,775 --> 00:33:37,650
Here, give me your notebooks.

561
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,750
Here.

562
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,300
Not just my autograph,

563
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:53,850
I am giving you my Line.

564
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Thank you.

565
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:02,550
Bye.

566
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,450
That is double standard.

567
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,525
Why can't you be as nice to the boys?

568
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:07,325
That's right.

569
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:10,375
This is nothing.

570
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:14,075
You'll see, someone will end up
even more miserable.

571
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:17,625
Who?

572
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,135
You must buy a flower from those kids
and send them to me.

573
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,000
Sir.

574
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,075
Sir?

575
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:16,800
What?

576
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,700
Are there any kids selling flowers nearby?

577
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:21,075
What kids?

578
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:23,725
Are there any kids selling flowers nearby?

579
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:27,373
Oh, you mean a gift shop. That is far from here.

580
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,775
No, I mean kids that sell flowers.

581
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:33,525
You want hammer?

582
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,825
Which model do you need?

583
00:35:35,825 --> 00:35:36,800
My goodness.

584
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,175
Everyone, it's time for class.

585
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:03,475
Clean this up.

586
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:04,325
Fine.

587
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:13,400
Bohn, aren't you going to the class?

588
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,925
Nature calls. I'll catch up later.

589
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,025
I feel like using the washroom too.

590
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:20,975
Me too.

591
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:22,375
Me too.

592
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,975
We'll all go to the washroom together.

593
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:26,075
Hey, no way!

594
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,750
Only I can use the washroom.

595
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,825
We live in a democratic country, okay?

596
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,825
I don't care.

597
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,400
I hate when people copy me. Go to your class now.

598
00:36:37,025 --> 00:36:39,325
Come on, go!

599
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,850
Go to your class.

600
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,900
What is wrong with him?

601
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:06,225
Young man?

602
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,575
Young man?

603
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,425
Young man?

604
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:17,675
I need a flower from you.

605
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,525
Young man?

606
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,125
I need a flower from you.

607
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:29,375
Bohn!

608
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,200
Was it you who gave your Line
to our boss' girlfriend?

609
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,000
Yes, what now?

610
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,931
You!

611
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,300
Are you trying to mess with our boss?

612
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,375
Hey!

613
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,350
Our boss wants to have a nice talk
with you somewhere quiet.

614
00:37:57,825 --> 00:37:59,325
Decide it now.

615
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,475
Everyone, do you know how to get to
the Gears Statue from Medical College?

616
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:42,125
Ting, do you know the way to the Gears Statue?

617
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,100
Duen is asking in the group chat.

618
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:46,000
How would I know? I don't have a boyfriend there.

619
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,250
Indeed, judging from your look.

620
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,400
Shut it!

621
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,025
You are so mean.

622
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,725
I am mean? Just answer your friend.

623
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:55,375
Duen, why do you head to the Gears Statue?

624
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,850
Are you there for a girl?

625
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,996
No, I have some work to be done there.

626
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:10,686
Ting and I don't know the way,
wait for Ram and Phu's reply.

627
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,500
It's at their faculty.

628
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:29,200
Ram, Duen is asking us the way
to the Gears Statue.

629
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Why is he coming here?

630
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:34,600
I'll tell him the direction first.

631
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:37,950
Turn left and go straight forward.
Then you'll see the park.

632
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,475
Hey, just wait.

633
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:46,150
What is your problem?

634
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,850
Oh, no.

635
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:53,225
Stop sending me Line messages, I am in the class.

636
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,675
I am turning my phone off now.

637
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,850
Done.

638
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:22,150
"Turn left and go straight forward.
Then you'll see the park."

639
00:40:22,825 --> 00:40:23,900
But what's next?

640
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,275
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialed is busy.

641
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,350
Curse it.

642
00:40:57,525 --> 00:40:58,525
I'll be here later.

643
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:06,700
Do you need help?

644
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:16,000
Well...

645
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,500
Don't laugh at me if I asked.

646
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,150
Go ahead, I won't mock you.

647
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,900
I am looking for the Gears Statue.

648
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,416
I was almost there.

649
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:27,312
My friend told me to turn left.

650
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:28,400
Another said right,

651
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,325
and then straight ahead.

652
00:41:29,325 --> 00:41:31,100
When I look around, I was already here.

653
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,825
You said you wouldn't make fun of me.

654
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,250
I am sorry.

655
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,375
To make up for my rude behavior,

656
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:42,075
I'll take you to the statue, okay?

657
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:42,950
Really?

658
00:41:43,825 --> 00:41:44,325
Come on.

659
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:45,600
Thank you.

660
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:00,150
Are you from the Medical College?

661
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,200
Yes, but this coat belongs to my senior.

662
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,875
Freshman can't wear long-coat.

663
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:08,575
Are you from the Management College?

664
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,600
If I study in its building,

665
00:42:12,175 --> 00:42:13,350
I can't be studying agriculture, right?

666
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:16,175
I am a Medical student but here I am.

667
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,400
Fair enough.

668
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:22,775
You made fun of me again.

669
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:25,275
I am sorry, I won't do it again.

670
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,275
But why do you need to be
at the Gears Statue?

671
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,375
I have a rose for my senior.

672
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,325
Is he your boyfriend?

673
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:36,500
No way, who would want to be his boyfriend?

674
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,875
He has bad temper, he is demeaning, and he is a bully!

675
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:40,425
Is that so?

676
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:44,625
I was working with a student
from Engineering as well.

677
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:47,400
He has bad temper. I hope it's not the same person.

678
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:58,950
Hello?

679
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:04,000
I am at the Engineering College.

680
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,425
What? Fine.

681
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,500
I'll be right there.

682
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,050
I am sorry, I need to be back at my faculty.

683
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:17,575
Oh.

684
00:43:17,925 --> 00:43:20,625
Can you show me the direction before you go?

685
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:23,850
It's not that far, just follow the road ahead.

686
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:24,275
Keep going,

687
00:43:24,275 --> 00:43:24,975
don't turn any way.

688
00:43:25,075 --> 00:43:26,725
Don't turn and keep moving forward.

689
00:43:26,825 --> 00:43:29,675
Thank you for sending me here.

690
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:30,800
It's my pleasure.

691
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,225
Thank you.

692
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,625
I am sorry, what is your name?

693
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:42,575
I am Duen, what about you?

694
00:44:16,275 --> 00:44:18,975
Do these extra men carry you home later?

695
00:44:18,975 --> 00:44:23,725
You are such full of yourself.

696
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,550
You are going to have your legs broken.

697
00:44:31,675 --> 00:44:32,827
Sister,

698
00:44:32,827 --> 00:44:35,323
I saw a boy from the Medical College...

699
00:44:35,323 --> 00:44:37,025
coming here with a rose in his hand.

700
00:44:37,025 --> 00:44:38,500
He was so handsome.

701
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,525
At the Gears Statue?

702
00:44:39,525 --> 00:44:40,250
Yes!

703
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,350
I saw him too; he was so handsome.

704
00:44:43,075 --> 00:44:43,650
Hey!

705
00:44:45,325 --> 00:44:46,225
Where are you going?

706
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,725
I have another thing to settle.

707
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:49,300
I'll come back later.

708
00:44:50,275 --> 00:44:50,975
Hey!

709
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:59,125
You are disrespecting my boss!

710
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:04,275
Big boss, teach him a lesson.

711
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:12,525
Get him!

712
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,750
Bohn?

713
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,400
Do you blame me for being late?

714
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,975
Do you know what I ran into today?

715
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,500
I searched for a flower kid the whole morning.

716
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,875
All the way from city center
in Bangkok to the suburban.

717
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:56,175
After I bought the flower,

718
00:45:56,175 --> 00:45:58,800
I couldn't find my way to the Gears Statue.

719
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,338
Most importantly,

720
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:03,100
you made me skip a tough major class.

721
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,950
If my grades drop this semester, it's your fault.

722
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,175
Here.

723
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,125
Take it.

724
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:26,075
Why are you smirking, Lizard Man?

725
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,975
Are you even listening to me?

726
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:47,725
Do you know...

727
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,075
how adorable you are?
