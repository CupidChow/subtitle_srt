[My Engineer]
[Episode 4]

2
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,475
What are you doing?

3
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,225
Waking you up like your lover.

4
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,275
Who's your lover?

5
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,475
You.

6
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,375
Did you forget what happened yesterday?

7
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,250
I have uniform.

8
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,925
What?

9
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,100
I have gears.

10
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,825
Yes, I know you have gears.

11
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,725
You study engineering. Of course, you have gears.

12
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,775
But I don't have a wife.

13
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,275
What? Why are you telling me this?

14
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,950
As I thought,

15
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:20,000
you fool wouldn't understand it.

16
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,525
Why are you scolding me?

17
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,225
Get to the point.

18
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:25,650
Why are you beating around the bush?

19
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,975
Are you crazy?

20
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:33,500
I want to go after you.

21
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Why are you laughing?

22
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:43,407
I'm laughing at your joke.

23
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,725
You're good at lying.

24
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,400
If I don't know you, I might believe you.

25
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,700
Get up.

26
00:03:58,225 --> 00:04:00,050
Wasn't what you told me yesterday a joke?

27
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,775
What did you do to me?

28
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,525
Yes.

29
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,450
I'm serious.

30
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:08,575
Besides, I've announced it to everyone.

31
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:09,925
Look at it yourself.

[#BohnDuen]

33
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,500
Hey, what did you post?

34
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:22,125
Delete it now.

35
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:23,025
No.

36
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,925
Everyone wishes us well.

37
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,025
Didn't you see that?

38
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,276
But I'm reluctant.

39
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:32,000
Give it to me.

40
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:32,975
Duen.

41
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,300
Look into my eyes.

42
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,800
All the while, I may have been
playing prank on you.

43
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,650
But not this time.

44
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,825
I really like you.

45
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,850
Besides, I've decided.

46
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,950
I want to go after you.

47
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,950
Do you know what are you talking about?

48
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,050
We're both boys.

49
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,850
How can you go after me?

50
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,075
So what?

51
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,125
I want to go after the person called Duennhow.

52
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:18,675
No way. I don't allow it.

53
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,350
Duen.

54
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:33,950
Do you hate me?

55
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,500
That's not it.

56
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,375
Even if I allow you,

57
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:48,750
don't you think this is too fast?

58
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,775
We just knew each other.

59
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,900
So if you know me better,

60
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:58,975
you'll open your heart to me?

61
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:07,250
I know.

62
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,375
You may not know me now.

63
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:14,325
But I'll surely make you open your heart to me.

64
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,475
You've seen too many drama series.

65
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,725
Dao, let's go home.

66
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,525
But I'm not done eating.

67
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,375
We'll eat at home. Let's go.

68
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:48,875
Where are you hurrying to?

69
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,100
You don't want to eat together?

70
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:54,175
Like a family.

71
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,625
Mind your own business.

72
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,825
What happened?

73
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,050
A child wouldn't understand adult's business.

74
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,025
Why are you sitting on the table?

75
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,250
I don't know. I just want to.

76
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,925
Personal cook. Do not disturb.
Hash tag Bohn Duen.

77
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,750
So Bohn is really going after this junior?

78
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,150
At first, I thought he was just fooling around,

79
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,700
but it turns out he is serious.

80
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,300
Hey, everyone.

81
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,275
The weather today is great.

82
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:53,775
I think the trees are really green.

83
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,000
-That's right.
-Is it?

84
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Get straight to the point.

85
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,363
Where were you last night?

86
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:00,143
Did you do anything with the junior?

87
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:00,825
You want to marry him?

88
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:01,425
Are you serious?

89
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:01,925
Hold on.

90
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,025
One by one. I can't catch up.

91
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,150
You first.

92
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:09,900
Hello. I'm with Mr. Bohn now,

93
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,525
the key person of the personal-cook matter.

94
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,150
So, Mr. Bohn, are you going after this junior?

95
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:17,125
Yes.

96
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:19,400
Wow.

97
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,025
Did he say yes?

98
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,300
He has rejected me.

99
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:27,300
But it isn't weird.

100
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,250
You were going after girls all the time.

101
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,025
Yes.

102
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,075
Why do you...

103
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,850
Yes, I don't care about these.

104
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,825
No matter who Duen is,

105
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,675
I know that...

106
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,500
I'm interested in the boy called Duennhow.

107
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,100
I also want him to feel the same about me.

108
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:49,800
You're really cool.

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Why are you so handsome?

110
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:55,300
You deserve it.

111
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:56,525
You're hit now.

112
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:02,325
Personal cook. Do not disturb.
Hashtag Bohn Duen.

113
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:05,325
Duen, I think Senior has gone too far.

114
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:06,750
He wasn't playing a prank on me.

115
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:08,975
He seriously wants to go after me.

116
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:09,625
What?

117
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:12,950
But I've rejected him.

118
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,225
I think he wouldn't be crazy again.

119
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,100
Duen. Where's Senior? I'll go hit him.

120
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,375
Calm down.

121
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,950
I want to hit him.

122
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:28,075
Who knows if he would fall for me,
like what he does for Duen.

123
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:28,925
Ridiculous.

124
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,775
Ting, that's not funny at all.

125
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,650
I was just kidding.

126
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,650
But I'm really envious of you.

127
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,200
I want to cat fight with Senior too.

128
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,450
The drinks are here.

129
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,500
Thank you.

130
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,400
This is Duen's. This is mine.

131
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,600
Junior Duen. A senior from engineering college
asked me to give you this.

132
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,525
Thank you.

133
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:00,625
I'll leave now.

134
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,675
A senior from engineering college.

135
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,950
It must be senior Bohn.

136
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,500
Wow, that's so romantic.

137
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,650
Open it. I want to see what Senior gave you.

138
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,025
Open it.

139
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,300
Here, my treat.

140
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:22,325
What do you want from me?

141
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:25,425
Hey, why did you say that?

142
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,450
I just want to treat you.

143
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,300
Is it okay?

144
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:31,400
You know that I'm a kind person.

145
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:33,875
What do you want from me?

146
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Hey, juniors. This way.

147
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,925
Take a seat.

148
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,725
Yes, split to two tables.

149
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,400
Sit wherever you want. Here.

150
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,300
Hello.

151
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,300
I'm Tee, the president of this volunteer project.

152
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:51,798
He's senior King, my secretary.

153
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:54,425
In order to save time,

154
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,950
we'll start the meeting
of the volunteer project right away.

155
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:57,875
-I...
-Hold on.

156
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,300
You lured me to help you
with the volunteer project?

157
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,100
I've lured everyone.

158
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,750
But you're the only one who showed up.

159
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,850
Sorry.

160
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:09,950
I have nobody else.

161
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,775
-Understand me.
-No.

162
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:11,900
King.

163
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,375
Hello.

164
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,200
So...

165
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:22,950
you're not leaving, right?

166
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,675
Well, we shall carry on with the meeting.

167
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,275
Juniors, how many of you came today?

168
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:31,275
1,2,3,4,5,6...

169
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,425
I'm calculating alone. No one is helping.

170
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:35,175
It's okay. You're called?

171
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:36,500
Jenny.

172
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,407
So...

173
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:42,117
the volunteer project
of engineering college this year is...

174
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:43,400
tree planting.

175
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,475
That's right.

176
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,050
But we don't have so much time to prepare this year,

177
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,725
so I hope that...

178
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,650
all of you would help as the planning.

179
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:54,850
Okay, thank you, juniors.

180
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,100
All the best.

181
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,725
Thank you so much.

182
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:59,600
Drink it up before you go home.

183
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,025
Take good care of yourself.

184
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:04,200
That's great.

185
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,725
Hey, the junior sitting over there...

186
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,700
is from our college?

187
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,825
Oh, he's called Ram.

188
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,225
He's the junior of my roll.

189
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,625
Him?

190
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,425
Why haven't I seen him before?

191
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:17,425
He doesn't like to join activities.

192
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,175
He's willing to help this time,

193
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,175
because I was begging him.

194
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,150
He doesn't like to communicate with others.

195
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,075
It took me a few weeks...

196
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,825
to find out that he's called Ram.

197
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:30,725
Ram?

198
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:33,400
That's a weird name.

199
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,000
See.

200
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,550
You just can't leave weird things alone.

201
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,425
You always show interest.

202
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:43,950
But it's hard to get closed to him.

203
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,400
He barely talks to others.

204
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:54,675
I just went to the dorm for a while,

205
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,875
and this has grown so much.

206
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,525
You're always greeting the plants before me.

207
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:01,200
I'm starting to feel unhappy about it.

208
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,000
Mother.

209
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:05,107
Look.

210
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,650
I bought a cake for you.

211
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,525
Don't be angry.

212
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:12,175
Do you want it?

213
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:13,600
Let me see.

214
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,450
Alright.

215
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,350
Luckily, I'm a food lover,

216
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,125
or else I wouldn't be cooled down.

217
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay.

218
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,475
Where's your husband?

219
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,325
Your father?

220
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,050
He went to play golf without me knowing.

221
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,200
Letting me stay home alone.

222
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,575
Mother.

223
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,725
I'm here.

224
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,475
It looks yummy.

225
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:47,425
Yes.

226
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,850
You shall eat first, mother.

227
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:50,725
I'll eat it later.

228
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:51,525
Okay.

229
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:05,025
Mother.

230
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:05,900
Yes?

231
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Why did you name me King?

232
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:10,425
Why did you ask?

233
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,300
Nothing. Just want to know.

234
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,575
It goes back to when you were newly born.

235
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:20,950
I didn't know what to name you then,

236
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,300
to make sure it's related
to your Sister Kamfah and Sister Kaning.

237
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:28,400
So I combined the K from Kamfah...

238
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,100
and Ing from Kaning to get the name King.

239
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:33,300
Oh.

240
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:35,675
You combined the names.

241
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,575
That's quite random.

242
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:40,750
I thought about something good as well.

243
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,225
What?

244
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:43,375
Kuaikwid.

245
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,175
Hold on.

246
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,250
Sadly, your father didn't allow it.

247
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,525
Isn't it good, mother?

248
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:50,500
But the name has a good meaning.

249
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,351
Save it. I'll thank father with the cake.

250
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,225
No, you've given me the cake.

251
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:54,900
No.

252
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:57,650
You should be called Kuaikwid.
It has a good meaning.

253
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,175
Don't eat it.

254
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:01,426
Alright, my baby Kuaikwid.

255
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:02,225
What Kuaikwid?

256
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,000
Alright, baby Kuaikwid. That's my cake.

257
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
What am I called?

258
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,594
Kuaikwid…

259
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:07,469
What?

260
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,738
King is okay as well.

261
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:09,538
Take it then.

262
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,675
Let's eat together.

263
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,675
Okay, mother.

264
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:29,950
How was it, son?

265
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,225
Everything's okay?

266
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,900
Why aren't you answering me?

267
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:41,300
Just like someone.

268
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,075
You're in year one?

269
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:44,975
Why are you ignoring me?

270
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,150
He's called Ram.

271
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,950
Ram?

272
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,150
That's a weird name.

273
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,625
Ram.

274
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:02,725
It means glorious?

275
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,475
It doesn't match him.

276
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,100
Here.

277
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:22,325
And this one.

278
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,175
Oh.

279
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:26,975
Have you opened it?

280
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,025
Not yet.

281
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,400
Why?

282
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,375
Don't you want to know what's in there?

283
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,475
No.

284
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,750
I'll go now.

285
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:54,075
Wow, like a dog.

286
00:16:55,625 --> 00:17:00,100
I think someone miscalculated.

287
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,675
You only know how to pick up girls,

288
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:05,625
when you meet a boy, you become out of hand.

289
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,525
What are you planning to do?

290
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:09,450
It's still in time if you stop now.

291
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,075
So you wouldn't be sad.

292
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,500
I will not give up.

293
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,900
Wait and see.

294
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,700
I will make him open the present.

295
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,125
So handsome.

296
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:30,900
Oh, my.

297
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:47,280
[Junior Duen, open me.]

298
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,025
Duen, what's going on?

299
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:20,400
I bought you cake.

300
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,450
Sorry.

301
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:25,125
I'm sensitive to small boxes recently.

302
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,625
It's all Bohn's fault.

303
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,700
He puts small boxes everywhere I go.

304
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:30,400
You can really hold it in.

305
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:31,450
If it were me,

306
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:33,825
I would lift my skirt at the drinks shop itself.

307
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:35,100
Open the box.

308
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,250
Oh yes, open the box.

309
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,275
Don't think too much.

310
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:40,750
This is the trick of a shameless man.

311
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,025
Yes, I saw that he was with different girls,

312
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:45,875
and was never serious to them.

313
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,450
You're just a toy to him.

314
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:01,700
What would you like to order?

315
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,500
I would like a strawberry milkshake.

316
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:05,675
Okay.

317
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:06,850
A very sour one.

318
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,675
Because my friend likes sour.

319
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,050
Okay.

320
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,900
I'll collect it later.

321
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:13,025
Okay.

322
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,950
You came all the way to eat here, Bohn.

323
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,200
Mike.

324
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,950
I heard you're going after a junior
from the medical college.

325
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,925
You've changed your taste.
Why you don't choose me then?

326
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,225
You know how I feel about you.

327
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:45,350
I don't like boys.

328
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,325
I only like Duen.

329
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:49,325
Those medical students...

330
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,400
are no match...

331
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,750
to us, the engineering students.

332
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:58,900
Let go off me.

333
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,450
What are you doing?

334
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:03,675
Don't you want to try it?

335
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,125
I'm sure you'll be happy.

336
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:08,350
Let go off me.

337
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,700
Duen.

338
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,225
It's not like what you think.

339
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:20,900
Let's go, Tang.

340
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,975
Duen, hold on.

341
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:22,700
Listen to me.

342
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,000
Let go off me.

343
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:53,800
What's going on?

344
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,775
Hey, lend me your notes of applied maths.

345
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,300
Okay, I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

346
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:01,600
I'm in front of your room. Just give it to me.

347
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,225
What?

348
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:05,225
It's me.

349
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,625
Hey, hurry up.

350
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,825
What are you doing?

351
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:20,900
Hold on. I'm coming.

352
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:24,750
I've waited for so long.

353
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,050
Why did you take so long?
Are you watching porn?

354
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:38,850
Or are you hiding someone there?

355
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:40,425
What?

356
00:21:46,975 --> 00:21:47,850
Nothing.

357
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,725
Because you don't like others
to come here,

358
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:55,300
they're saying that...

359
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:57,450
you hide your lover here.

360
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,475
Where are you hiding it?

361
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,100
Stop fooling around. I'll get you the notebook.

362
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:13,475
Take it and leave.

363
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,050
Okay, you're chasing me off.

364
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,250
I'll leave after I pee.

365
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,475
Hello.

366
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:26,875
No one is here either.

367
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,800
Hey, the water tap is broken.

368
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,750
Oh, my.

369
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,825
Oh.

370
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,750
I forgot to tell you that it's broken.

371
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,700
Why you don't tell me that tomorrow morning?

372
00:22:45,725 --> 00:22:47,550
I'll go tidy up.

373
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,900
I'm all wet now.

374
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,775
Lend me a shirt. It's in your bedroom, right?

375
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:54,725
Hey.

376
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:18,075
Since when do you know that...

377
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:21,000
I like Boss?

378
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:24,125
Since you kept his name card
during the welcome event.

379
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:25,850
Since then I kept observing,

380
00:23:26,825 --> 00:23:27,700
until I'm sure.

381
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:31,000
Does Boss know about it?

382
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,875
He doesn't know.

383
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,725
He can't know it either.

384
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:36,875
So you plan to keep hiding your love...

385
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,900
and be a mute husband?

386
00:23:42,825 --> 00:23:44,350
I don't want to lose a friend.

387
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:45,825
I know you.

388
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,900
But I want to ask you seriously,

389
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,700
aren't you suffering?

390
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,850
You're hiding your love,

391
00:23:52,175 --> 00:23:54,700
although we ridicule you two as husband and wife.

392
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:03,625
Between hiding this love
and losing him, I don't know...

393
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,025
which one will make me suffer more.

394
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,425
[Medical College]

395
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:24,550
We bumped into senior Bohn
hugging another boy in the restroom.

396
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,050
Hugging each other?

397
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:28,475
This isn't real.

398
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:32,875
I thought he wouldn't be a playboy
after changing orientation.

399
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:35,775
Turns out he can't change his bad habit.

400
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,000
Why are you crying?

401
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,750
Duen should be sad.

402
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,700
Stop screaming.

403
00:24:41,425 --> 00:24:42,650
Why should I be sad?

404
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,375
I don't like him.

405
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,600
I know you're jealous.

406
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,625
What jealous?

407
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,650
Don't be stubborn.

408
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,850
If you aren't jealous,

409
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,625
why would you walk away angrily?

410
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:05,550
Who's angry? I can't talk to you.

411
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,500
Look at you. You're angry,
meaning you're jealous.

412
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,225
I'm not jealous.

413
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,875
You're jealous.

414
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:15,825
I'm not jealous.

415
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,875
Jealous.

416
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:17,600
You're jealous.

417
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,375
Jealous.

418
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:23,925
If I say I'm jealous, will you stop annoying me?

419
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:27,550
Yes, I'm jealous. Are you happy now?

[Can you not be so cute? #BohnDuen]

421

Hello, rotter Bohn.

422
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:51,275
What did you post?

423
00:25:51,325 --> 00:25:52,675
Delete it immediately.

424
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:54,975
No way.

425
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,650
Unless you really tell me that you're jealous.

426
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,575
I'm not jealous.

427
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,475
Your partner is your business.

428
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:05,900
Then posting the photo on Facebook
is also my business.

429
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:07,800
You're asking for trouble.

Hey.

431
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:12,650
Talk about it after class. Believe me.

432
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,975
No, I want to clear this up with him.

433
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:20,350
Believe us. Go on with class first, brother.

434
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,950

435
00:26:27,225 --> 00:26:28,500
Give me your cell phone.

Is the air all out?

437
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:57,575
Never snatch senior Bohn from us.

00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:58,775
Let all the air out, sister.

439

Hurry, run!

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,275
Ah.

446
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,275
I want to give this to you.

447

Since you've seen it,

448
00:27:27,075 --> 00:27:27,925
take it.

449
00:27:34,975 --> 00:27:36,525
Look at what your fans have done to me.

450
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:39,450
Are you happy now?

451
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,725
Ever since I met you,

452
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:45,775
there's always trouble in my life.

453
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:49,125
Stop treating me like your toy, okay?

454
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:51,700
I beg you.

455
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:54,250
I never treat you like my toy.

456
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,150
But if I did something that makes you unhappy,

457
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,300
I'm sorry.

458
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,925
I'll never show up in front of you anymore.

Oh, Junior Duen. Where did
the engineering student go?

465
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,325
He hasn't been giving me the box recently.

466
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:03,100
He may not come anymore.

00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:04,200
Oh, really?

468
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,125
Duen.

469
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,025
What's going on?

470
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,725
No, nothing.

471
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,625
I don't know. But you're not like your usual self.

472
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,225
This is my usual self.

473
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,075
Aren't you thinking too much?

474
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,050
Not really.

475
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:25,625
Since Senior stepped into your life,

476
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:26,900
I think you've changed.

477
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:28,475
In what sense?

478
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,550
You're never polite to him.

479
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,400
Because he doesn't deserve my respect.

480
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,500
You never skipped class before.

481
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:35,550
But you skipped classes to send him flowers.

482
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,300
Because I promised him.

483
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:39,775
But since he disappeared, you look unhappy.

484
00:30:39,825 --> 00:30:42,700
You look crossed in love.

485
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,350
What crossed in love? This is my usual self.

486
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:52,925
Duen, you don't know yourself.

487
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:54,150
Because you're silly.

488
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,225
But we're your friends.

489
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,325
We know each other for so long, we can tell.

490
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,550
I really think you've changed.

491
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,876
Are you starting to care for Senior?

492
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:12,750
But no way, because Senior belongs to me alone.

493
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,675
Have you asked Senior about it?

494
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,600
I'm thankful for your concern.

495
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,150
But I'm just like my usual self.

496
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,475
I'm going to see Ram at the college.

497
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:29,775
I have to pass him the donation box.

498
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,575
Okay, goodbye.

499
00:31:55,925 --> 00:31:56,475
Ram.

500
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,100
I collected donation at the college.

501
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:02,250
I've got quite a lot.

502
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:05,575
Thank you.

503
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,500
Are you going back?

504
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,675
I can send you back with the car.

505
00:32:09,725 --> 00:32:12,075
It's okay. I'll stay longer.

506
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,025
Go back first.

507
00:32:14,925 --> 00:32:16,925
Okay, take good care then.

508
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,200
I'll leave now.

509
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:19,325
Bye-bye.

510
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,200
Junior.

511
00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:31,075
You can talk after all.

512
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,675
You can even talk a lot.

513
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,025
Hold on.

514
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,425
Where are you going?

515
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:39,775
Let me donate as well.

516
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:42,900
According to my analysis,

517
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:47,100
you only talk to people you're closed to, right?

518
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:53,825
I'm not done donating.

519
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,000
Are you in a hurry?

520
00:32:56,025 --> 00:32:57,150
That means...

521
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,525
if I want to talk to you,

522
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:01,400
I have to first be close to you, right?

523
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:06,825
However,

524
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,750
how should I be close to you,

525
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,325
when you're always so cool to me?

526
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,300
What about this?

527
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,600
Let's start with me calling you Cool Boy.

528
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,425
That sounds closer.

529
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:22,775
Right?

530
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:36,900
If you don't answer, I'll call you that name then.

531
00:33:37,575 --> 00:33:38,150
Cool Boy.

532
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,650
Why must I do this?

533
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:42,250
Rotter Tee.

534
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,225
It's so hot.

535
00:33:48,575 --> 00:33:50,375
He lured us here,

536
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,950
but we don't know where he went.

537
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,800
Hey, everyone.

538
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,350
Thank you for helping me with this project...

539
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,800
Truly, from the bottom of my heart.

540
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,525
Bah.

541
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:10,775
I'm not here to help you.

542
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,150
I'm here to help your secretary, King, okay?

543
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:15,775
Whatever it is,

544
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,225
you're still helping me.

545
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:23,338
Then I'll help the freshman girls
carry the donation box.

546
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:24,900
I want to come along.

547
00:34:25,025 --> 00:34:25,625
Don't disturb me.

548
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,725
I'll go now.

549
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,867
Here's another one.

550
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,500
Mr. Bohn.

551
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,947
How many centuries are you going to take for that?

552
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:42,425
Hey.

553
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,600
Hmm.

554
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,600
I know you. You're crossed in love.

555
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:53,325
But you should move on now, brother.

556
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:57,575
Look. Since the girls know
that we're here to help,

557
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,525
all the cute juniors are here.

558
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,650
Look.

559
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,454
I'm not even done talking,

560
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:06,425
and here she comes.

561
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:08,350
Senior, may I help?

562
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,100
Of course. Next to me is empty.

563
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:19,975
Senior, where are you going after this?

564
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:21,550
Oh.

565
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,575
Junior.

566
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:27,700
I already have someone I like.

567
00:35:28,325 --> 00:35:30,100
But I haven't, junior.

568
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,150
I'm still single.

569
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:34,775
Do you want to date me, junior?

570
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:42,275
Rotter Bohn.

571
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:44,350
The junior is so cute.

572
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:47,475
You don't appreciate her at all.

573
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:11,700
Duen.

574
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:13,400
What are you doing?

575
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,350
Senior Thara.

576
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,925
I came to look for something.

577
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,975
Why are you here, senior?

578
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:21,175
I came to pick up trash.

579
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:25,425
I feel troubled recently,
so I came to release stress.

580
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,750
There's much trash around the college.

581
00:36:28,225 --> 00:36:28,650
That's right.

582
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,900
Oh, right, Brother Thara.

583
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,350
Did you see a small gift box around here?

584
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,600
Small box?

585
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,525
Yes.

586
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:49,950
This one?

587
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:51,300
Yes, that's it, Senior.

588
00:36:58,875 --> 00:36:59,425
But...

589
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:03,150
it doesn't look like mine.

590
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,200
Just throw it away.

591
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:05,775
I'll throw it away then.

592
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,275
Bye, Duen.

593
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:11,775
Senior Thara.

594
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:23,875
So cute.

595
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:26,800
Junior, do you need my help?

596
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,425
So cute.

597
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:35,875
Carry on with work.

598
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:38,525
Cute.

599
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,175
It's really cute.

600
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,450
Hey, everyone.

601
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,450
I bought food.

602
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,575
Put your work down and eat.

603
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,025
I don't want to eat.

604
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,350
I'll finish this first.

605
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:53,325
Me too.

606
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,050
Me too.

607
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,600
Me too.

608
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,925
But if you're hungry,

609
00:37:58,625 --> 00:37:59,875
you may eat first without us.

610
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,125
Oh.

611
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,225
You're saying as if I'm wrong.

612
00:38:05,175 --> 00:38:06,975
Okay, I'll not eat then.

613
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:08,700
Oh.

614
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,207
Since all of you are so hardworking,

615
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:14,450
I'll record this and post it to the page.

616
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:16,150
Here.

617
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,275
Photo.

618
00:38:17,825 --> 00:38:19,600
Here, selfie.

619
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,625
Here, photo.

620
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,300
Smile and say yeah.

621
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:25,000
Here, everyone.

622
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:25,500
Here.

623
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,250
Make sure it's good.

624
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,525
Sure.

625
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,100
1,2,3. Yeah.

626
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,425
Great.

627
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,325
So great.

628
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:37,750
Continue working.

629
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,450
Hold on.

630
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:39,225
What?

631
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:40,750
Work hard, juniors.

632
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,550
Let me add an awesome caption.

633
00:38:43,975 --> 00:38:46,400
We're so busy that we have no time to eat.

634
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:48,757
which girl

635
00:38:48,757 --> 00:38:51,475
would feed us?

636
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:52,950
I love that.

637
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,125
Awesome, right? Click and send.

638
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:14,350
Oh.

639
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,350
My hand is swelling from working.

640
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:20,525
When is it going to be done?

641
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,125
Hubby, look at your wife's hand.

642
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,750
It's rough now. What do we do?

643
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:34,600
I want to ask you seriously.

644
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:36,525
Aren't you suffering?

645
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:39,038
You're hiding your love.

646
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,975
Don't do it then. Let me do it.

647
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:43,575
You're my wife.

648
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:45,050
I'm worried about you.

649
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,150
Are you sick today?

650
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:52,900
You accepted my joke?

651
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,850
Don't you normally scold me?

652
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:57,875
I'm fooling around with you.

653
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:00,700
Oh, I knew you're kidding.

654
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,775
My hubby is really fun.

655
00:40:04,575 --> 00:40:07,200
I'll go get some nails. Carry on.

656
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,100
Are you okay?

657
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:35,750
I know now between keeping
this friendship and losing him,

658
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,525
which one makes me suffer more.

659
00:40:38,225 --> 00:40:42,725
It's best to stay like this.

660
00:41:19,225 --> 00:41:21,700
We're so busy that we have no time to eat.

661
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,800
which girl would feed us?

662
00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:03,700
No need.

663
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,300
If I can make you open the box,

664
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,600
then I can also open your heart.

665
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:50,650
Look to your right.

666
00:43:03,325 --> 00:43:04,675
If you don't want to talk to me,

667
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,000
you may reply in text.

668
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,475
Are you ignoring me?

669
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,975
It's okay if you don't talk to me.

670
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,000
But I'll make you talk to me.

671
00:43:26,725 --> 00:43:28,550
Remember, Cool Boy.

672
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:38,850
Okay.

673
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,650
Wait there.

674
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,300
Mother said you have work in college recently,

675
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,250
so she told me to send you food.

676
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:02,550
Thank you.

677
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,300
Come home when you have time.
Parents miss you.

678
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,775
Okay.

679
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,831
Continuous messages.

680
00:44:17,831 --> 00:44:19,125
Don't you want to read them?

681
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:24,350
Who's sending my brother messages?

682
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,275
You don't even dare to reply in front of me.

683
00:44:26,725 --> 00:44:27,650
Go home.

684
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:31,575
Hold on. Let me guess who is the sender.

685
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,375
He must be the guy you encountered
when you met the dog.

686
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,100
He's contacting you for a reason.

687
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,275
But you don't reply him,
because you don't know him well.

688
00:44:41,475 --> 00:44:43,700
Actually, you don't hate him.

689
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,850
Or else you would have blocked him.

690
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,325
Who makes you so shy?

691
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:56,850
Bohn.

692
00:44:57,575 --> 00:44:58,175
Take a rest.

693
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,800
Go eat.

694
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:00,798
I'm not hungry.

695
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:02,875
I'll eat later.

696
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,050
Bohn.

697
00:45:12,725 --> 00:45:14,150
I said that I'm not...

698
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,700
I don't have time tomorrow morning.

699
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,325
So I came to give you this now.

700
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:24,900
For you.

701
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,050
Besides,

702
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,725
I heard that you're busy with work recently.

703
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:47,675
So I bought food...

704
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,850
So I bought food for Ram.

705
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,100
But there's extra.

706
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,200
You can take it.

707
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,025
Here.

708
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:06,875
Take it if you want.

709
00:46:07,325 --> 00:46:08,300
Why are you getting closer?

710
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,025
What do you want?

711
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:20,875
Duen.

712
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,975
Did I tell you that...

713
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:29,275
I like you?

714
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,150
Hold on, sister.

715
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,875
Do you know someone called Duen?

716
00:46:52,175 --> 00:46:54,550
Duen? I know him.

717
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,925
But which one? There are many Duens.

718
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,250
The fair one.

719
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,400
Duen is cute with a flat face.

720
00:47:05,975 --> 00:47:10,125
Small and affectionate.

721
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:13,125
His eyes are like a line when he smiles.

722
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,896
Most importantly, he looks weak and naive.

723
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:22,175
The fair and silly Duen.

724
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,650
Oh, I recall.

725
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,125
The fair and silly Duen.

726
00:47:25,725 --> 00:47:26,650
There's only one.

727
00:47:26,825 --> 00:47:28,050
Then...

728
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,575
can you please pass this to him?

729
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:31,225
Okay.

730
00:47:31,225 --> 00:47:33,225
Say it's from the engineering senior.

731
00:47:33,325 --> 00:47:34,400
Okay, I'll do it.

732
00:47:34,675 --> 00:47:35,425
Thank you.
