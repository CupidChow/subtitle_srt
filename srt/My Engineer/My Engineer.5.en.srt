[My Engineer]
[Episode 5]

2
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,775
Good morning, everyone.

3
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:54,125
The loser of the year is here.

4
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,450
I heard you went to disturb Senior
at the Gears Statue.

5
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:00,400
Hey, I didn't go to see him.

6
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,925
I only brought food to Ram and Phu.

7
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,675
Ask them if you don't believe me.

8
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,500
No matter what,

9
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:14,225
you and Senior are good now, right?

10
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,375
What did Senior say?

11
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,325
So did you open the box?

12
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,475
The box with old-fashioned love letter.

13
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,925
Why did you stop?

14
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,500
Although it's old fashion,

15
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,600
it made you turn around to see me.

16
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:47,250
I only came to see my friend,

17
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,450
not you.

18
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:50,575
How many times should I repeat?

19
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,050
If that's the case,

20
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,450
can I continue to go after you?

21
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,925
How did you reply him?

22
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,550
How should I reply him?

23
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,450
He'll not listen no matter what I do.

24
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,125
He can do whatever he wants.

25
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:19,275
If I don't say yes,

26
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,575
he'll give up sooner or later.

27
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,475
But it seems that Senior will not give up easily.

28
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:34,840
Are you interested in being the wife
of a great engineer, me?

29
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,025
Hash tag, I like Junior Duen.

30
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,825
Hash tag Bohn Duen.

31
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,325
Oh, my God.

32
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:42,175
When did he post this?

33
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,075
He posted before telling me again.

34
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,550
Crazy fellow.

35
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,975
I'll return it to you.

36
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:52,450
Let me see it.

37
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,425
He called just in time.

38
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,150
Hello, Bohn.

39
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,775
Delete the post immediately.

40
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,125
Or else your fans will start annoying me.

41
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,675
They won't do anything to you.

42
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,525
Because no matter what,

43
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,325
I'll protect you, my precious.

44
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,400
Why are you being shy while scolding Senior?

45
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:23,375
Who's shy?

46
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:25,425
I'm just...

47
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,925
Stop saying such old fashion love prattle.

48
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:29,150
That's it.

49
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:29,975
Hold on.

50
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,625
Are you in college now?

51
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,750
I'll come to see you later.

52
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:33,900
No.

53
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,950
I'm submitting a report to the teacher.

54
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:39,125
Let me see you for a while, please. Okay?

55
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:41,200
If I can't see you now,

56
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,050
my heart will surely die.

57
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,725
Then die. That's all.

58
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,675
Who does he think he's talking to?

59
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,100
Hello, Senior Bohn.

60
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,975
Hello, Senior.

61
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,000
Rotter, you lied to me.

62
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,750
The handbills for charity work.

63
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,525
Please help to paste these all over the college.

64
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:16,750
I'll paste them in multimedia college.

65
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:18,950
Knock it off.

66
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,900
You just want to pick up girls.

67
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,975
Multimedia college is big.

68
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:24,625
I don't want you to be tired.

69
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,275
I'm sacrificing myself.

70
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:30,300
Do you think I like to pick up girls?

71
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:31,225
Yes.

72
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,150
You're loud.

73
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:34,525
I'll be in charge of medical college then.

74
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,850
Everyone knows you have
a medical student as husband.

75
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,975
Why you don't criticize Bohn for picking up boys?

76
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,275
Do you think he's better than me?

77
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:45,925
Yes.

78
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,050
You're loud.

79
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,175
Wow, so cute.

80
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:55,200
Single life is boring.

81
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:57,950
I would like to be someone's baby.

82
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,600
Although I'm not as handsome as others,

83
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,725
unlike the handsome,
I have no girlfriend, juniors.

84
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,300
Bye bye.

85
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:10,450
Her body is good.

86
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,350
What are you looking at?

87
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,275
Do you think I'm afraid of you
just because I'm an outsider?

88
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:21,450
Calm down.

89
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:25,825
We're going to shoot a mini film for a contest.

90
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:30,300
Your feature fits the criteria
of our leading role.

91
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,450
From your appearance, behavior...

92
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,500
to your aura.

93
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:38,150
Thank you, Senior.

94
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:40,950
Look.

95
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,700
Oh.

96
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:45,225
You're obviously the future star of showbiz.

97
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,575
I'm busy.

98
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,425
Help me.

99
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,775
I haven't found an actor. Help me.

100
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:55,850
If you don't help me,

101
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,725
I'll not be able to graduate.

102
00:06:58,325 --> 00:06:59,950
Then I'll be a problematic teenager.

103
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,400
Illegal assembling, taking drugs.

104
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,775
My mother will kill me, Senior.

105
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:07,550
Hold on, Senior.

106
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:12,975
Movie shooting for a contest.

107
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,425
If a star maker finds us,

108
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,900
we may be movie stars.

109
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:20,300
But I don't want to act.

110
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:21,150
But I want to.

111
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:25,850
Think about it, when you start acting,

112
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,500
you may recommend me too.

113
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,550
When I become famous, you can stop acting.

114
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:30,575
Get it?

115
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:34,425
Here's the case, Senior.

116
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,650
My friend agrees to act.

117
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:39,650
But there's a condition.

118
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,400
I have to be part of it.

119
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:44,175
So my friend will not be lonely.

120
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:46,325
Junior, hold on.

121
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,275
I agree to let you act...

122
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:56,950
as a partner of the leading man.

123
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:57,600
Yes!

124
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,350
Thank you so much.

125
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:02,725
I can act as well.

126
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,225
Duen.

127
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,625
It's almost noon. Let's eat together.

128
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:14,650
I don't want to.

129
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:15,850
Let's go.

130
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,300
We can also go to the infamous juice shop.

131
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,750
I said I don't want.

132
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,550
Duen always skips class.

133
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:27,600
The teacher punishes him
by not approving his report.

134
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,250
A serious student like himself skips class?

135
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:31,950
Yes.

136
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:36,175
Who told him to buy flower every morning?

137
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:38,825
Now,

138
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,800
teacher gave him a week to correct the report.

139
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,700
But if he keeps skipping class,

140
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,300
teacher will not let him pass.

141
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,962
Hey, where are you taking me?

142
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,500
I don't want to go.

143
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,100
Let me go.

144
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,950
Bohn, what are you doing?

145
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,325
Why did you take me here?

146
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:14,375
Buy me seven roses now.

147
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,425
Seven?

148
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,900
Didn't I already buy you flower today?

149
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,350
Why do you need so many flowers?

150
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:22,525
From tomorrow on, you don't have to...

151
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,000
buy me flowers for a week.

152
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:28,075
But you must write your report seriously.

153
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,875
I promise to not disturb you...

154
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:32,300
until you're done.

155
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,175
Senior Duen will not disturb you for a week.

156
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:40,350
Can you take that?

157
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:44,100
I can take it even if it's longer.

158
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:47,625
Let's see.

159
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,700
Oh right. Do you want to eat with us?

160
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,200
Go ahead.

161
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,750
I want to look for some books for the report.

162
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,954
Books?

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,900
Okay, we'll eat first.

164
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:03,950
Bye-bye.

165
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,600
See you later.

166
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,150
Sorry.

167
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,475
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:29,875
Oh, Senior Yim.

169
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:37,800
The book you're looking for...

170
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:39,950
is lent for a while now.

171
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,200
I think...

172
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,225
he will not return it.

173
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,750
Do you want to look for it in a bookshop?

174
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,325
Forget about it, Senior.

175
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:54,475
It's hard to find such an old book.

176
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,925
Don't worry about it.

177
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,850
I think...

178
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,175
I have a friend who chose this subject too.

179
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,025
I'll ask him later if he still has the book.

180
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:05,500
Really?

181
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,600
Sadhu. I hope the Senior still has it.

182
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,250
Sadhu.

183
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,350
It looks yummy.

184
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:14,621
Thank you, Brother Ta.

185
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,530
Thank you.

186
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,550
Thank you, brother Ta.

187
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,425
Brother Ta, hold on.

188
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,250
We've been here for a while. I would like to ask,

189
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,850
where are you from?

190
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,575
You want to know? It's a long story.

191
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:24,725
Yes.

192
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,600
Okay.

193
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:28,050
I grew up in the south.

194
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,750
Why is this shop...

195
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,150
I like people from the north.

196
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,375
Oh.

197
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,725
Hold on. I was born in the northeast area.

198
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:38,975
You're confused, right?

199
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:43,150
[Northeast dialect]

200
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,050
I'm not supposed to hear this.

201
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,625
I think so too.

202
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,350
Look at your brother.

203
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,000
Hey.

204
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:58,725
Stop being anxious.

205
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,425
You're not seeing Junior for only a week.

206
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,871
For the sake of his future,

207
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:05,350
I have to hold it in.

208
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:08,150
Don't you believe me?

209
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,600
I bet with 1,000 baht that you can't do it.

210
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,525
Me too.

211
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,800
Me too.

212
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:18,200
But I believe you, Bohn.

213
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:19,575
I believe you can't do it.

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,700
What?

215
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,375
So...

216
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,275
Do I look like I can't live without him?

217
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:28,275
Yes.

218
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,225
Okay.

219
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:32,100
If I can do it,

220
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,275
all of you will pay me.

221
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,349
Dream on.

222
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:37,675
You can't do it, Bohn.

223
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:38,800
Let's see.

224
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,250
It's just a week.

225
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,950
What's so hard about it?

226
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,750
Duen.

227
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,175
Why are you looking at me?

228
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,050
Are you missing Duen?

229
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,175
Tee, you rascal.

230
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,650
Hold on.

231
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:35,725
Where are you going?

232
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:36,850
Aren't you going after Duen?

233
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,275
Isn't flower better?

234
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:39,725
Hey, calm down.

235
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:57,225
Hello, Senior.

236
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,050
Hello.

237
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:05,475
What happened to your face, Senior Tee?

238
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:06,300
Here?

239
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,225
I'm allergic to seafood, Junior.

240
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:14,150
Let's talk business.

241
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,075
I asked you guys here today because my friend...

242
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:20,175
would like to talk to you.

243
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,807
I'll go now.

244
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:25,725
I have a medical appointment.

245
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,100
See you next time.

246
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,075
Bye, Senior.

247
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,125
Bye.

248
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,750
Speedy recovery.

249
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,025
I was shy to ask you guys out.

250
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,700
But I want to ask,

251
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:40,175
how's Duen?

252
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,075
Actually, there's a lot about him.

253
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,600
However,

254
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,325
our throats will be dry if we tell you everything.

255
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,804
It'll be good if there are some drinks.

256
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,875
Yes. Something sweet will be awesome.

257
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,225
Can you tell me...

258
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,050
his condition now?

259
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:13,650
Juniors.

260
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,400
Juniors.

261
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,350
Hey, can you tell me now?

262
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,675
Why are you so loud?

263
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,100
Do you really want to know?

264
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,200
Duen is writing his report
in the library every day.

265
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:31,100
Oh right.

266
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
However,

267
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,150
a psychology book was lent out
and hasn't been returned.

268
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,200
It's also unavailable in the market.

269
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,025
We don't know how to help him.

270
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:44,651
He'll be screwed if he can't find the book.

271
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,075
That's right.

272
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,925
Where are you going?

273
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,575
Who's going to pay for this?

274
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:21,975
Boss.

275
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:23,700
Boss.

276
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:24,850
Boss.

277
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,098
Get up, Boss.

278
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,600
Boss.

279
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,750
Cut.

280
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,200
Move the props for the next scene.

281
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:33,225
Second scene. First take.

282
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:40,675
Your acting is really good.

283
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:43,175
I got goosebumps watching it.

284
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:45,675
From glance to action,

285
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,250
I can feel all the energy from you.

286
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:49,650
You get it?

287
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:53,775
Such good actor is found once in a blue moon.

288
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,300
How was my acting, Senior?

289
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,375
What did you act as?

290
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,125
I acted as the corpse.

291
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,200
Quite good. Your bleeding looks real.

292
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,875
Get ready for the next scene.

293
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,900
He said I'll get the supporting role.

294
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,125
Turns out I'm acting as the corpse
that the leading man investigates.

295
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,800
Mek, have the director give me more scene.

296
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,225
I don't want to end my scene so soon.

297
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:23,350
Please.

298
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:25,150
I can also act as a ghost.

299
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,300
Put in some good words for me.

300
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:29,650
Just some good words.

301
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,800
Mek, the leading woman
for the next scene isn't here yet.

302
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,000
While waiting, you may read the script first.

303
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,175
Let me know if you want to eat.

304
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:39,975
Okay.

305
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:46,150
Great. I'll practice the script with you later.

306
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,800
If the director compliments you,
remember to tell him that I taught you.

307
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,350
But if he scolds you,

308
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:53,450
then don't mention that I practiced with you.

309
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,575
Do you know what I mean?

310
00:19:56,725 --> 00:20:00,400
In this scene, both the leading roles
talk to each other seriously.

311
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,150
Because the friend of the leading man is killed.

312
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:05,050
Let me practice the script with you.

313
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:07,100
I'll be the girl.

314
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,750
Let's start.

315
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:09,975
Here.

316
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,825
Boss, I told you not to eat pork soup in Korea.

317
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,000
But now it's too late.

318
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:19,327
Not really.

319
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,425
The next victim...

320
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,350
might be us.

321
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:24,575
No.

322
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,490
There are things that I want to do...

323
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,575
that I haven't done.

324
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:31,575
Me too.

325
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:36,425
I want to see snow.

326
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:38,475
What about you?

327
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,275
What do you want to do?

328
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,000
Do you want to know?

329
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:46,450
I want to tell you, love you.

330
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,975
I have always loved you.

331
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,150
I was just hiding my love in my heart.

332
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,225
Because we are friends.

333
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:05,850
Your acting is hilarious.

334
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,450
I'm so into it.

335
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,875
You're really talented.

336
00:21:10,975 --> 00:21:12,100
You acted so well.

337
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:14,750
Junior Mek.

338
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,300
This is Junior Fon,

339
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,975
the leading woman.

340
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:21,125
Hello.

341
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:21,950
Hello.

342
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,800
Here, Fon. I'll take you to dress up.

343
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:29,850
Okay.

344
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,575
She's cute.

345
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,250
I really shouldn't finish so soon.

346
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:43,925
Why can't I act for another scene?

347
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,225
She's an angel.

348
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,250
"Psychology" is sold out.

349
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,725
When will it be restocked?

350
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:31,350
It may take a while.

351
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,750
Because it's imported.

352
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,950
Sorry.

353
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:38,375
Are you looking for psychology book for year one?

354
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:41,200
Hello, brother Thara.

355
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,450
Yes.

356
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,525
This book is hard to find.

357
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:50,275
You can check out the secondhand book store.

358
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:53,425
If they don't have it, that means
it's really hopeless then.

359
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,250
Where's the shop then?

360
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,175
It's in an alley near the college.

361
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,700
It's called...

362
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:06,875
Wow.

363
00:24:11,675 --> 00:24:12,700
Thank you, Senior.

364
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,525
That's the one, Senior.

365
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,875
Where did you find it?

366
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,200
It was hard to find.

367
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,225
Really? Thank you.

368
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,125
I've been looking for it but couldn't find it.

369
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,625
Senior.

370
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,350
Hello.

371
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,100
It wasn't nice of you the last time.

372
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,825
You left without paying.

373
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:53,850
That's right.

374
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,550
Wow.

375
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,850
You found this book for him?

376
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:01,300
Why don't you give it to him?

377
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,125
Oh, I forgot.

378
00:25:04,475 --> 00:25:06,900
You swore to not disturb him.

379
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,300
It's okay. I'll pass it to him.

380
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:10,250
Hey.

381
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:26,550
Here, someone had me pass this to you.

382
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,575
You already have it?

383
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,925
Yes, this is Senior Yim.

384
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:34,425
I've told you guys about him.

385
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:36,750
He was the one who showed me
the way to Gears Statue.

386
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,550
He found this book for me.

387
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,625
What do we do?

388
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:49,300
Let me handle this.

389
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,975
Senior Bohn told us to bring this to you.

390
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:56,900
You should decide yourself who to choose.

391
00:25:58,075 --> 00:26:00,125
I mean which book to choose.

392
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,350
I'll leave now.

393
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,450
Bye.

394
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:06,925
Bye, Senior.

395
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,800
See you later.

396
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,475
I'm sorry, Senior.

397
00:26:40,925 --> 00:26:43,200
Because I have to choose this book.
It's from a friend.

398
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:44,525
Or else he'll tease me.

399
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,000
Because he has a bad attitude.

400
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,225
It's okay. I understand.

401
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,925
Thank you so much.

402
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,900
Thank you for finding me this book.

403
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,975
Thank you.

404
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,325
Come.

405
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:08,700
Hurry.

406
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,275
Hello.

407
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:12,700
I'm called Boss.

408
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,675
I have a congenital disease.

409
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:15,950
It's fatal.

410
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,875
I'm going to sneeze to death,

411
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,375
if I can't get your heart.

412
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,275
It wasn't funny.

413
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,075
He's called Mek,

414
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,775
the leading man of this movie.

415
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,400
I was acting as a corpse.

416
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:30,375
But it's not an ordinary corpse.

417
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,475
It's the corpse of the leading man's best friend.

418
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,300
Even if I was killed,

419
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,650
I still know your heart.

420
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,125
Okay.

421
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:43,550
You don't talk a lot.

422
00:27:43,975 --> 00:27:47,900
Both leading roles are here.

423
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,650
Let's practice the script.

424
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,975
Here. Hurry.

425
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,000
Here you go.

426
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:02,925
Over here.

427
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:04,050
Did you...

428
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,675
draw this yourself? It's cute.

429
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:10,350
Please give it back to me.

430
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:11,125
Oh.

431
00:28:12,075 --> 00:28:12,550
Here you go.

432
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,075
Hold on.

433
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,150
Is there anyone else in this scene?

434
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:25,150
No.

435
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,225
Then...

436
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:28,050
Oh.

437
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,125
I'll not disturb then.

438
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,525
Go ahead with your practice.

439
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:38,425
Oh. Let's start here.

440
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,100
Mek.

441
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,025
I have always loved you.

442
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,675
But I was hiding my love,

443
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,375
because we are friends.

444
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:55,375
Cut.

445
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:01,125
It's influential.

446
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:03,775
The word "love" started from inside,

447
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:04,750
filled the pancreas,

448
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,475
then was spitted out through the mouth.

449
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,975
This movie can join the Cannes Film Festival.

450
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,700
Mek.

451
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:15,300
Which college are you and your friend from?

452
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,475
Engineering college.

453
00:29:16,825 --> 00:29:19,550
Will you be here for the next scene?

454
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,125
Next scene? Of course.

455
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:22,125
Why did you ask?

456
00:29:22,775 --> 00:29:23,550
Nothing.

457
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,875
Are you tired?

458
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:34,646
Mek.

459
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,075
See you tomorrow.

460
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,875
See you tomorrow.

461
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:38,775
Bye.

462
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,525
What did you say to her just now?

463
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,025
Did she mention me?

464
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:48,925
No.

465
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:51,500
That really hurts.

466
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:54,250
I'm so sad.

467
00:29:55,075 --> 00:29:56,400
She didn't mention me at all?

468
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,750
[To Boss, all the best. Fon]

469
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,075
Did you draw this yourself? It's cute.

470
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,400
Please give it back to me.

471
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,200
Here you go, Duen.

472
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:24,050
Senior Bohn had us pass you this
before you submit the report.

473
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:26,975
Oh.

474
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,025
I believe you can do this.

475
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,925
But if the report doesn't pass,

476
00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:47,050
I'll hug you myself to comfort you.

477
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,500
Ps: Celebrate with the thing in the box.

478
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:55,700
You were like an ant on a hot pan just now.

479
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,250
What did he give you?
You're smiling from ear to ear.

480
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:02,375
Let me see it.

481
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,350
Let's go. I have to submit my report.

482
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,250
What did he give you?

483
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,300
Hurry. I'm going to be late.

484
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,275
This rhythm is good.

485
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,900
Hey.

486
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:27,425
Don't worry.

487
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,000
If the report doesn't pass,

488
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:31,225
you'll only not see Junior for another week.

489
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:32,075
That's it.

490
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,450
Hello.

491
00:32:41,975 --> 00:32:43,200
I have already submitted my report.

492
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,200
So...

493
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:46,250
Passed.

494
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,100
So I didn't buy the cake for nothing.

495
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:53,175
Do you want to go somewhere together
this afternoon?

496
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,425
I have an activity.

497
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,300
Is there anything?

498
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,800
I'll go see you then. Bye.

499
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,800
Look at how wide is your smile.

500
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:08,775
Your boyfriend's report passed, right?

501
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:09,825
I'm happy for you.

502
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,075
But before you're happy for me,

503
00:33:16,175 --> 00:33:17,400
you have lost your bet.

504
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,375
Give me the money.

505
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,400
Hello, mother.

506
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,450
Where are you going?

507
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,275
Give me the money.

508
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:28,425
These guys...

509
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:34,875
[Report passed! Yeah!]

510
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:37,125
Everyone.

511
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:38,800
I have a question.

512
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,575
If the person you like...

513
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,375
chose someone else,

514
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:44,400
and the person he chose...

515
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:46,125
is a bad guy,

516
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,850
will you strive or give up?

517
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,950
Of course, give up.

518
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:51,700
Even if he has chosen a bad guy,

519
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:53,250
he has made his decision.

520
00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:56,825
Of course, strive.

521
00:33:57,775 --> 00:33:59,025
Exactly because he chose a bad guy,

522
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,975
you have to protect him.

523
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,600
Bohn.

524
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:22,200
We haven't met for so long,

525
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,975
yet we can't hug?

526
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:25,050
Knock it off.

527
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,875
You said you'll hug me if I fail.

528
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:30,075
But now I've passed.

529
00:34:31,825 --> 00:34:33,600
Why are you here?

530
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:36,350
I brought the cake here to share
with your friends.

531
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,350
No need.

532
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,200
I bought the cake for you to celebrate.

533
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,100
I've used your book.

534
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,025
So I thought about eating the cake with you.

535
00:34:47,675 --> 00:34:49,575
You used my book?

536
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:52,300
Yes. If I hadn't used your book,

537
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,600
you may tease me.

538
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,550
Let's eat the cake.

539
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,050
There's no spoon.

540
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,900
I'll get some spoons from the canteen.

541
00:35:05,175 --> 00:35:06,575
I'll leave this here.

542
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:15,425
Look at your smile.

543
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:18,975
But you'll not be able to smile much longer.

544
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:20,750
-What?
-Look who's here.

545
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,300
Carry on with your work.

546
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,350
I'll talk to him myself.

547
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:34,875
Okay.

548
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,075
What's going on?

549
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,950
I came to tell you, I like Duen.

550
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,500
I like Duen too.

551
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,925
I know.

552
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:56,400
But I also know how Duen thinks about you.

553
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,500
So I will stop going after him.

554
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:01,350
Because I don't want to be the third part.

555
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,400
But if you make Duen sad,

556
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,050
I will surely snatch him from you.

557
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,675
Oh, Senior Yim.

558
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,625
Why are you here?

559
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:27,525
I came here for some business.

560
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,100
I'm leaving now.

561
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:32,775
Senior, what's wrong?

562
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:36,075
You don't look so well.

563
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,850
I'm just...

564
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,775
crossed in love.

565
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,550
The one I like...

566
00:36:46,025 --> 00:36:47,000
has a boyfriend.

567
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,275
Oh my. A person like you will be crossed in love too.

568
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,399
Who is he?

569
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:53,000
He's really stupid.

570
00:36:54,575 --> 00:36:55,125
Yes.

571
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:56,975
He's really stupid.

572
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,650
It's okay, Senior.

573
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,550
Alright.

574
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,225
I'll buy you an ice cream to comfort you.

575
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:04,900
Okay?

576
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:07,225
Have you asked...

577
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,850
for his permission before buying me ice cream?

578
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,380
What are you looking at?

579
00:37:15,675 --> 00:37:16,950
What is it having to do with him?

580
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:20,675
Let me know when you're going to buy it.

581
00:37:21,925 --> 00:37:22,800
I'll leave now.

582
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,525
Let's eat the cake.

583
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,475
I've brought spoons.

584
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,125
Here.

585
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,500
Here.

586
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:02,650
Bohn.

587
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,575
Eat some.

588
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,250
What's going on?

589
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,248
Between me and the person just now,

590
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:11,375
who's better?

591
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,075
What?

592
00:38:13,575 --> 00:38:14,525
Why did you ask this?

593
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,450
Just answer me.

594
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:23,425
Senior is polite, gentle and warm. Unlike you.

595
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:24,550
That's enough. Just eat.

596
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,825
Stop it.

597
00:38:27,475 --> 00:38:28,525
I'm not done.

598
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,050
Duen.

599
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,475
You're not here for us, right?

600
00:38:35,925 --> 00:38:38,125
Hold on, it's not as what you think.

601
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,750
I just came here to give Senior the cake.

602
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,225
Senior Tee, the stick is found.

603
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,850
Okay, bring it there.

604
00:38:48,775 --> 00:38:49,925
You're looking for trouble.

605
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:51,800
Junior Duen.

606
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,950
Do you want to do charity work with us?

607
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,900
The quota is almost full.

608
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,750
Let's go.

609
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:01,750
You can train yourself with work.

610
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:02,600
That's right.

611
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,625
I haven't been in activities for quite some time.

612
00:39:07,075 --> 00:39:08,350
Then let's go.

613
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:11,425
Don't you remember the last time?

614
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,650
What happened?

615
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:22,025
The last time I joined an activity,

616
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,825
I got hospitalized
because I was allergic to insect bites.

617
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,925
From then on, my father
doesn't allow me to do charity work.

618
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:33,575
And the food.

619
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,050
I'm allergic to many kinds of food.

620
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,300
Especially ginger.

621
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,525
I can't eat that at all.

622
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:47,575
Then you should think twice.

623
00:39:47,575 --> 00:39:48,850
Let me know when you've decided.

624
00:39:49,325 --> 00:39:51,175
I'll reserve you a seat.

625
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:52,515
Okay.

626
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,125
Thank you.

627
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,900
There are many mistakes.

628
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,600
You can at least greet me, Cool Boy.

629
00:40:21,675 --> 00:40:22,571
What are you doing?

630
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:24,350
Work from Mr. Wechai?

631
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,475
Let me teach you, okay?

632
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,175
Here.

633
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:30,850
What's going on?

634
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:32,725
You don't want me to teach you?

635
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:33,975
Don't be shy.

636
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,575
Grab it. Tear it off.

637
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,979
Then you'll have nothing to submit.

638
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,250
Isn't this good?

639
00:40:46,525 --> 00:40:47,225
Let me see.

640
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:51,175
Here, listen carefully.

641
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,542
This adds to this.

642
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,425
And this...

643
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:42,325
Now it's all correct.

644
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,250
I told you it's easy.

645
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,375
You only need to memorize the formula.

646
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,900
If there's nothing, I'll leave now.

647
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,000
Goodbye.

648
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,325
What's going on?

649
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,150
What's going on?

650
00:42:05,675 --> 00:42:06,675
Hold on. Where are we going?

651
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:07,675
Cool Boy.

652
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,800
Where are you taking me?

653
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,350
Don't you know there's...

654
00:42:12,975 --> 00:42:13,550
Oh my.

655
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,050
Cool Boy.

656
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,050
I'm not going.

657
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,300
Cool Boy.

658
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,200
Cool Boy.

659
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:22,575
No, I'm afraid of dogs.

660
00:42:56,725 --> 00:42:57,925
I was wondering where you are taking me.

661
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,275
You want to thank me with a meal?

662
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:02,425
Alright then.

663
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,200
Hey girl.

664
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:05,725
-Coming.
-We want to order.

665
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,675
Here.

666
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,325
Hold on a second.

667
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh right.

668
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,475
Thank you for helping me just now.

669
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,875
When I was small, there was
a fierce dog near my granny's house.

670
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,000
One day, its leash broke and it bit me.

671
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,725
That's why I'm traumatized.

672
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:06,625
This...

673
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,525
My friend didn't order this.

674
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:10,325
This is on me.

675
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:11,900
Can I exchange this with your Line contact?

676
00:44:19,525 --> 00:44:21,975
I'll eat this for you then.

677
00:44:28,975 --> 00:44:29,625
Cool Boy.

678
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,825
You have to be more subtle in rejecting.

679
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:35,750
I don't even dare to order juice now.

680
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,675
It's to buy one and get one for free.

681
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,925
My car is right there.

682
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,600
Thank you for sending me.

683
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,225
If you have more questions,

684
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,150
you may ask me via text.

685
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:53,275
Don't mind that.

686
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,425
Hello, mother.

687
00:45:02,675 --> 00:45:05,175
I've eaten. A junior treated me.

688
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:06,825
What about you?

689
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,725
Where are you eating with your husband?

690
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,325
I'm going back.

691
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,450
Okay. I love you too.

692
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:18,550
Okay.

693
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,025
Oh my.

694
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,275
When did you buy that?

695
00:45:25,525 --> 00:45:26,150
For me?

696
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:41,225
[Thank you for teaching me, Senior.]

697
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:47,700
[Exclusive scenes]

698
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,775
Do you always eat alone?

699
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,650
If you don't want to talk to me,

700
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,950
you may also nod or shake your head.

701
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,625
Do you always eat alone?

702
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,250
Don't you feel lonely?

703
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,850
Food doesn't taste good when you eat alone.

704
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,750
You have to eat with friends.

705
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,250
Do you know the feeling of snatching for food?

706
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,500
You don't, right?

707
00:46:19,575 --> 00:46:20,975
The food you snatched is the yummiest.

708
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,300
You don't know that.

709
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,000
Do you know? I read something once.

710
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,675
Everyone has his standard of being alone.

711
00:46:31,675 --> 00:46:34,725
From level 15 on, is talking alone.

712
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:38,325
At level 35, is shopping alone.

713
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:42,100
At level 50, is watching movie alone.

714
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:44,975
As for Cool Boy like you,

715
00:46:45,275 --> 00:46:47,025
I guess you're...

716
00:46:48,325 --> 00:46:49,475
at level 75,

717
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:50,925
eating alone.

718
00:46:53,275 --> 00:46:55,125
You aren't at level 100 yet, right?

719
00:46:55,725 --> 00:46:57,000
Sitting on pedaling boat alone.

720
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,400
Here, take this.

721
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,625
Because you're my junior.

722
00:47:11,025 --> 00:47:11,975
Are you shy?

723
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,400
Don't be. Eat it.

724
00:47:13,775 --> 00:47:14,425
Eat it up.

725
00:47:16,675 --> 00:47:17,475
Eat it.

726
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:18,400
Hurry.

727
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,325
Isn't this good?

728
00:47:35,475 --> 00:47:38,003
Actually, I don't eat ginger,
but I'm willing to eat it.

729
00:47:38,003 --> 00:47:39,200
Because you gave it to me.
