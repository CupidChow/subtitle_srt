187
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:58,797
the two of you are in peace again, right?

188
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:03,372
Tang, look.

189
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:04,972
Even being ridiculed,

190
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:06,662
he still doesn't let go of Senior's hand.

191
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,172
He's even holding it so tightly.

192
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:11,072
Just tell them

193
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:13,572
what we did.

194
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:17,847
What did you do?

195
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:18,997
Nothing.

196
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:20,322
Sadhu.

197
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:21,972
Duen isn't lying, right?

198
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:22,597
Phu.

199
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:26,147
Let's eat.

200
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:26,547
Let's go.

201
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:29,797
Stop changing the topic.

202
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:31,447
What did you do? Be honest.

203
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:32,447
Are you shy?

204
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:37,722
Talking about hunger. We're hungry too.

205
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:39,322
We are all waiting for you, Bohn.

206
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,247
Exactly.

207
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:41,297
We didn't know where you were.

208
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:44,747
Let's go to eat.

209
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:46,547
Let's go.

210
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:49,247
Hey, hold on.

211
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:51,397
Where did Boss go?

212
00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:52,722
Why didn't I see him?

213
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,572
I don't know.

214
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:07,222
Mek.

215
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:08,347
Sorry.

216
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:10,997
Why are you apologizing to me?

217
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:14,397
You're my "talkative wife", not my wife.

218
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:15,547
No matter what,

219
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:17,622
we're just an imaginary couple.

220
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:20,922
No.

221
00:16:21,572 --> 00:16:22,847
Who said we're just an imaginary couple?

222
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:25,472
We're an actual couple.

223
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:27,597
Stop joking around with me, okay?

224
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:39,022
Mek.

225
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:39,622
Hold on.

226
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:41,797
Listen, everyone.

227
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:44,072
You and I are a couple.

228
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:47,072
We're a couple.

229
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:49,447
Did everyone hear that?

230
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:04,889
It's enough. I'm shy.

231
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,497
Hubby, sorry.

232
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:09,625
Enough, stop it. I got it.

233
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,347

No way.

267
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,947
Where should Tang sleep then?

268
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:45,572
That's his business.

269
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:46,372
He is a grown-up.

270
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:47,897
I'm your boyfriend.

271
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:49,047
I want to sleep here.

272
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,197
You

273
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:54,822
are not mad with me anymore?

274
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:56,522
About me pushing you into the water.

275
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:58,247
Who's mad with you?

276
00:18:58,822 --> 00:18:59,822
I'm not mad at all.

277
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,847
I was just teasing you.

278
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:03,822
You!

279
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:06,297
Always like to make me upset.

280
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:10,197
It's just that teasing you

281
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:11,272
is quite fun.

282
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:14,597
But I don't think it's fun.

283
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:16,647
Sleep outside tonight.

284
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:20,822
Do you think you can chase me out?

285
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:33,797
Duen.

286
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:35,997
Duen.

287
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:45,722
Senior Bohn.

288
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:47,572
You may sleep with me.

289
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:55,197
No need. I'm shy.

290
00:19:55,197 --> 00:19:56,097
Thank you.

291
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,747
Bohn, look at this.

292
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:31,822
Be careful.

293
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,072
Okay, I get it.

294
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:39,997
Can you walk?

295
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:42,947
Here.

296
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:50,522
I'm so tired.

297
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:53,697
Get on.

298
00:20:56,397 --> 00:21:00,247
Go! We want to be the first one to arrive!

299
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:20,372
Do you want me to take a photo of you?

300
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:22,572
Okay.

301
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:28,072
Just over here.

302
00:21:37,572 --> 00:21:38,272
A photo together?

303
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:39,772
Here.

304
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:47,222
Everyone.

305
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:49,572
Let's have a group photo.

306
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:50,926
Here, let's take a group photo.

307
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:52,247
Come on.

308
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:54,872
Hurry up.

309
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:55,922
Bohn, hurry.

310
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:56,946
Tang, Ting Ting.

311
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:57,772
Ram, hurry.

312
00:21:57,922 --> 00:21:59,297
Come on.

313
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:01,272
Chim, take my photos too.

314
00:22:01,272 --> 00:22:02,247
Take a good one.

315
00:22:02,772 --> 00:22:04,097
Get in.

316
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:05,147
Get closer.

317
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:06,147
Come.

318
00:22:06,547 --> 00:22:07,622
Ready.

319
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:09,222
One, two, three.

320
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:12,597
Another one, okay?

321
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:13,397
Okay, another one.

322
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:15,547
Ready. One, two, three.

323
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,547
Another one. One, two, three.

324
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:36,122
Hey, you guys.

325
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:38,322
Hey, get out.

326
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:41,147
Get out.

327
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:45,722
What's going on? I want to sleep.

328
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:47,122
Let's play cards.

329
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:48,522
No.

330
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:51,397
You won so much money yesterday.
My wallet is getting empty.

331
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:55,422
We won't play with money this time,

332
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:57,097
but something else.

333
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:04,672
What's with today?

334
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:06,122
Are you playing tricks?

335
00:23:06,122 --> 00:23:07,297
Let me do it.

336
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:08,872
Hurry.

337
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:09,622
Seniors.

338
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:11,872
Where's Senior Bohn and Duen?

339
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:15,647
They have turned
the charitable event to honeymoon.

340
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:16,547
Get a seat.

341
00:23:16,547 --> 00:23:18,522
-Sit.
-Sit in a circle.

342
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,197
Okay, Senior.

343
00:23:21,522 --> 00:23:22,354
Do you know, Senior?

344
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:24,947
I brought many coins today.

345
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:27,422
I can play for a very, very long time.

346
00:23:27,422 --> 00:23:30,597
But we're not playing with money today.
We're playing with this.

347
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:34,097
What?

348
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:35,797
My exclusively made liquor.

349
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:39,247
This liquor is mellow and smooth.

350
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:40,272
But the aftershock is great.

351
00:23:41,722 --> 00:23:42,947
If you're afraid,

352
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:44,147
just quit.

353
00:23:44,147 --> 00:23:45,072
Then I shall go first.

354
00:23:45,197 --> 00:23:46,947
Hold on.

355
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:47,847
Okay.

356
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:48,672
Are you ready?

357
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:49,272
Ready.

358
00:23:49,272 --> 00:23:49,772
Come on.

359
00:24:06,147 --> 00:24:08,647
Don't worry, you will surely lose.

360
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:11,347
Because my cards are straight.

361
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:12,747
Five, six, seven.

362
00:24:17,047 --> 00:24:18,647
Oh, my. Yours is a full house.

363
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:22,747
My junior, I'll drink.

364
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:24,647
-Don't stop me.
-Senior.

365
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:25,372
What?

366
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:26,947
Senior, you don't have to drink.

367
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:29,741
Your identity

368
00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:33,335
is my senior, our senior.

369
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:36,872
Let me drink for you.

370
00:24:36,872 --> 00:24:38,372
Yes, you should respect me like that.

371
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:40,172
Senior, remember.

372
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:42,197
-Keep that in your brain.
-You must respect me.

373
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:45,347
You must remember that I sacrificed
myself today to drink for you.

374
00:24:45,347 --> 00:24:45,997
Awesome.

375
00:24:47,772 --> 00:24:48,797
Bottoms up.

376
00:24:48,797 --> 00:24:49,847
Cheers.

377
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:51,822
Great.

378
00:24:52,297 --> 00:24:54,272
This is my junior.

379
00:24:56,147 --> 00:24:58,647
I think you can't drink anymore. Let's go back.

380
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:00,472
See you later, Senior.

381
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:01,872
See you.

382
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:04,497
-I'll take you back.
-I don't want to.

383
00:25:17,747 --> 00:25:19,097
Will you do anything to me?

384
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:22,722
Don't touch me. I want to sleep here.

385
00:25:28,547 --> 00:25:30,072
I told you to leave me alone.

386
00:26:18,497 --> 00:26:20,097
Why did you take me away?

387
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:21,872
I want to keep playing.

388
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:25,122
No. You're very tired.

389
00:26:25,747 --> 00:26:26,447
You want to sleep.

390
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:38,322
Boss.

391
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:40,397
I want to ask you something.

392
00:26:41,272 --> 00:26:42,072
What?

393
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:47,322
Last night,

394
00:26:48,447 --> 00:26:51,872
where did you go?

395
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:03,272
I sent Fon downhill.

396
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:06,397
Then I told her...

397
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:07,772
Fon.

398
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:11,072
I think you shouldn't quit showbiz.

399
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:15,947
Why?

400
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:18,972
What about our past, Boss?

401
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:22,197
I'm very grateful for you, Fon.

402
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:24,872
I have even liked you.

403
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:28,122
But I realize I like Mek more.

404
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:33,072
Thank you for coming to see me.

405
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:35,747
I will help you look for a car to go back.

406
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:45,447
It's okay.

407
00:27:49,672 --> 00:27:52,197
I know. I know it all.

408
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:07,822
Don't worry about me.

409
00:28:11,297 --> 00:28:11,997
I'm okay.

410
00:28:40,222 --> 00:28:42,597
So I chose you.

411
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:49,147
If that's the case, you should be rewarded.

412
00:28:49,147 --> 00:28:50,222
Hey, Mek.

413
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:52,497
Mek.

414
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:56,572
Let go. I'm drunk.

415
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:22,350
Junior Phu.

416
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:25,447
Come to sleep in my place?

417
00:29:25,522 --> 00:29:26,447
I'm fine.

418
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:29,622
I beg you. I really don't want to go.

419
00:29:30,272 --> 00:29:30,997
I beg you.

420
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:53,472
Let me go.

421
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:55,622
I told you to let me go.

422
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:02,122
I told you not to annoy me anymore.

423
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:08,522
Why?

424
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:11,722
It doesn't matter why.

425
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:13,472
You may leave now.

426
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:17,597
No. I won't leave if you don't tell me the reason.

427
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:20,497
I told you to leave.

428
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:22,097
You're annoying.

429
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:23,497
Get lost.

430
00:30:26,597 --> 00:30:27,097
Why?

431
00:30:38,147 --> 00:30:39,047
The person who knows me well

432
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:42,297
is you, Senior.

433
00:31:02,722 --> 00:31:03,572
It's okay.

434
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:10,647
Is this the Venus plant I gave you?

435
00:31:10,822 --> 00:31:12,397
I just find it weird that you took it along.

436
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:14,447
It's very important to me.

437
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:30,072
Did you make it yourself?

438
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,222
Let me see it.

439
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:36,297
I think Ram and Senior King are a match.

440
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:37,797
A good looking couple.

441
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:40,897
You're speaking really softly.

442
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:48,847
I feel horrible.

443
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:51,722
I said I feel horrible.

444
00:31:54,322 --> 00:31:54,947
Because of me?

445
00:32:00,547 --> 00:32:01,147
Yes.

446
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:03,947
Because you make me feel very good.

447
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:07,447
That's why I feel horrible.

448
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:11,297
Do you know?

449
00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:14,272
Do you know how hard it is for me
to control myself when I'm near you?

450
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:20,547
This makes me feel really horrible.

451
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:25,072
That's why I want to be distant from you.

452
00:32:25,822 --> 00:32:27,072
So I won't be tortured anymore.

453
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:31,772
This is the reason.

454
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:35,272
I told you now.

455
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:36,897
Are you happy now?

456
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:38,572

What's going on?

469
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:39,472
Can you tell me?

00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,397
Something about you.

Whenever I think about you seeing Mai yesterday,

472
00:34:49,097 --> 00:34:50,422
I feel afraid.

473
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:52,922
Why are you afraid?

474
00:34:56,422 --> 00:35:00,447
I don't like him at all.

475
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:05,222
I know.

476
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:11,647
But I'm afraid you may be bored of me one day.

477
00:35:12,597 --> 00:35:13,947
I'm so dumb,

478
00:35:14,672 --> 00:35:17,122
not cute and I can get nothing done.

479

But do you know?

480
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:27,697
You're the cutest little dumb.

481
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:38,897
Close your eyes.

482
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:42,572
Why should I close my eyes?

483
00:35:43,797 --> 00:35:44,822
Just close them.

484
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:50,147
Okay.

00:35:59,822 --> 00:36:00,922

Hello.

504
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,622
Fellow juniors.

505
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:43,247
Hurry. Get up to feel the fresh air.

506
00:37:44,247 --> 00:37:49,372
Hurry, everyone. Take a shower, dress up and then eat.

507
00:37:49,722 --> 00:37:52,947
After packing up, we shall go back at 10 a.m.

508
00:37:55,347 --> 00:37:56,622
Those still in the tents, get up.

509
00:37:58,122 --> 00:38:02,422
Fellow juniors, wake up. Wake up!

510
00:39:08,272 --> 00:39:10,347
How are you? Did you sleep well last night?

511
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:14,747
You...

512
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:16,497
Regarding last night...

513
00:39:16,497 --> 00:39:17,172
What?

514
00:39:17,997 --> 00:39:18,897
Did you forget it?

515
00:39:25,622 --> 00:39:28,447
Don't tell me you were so drunk
that you forgot about last night?

516
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,722
I was playing cards with Senior Tee.

517
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:36,326
Then...

518
00:39:36,326 --> 00:39:37,147
Then blackout, right?

519
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:38,322
Great.

520
00:39:38,597 --> 00:39:40,797
Hurry to take a shower.

521
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:42,122
I'll do that later as well.

522
00:39:55,247 --> 00:39:56,097
My car is here.

523
00:39:57,222 --> 00:39:58,597
I will go to see my grandma later.

524
00:39:59,097 --> 00:39:59,672
Okay.

525
00:40:02,397 --> 00:40:05,422
Send us a message when you arrive at your grandma's.

526
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:06,672
Be safe on the road.

527
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:08,372
Goodbye.

528
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:27,547
Then...

529
00:40:30,447 --> 00:40:31,247
See you in the apartment.

530
00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:57,372
I wasn't drunk last night.

531
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,997
What?

532
00:41:18,047 --> 00:41:18,822
What?

533
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:20,497
What are you looking for?

534
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:23,422
Dessert. I bought it this morning.

535
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:24,697
I don't know where I put it.

536
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,072
Here.

537
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:37,197
I saw that you forgot about it. So I took it for you.

538
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:40,273
What would you do without me?

539
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:49,622
I don't know how to cycle.

540
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:52,622
Teach me.

541
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:54,647
But ballroom dance is for two.

542
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:58,797
So you must dance with your wife.

543
00:41:58,797 --> 00:42:00,522
I must learn how to play the guitar.

544
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:03,147
But you must teach me.

545
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:05,547
Hubby, compose a song for me.

546
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:06,972
Please.

547
00:42:07,072 --> 00:42:07,922
I've composed it.

548
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:09,347
Play it for me.

549
00:42:09,822 --> 00:42:11,047
Play it yourself.

550
00:42:11,722 --> 00:42:13,047
Play it for me.

551
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:21,547
Hey.

552
00:42:26,322 --> 00:42:27,622
Don't eat that.

553
00:42:30,872 --> 00:42:32,597
You're always teasing me.

554
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,747
Hey, give me some.

555
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:52,822
Fine, I will not eat yours.

556
00:42:54,422 --> 00:42:55,647
I will eat another bag.

557
00:43:09,522 --> 00:43:11,572
Hey, share your Line with me.

558
00:43:25,972 --> 00:43:28,622
Regarding the necklace, thank you again.

559
00:43:32,072 --> 00:43:33,147
What's there to thank for?

560
00:43:34,372 --> 00:43:35,197
It's just a small matter.

561
00:43:39,272 --> 00:43:40,247
We're senior and junior.

562
00:43:41,822 --> 00:43:42,472
Don't think too much.

563
00:43:44,397 --> 00:43:44,897
I'll go now.

564
00:44:13,997 --> 00:44:14,847
I have sent you a photo.

565
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:15,597
Have a look.

566
00:44:37,522 --> 00:44:39,297
I'm going to record the ending of my show.

567
00:44:39,997 --> 00:44:44,597
Okay, everyone. Now you see how tough my life is.

568
00:44:44,997 --> 00:44:48,347
Alright. If you want to see where
Ting Ting is going to take you next,

569
00:44:48,347 --> 00:44:50,115
don't forget to follow Ting Ting's channel.

570
00:44:50,115 --> 00:44:52,397
That's all for today. Bye-bye.

571
00:44:54,697 --> 00:44:57,810
Ting, why didn't you tell me
you're recording this ending?

572
00:44:58,097 --> 00:45:00,072
I want to appear on your channel.

573
00:45:00,522 --> 00:45:02,472
You're a busybody. It's done now.

574
00:45:13,522 --> 00:45:14,022
Bohn.

575
00:45:16,772 --> 00:45:17,550
Give me your phone.

576
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:33,400
Don't peek.

577
00:45:51,097 --> 00:45:51,647
Here.

578
00:46:03,322 --> 00:46:04,872
Babies, the bus is here.

579
00:46:04,872 --> 00:46:06,447
Let's get into the bus.

580

are in a relationship.]
