[My Engineer]
[Episode 10]

2
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:06,027
Why don't you pick up Senior's call?

3
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:07,100
Are you two fighting again?

4
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,154
No.

5
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:12,230
It's just that I did something to him yesterday.

6
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:13,701
So I'm sure he wants to kill me now.

7
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:15,927
You did something? What does that mean?

8
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:16,882
Share with us.

9
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,625
That means...

10
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:25,569
What? You've teased Senior to that extend?

11
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,446
I was in the mood.

12
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:31,971
He must be waiting for me at the school gate now.

13
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:36,921
Please buy me some time.
I'll leave from the back gate.

14
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,975
Okay?

15
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:41,136
No problem. Don't worry, let me handle it.

16
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:43,919
I can even take Senior back to my house.

17
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,265
Ting, that's your friend's husband.
You're really desperate.

18
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,625
Then I'll go first.

19
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:50,718
I'll handle this to you.

20
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:51,693
Bye-bye.

21
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:03,223
Duen.

22
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:05,748
Oh, Senior Thara.

23
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:07,657
You scared me. What's going on?

24
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:09,386
My mother has something for auntie.

25
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:10,400
So I'll just pass it to you.

26
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:11,394
Okay, Senior.

27
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:18,313
Here you go.

28
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:19,824
Thank you, Senior.

29
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,659
I'll leave now then.

30
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,752
Hold on.

31
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,164
There's more. Hold on.

32
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:25,987
Senior Thara, hurry up.

33
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,319
I don't want anyone to see this.

34
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:31,494
Who are you looking for?

35
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:33,343
Bohn.

36
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:34,834
Get here.

37
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:41,295
Oh.

38
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:50,460
Tell me. What did you do to me last night?

39
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,746
Why am I in pain?

40
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:55,967
What pain?

41
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:58,213
You know it. Why are you asking?

42
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:00,420
Tell me.

43
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:05,927
Are you sure you want to know?

44
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,279
I'm ready.

45
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:08,790
Tell me.

46
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:13,659
Okay, I'll tell you then.

47
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:17,796
It started when I picked you up at the bar.

48
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:20,221
I took you back.

49
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,649
You could take him back, even when he's so drunk.

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,796
Bohn.

51
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:33,561
Ben, please bring a towel and water.

52
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,316
Okay.

53
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:35,350
Okay, thank you.

54
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:36,006
You're welcome.

55
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:38,969
How can you be so drunk?

56
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:08,133
It's so warm.

57
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:11,990
Warm, it's so warm.

58
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:15,449
Here you go.

59
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:16,702
Thank you.

60
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:17,378
You're welcome.

61
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:24,157
Ben, you may go to bed now. I'll take care of him.

62
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:25,271
Okay.

63
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,046
Bye-bye.

64
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,119
Bye-bye.

65
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,155
Get here.

66
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:33,938
-Take off my clothes for me.
-I know you're warm.

67
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,895
Take off my clothes.

68
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:03,342
Get here.

69
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:05,370
Where are you going?

70
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:19,425
Is it better?

71
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:21,235
Hmmm.

72
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:28,809
My legs are warm.

73
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:35,032
You want me to rub your legs?

74
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:36,364
Yes.

75
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:15,529
Why isn't yours like mine?

76
00:07:15,926 --> 00:07:19,306
Are you envious?

77
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:24,236
Do you want some? I have a lot.

78
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,491
You're a sweet talker.

79
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:39,644
I'll damage your pride later.

80
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,334
What do you want to do?

81
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:53,978
What do you want to do?

82
00:07:55,668 --> 00:07:56,443
Me?

83
00:07:57,437 --> 00:07:58,829
I want to make you happy.

84
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:00,021
What?

85
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:03,341
It may hurt a little.

86
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:09,147
Get ready. One, two, three.

87
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,626
It hurts.

88
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,932
It isn't clean yet. I think we need to do it again.

89
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:18,709
Get ready. One, two, three.

90
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:20,399
It hurts.

91
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:24,912
I think we need to do it another time.

92
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:25,727
Oh.

93
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:39,186
How can you fall asleep like this?

94
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:53,600
So, my backside hurts because I fell from my bed?

95
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:55,389
Yes.

96
00:08:58,172 --> 00:08:58,769
What else would it be?

97
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:01,313
Do you think I would rape you?

98
00:09:04,455 --> 00:09:07,198
Yes. I was really disturbed.

99
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,566
Let me ask you.

100
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,337
If I really did it, what would you do then?

101
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:28,311
Let me make marinated eggs for you today.

102
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:31,413
I'm just kidding.

103
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:35,031
I'll make fried pork for you, okay?

104
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:38,769
I want to have marinated eggs today.

105
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:41,035
Are you making fun of me?

106
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,679
You wanted to eat fried pork yesterday.

107
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:47,059
But I don't want it now.

108
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,776
What trick are you playing?
Why are you so changeable?

109
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:57,655
Today, I want to eat marinated eggs.

110
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:08,112
Okay then.

111
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,156
I'll be back in a while.

112
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,583
Father Bohn and Mother Duen are good again.

113
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:21,512
Is that good?

114
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,758
Yes, it's much better.

115
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:26,045
Right. This is much better.

116
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:29,961
If I really did it,

117
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,293
what would you do then?

118
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:35,627
I may just accept it.

119
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,285
No matter what identity I have,

120
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,486
as long as I'm with you, I'll be happy.

121
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:50,239
Are you sure?

122
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:51,591
Yes.

123
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,025
But regarding identity,
can we think about it in the future?

124
00:10:57,655 --> 00:11:00,756
Right now, I just want you to be how you used to be,

125
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,196
who don't act wildly and rebel against me.

126
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,178
I like that person more.

127
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:15,070
Yes.

128
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,205
If Daonua and Ben also want me to be my usual self,

129
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:20,875
I'll be my usual self again.

130
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:24,255
Here you go.

131
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:27,436
I bought eggs.

132
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,531
I'll make it for you when we're home.

133
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:33,917
I want a super big portion.

134
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:36,064
Since we have many eggs.

135
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:38,231
What nonsense is that?

136
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,086
Let's go home.

137
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:49,702
You're treating me to a meal
to thank me, right?

138
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:55,786
Like I said.

139
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:58,350
How was it? Did you pass?

140
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:02,545
Just keep it. Take it as your lucky pencil.

141
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,056
Didn't you lose your old one?

142
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:19,802
Is this your family photo?

143
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,267
Let me guess.

144
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:25,130
This man is your father.
This is your younger brother.

145
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:27,535
This foreign woman is your mother.

146
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,312
Looks like she's scolding you.

147
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,366
Who is this?

148
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,414
Your girlfriend?

149
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:39,205
If she's not your girlfriend, why are you shy?

150
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:49,722
She's my neighbor.

151
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,965
Neighbor? But she likes every photo of yours.

152
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:59,126
Is she really your neighbor?
She's your girlfriend, right?

153
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:08,211
Let's go back on our own.

154
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:09,885
Hey.

155
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,446
You want to send me back?

156
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:16,263
Oh, you're afraid that I may
meet the dog in the alley, right?

157
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:17,714
Don't worry.

158
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:20,557
I'll buy something first
then go back via another alley.

159
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:21,650
It's very safe.

160
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:24,215
Goodbye.

161
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:31,968
Father Bohn, goodbye.

162
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:33,698
Bye-bye.

163
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:39,324
Hey, hold on.

164
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:41,531
What else do you want?

165
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:43,380
I was very obedient to you today.

166
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:44,513
Not about that.

167
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:47,853
It's about you removing my leg hair.

168
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:49,980
I haven't punished you for that.

169
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,044
What do you want me to do?

170
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,773
How will you forgive me?

171
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:04,837
Tomorrow,

172
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,250
I want you to sleep in my apartment.

173
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:36,063
Hey, what are you doing to me?

174
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:38,946
You'll have no way to resist me now.

175
00:15:47,017 --> 00:15:47,992
Don't tell me

176
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:50,676
you're going to whip me
with your belt like in movies.

177
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:53,281
No.

178
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:57,137
No!

179
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:57,693
I think

180
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,318
he'll surely torture me.

181
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:01,709
He'll lock me up,

182
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:02,882
and then treat me like a slave,

183
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:04,572
until he's satisfied.

184
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:05,546
Calm down.

185
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:06,958
Don't exaggerate it.

186
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:08,429
Senior only wants you to
spend a night at his place.

187
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:09,880
He's not going to torture you.

188
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:13,121
When are you spending a night at his place?

189
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:14,493
I've been rejecting it for days.

190
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,222
But I think I can't escape it today.

191
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,429
He said he would wait for me at the school gate.

192
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:19,184
Today?

193
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:22,683
But didn't we want to choose a present
for my father together?

194
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:23,479
That's true.

195
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:25,188
That's right.

196
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,719
I'll tell him that I'm not going.

197
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:33,160
I'm not coming today. I forgot that
I had promised Tang to go out with him.

198
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:36,162
I don't trust you.
You're trying to avoid it, right?

199
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:40,993
No. He wants me to help
choose a present for his father.

200
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,604
Liar.

201
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,858
Go check it, if you don't trust me.

202
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:47,395
I'll send you the address of the mall later.

203
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:52,186
That's good.

204
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:54,035
I'll sacrifice myself

205
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,705
to spend a night with Senior on your behalf.

206
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:58,588
Not good?

207
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,798
Looks good.

208
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:08,608
Let me take it.

209
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:10,616
Oh, Senior Thara.

210
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:11,212
Oh.

211
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,299
-Hello, Senior.
-Hello.

212
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:15,407
Senior, it's been a long time.

213
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:16,460
Are you here to buy something?

214
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:19,820
Yes. I'm here to buy a birthday present
for my pet, Cupcake.

215
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,862
Cupcake is a cute name.

216
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:24,631
Is it a dog or a cat?

217
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:26,520
Neither a dog nor a cat.

218
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:27,315
This is it.

219
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:28,866
Iguana!

220
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:32,703
It's not an iguana.

221
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,572
It's a lizard. Is it cute?

222
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:40,118
Senior Thara is like this.
He's cool but a little crazy.

223
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,303
Cute.

224
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:45,645
It's so cute.

225
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,051
Thank you so much.

226
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,874
You're so nice to send me off.

227
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,266
I'm not sending you off.

228
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:54,870
I'm just following the address that Duen sent me.

229
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:57,832
I'm here to see if he's really with his friends.

230
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:02,087
You're in your practical year, right? Is it tiring?

231
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:06,798
The cases that I'm in charge of?

232
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:09,005
A patient had stomachache yesterday.

233
00:18:12,305 --> 00:18:14,830
It seems to be a tumor.
But we don't know if it's malignant.

234
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:18,170
Work hard, Senior.

235
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:23,518
I don't really want to be involved
in your family matter.

236
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:26,361
But I think the person, who Duen is talking to,

237
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,727
isn't just his normal friend.

238
00:18:30,814 --> 00:18:33,399
What about this? I want to treat Bohn to ice cream.

239
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:35,069
Why don't I buy you one too?

240
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:37,792
I read his lips.

241
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,277
Duen wants to eat ice cream.

242
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:42,663
But he doesn't feel so well recently.

243
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:45,725
Really? I'll spare time for you then.

244
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,275
Bohn.

245
00:18:47,832 --> 00:18:48,985
Then that fellow said,

246
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:52,126
"Really? Why don't you take an injection in my room?"

247
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:55,585
I'll call you to confirm it then.

248
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:59,144
Then Duen said, "The needle has to be big."

249
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,504
I'll go now then.

250
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,080
Okay.

251
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:04,134
Goodbye, naughty boy.

252
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:07,235
Then the fellow said, "My needle is very big."

253
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,806
Beware, it may be very exciting.

254
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,239
He's flicking his forehead even in public.

255
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,631
He'll surely flick his other parts,

256
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:15,903
when they're alone.

257
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:24,015
Bohn.

258
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:26,241
What's going on with you?

259
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:28,329
-Hold on, Bohn.
-Come on.

260
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:29,064
What do you want?

261
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:31,708
What's going on?

262
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:33,418
Get into the car.

263
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:47,036
What's wrong with you?

264
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:49,879
I saw my boyfriend being intimate with others,

265
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:52,046
could I be indifferent?

266
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:54,233
It's not as what you think.

267
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:57,335
Senior Thara is my elder brother.

268
00:19:57,434 --> 00:19:58,686
Stop lying to me.

269
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:02,126
You're the eldest child.
How can you have an elder brother?

270
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:05,645
I don't care. I want to make you mine.

271
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:06,917
Bohn, stop it.

272
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:07,593
Stop.

273
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,899
Senior Thara is the son of my auntie.

274
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:18,488
He's my cousin.

275
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,317
It's not as what you think.

276
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:21,191
Are you sure?

277
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,710
Do you want to call my mother to ask her?

278
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,480
Let her tell you.

279
00:20:33,478 --> 00:20:34,352
You're really...

280
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:37,434
We're already together.
Yet you're always so hot-tempered.

281
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,786
Sorry.

282
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:40,535
I'm just jealous.

283
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,563
Don't hate me.

284
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,022
I won't hate you,

285
00:20:47,374 --> 00:20:50,058
if you don't do this again.

286
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:51,231
Get it?

287
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:02,603
Oh, no.

288
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:04,849
There's a mark now.

289
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,314
What would others say?

290
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:08,786
That's better.

291
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:11,648
So others will know that you're owned.

292
00:21:15,764 --> 00:21:16,599
Are you insane?

293
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:20,316
Actually, I can do more than leaving marks.

294
00:21:21,171 --> 00:21:22,404
Want to try it in my apartment?

295
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,849
I'm not done choosing present with Tang.

296
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:27,831
Besides, the exam week is coming.

297
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:31,410
Can I go after the exam?

298
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:35,585
You always reject me.

299
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:37,453
The exam is really coming soon.

300
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:40,137
You don't want me to have a bad result, right?

301
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:41,390
Then...

302
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:44,571
Study in my apartment.

303
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:47,135
I promise not to disturb you.

304
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:49,501
I just want to be close to you.

305
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:04,451
Bohn, stop looking at me that way.

306
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:07,394
You know I can't resist it.

307
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:12,523
Sleep in my room.

308
00:22:12,523 --> 00:22:13,656
♪ Give someone you love ♪

309
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:18,944
♪ your entire heart ♪

310
00:22:18,944 --> 00:22:20,853
As I said, let's do it after the exam.

311
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:29,083
♪ Don't mind what others think ♪

312
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:36,042
♪ It doesn't matter
if it's heaven or earth ♪

313
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:40,992
Hi, Ram. Why didn't you call
or text me that you're coming?

314
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,258
I can cook for you.

315
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:44,233
It's okay.

316
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:46,559
Where's dad?

317
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:49,044
Hey, darling. I'm so hungry.

318
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:51,350
Oh, Ram.

319
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:52,841
You're back home today.

320
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:07,712
What are you cooking for me today?

321
00:23:07,712 --> 00:23:08,527
Roasted beef.

322
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:09,401
You know me.

323
00:23:10,813 --> 00:23:14,232
Tonight, let me give you a big surprise.

324
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,028
Okay.

325
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:20,336
So sweet. I don't think you need a meal.

326
00:23:20,535 --> 00:23:21,787
Just skip to dessert.

327
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:25,863
Kids, don't make fun of your parents.

328
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:28,010
Look.

329
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:33,517
I heard that you said it's broken.

330
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:35,107
I took it to fix it.

331
00:23:35,187 --> 00:23:36,379
Look at your mother.

332
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:40,316
Regarding this watch, I've asked in many places,

333
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:42,423
but no one was willing to fix it.

334
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,352
Your mother has fixed it for me.

335
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:46,320
So lovely.

336
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:50,932
I'll go pack my stuff.

337
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:57,035
How is it? Have a look.

338
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:18,228
Oh, Pin.

339
00:24:18,785 --> 00:24:20,037
Why are you sitting here alone?

340
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:21,588
Are you troubled?

341
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:24,471
What is this then?

342
00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:26,976
You're frowning very hard.

343
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:29,123
We're good friends since small.

344
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,687
How would I not know if you're troubled?

345
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:33,079
Tell me.

346
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:36,976
If

347
00:24:38,964 --> 00:24:40,017
the person you love the most

348
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:41,926
betrays you,

349
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:44,809
what would you do?

350
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,260
It's hard to answer.

351
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:52,323
I think, everyone has a good side

352
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,133
and a bad side.

353
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,890
But I think there's surely a reason

354
00:24:58,089 --> 00:24:59,739
for him to do that.

355
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:04,729
But if we still love him,

356
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:08,606
we should only look at his good side.

357
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:15,962
Don't be troubled.

358
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:19,043
Show me your smile.

359
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:20,773
Like this.

360
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:27,174
Look. You look so much better with a smile.

361
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,737
Demonstrate the secret code
to share answer again.

362
00:25:46,737 --> 00:25:47,810
Oh.

363
00:25:49,202 --> 00:25:49,898
Listen well.

364
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:50,773
This is A.

365
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:53,953
Okay, B is like this.

366
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:57,572
Okay. If it's C, it'll be this.

367
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,210
Okay?

368
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:02,979
Show me once.

369
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:09,440
What are you two doing?

370
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,766
I've asked King to share his answer
with me using secret code.

371
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,397
I learnt it from a movie.

372
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:15,385
Just like this.

373
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:18,367
But I heard there aren't objective questions in the exam.

374
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:18,884
What?

375
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,349
Time for the exam.

376
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:22,124
Let's go.

377
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,914
Silly boy.

378
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:25,464
Hey!

379
00:26:25,464 --> 00:26:25,961
Wait for me.

380
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:32,741
It looks good.

381
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:34,371
Sit.

382
00:26:37,711 --> 00:26:38,347
Hey, Duen.

383
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:40,693
What happened to your neck?

384
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:42,621
Neck?

385
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:45,643
When I was changing light bulb last night,

386
00:26:45,842 --> 00:26:47,353
I burnt myself.

387
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:51,786
Although I look stupid,

388
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:53,794
I'm not that stupid.

389
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,322
Be honest.

390
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,228
Did Senior do something very hardcore
to you yesterday?

391
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:04,013
I really burnt myself,
when I changed the light bulb.

392
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:05,961
He's refusing to be honest.

393
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,445
I've restrained him. Remove his plaster.

394
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:08,446
-Hurry.
-Let me go.

395
00:27:10,991 --> 00:27:12,701
I'll go revise for exams. Bye.

396
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:17,711
It's suspicious. What do you think?

397
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,526
Yes.

398
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,820
Goodbye, Miss. Thank you.

399
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:35,086
Please come in.

400
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:41,448
Hello, doctor.

401
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:48,923
What problem do you have?

402
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:50,016
My stomach aches.

403
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:51,527
You're in the hospital now.
You'll be fine.

404
00:28:51,527 --> 00:28:52,303
Hurry in.

405
00:28:55,543 --> 00:28:57,849
The patient has a stomachache.
We've treated her abdomen problem.

406
00:28:58,485 --> 00:28:59,678
She should be fine now.

407
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:03,316
But I

408
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,120
found a tumour in the patient's abdomen.

409
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,633
We have to examine it,
to find out if it's benign or malignant.

410
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:11,487
Malignant?

411
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:15,165
Malignant means cancer.

412
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:58,366
Hey.

413
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,435
Actually, it's fortunate this time.

414
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:06,616
The possibility is 50%.

415
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:08,744
Even if it's malignant,

416
00:30:11,447 --> 00:30:12,938
I think the treatment will be in time.

417
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:16,855
Don't be so nervous.

418
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:19,559
How can I not be nervous?

419
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:21,189
She's my mother.

420
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:23,714
She's not your mother. Of course, you're relaxed.

421
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:25,324
That's not what I mean.

422
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:03,276
Not all patients' families
understand our good intention.

423
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,594
Why do you have time with us today?

424
00:31:33,853 --> 00:31:35,026
Don't you need to take care of your wife?

425
00:31:36,735 --> 00:31:38,246
Because Duen went to celebrate with his friend.

426
00:31:38,703 --> 00:31:40,135
That's why he looks so upset.

427
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:42,759
Who's upset? I'm not upset.

428
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:45,900
He needs time for his friends as well.

429
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,377
Do you understand?

430
00:31:46,377 --> 00:31:47,570
Oh.

431
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,167
Stubborn.

432
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:49,797
Okay, what about this?

433
00:31:50,314 --> 00:31:52,004
I'll cook for you later.

434
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,588
I guarantee it'll be very delicious.

435
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,258
Give me some time.

436
00:31:56,576 --> 00:31:58,385
Hold on a second.

437
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:00,970
I'll make a great meal.

438
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:01,666
Okay.

439
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:04,827
You're really crazy.

440
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:10,294
Oh, right, Bohn.

441
00:32:11,188 --> 00:32:12,242
Does Boss know how to cook?

442
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:14,369
Oh, right, that time...

443
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:23,303
This...

444
00:32:23,303 --> 00:32:24,787
No, I think this is better.

445
00:32:24,787 --> 00:32:26,530
No, order this one.

446
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,570
But I want this more.

447
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:28,565
No.

448
00:32:28,565 --> 00:32:30,831
You don't agree with me.

449
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,322
Does anyone want a pizza?

450
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:33,037
Me.

451
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:33,972
I don't want it.

452
00:32:33,972 --> 00:32:35,224
Take this. I want this one.

453
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,564
No, I want this one.

454
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:39,638
This is good.

455
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:41,129
Hello.

456
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:41,924
No one agrees with me.

457
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,037
What?

458
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:44,787
You want me to come to you now?

459
00:32:56,298 --> 00:32:58,465
Guys, I'm sorry.

460
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,691
There's a sudden change of plan.

461
00:33:02,302 --> 00:33:05,045
Bohn and the rest don't know how to cook.

462
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:08,604
You want to ditch us again?

463
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:12,699
We rarely gather. I want to have dessert here.

464
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:17,510
It's okay.

465
00:33:18,544 --> 00:33:21,884
Having a party with a group of men is awesome.

466
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:22,600
Ting.

467
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:24,608
You're doing it again.

468
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,445
Duen, where are the seniors now?

469
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:29,518
In Senior King's house.

470
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:38,305
I can't take this anymore. Let's eat it raw.

471
00:33:38,544 --> 00:33:40,989
Hey, calm down.

472
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:42,600
I'm starving.

473
00:33:50,353 --> 00:33:51,049
Hey.

474
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:51,705
What?

475
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:55,602
Hello, are you here?

476
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,325
Okay. Come in right away.

477
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:06,337
I can't take this hunger anymore.

478
00:34:09,498 --> 00:34:10,432
Wow.

479
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:19,160
Hello.

480
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,387
-Hello, seniors.
-Hello.

481
00:34:21,387 --> 00:34:22,460
Hello.

482
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,647
Where is the food I'm supposed to cook?

483
00:34:25,442 --> 00:34:25,999
Here.

484
00:34:30,373 --> 00:34:31,745
Why did you buy so much?

485
00:34:32,261 --> 00:34:33,931
There is pork and vegetables.

486
00:34:36,277 --> 00:34:38,464
Let's make pork hotpot.

487
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:39,399
Okay.

488
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:40,234
Let's eat.

489
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:40,890
Awesome.

490
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,375
Let me prepare it then, seniors.

491
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:44,548
Okay.

492
00:34:44,548 --> 00:34:45,263
Thank you.

493
00:34:45,701 --> 00:34:48,047
Bohn, help me get the stuff into the kitchen.

494
00:34:48,245 --> 00:34:50,631
Oh, you're ordering me around
as soon as you arrive?

495
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:51,685
Are you going to do it?

496
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:52,401
Yes, I am.

497
00:34:57,391 --> 00:34:59,061
So obedient.

498
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:04,707
I didn't expect you to come.

499
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:17,132
What's troubling you?

500
00:35:17,545 --> 00:35:18,563
Look at your frown.

501
00:35:21,665 --> 00:35:22,241
Come with me.

502
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:33,156
Is something fishy going on between them?

503
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:35,323
I don't think so.

504
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,589
Brother King always likes
to be friends with weird people.

505
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:42,420
There's something you don't know.

506
00:35:43,136 --> 00:35:46,714
Tee told me that Ram went to King's apartment.

507
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,001
They even met King's sister, Kumfah.

508
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:51,764
Furthermore, Tee said,

509
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,740
Kumfah told him that they were very close.

510
00:35:55,899 --> 00:36:00,273
They were hugging and kissing in public.

511
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,700
No wonder. As I said,

512
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,901
the arm in Senior King's profile picture

513
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,307
is surely Ram's arm.

514
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:19,995
They can't escape from my gay detector.

515
00:36:31,227 --> 00:36:32,241
This is my secret base.

516
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:35,521
When I'm feeling bad, I like to relax here.

517
00:37:14,587 --> 00:37:18,006
Every plant requires time to be nursed.

518
00:37:18,623 --> 00:37:20,233
It isn't easy to raise them.

519
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,428
But once it grows, we can admire
such beautiful flowers.

520
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:28,722
Look.

521
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,136
Beautiful, right?

522
00:37:54,308 --> 00:38:05,263
♪ Give someone you love
your entire heart ♪

523
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:07,425
I don't know why you are sad.

524
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:09,835
But no matter what it is, it'll pass.

525
00:38:09,835 --> 00:38:10,809
♪ Don't mind what others think ♪

526
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:14,487

00:38:14,487 --> 00:38:15,123
♪ It doesn't matter ♪

528
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:16,356
the beautiful flowers will bloom.

530
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:26,455

♪ If love sprouts at the bottom of your heart ♪

533
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:31,286
A quiet person like you

534
00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:32,935
can hardly find someone who knows you, right?

535
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,805
♪ Let it grow at its will ♪

536
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:37,012
That's why you always encounter sad things.

537
00:38:38,245 --> 00:38:40,869
Let's do this. Whenever you're unhappy,

538
00:38:41,465 --> 00:38:42,698
you may talk to me anytime.

539
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:44,189
Okay?

540
00:38:58,225 --> 00:38:59,000
The person who knows me

541
00:39:01,445 --> 00:39:02,101
is you.

542
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:09,517

548
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:54,606
Senior King and Ram came this way.

549
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:55,540
Where did they go?

550
00:40:01,505 --> 00:40:02,717
Cool Boy, be gentle.

551
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,849
Cool Boy, it's coming out.

552
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:12,280
Cool Boy.

553
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:15,043
Cool Boy.

554
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:22,678
What are you doing?

555
00:40:24,328 --> 00:40:25,183
My hand is pricked by a thorn.

556
00:40:26,236 --> 00:40:27,012
What's going on with you?

557
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,133
Oh, thorn?

558
00:40:31,027 --> 00:40:32,797
What else could it be other than
being pricked by a thorn?

559
00:40:34,984 --> 00:40:37,449
I just want to tell you
the pork hotpot is ready. Let's eat.

560
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:38,363
Oh, okay.

561
00:40:38,383 --> 00:40:39,298
We'll be there soon.

562
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,304
Let's go for the pork hotpot.

563
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:58,860
Let me have the dip.

564
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:05,341
Eat this.

565
00:41:08,005 --> 00:41:08,701
Is it delicious?

566
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:11,624
Bohn, is this water?

567
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,486
Yes, but there's some alcohol in it.

568
00:41:15,143 --> 00:41:16,017
Your glass is over there.

569
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:18,562
What?

570
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:19,814
Why didn't you tell me?

571
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,484
Who would have known?

572
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:26,137
Oh, sister.

573
00:41:28,463 --> 00:41:29,437
Hello.

574
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:31,306
Hello.

575
00:41:31,484 --> 00:41:32,260
You're here, sister.

576
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:34,765
Why is it me again?

577
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,236
Thank you.

578
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:38,880
Everyone, this is Sister Kumfah, my elder sister.

579
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,127
Hello, sister.

580
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:46,276
I unintentionally found out that
there's a boy's party today.

581
00:41:46,653 --> 00:41:47,767
So I came to have a look.

582
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:49,934
Is it okay, Brother Ram?

583
00:41:51,663 --> 00:41:52,558
Sister, you know Ram?

584
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:53,870
Of course.

585
00:41:56,952 --> 00:42:00,272
Oh, Boss. Where's your quiet husband?

586
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:01,683
Why didn't he come along?

587
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:04,407
Mek? He's in my heart.

588
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:06,653
I'm just kidding, sister.

589
00:42:06,812 --> 00:42:08,820
He's studying at home, that's why he didn't come.

590
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,967
Oh.

591
00:42:17,389 --> 00:42:18,741
Hey, Bohn.

592
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:22,717
Who's the one leaning on you?

593
00:42:24,128 --> 00:42:27,409
I think I smell the stink of love.

594
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:34,463
He's Duen, my boyfriend.

595
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:35,381
Really?

596
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,033
Not those jokes like Boss's, right?

597
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,558
No.

598
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:47,289
This is my first time seeing a gay couple
since I was born.

599
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:50,888
Have you two been together for long?

600
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,100
No, sister.

601
00:42:52,518 --> 00:42:54,307
We only got together a short while ago.

602
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:00,490
You only drank a little, yet you're so drunk.

603
00:43:02,577 --> 00:43:05,222
What? I only drank a glass, yet you're worried.

604
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,200
You're together for not long, that means

605
00:43:12,915 --> 00:43:13,790
you're still virgin?

606
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:16,474
Right?

607
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:22,021
Are you looking down on me
when you say that?

608
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:24,446
Have a good look, sister.

609
00:43:31,981 --> 00:43:33,591
What are you doing?

610
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:38,820
Hey.

611
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:39,973
Don't stop.

612
00:43:40,987 --> 00:43:41,762
Keep going.

613
00:43:42,657 --> 00:43:43,889
I want to see it.

614
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:46,653
Hey.

615
00:43:51,623 --> 00:43:54,108
Duen.

616
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:55,579
Don't sleep now.

617
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:57,150
What is this?

618
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:07,587
You're drunk.

619
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:08,561
Hold on, Ting.

620
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:09,863
Can you go home?

621
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:10,490
Are you drunk?

622
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,631
There's staircase ahead.

623
00:44:14,128 --> 00:44:16,076
Staircase.

624
00:44:16,096 --> 00:44:16,692
Carry your leg.

625
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,627
Carry your leg.

626
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:19,734
Are you okay?

627
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,736
Sister, be safe on your way home.

628
00:44:22,736 --> 00:44:23,353
Okay.

629
00:44:24,048 --> 00:44:24,625
Be safe.

630
00:44:25,201 --> 00:44:25,917
Goodbye, sister.

631
00:44:26,712 --> 00:44:27,567
Bye-bye.

632
00:44:27,607 --> 00:44:28,283
Goodbye.

633
00:44:28,283 --> 00:44:29,973
Bye-bye.

634
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:31,305
Okay.

635
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:34,366
What about you guys?
Don't you want to spend a night here?

636
00:44:34,366 --> 00:44:35,341
Bohn and Duen are sleeping here.

637
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:38,402
I have something to do tomorrow morning.

638
00:44:38,621 --> 00:44:39,535
I'll go now.

639
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:40,708
Bye-bye.

640
00:44:40,768 --> 00:44:41,384
Are you okay?

641
00:44:41,961 --> 00:44:42,796
Bye, juniors.

642
00:44:42,796 --> 00:44:43,690
Goodbye, Senior.

643
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,977
Goodbye.

644
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:46,454
What about you guys?

645
00:44:47,507 --> 00:44:49,138
It's okay. We're sorry.

646
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:50,311
Look at Ting.

647
00:44:50,331 --> 00:44:51,444
Take good care of your friend.

648
00:44:51,444 --> 00:44:52,812
Are you okay? Look at her clothes.

649
00:44:52,812 --> 00:44:53,591
Okay, Senior. We can deal with this.

650
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:54,409
We're going home now. Let's go.

651
00:44:54,446 --> 00:44:55,758
Do you need a bag?

652
00:44:56,275 --> 00:44:56,911
It's okay, Senior.

653
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:57,786
-Let's go.
-Bye.

654
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:10,927
What are you doing?

655
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:12,796
My father...

656
00:45:13,054 --> 00:45:14,625
Ram, aren't you coming?

657
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:15,261
We're leaving now.

658
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:17,169
Ting can't hold on any longer.

659
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:24,744
Let's go.

660
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:31,006
♪ Having you is like having the whole world ♪

661
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:36,374
♪ Your love filled my heart ♪

662
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:44,343
♪ I have been looking for true love my whole life ♪

663
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:51,722
♪ Now I finally know you're the person
I was waiting for ♪
