00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,950
[My Engineer]
[Episode 9]

2
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:00,631
I think

3
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:02,315
it's time for the result.

4
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:21,984
Stop.

5
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:25,082
Are you satisfied now?

6
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:39,999
If you ever make my friend sad,

7
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:42,074
you'll be dead.

8
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:45,924
That day will never come.

9
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:55,518
Do you want to die here?

10
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:57,142
Why did you do that?

11
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:58,646
Why did you do that?

12
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:01,142
Duen, that's enough.

13
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:01,683
He may die.

14
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:02,495
Why did you do that?

15
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,443
Why did you do that?

16
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:06,315
Duen.

17
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:09,142
Duen.

18
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:31,819
Ram.

19
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:33,743
Can you go back by yourself?

20
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:38,916
This punch is to punish your ruthlessness.

21
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:42,044
No matter what, thank you.

22
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,601
Thank you for always caring for me.

23
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:45,621
Okay.

24
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,871
Let's go back then.

25
00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:50,946
Let's go.

26
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:52,691
-See you.
-Bye-bye.

27
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,232
Bye-bye.

28
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:55,458
Are you sure you can go back?

29
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:08,210
You can't ride. Let me send you.

30
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:15,668
Oh, right, this is for you.

31
00:04:15,728 --> 00:04:18,225
As an apology for lying to Sister Kumfah
about your sharp voice.

32
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,127
Venus plant.

33
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,022
But it just sprouted.

34
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:31,368
It's very hard to raise.

35
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,881
It finally sprouted after so long.

36
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,417
I saw that you were interested in it.

37
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:36,089
So I would like to gift it to you.

38
00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:39,488
When you're interested in it,
it's like you're interested in me.

39
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:47,879
I

40
00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:50,165
like it a lot.

41
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:52,240
Thank you.

42
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:53,352
Oh, my.

43
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:55,277
You have never spoken so much to me.

44
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:56,961
Here, take these too.

45
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,345
Let's go home.

46
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:00,871
You should try raising it too.

47
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,029
Come over here.

48
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:43,879
Stop the screaming.

49
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:45,894
Didn't you act very formidably
when you fought Ram?

50
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:47,939
I was not pretending to be formidable.

51
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:50,555
I did everything for you.

52
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,112
Puke.

53
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,097
Show me the other side of your face.

54
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:16,571
Be gentle.

55
00:06:17,473 --> 00:06:18,165
Okay.

56
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,781
Let's do this side first.

57
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:32,270
Is this gentle enough?

58
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:38,405
Too gentle. A little rougher, okay?

59
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:41,082
Okay, what about this?

60
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:46,555
It really hurts.

61
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:48,450
For you.

62
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:51,127
Once again.

63
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:51,999
No.

64
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:27,488
Hey, Cool Boy.

65
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,946
What about I buy you 10 more
Venus plants tomorrow?

66
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:32,931
So you'll talk more to me.

67
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:34,916
I talk normally too.

68
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:36,059
Yes, I know.

69
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:38,345
But why don't you talk
when you're with me?

70
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:40,510
Try to say more.

71
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:42,044
More.

72
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,638
No. Say a longer sentence.

73
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:44,180
A sentence.

74
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:48,751
Are you looking for trouble?

75
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:50,977
Speak properly.

76
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:52,119
I like Senior King.

77
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:52,751
I like...

78
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:56,450
Why don't you say it?

79
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,337
Could you really like me?

80
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:01,984
I like Senior King.

81
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:02,616
Senior King is cute.

82
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:04,420
Senior King is the best in the world.

83
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,022
Cool Boy.

84
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:06,405
Come back and talk to me.

85
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,127
This flower is for someone important to me.

86
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:34,736
Crazy.

87
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:37,593
What did you say?

88
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:40,631
Everyone is watching us.

89
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:42,074
I can do something even worse.

90
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:05,804
Then Duen bites the lips of Bohn desperately.

91
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:09,204
The blazing tongue crawls into
Bohn's mouth gradually.

92
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:11,458
What are you reading?

93
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,067
Everyone likes to see you
and Duen being together.

94
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,074
So someone wrote a novel about you two
on the "Wretched Kid" website.

95
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:22,014
The novel is called
"My Doctor - The Wife of Medical Senior"

96
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:24,029
The author is Momphor.

97
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:27,037
Besides, do you know, Bohn?

98
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,503
This novel is at the top in the list now.

99
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:33,172
I think it will be used for a drama series soon.

100
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:36,841
Actually, I don't care what they write.

101
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:40,330
But why did they describe me as Duen's wife?

102
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,315
It's not true.

103
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:45,292
There's a plot in an abandoned house in the woods.

104
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:46,977
You are his wife there too.

105
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,443
I think this author has misunderstood.

106
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:50,225
Trust me.

107
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:53,172
I think it isn't a misunderstanding.

108
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:54,826
Because I read the reviews.

109
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:55,247
Where?

110
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:55,819
Look.

111
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:58,074
The readers think you're the wife too.

112
00:09:58,285 --> 00:10:01,804
Because they think Duen
is more handsome than you.

113
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:02,916
That's true.

114
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:06,977
Maybe even Duen thinks you're the passive one.

115
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:11,037
Impossible.

116
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:14,646
Although he's a little silly,
he knows that he's my wife.

117
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:19,879
Then Duen bites the lips of Bohn desperately.

118
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:28,059
Oh, my. This speaks my heart.

119
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,653
Although I haven't kissed anyone,

120
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:31,638
the author knows that, if I progress,

121
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,292
Bohn will surely be shy.

122
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:35,007
What you mean is

123
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,864
this novel is like the real life
of yours and Senior Bohn?

124
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:38,736
Yes.

125
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:41,052
I pushed him to the table,

126
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:42,495
and then attacked him.

127
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,503
Don't you think that's just like me?

128
00:10:50,195 --> 00:10:52,330
Brother Duen, be clear-headed,

129
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,563
and stop reading novels.

130
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:55,999
You're just an O.

131
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:57,563
O?

132
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,337
What O?

133
00:10:59,668 --> 00:11:02,165
In the world of fetish girls, O means passive.

134
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:05,593
According to your behavior,

135
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:07,939
you're always obedient to Senior.

136
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:08,661
So,

137
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:10,134
you're passive.

138
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:13,473
Crazy.

139
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,488
I'm so manly. Of course, I'm the active one.

140
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:17,804
Duen is so silly, he has to be passive.

141
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,849
But he's more handsome than you.

142
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,555
I understand. It's hard to accept at the beginning.

143
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:23,909
But once you make your first step,

144
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,059
you'll get used to it soon.

145
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,465
Trust me, brother.

146
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:32,480
Senior looks more progressive than you.

147
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,247
I understand. It's hard to accept at the beginning.

148
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:37,383
But once you make the first step,

149
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:38,525
you'll get used to it soon.

150
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:45,352
I repeat it for the last time,

151
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:46,886
Duen is my wife.

152
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:48,781
Hey!

153
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:52,420
I repeat it for the last time,

154
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,134
Bohn is the passive one.

155
00:11:58,165 --> 00:11:59,217
Let's go.

156
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:07,157
Brother.

157
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:07,728
What?

158
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,563
Can I buy snacks, please?

159
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:10,555
Snacks?

160
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:13,142
Okay, go ahead.

161
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,525
Let's go, Ben.

162
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:19,909
Duen.

163
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,420
Here, the tissue paper you told me to buy.

164
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:28,089
Great, thank you.

165
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:30,977
What did you buy then?

166
00:12:33,774 --> 00:12:35,458
I was craving for some fried pork.

167
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,563
Good.

168
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:43,277
You're always obedient to Senior.

169
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:43,849
No matter what,

170
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,082
you're the passive one.

171
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:47,909
I changed my mind.

172
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:50,134
I want to make marinated eggs today.

173
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:51,728
What's wrong with you?

174
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:54,796
Don't you normally eat what I want to eat?

175
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:57,082
I just don't want to listen to you today.

176
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,924
What's wrong with you?

177
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,037
Nothing's wrong.

178
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,059
But from today on,

179
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,653
I'll not obey you anymore.

180
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:12,510
Brother Duen, what's going on?

181
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:14,946
I'm fine.

182
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,962
Let's go buy some eggs.

183
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,315
Let's go.

184
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:27,819
Brother Bohn.

185
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:30,435
Why is Brother Duen so fierce today?

186
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:46,465
Mek, open the door for me.

187
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:51,759
Hubby, it's your wife.

188
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,962
Open the door for me.

189
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:55,037
Hubby, your wife is here.

190
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:55,759
Are you at home?

191
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,646
Open the door for your wife.

192
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:01,653
Next time, can you let me know before you come?

193
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:04,300
Sorry. I have something urgent
to discuss with you.

194
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:05,954
Excuse me.

195
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:15,007
Look at this.

196
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,856
Actor selection.

197
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:20,811
Look at the organizer's name.

198
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:22,916
Tri Creation.

199
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:24,571
Isn't this Fon's company?

200
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:27,518
Yes. I'm thinking

201
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:29,172
if I can become an artist too,

202
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:31,789
I can get nearer to her.

203
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,330
Good idea.

204
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:37,202
But do you think you'll be selected?

205
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:40,931
Why can't someone like me be a celebrity?

206
00:14:42,345 --> 00:14:43,909
I'm going to be direct to you.

207
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,736
You can neither sing nor dance.

208
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,300
You can't even breathe properly.

209
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,142
How can you compete?

210
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:51,668
That's why I came to see you.

211
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:57,232
Teach me how to play the guitar, okay?

212
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,578
How can you make it in time?

213
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,352
The selection is next week.

214
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:04,420
Look.

215
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:07,518
I've prepared clothes to stay here for a week.

216
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,894
I must learn how to play the guitar.

217
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:12,781
Please teach me.

218
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:16,510
Except my love for her, I have no competence.

219
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:28,872
Hey.

220
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:30,435
Why do you treat me like this, hubby?

221
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:32,029
Even love isn't your competence.

222
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,796
Most importantly, the bicycle date was my idea.

223
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:39,247
I was just acting cool.

224
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:42,405
Teach me how to play the guitar, please.

225
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:43,428
No.

226
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:45,443
Most importantly, I don't want to live with you.

227
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:46,465
I like to live alone.

228
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:48,540
It's really urgent for me.

229
00:15:54,014 --> 00:15:57,503
Okay, I'll just kneel here and not leave,

230
00:15:57,954 --> 00:15:59,187
until you agree to teach me.

231
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:06,435
Hey.

232
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:09,413
Mean hubby, open the door.

233
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:10,195
Hey, Mek.

234
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,270
Hey, Mek.

235
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:33,563
Hello.

236
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:36,480
Are you here for a bouquet?

237
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:39,157
Can I pay with kisses?

238
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:45,022
Mother, why are you here?

239
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:47,187
I told you that you don't have to come to the shop.

240
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:50,977
I'm so bored at home.

241
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:53,804
I'll take care of the shop today. Go and rest, child.

242
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:56,450
Mother, I've discussed with my brother and sister.

243
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,405
We want you to rest at home.

244
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:00,119
We will take care of making money.

245
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,774
I still can work.

246
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,811
Look, you're still coughing.

247
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:05,743
Don't work.

248
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,638
Trust me, I can work.

249
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:10,916
I don't care. I'm going to arrange
some flowers for customers.

250
00:17:26,405 --> 00:17:27,428
Yo.

251
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,533
We meet again.

252
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,601
Do you still have a headache?

253
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:36,210
Why are you mentioning that?

254
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:37,533
Okay.

255
00:17:37,713 --> 00:17:38,946
I think you're fine now.

256
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:40,480
I want three bouquets of jasmine.

257
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:43,428
You want to do business with me?

258
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:46,856
If you keep talking, I won't sell it to you.

259
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:48,781
Okay.

260
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:58,255
Wow, what are you doing?

261
00:17:58,255 --> 00:17:59,037
It looks yummy.

262
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:00,962
Marinated eggs.

263
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,480
Marinated eggs. Not bad.

264
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:09,172
I like whatever you make for me.

265
00:18:09,774 --> 00:18:11,969
There's another reason
that you're the passive one,

266
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:15,187
because you like to cook for Senior.

267
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:18,766
You're like a good wife. How can you not be passive?

268
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:22,525
I don't feel like cooking today.

269
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:23,458
You should do it.

270
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:25,743
Hey.

271
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:28,089
Hold on. Are you serious?

272
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,533
Yes, I'm serious.

273
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:32,811
I would like to watch you cook too.
Is there a problem?

274
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:35,698
Yes. I don't want to cook.

275
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:38,315
If you don't want to cook, then let's not eat.

276
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,563
Brother, who's cooking then?

277
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:55,879
My honey and I are hungry.

278
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,165
Can Brother Bohn cook?

279
00:19:18,285 --> 00:19:22,465
No. Even the instant noodles he cooks are very bad.

280
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,571
Bohn, the pan is going to be on fire.

281
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,563
Turn off the fire.

282
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:34,886
Hurry, turn off the fire.

283
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:35,428
It's burnt.

284
00:19:35,428 --> 00:19:37,022
What are you doing? It's burnt.

285
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:38,959
Hurry, turn off the fire.

286
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:39,518
Where?

287
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:40,661
Over there. Turn it off.

288
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,736
Oh my, turn it off.

289
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:43,849
Is it off?

290
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,232
Turn it off. Turn it.

291
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:46,044
Is it off?

292
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:46,796
Is it actually off?

293
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:47,849
I don't know. I can't see it.

294
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:49,292
Turn it, turn it.

295
00:19:49,383 --> 00:19:51,759
Don't worry, Honey.

296
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,683
I was the one who poured the hot water.

297
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:00,480
If it's not enough,

298
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,435
there's a marinated egg.

299
00:20:05,112 --> 00:20:06,255
Is that edible?

300
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,503
Take your black egg away.

301
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,360
It's edible.

302
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:13,774
It's crispy.

303
00:20:16,992 --> 00:20:18,495
Let's eat instant noodles.

304
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:18,886
Let's eat.

305
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:35,277
Thank you, Father Bohn.

306
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:36,751
Thank you for sending me home.

307
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:37,804
Bye.

308
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,187
Bye-bye.

309
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:45,322
Hey, hold on.

310
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:46,977
I'm asking you seriously,

311
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,300
what's wrong with you today?

312
00:20:49,774 --> 00:20:50,315
Nothing.

313
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:51,337
How can it be?

314
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,345
You're normally an obedient and gentle silly boy.

315
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:56,751
You listen to everything I say.

316
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:00,781
From now on, you shall get to know me again.

317
00:21:01,232 --> 00:21:03,157
You have to listen to me.

318
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:05,954
If there's nothing,

319
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:07,879
I order you to go back immediately.

320
00:22:01,774 --> 00:22:03,488
Yo, how did you sleep?

321
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:04,631
Good morning.

322
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:10,886
In my room, you have to obey my rules.

323
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:14,315
First, you'll go wherever I go.

324
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:18,616
Second, don't touch anything in my room.

325
00:22:18,616 --> 00:22:19,849
Got it?

326
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,082
Got it.

327
00:22:22,014 --> 00:22:25,864
Hey, that's the latest comic.

328
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:27,217
Awesome.

329
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:30,778
I just said, don't touch my things.

330
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:35,368
Sorry.

331
00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:44,210
Depressing. The mid-term exam is coming soon.

332
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,074
Why are teachers still giving us a test?

333
00:22:47,638 --> 00:22:48,931
Let's get to the battlefield.

334
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,413
Are you okay?

335
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,428
I'll come later.

336
00:22:59,428 --> 00:23:00,661
Okay, hurry up.

337
00:23:05,353 --> 00:23:05,894
Hey, Cool Boy.

338
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:08,420
Why didn't you go for the test?

339
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:21,172
I lost my pencil for the test.

340
00:23:22,556 --> 00:23:23,939
Why didn't you borrow one from a friend?

341
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,022
Or else you won't make it.

342
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:32,240
It isn't the same.

343
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:34,255
Why?

344
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:37,052
Is your pencil the pink lady version?

345
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,217
My mother carved my name on it.

346
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:04,661
Here, use mine first,

347
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:05,593
or you won't make it.

348
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,730
[Cool Boy]

349
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:21,783
The pencil my mother gave me brings good luck.

350
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:23,672
Oh, I forgot about it.

351
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:25,739
Here, let God King do his magic.

352
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,628
It'll surely work.

353
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:37,787
It's blessed. Take it.

354
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:39,695
That's how I get first places in every subject.

355
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:41,226
Take it. Hurry, or you won't make it.

356
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,163
Hurry up.

357
00:24:56,634 --> 00:24:58,184
Sorry, I borrowed your pencil just now.

358
00:24:58,403 --> 00:24:58,980
I forgot to return it to you.

359
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,385
Here, use mine first.

360
00:25:33,473 --> 00:25:34,824
Here, repeat the fourth chord.

361
00:25:37,946 --> 00:25:38,761
Wrong.

362
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:42,638
Which fret again?

363
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:43,830
I forgot.

364
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:45,759
How many times have I repeated?

365
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,488
One is fret one, two is fret two.

366
00:25:47,488 --> 00:25:48,721
What's the use of your brain?

367
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:50,908
I forgot since the first fret.

368
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:00,968
Then...

369
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:02,200
How to strum?

370
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,158
Oh.

371
00:26:10,093 --> 00:26:11,007
I get the feeling now.

372
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:20,113
I get it.

373
00:26:21,365 --> 00:26:22,041
Thank you.

374
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:06,832
Why did you withdraw so quickly?

375
00:27:08,144 --> 00:27:11,226
Your wife is cold. I need warmth.

376
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:13,929
Have you figured out
which song to play for the selection?

377
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:16,514
Regarding this,

378
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:18,979
I'm not planning to play the present songs,

379
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:20,132
because others may have done it.

380
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,432
So I'm planning to compose a new song.

381
00:27:24,963 --> 00:27:26,494
That's also good. But

382
00:27:27,011 --> 00:27:27,945
do you know how to compose?

383
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:32,796
This is another reason why I came to see you.

384
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:33,691
I remember, at the welcome party,

385
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,434
the song you composed sounded good.

386
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:40,768
Compose a song for me to join the selection.

387
00:27:41,603 --> 00:27:43,154
How much do you need me to help you?

388
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:44,705
Why don't I just join the contest for you?

389
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:48,383
Oh, hubby, you're mean.

390
00:27:49,178 --> 00:27:50,410
I'll compensate you with my body.

391
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,245
Okay?

392
00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:52,736
Compose a song for me, please.

393
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,854
Hey, young boy.

394
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:01,663
Our friend, Wai, is crossed in love.

395
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:04,764
Let's drink together tonight to comfort her.

396
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:10,490
Oh, you're with your wife.

397
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,836
Am I here at the wrong time?

398
00:28:13,353 --> 00:28:14,088
No.

399
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:16,434
I was just teaching him the guitar.

400
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:17,249
He wants to join the selection.

401
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:18,939
Oh, really?

402
00:28:19,078 --> 00:28:21,126
We can gather since everyone is here.

403
00:28:21,504 --> 00:28:22,677
Come on. Let's go.

404
00:28:22,756 --> 00:28:23,293
No.

405
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:25,341
I want to continue the practice.

406
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:27,150
I'm not going.

407
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,496
Bad Boss.

408
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:31,901
Even you want to abandon me?

409
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,617
Hey.

410
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,003
It's not like that, Wai. It's...

411
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:35,778
It's exactly like that.

412
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:38,124
No one loves me anymore.

413
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:40,251
I want to die.

414
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,021
I'm going to suffocate myself here.

415
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:45,102
Hey, she's going to suffocate herself.

416
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:45,934
Decide it quickly.

417
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,925
You have to go, or she'll die.

418
00:28:48,044 --> 00:28:49,416
You, hurry.

419
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:50,867
She's going to die.

420
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,036
Look.

421
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:58,859
He said he wanted to learn guitar this afternoon.

422
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:06,494
All of you have to be with me

423
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:08,124
until the shop closes.

424
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,674
Rotter Tee.

425
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:12,637
How dare you abandon me for another woman?

426
00:29:14,764 --> 00:29:17,826
Every man is like that, right?

427
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:20,152
It's okay.

428
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:22,040
Let's continue dancing.

429
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:27,110
I like this dance step a lot.

430
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:29,873
Bohn.

431
00:29:31,026 --> 00:29:32,100
Today, your wife...

432
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:34,625
Your husband, Duen, allows you to have fun here?

433
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:37,547
Which Duen? I don't know him.

434
00:29:37,547 --> 00:29:37,945
Oh.

435
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,350
This houseman is brave.

436
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,829
What happened? Did you fight?

437
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:47,110
Not really.

438
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:48,998
I don't know what happened recently.

439
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:49,774
He's so stubborn.

440
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,100
He doesn't do anything as I say.

441
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:56,036
I think, he may prepare himself
to be your husband.

442
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,541
As the wife, just take it, Bohn.

443
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:01,821
What do you mean by "wife"?

444
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,293
I'm his husband.

445
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,306
Get it?

446
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:05,042
Yes.

447
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:12,696
Hey, Fierce Tiger.

448
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:14,088
Relax.

449
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:15,122
Hello, senior.

450
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:16,632
Hello.

451
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,283
Senior Win.

452
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:18,819
Hello.

453
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:20,489
Do you still remember me? I'm Wai.

454
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:22,418
Save it, Wai. Get here.

455
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,021
You just came back from Singapore, Senior?

456
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:25,698
Vacation.

457
00:30:28,302 --> 00:30:31,165
Why are you looking so sad?

458
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,485
It's a long story.

459
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:37,845
Okay. Let's talk about it next time.

460
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:39,833
You may come and talk to me at my table.

461
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:41,404
We're having a gathering of college hunks.

462
00:30:43,253 --> 00:30:44,147
Okay.

463
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,042
Do you want to go there?

464
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,859
Bohn, the college hunks are there.

465
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:50,867
Take me there, please.

466
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:52,040
I don't want to.

467
00:30:52,338 --> 00:30:53,253
They just pretend to be cool.

468
00:30:55,777 --> 00:30:56,374
Who's scolding me?

469
00:30:57,785 --> 00:30:58,680
Hello, Senior Win.

470
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:00,787
I'm here. Where are you?

471
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:05,738
Oh.

472
00:31:07,984 --> 00:31:08,402
It's you.

473
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:10,091
Are you here to drink as well?

474
00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:14,545
Sorry, Senior.

475
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:15,917
Are you in there?

476
00:31:17,646 --> 00:31:19,058
Hey, Thara.

477
00:31:19,137 --> 00:31:19,734
Hey, Win.

478
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:20,887
Oh, Frong.

479
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:22,338
It's good that everyone's here.

480
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,545
Frong, this is Senior Thara.

481
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:26,215
Thara, this is Frong,

482
00:31:26,254 --> 00:31:26,771
our junior.

483
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,849
Here, get in.

484
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:32,318
Let's go.

485
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:37,328
Oh.

486
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,397
[Rotter Bohn]

487
00:32:05,698 --> 00:32:06,374
Hello.

488
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,719
Rotter Bohn, what's the matter?

489
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:12,278
Oh, Senior King?

490
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:13,690
Sorry, senior.

491
00:32:15,797 --> 00:32:16,214
What?

492
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:29,296
Oh, Duen.

493
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:30,171
You're here.

494
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:33,630
Sorry for disturbing you so late.

495
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:36,314
Bohn said he wouldn't go home
unless you pick him up.

496
00:32:37,228 --> 00:32:38,501
Duen, you're here.

497
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:41,533
I miss you so much.

498
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:48,381
Let go of me.

499
00:32:49,892 --> 00:32:50,747
What's wrong with you?

500
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:51,940
Why are you so drunk?

501
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,041
I'm troubled.

502
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:58,063
Duen, why are you sulking with me?

503
00:32:59,554 --> 00:33:01,383
Can you be the old Duen again?

504
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:05,479
I'll do anything you want.

505
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:09,992
You'll do anything?

506
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,212
Yes. As long as you can be the old Duen,

507
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,942
I'll do anything.

508
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:17,467
Come here.

509
00:33:20,827 --> 00:33:22,616
You're going to be hammered for drinking so much.

510
00:33:25,578 --> 00:33:26,214
Are you okay?

511
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,606
What, senior?

512
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:28,182
Are you okay?

513
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:29,554
Yes.

514
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:30,449
I am

515
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:31,761
okay.

516
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,425
Are you sure you're okay?

517
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:35,121
Of course.

518
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,188
Okay, then text me when you arrive home.

519
00:33:37,228 --> 00:33:37,824
Be safe.

520
00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:38,918
Okay. Goodbye, Senior.

521
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:39,952
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

522
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:45,359
Hey, you're leaving, brother?

523
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:46,453
Goodbye.

524
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:46,930
All the best.

525
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:47,546
All the best.

526
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:56,353
Are you okay?

527
00:33:57,009 --> 00:33:58,600
I am okay.

528
00:34:02,377 --> 00:34:03,789
Let's sit over there, okay?

529
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:27,327
Hey.

530
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:29,216
I have taken paracetamol.

531
00:34:29,912 --> 00:34:30,926
Can't I go back now?

532
00:34:31,423 --> 00:34:32,119
I'm tired.

533
00:34:34,643 --> 00:34:36,194
You didn't want paracetamol the last time.

534
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,142
Now you want it.

535
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,011
What do you actually want?

536
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:43,669
What I know for sure is

537
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:45,001
I don't want Thara.
(Paracetamol is called Phara)

538
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:48,918
Here, let me do it.

539
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:50,468
It won't hurt so much when I do it.

540
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:10,806
Why aren't you talking?

541
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:12,377
It doesn't hurt anymore?

542
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:14,902
No.

543
00:35:15,836 --> 00:35:18,361
Maybe it's better now because I'm drunk.

544
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:20,389
Are you hungry?

545
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:21,582
A little.

546
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:22,814
There's pork porridge.

547
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:30,687
It's good for sobering up.

548
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:48,798
Yummy.

549
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:49,832
Do you want some?

550
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:51,641
You shall eat first.

551
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:53,709
I bought this for you.

552
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:56,194
Yet you don't want to eat it. It's still warm.

553
00:35:56,353 --> 00:35:57,347
Okay, I'll eat first.

554
00:35:57,387 --> 00:35:58,381
What's going on?

555
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:04,285
Bad Mek.

556
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:16,890
Mek.

557
00:36:20,786 --> 00:36:21,701
Mek.

558
00:36:24,822 --> 00:36:25,180
I...

559
00:36:27,724 --> 00:36:28,420
I...

560
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,442
I love you.

561
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:49,573
You're indeed my best friend.

562
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,013
Thank you.

563
00:38:16,412 --> 00:38:17,128
What's going on?

564
00:38:21,978 --> 00:38:22,416
Sigh.

565
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:42,992
Brother Bohn.

566
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,444
Let's eat.

567
00:38:45,418 --> 00:38:45,974
Ben.

568
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:50,686
Do you know who sent me back last night?

569
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,277
Brother Duen.

570
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,764
He went back after he sent me home?

571
00:38:58,062 --> 00:38:59,791
He was in your room for a while.

572
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:02,356
Oh, my God.

573
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,573
But when he went back,
there was nothing suspicious, right?

574
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:10,269
Yes.

575
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,722
But at one point,

576
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:18,638
I heard moaning sound from your room.

577
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:20,765
What did I say?

578
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,853
You said, "Oh, it hurts."

579
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:34,642
There's a plot in an abandoned house in the woods.

580
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,387
You're his wife there too.

581
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:42,137
What actually happened last night?

582
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:43,390
You don't have to know.

583
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,040
Go downstairs.

584
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:54,722
Do you think Duen is the active one?

585
00:39:55,616 --> 00:39:56,511
Is there a problem?

586
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:57,823
He's so silly.

587
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:00,407
He even looks a little reserved.

588
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,563
This has nothing to do
with being active or passive.

589
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:05,696
If you don't believe it,

590
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:08,101
look at the skinny guy.

591
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:10,349
The buffed guy is my friend.

592
00:40:10,646 --> 00:40:11,680
He's the active one.

593
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:15,676
Can someone so sweet be active?

594
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:20,666
Yes. That's why active or passive one
has nothing to do with appearance.

595
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,356
Don't you think Duen is silly.

596
00:40:22,535 --> 00:40:24,324
He may be the active one.

597
00:40:24,582 --> 00:40:25,636
You have to be ready.

598
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,155
Here, sugar water.

599
00:41:07,743 --> 00:41:08,697
What happened last night?

600
00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:13,031
I only remember that
I asked you to compose me a song.

601
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:15,357
Then Wai came.

602
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:17,922
Then I went out.

603
00:41:18,856 --> 00:41:21,143
What else? You and Wai were both drunk.

604
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:22,654
Oh, no.

605
00:41:24,145 --> 00:41:26,033
I was supposed to compose at home.

606
00:41:26,332 --> 00:41:29,075
But you haven't composed a song for me yet.

607
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:33,469
Hey, hubby. Compose me a song.

608
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,039
Come on.

609
00:41:37,107 --> 00:41:37,982
It's done.

610
00:41:42,693 --> 00:41:45,616
Wow, thank you so much.

611
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:48,220
Play it for me, please.

612
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,493
Play your own song.

613
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:53,329
You play it. I don't even know the chords yet.

614
00:41:55,695 --> 00:41:56,471
Play it to me.

615
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,683
So I'll know how to play it.

616
00:41:57,803 --> 00:41:58,638
Come on.

617
00:41:59,155 --> 00:42:00,665
Okay, I'll only play it once.

618
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:03,628
Thank you so much.

619
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:35,079
From today on, you two will have new nicknames.

620
00:42:35,814 --> 00:42:39,035
The quiet husband and talkative wife
of Engineering College.

621
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,079
Too many vegetables.

622
00:42:56,311 --> 00:42:57,186
Exchange some meat with me.

623
00:43:00,606 --> 00:43:02,116
Exchange with me.

624
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:03,409
Too many vegetables.

625
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:06,391
Hey, did I let you eat that?

626
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:07,643
I don't have to ask.

627
00:43:07,782 --> 00:43:10,864
Because a hubby like you is always kind.

628
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,693
Right?

629
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:58,060
Mek, you

630
00:45:02,454 --> 00:45:03,766
played so well.

631
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:05,913
It even touched my heart.

632
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:10,963
It's just like my love to Fon
which can't be spoken out loud.

633
00:45:11,718 --> 00:45:12,832
Thank you so much.

634
00:45:13,189 --> 00:45:15,973
I can surely be selected with this song.

635
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:19,435
Go ahead and play.

636
00:45:27,523 --> 00:45:29,671
[Special scene]

637
00:46:30,585 --> 00:46:31,917
Hubby.

638
00:46:32,454 --> 00:46:34,124
Take your wife to puke.

639
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:42,613
I can't get up.
