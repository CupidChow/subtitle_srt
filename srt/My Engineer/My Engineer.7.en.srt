[Episode 7]

2
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:58,347
I'll get some water.

3
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:03,847
Are you tired?

4
00:02:03,897 --> 00:02:04,372
No.

5
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:05,447
Really?

6
00:02:05,497 --> 00:02:05,897
Yes.

7
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:07,372
But you're all sweaty here.

8
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:10,347
Excuse me. Can you take a photo of me?

9
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:11,347
Yes, sure.

10
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:18,522
Alright. One, two, three.

11
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,197
Another one, please.

12
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:21,147
Oh, okay.

13
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:23,897
One, two, three.

14
00:02:25,297 --> 00:02:25,822
Have a look.

15
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:28,172
Wow, it's great.

16
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:29,647
Your name is...

17
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:31,097
My name is Duen.

18
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:33,022
Duen is such a cute name.

19
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,847
Sorry, I don't want it anymore.

20
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,372
I'm called Num.

21
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:38,722
Are you a local?

22
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:40,448
I...

23
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:43,222
No. Duen and I brought the child here for fun.

24
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:46,947
Let's go, Daonua.

25
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:50,247
Hey, wait for me.

26
00:02:52,197 --> 00:02:54,697
I'm sorry. I have to go.

27
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:56,022
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:01,322
Senior Bohn.

29
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:03,822
Senior Bohn.

30
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:07,747
Senior Bohn.

31
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:13,322
Senior Bohn, what's going on?

32
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:16,847
Does this mean...

33
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:18,647
you're jealous?

34
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:24,572
What do you say?

35
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:28,397
Senior Bohn.

36
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:34,922
Sister Dao. Wait for me here.
I'll be back soon.

37
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:35,772
Just a moment.

38
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:39,972
Senior Bohn.

39
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:43,172
Why did you run away?

40
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:47,297
I don't want Daonua to see my upset face.

41
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:50,472
So...

42
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,397
You really can't tell
that she was interested in you?

43
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,172
No, she wasn't.

44
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,947
She just asked for my help
to take photos of her.

45
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:01,497
Then we had small talk.

46
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:03,099
It wasn't small talk.

47
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:04,872
She came to you.

48
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:05,447
What?

49
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:06,947
I don't care.

50
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:09,847
Don't let others
approach you easily, get it?

51
00:04:11,397 --> 00:04:13,272
Help! A child fell into the water.

52
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:24,947
Help! Help!

53
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:27,622
Daonua! Daonua!

54
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:37,247
Daonua!

55
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:43,547
Daonua!

56
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:48,922
Hurry.

57
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:49,897
Sister Dao.

58
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:55,097
Family members can't enter. Please wait outside.

59
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:56,272
Sister Dao.

60
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:38,722
How's my sister, miss?

61
00:05:38,897 --> 00:05:40,997
Your sister is fine. Don't worry.

62
00:05:42,297 --> 00:05:43,347
Thank you so much.

63
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,072
Daonua is fine.

64
00:05:55,097 --> 00:05:56,147
Your hand is injured?

65
00:05:58,197 --> 00:06:00,897
Maybe I was scratched when I jumped in.

66
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:03,297
Let's clean up your wound.

67
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,022
It's okay. It's not a big deal.

68
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:07,947
No way. The wound may get infected.

69
00:06:08,197 --> 00:06:08,747
Let's go.

70
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:12,172
Let's go now.

71
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:19,422
Does it hurt?

72
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:25,047
Nam, there's something urgent.
Help me out, please.

73
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,997
Excuse me. I'll be back soon.

74
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:28,997
Okay.

75
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:44,072
Actually...

76
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:45,847
it's just a small wound.

77
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:47,472
I can do it for you.

78
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,172
Bohn.

79
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:07,422
Thank you for saving Daonua.

80
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,672
Don't mention it.

81
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:16,797
Actually, I was the one being unreasonable.

82
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:19,697
That's why you left your sister aside,

83
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,297
and this incident happened.

84
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,272
Sorry.

85
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:27,622
I haven't treated someone like that before.

86
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:30,422
I don't know how you feel about me.

87
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:33,322
That's why I'm jealous for no reason.

88
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:38,322
I don't want to be like this anymore.

89
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:41,972
Duen.

90
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,422
Please be my boyfriend.

91
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:52,947
I know,

92
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:56,522
I may not be a good person.

93
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:57,972
But I swear,

94
00:07:58,397 --> 00:07:59,822
I'll surely be your good boyfriend.

95
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:02,847
I'm back.

96
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:06,347
I'll continue cleaning your wound.

97
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:07,397
Excuse me.

98
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:21,247
I followed you secretly.

99
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:23,297
I was afraid that you'd be fooled again.

100
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:25,647
I didn't expect to see Fon.

101
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:30,047
It's okay. Don't think too much.

102
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:32,597
So you and Fon...

103
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,522
It's...

104
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:39,897
After we talked just now,
we wanted to be together.

105
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:41,797
When?

106
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:43,597
After the meal from the crew,

107
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:47,197
she told me she still remembered me.

108
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:49,722
Besides, she has been fond of me
since we were in primary school.

109
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,447
But she appeared to be cool
when we were with the crew.

110
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:55,697
She said she was shy.

111
00:08:56,397 --> 00:08:59,097
Since then we have been talking.

112
00:08:59,197 --> 00:09:00,497
Besides, we're getting along well.

113
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:04,022
I want to talk to her day and night.

114
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:07,297
Because I think she's the one.

115
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,547
I don't want to waste time waiting.

116
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:12,097
Why didn't you tell me?

117
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:14,547
You think I don't want to?

118
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:17,547
I can't tell you because...

119
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:20,947
of this.

120
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:21,897
Hello.

121
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:22,372
Look.

122
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:28,372
I'm Saiphirun Thawornthamrat,
contestant number 0127.

123
00:09:30,772 --> 00:09:32,447
She joined a draft selection audition,

124
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:34,522
which a partner is not allowed.

125
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:36,062
So she doesn't allow me to tell anyone...

126
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:37,397
until the contest is over.

127
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:39,872
If she passes the selection,
will you break up with her?

128
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,272
She said no matter what, she'll still be with me.

129
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,297
But we have to do it secretly.

130
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:46,147
Are you okay with it?

131
00:09:46,822 --> 00:09:49,372
I don't know. But that's in the future.

132
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:53,022
As long as we're happy now.

133
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:54,622
However,

134
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:58,422
don't tell anyone I'm with Fon.

135
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:00,397
Please.

136
00:10:50,947 --> 00:10:51,472
Wow.

137
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:59,097
The photo looks good.
Can I use it as a profile photo?

138
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:01,197
If you don't reply, I'll take it as yes.

139
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:17,147
Who are you chatting with?

140
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:19,397
Who's that in the photo?

141
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:48,322
Hold on.

142
00:11:51,272 --> 00:11:52,397
Regarding what I asked you,

143
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:53,722
what do you think?

144
00:11:59,122 --> 00:11:59,697
No.

145
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:07,847
I don't know.

146
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:09,697
Can you give me some time
to think about it?

147
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:32,172
Get up for your medicine.

148
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:58,697
Sister Dao, regarding
what happened today, I'm sorry.

149
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:00,947
Don't apologize.

150
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:02,372
I'm fine now.

151
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:05,122
I have something for you.

152
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:06,597
What's that?

153
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:17,097
It's cute. Where did you get this?

154
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:20,197
I bought it secretly at the floating market.

155
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:22,385
I wanted to give you a surprise.

156
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,222
But I dropped it in the water.

157
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:27,922
Don't tell me...

158
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,672
you fell into the water...

159
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:34,047
because you were trying to pick it up for me?

160
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,797
Yes. But before I did that...

161
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:39,522
I fell into the water.

162
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:42,272
Fortunately, Brother Bohn saved me.

163
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,072
He also picked it up for me.

164
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:46,697
Or else, I'll be doomed.

165
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,897
When I bought it, I was being very secretive.

166
00:13:55,097 --> 00:13:58,071
I don't know when Brother Bohn saw it.

167
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:04,940
Duen.

168
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:08,537
Please be my boyfriend.

169
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:29,993
I can also make you open your heart
to me if I can make you open the box.

170
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:44,910
Brother Duen, you're early.

171
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,632
Hello, Brother First.

172
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:46,263
Hello.

173
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:48,639
What do you need? There are roses
of different colors today.

174
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:54,624
This one.

175
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:58,715
Red rose. It means stable love.

176
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:01,391
You don't like it?

177
00:16:01,632 --> 00:16:02,925
What about this?

178
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:04,248
This one.

179
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:06,985
Orange rose. It means friendship.

180
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:10,113
Do you want white roses?

181
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:12,459
It means pure love.

182
00:16:18,474 --> 00:16:21,241
I don't want roses today.

183
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:24,850
Here.

184
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,045
Thank you.
Please be faster, Brother First.

185
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:27,767
Okay.

186
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:30,324
Here.

187
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:31,677
Thank you.

188
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,226
Check if you're ready. Let's go.

189
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:49,451
It's like it no matter how I look at it.

190
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:51,075
Look.

191
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:52,309
Ah.

192
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:55,436
What are you thinking about?

193
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,113
Look at this.

194
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,286
I'm sure they're dating secretly.

195
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:08,820
Perhaps not.

196
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:11,075
Maybe he was just taking a ride with him.

197
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:14,474
Who are you talking about?
We're talking about King.

198
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:16,639
Look at his new profile picture.

199
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:18,895
Oh, right.

200
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:21,391
Look. How delighted he is.

201
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:21,993
That's right.

202
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:23,797
That must be his boyfriend's arm.

203
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:25,872
The tattoo on the arm looks familiar.

204
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,587
I've seen it somewhere.

205
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:28,369
Look at it.

206
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,594
Damn!

207
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:37,361
Even God King has a husband now?

208
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:39,106
You didn't even tell your sister.

209
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:40,790
This one.

210
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,512
Who's that?

211
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:42,895
He's not my boyfriend.

212
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:47,136
It's okay if you don't tell me.

213
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,632
I'll just gossip about others.

214
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,910
I heard you confessed
to the medical junior yesterday.

215
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,113
So what did he say?

216
00:17:58,263 --> 00:18:01,632
Why didn't the medical junior
send you flower today?

217
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:06,233
He'll be here soon. He went to buy flowers.

218
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:08,549
Let's go.

219
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:14,023
But he's normally here around this time.

220
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:15,316
Is he hiding from you?

221
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,280
I have no time to send you flowers today.

222
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:30,745
Like I said, the junior is surely hiding from you.

223
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:34,113
If he's hiding from me, why would he text me?

224
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:39,406
He must be busy. Maybe he has an early class.

225
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,835
Oh, right, Bohn.

226
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:46,610
This morning, I...

227
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:48,757
I...

228
00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:49,752
You what?

229
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:53,121
I didn't go to the toilet. I need to defecate now.

230
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:57,181
What's wrong with him?

231
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,745
Why are you following me?

232
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:53,752
What following, Senior?

233
00:19:54,263 --> 00:19:56,248
We're in the same way.

234
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:58,715
You'd better answer me, or I'll escort you to school.

235
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:03,918
Rund.

236
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,872
Mother said you left something at home.

237
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:18,985
So I came to send it to you.

238
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:21,121
I didn't tell mother that.

239
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,707
Really? I must have remembered it wrongly.

240
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:24,970
Why are you disturbing Senior?

241
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:27,376
It's...

242
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,587
He was just asking for direction.
It was nothing.

243
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:32,880
Right?

244
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:34,594
That's true.

245
00:20:34,594 --> 00:20:35,587
And you, Cool Boy.

246
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:37,963
Your brother came to see you,
yet you didn't receive him well.

247
00:20:38,775 --> 00:20:39,978
Buy him a bottle of water.

248
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,083
What are you looking at? Go.

249
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:49,060
Why were you helping me, Senior?

250
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:51,406
You saw my photo on Ram's phone, right?

251
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:54,113
You're curious about who I am.

252
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,489
So you followed me
for you're worried about your brother, Ram.

253
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,023
How do you know that?

254
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:01,602
Don't worry.

255
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:04,880
I just think Ram is a cool and weird person.

256
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:06,513
So I am fooling around with him.

257
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,429
There's nothing.

258
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:09,872
My brother is a boxer.

259
00:21:10,594 --> 00:21:12,218
Beware not to be boxed.

260
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:18,173
No matter what, nice to meet you, Rund.

261
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:19,948
I have to go to class now. Bye.

262
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,587
What's wrong, brother?

263
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:39,045
Go for class after drinking.

264
00:21:39,045 --> 00:21:39,857
I get it.

265
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:45,121
Quick. Be hurry.

266
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:46,715
Speed.

267
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:50,384
Why do you take me to the computer room?

268
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:53,091
The result of the draft selection
that Fon joined is out today.

269
00:21:53,842 --> 00:21:56,038
The judges will consider the popularity
according to the online poll.

270
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,842
Fon doesn't have enough points.

271
00:21:57,872 --> 00:21:59,918
Then why don't you vote for her
with your computer?

272
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,865
Because each computer can only vote once.

273
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,880
So you want to vote
with the college's computers?

274
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:10,633
No. I want to vote with the computers
of the entire college.

275
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,279
That's why I'm asking for your help.

276
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,294
All the computers of the entire college?
Are you insane?

277
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:17,211
I'm willing to be crazy
if Fon can pass the selection.

278
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:19,286
I don't get it.

279
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:21,181
If Fon passes the selection,

280
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:23,136
wouldn't it be harder for you to be with her?

281
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:25,181
That's true.

282
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:30,023
But to be a superstar
has always been her dream.

283
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:33,722
I don't know. It may sound unbelievable,

284
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:35,918
but when you truly love someone,

285
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:37,512
you only want to help her.

286
00:22:38,263 --> 00:22:40,279
Despite it's something
that you're unwilling to do.

287
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,158
I know your feelings.

288
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:45,572
I'll help you.

289
00:22:46,474 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm grateful.

290
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:53,391
Okay. Our target is every computer
of the entire college.

291
00:22:53,451 --> 00:22:55,106
The judges only choose the first 20.

292
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:58,594
Fon is lacking 1,000 points to be the 20th.

293
00:23:36,188 --> 00:23:37,993
It's going to end soon.

294
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:40,549
Our hard work has paid off.

295
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,895
Don't be relaxed. Close up the distance first.

296
00:23:43,737 --> 00:23:47,406
What's going on?

297
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:50,294
Hey, Mek. Did you lose connection as well?

298
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:51,075
Me too.

299
00:23:51,373 --> 00:23:53,933
Why is there no internet connection now?

300
00:23:58,624 --> 00:24:00,339
Sir, slow down.

301
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,872
I want ice cream.

302
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,045
Sir.

303
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:06,023
Sir.

304
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:06,685
As usual.

305
00:24:07,075 --> 00:24:07,617
As usual?

306
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:12,910
Cool Boy.

307
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:14,895
Okay.

308
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:16,820
What do you want, kid?

309
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,955
A cheese chocolate Popsicle.

310
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,872
Were you laughing at me?

311
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:25,752
There's no Popsicle.

312
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:27,136
This cart sells only cup-sized ice cream.

313
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:28,609
Open your eyes and look.

314
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:32,068
You're a university student.

315
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:34,083
Okay, I don't want it anymore, sir.

316
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:35,617
-Cool Boy.
-What's going on?

317
00:24:38,113 --> 00:24:39,587
Cool Boy.

318
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,948
Your dog food is there. Cool Boy, save me.

319
00:24:48,248 --> 00:24:48,700
Cool Boy.

320
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,865
If you save me, I'll help you with all your homework.

321
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,181
With complimentary past-year questions.

322
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:54,715
And all my secrets for every subject in year one.

323
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:55,587
Cool Boy.

324
00:24:55,707 --> 00:24:57,572
Damn!

325
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:05,181
My heart almost hopped out.

326
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:07,888
-Thank you for saving...
-Information.

327
00:25:10,294 --> 00:25:11,737
You're really impatient.

328
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,955
It's in my dorm. I'll give them to you tomorrow.

329
00:25:18,414 --> 00:25:19,527
Are you in a hurry?

330
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,053
The exam is soon, right?

331
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:24,339
I'll get them for you.

332
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:25,271
Just wait for me here.

333
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,737
What's going on?

334
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,391
Your bicycle?

335
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:42,444
Let me ride, and you'll sit at the
back to collect the stuff from my dorm.

336
00:25:48,188 --> 00:25:49,512
It's great to go back this way.

337
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,196
The air is fresh.

338
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,602
Hey, sisters.

339
00:25:58,805 --> 00:26:01,331
Isn't that the handsome couple
in the bus yesterday?

340
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:02,865
Oh, right.

341
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:03,767
I see.

342
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:06,534
That's the mixed-blood senior
with the big private part.

343
00:26:06,835 --> 00:26:08,720
What are we waiting for? Let's follow.

344
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,752
Hurry.

345
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:44,068
♪ Having you is like having the whole world ♪

346
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:46,308
♪ Your love filled my heart ♪

347
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:49,451
♪ I have been looking for true love
my whole life ♪

348
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:53,842
♪ Now I finally know you're the person
I was waiting for ♪

349
00:26:53,842 --> 00:26:57,451
♪ Don't mind the gossips ♪

350
00:26:57,451 --> 00:27:05,121
♪ Don't mind it because I'll let you know ♪

351
00:27:11,857 --> 00:27:12,820
Hey, Cool Boy.

352
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:14,955
The chain fell off.

353
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,572
Can it be fixed?

354
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:37,512
Cool Boy, those juniors who ridiculed us
in the bus are here.

355
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:44,248
Sisters, they're staring at each other.

356
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:45,211
What are they talking about?

357
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:49,030
They must be saying,
"Dear, buy me flowers, okay?"

358
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,857
Then the mixed-blood senior answered,
"Why? It's a waste of money."

359
00:27:51,857 --> 00:27:54,143
Does it mean you don't love me?

360
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:59,045
No. But those flowers are no match
to my sincerity to you.

361
00:28:02,835 --> 00:28:05,241
We'll support you two forever.

362
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:10,263
If we're really a couple,
they'll be choked of happiness.

363
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:21,602
Help to pedal.

364
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,211
Bye-bye.

365
00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:43,286
Oh, it's you.

366
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:45,692
Excuse me.

367
00:28:47,316 --> 00:28:49,030
I'm here to collect the jasmine I ordered.

368
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:50,985
Sorry, we're closed.

369
00:28:54,564 --> 00:28:55,346
Hello.

370
00:28:58,294 --> 00:28:58,895
Is there a problem?

371
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,752
I have a headache.

372
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:08,549
You don't have a fever.

373
00:29:10,835 --> 00:29:13,361
I have headache
because I knocked my head to the wall.

374
00:29:20,188 --> 00:29:23,497
Then you should get some painkillers
from the pharmacy.

375
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,121
If I need painkillers,

376
00:29:25,482 --> 00:29:27,196
I can get them from the drug store
around the corner.

377
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,000
I don't have to come here.

378
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:32,700
Don't you want to scan it?

379
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,226
To see if my brain is affected.

380
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,985
Since you're still able to argue with the doctor,

381
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:41,151
I think there shouldn't be any problem.

382
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:43,797
Are you a real doctor?

383
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:45,782
I'm a medical student in year five.

384
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:50,053
No wonder. I want a real doctor.

385
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:52,549
So he'll follow the medical ethics
instead of giving me painkillers.

386
00:29:57,211 --> 00:30:00,218
Mr. Korawit, please collect the medicine
at the counter.

387
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:04,369
Hello.

388
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:06,835
Okay. May I know what's your last name?

389
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:07,767
Kankun.

390
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:09,241
Oh, okay.

391
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:12,669
The doctor prescribed painkillers for you.

392
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,587
Take 2 tablets every 4 hours.

393
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:17,963
If you get better, you may stop taking them.

394
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:39,497
The connection isn't getting better.

395
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:41,842
The result will be announced soon.

396
00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:43,647
What should I do?

397
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:50,294
Hey, let's take a bus to the organizer.

398
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:51,286
Are you crazy?

399
00:30:51,707 --> 00:30:53,632
Is there any better way?

400
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,331
Hey, the connection has resumed.

401
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:01,842
Click in and have a look.

402
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:02,835
Hey.

403
00:31:03,617 --> 00:31:05,451
I don't dare to look.

404
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:06,203
Why?

405
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:10,354
If she succeeds, that means
we'll have to date secretly.

406
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:12,669
But if she fails, she'll surely be very sad.

407
00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:15,106
I don't want her to be sad.

408
00:31:15,226 --> 00:31:16,880
If not, we are going to date secretly...

409
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:20,820
How is it?

410
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,835
Check it for me.

411
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:24,760
Then tell me.

412
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,151
She has passed.

413
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,865
Really?

414
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:37,451
She has passed.

415
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:38,985
She has passed.

416
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,166
[Fon]

417
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:50,143
Hello. Congratulations, Fon.

418
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:54,203
Yes. I've waited for the result
in front of the computer for long.

419
00:31:54,594 --> 00:31:56,188
This must be celebrated well.

420
00:31:56,309 --> 00:31:58,594
How about your favorite blended ice?

421
00:31:58,865 --> 00:31:59,737
Okay?

422
00:32:02,745 --> 00:32:03,647
Really?

423
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,203
It's okay.

424
00:32:06,865 --> 00:32:07,707
I understand.

425
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:10,504
Go ahead then.

426
00:32:11,226 --> 00:32:12,128
Congratulations.

427
00:32:18,143 --> 00:32:18,865
What happened?

428
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:22,414
The company wants those
who passed to attend a meeting.

429
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:26,233
What's the big matter?
Just celebrate it later.

430
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:28,068
Where are you going then?

431
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:31,106
This is going to be troublesome.

432
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,587
Why are you upset? Your girlfriend
is an Internet celebrity.

433
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:36,850
Many people desire that.

434
00:32:38,745 --> 00:32:39,587
That's true.

435
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:42,624
Others need tickets to shake
their hands, but you don't need.

436
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:44,429
You're right.

437
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,316
I have defeated every man in the country.

438
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,512
Let's go. I'll celebrate it with you.

439
00:32:50,624 --> 00:32:51,978
Let's go.

440
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:05,361
[Where are you?]

441
00:33:05,662 --> 00:33:07,406
[I'm eating in Brother Ta's restaurant.]

442
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:08,730
[Do you want to join?]

443
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,436
I think Duen is a little weird.

444
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:17,722
He has disappeared the whole day.

445
00:33:19,918 --> 00:33:21,572
Maybe he has classes.

446
00:33:22,053 --> 00:33:23,797
He replies to me normally.

447
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:26,654
Could he see someone else?

448
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:32,068
What's wrong with you then?

449
00:33:32,188 --> 00:33:33,632
Nothing.

450
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:36,278
What do you know?

451
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:38,865
Tell me.

452
00:33:39,677 --> 00:33:41,271
Tell me everything you know.

453
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:44,910
Okay. I'll tell you.

454
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:48,579
But promise me, you have to be calm.

455
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:49,903
Okay, I promise.

456
00:33:51,737 --> 00:33:52,609
Here's the case.

457
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,466
This morning, I saw your medical junior.

458
00:33:55,978 --> 00:34:00,248
He was riding a motor with the boss of the florist.

459
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,775
I don't know where they are going to.

460
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:06,865
But they were smiling and looked happy.

461
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:10,083
They were even holding hands.

462
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:14,685
Hey, where are you going?

463
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:17,963
Didn't you say you would be calm?

464
00:34:19,136 --> 00:34:19,857
Okay.

465
00:34:22,534 --> 00:34:23,269
Hold on.

466
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:29,030
Oh, Bohn. Why are you here?

467
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:32,008
Why? I'm just here in time, right?

468
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:33,812
What are you talking about?

469
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:36,248
Get here.

470
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:38,294
Where have you been today?

471
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:44,599
I...

472
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,053
You went to have fun with him, right?

473
00:34:47,106 --> 00:34:48,339
It's not like what you thought.

474
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:49,933
You thought I don't know?

475
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:51,587
He went out with him on his motor.

476
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,722
You were even hugging his waist.

477
00:34:55,256 --> 00:34:57,873
Bohn, calm down.

478
00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,587
You want me to calm down?

479
00:34:59,587 --> 00:35:01,752
You're still protecting him at this point.

480
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:04,188
Oh.

481
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:06,955
You didn't reply to me...

482
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,519
-because you're seeing someone else.
-Enough.

483
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:11,737
You always throw tantrums,

484
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:13,752
and never listen to me.

485
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,820
If you like to be unreasonable,

486
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,963
then stop talking to me.

487
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:27,196
This...

488
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:28,760
Junior Duen and I...

489
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:30,835
are not like what you imagined.

490
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,436
Because the flowers he wanted today are sold out,

491
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:36,700
that's why I took him to buy them.

492
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:40,098
What he wanted was rosemary.

493
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:34,203
My room is a little messy.

494
00:36:42,925 --> 00:36:44,279
How was it?

495
00:36:46,715 --> 00:36:49,722
How are you? Did you fight?

496
00:36:50,715 --> 00:36:51,467
I'll water you later.

497
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:54,474
I'm back.

498
00:36:58,985 --> 00:36:59,827
Did you miss me?

499
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,782
Do you like this?

500
00:37:44,549 --> 00:37:45,679
This is a Venus trap.

501
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,188
It eats insects.

502
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,632
Wait right here.

503
00:37:53,752 --> 00:37:54,624
I'll get you the notes.

504
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:27,136
Who are you?

505
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:30,233
King's boyfriend?

506
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:34,264
What say you?

507
00:38:36,218 --> 00:38:37,271
Oh, sister.

508
00:38:39,196 --> 00:38:41,933
Cool boy, this is my sister, Kumfah.

509
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:48,008
Sister, this is my junior in college, Ram.

510
00:38:50,143 --> 00:38:51,136
Here. The notes you want.

511
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:53,692
Have a look. Tell me what you lack.

512
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:57,993
Sister, why are you here?

513
00:38:57,993 --> 00:39:00,399
I'm here to see your little boyfriend.

514
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,527
You've published the photo on Facebook.

515
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:06,474
I came to see him.

516
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:08,850
You know your sister...

517
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,978
You have weird fetish
of watching gay men together.

518
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,391
That's right.

519
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,076
Look at your little boyfriend.

520
00:39:16,098 --> 00:39:19,346
Mixed-blood, handsome and tattooed,

521
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:22,654
matching your handsome face.

522
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:26,173
I really love this pair.

523
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:27,497
That's enough, sister.

524
00:39:27,858 --> 00:39:28,790
He's not my boyfriend.

525
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:35,106
Don't lie to me. You two were
so close in the photo.

526
00:39:35,647 --> 00:39:37,241
You even brought him to your room.

527
00:39:37,873 --> 00:39:39,617
Besides, you didn't open the door for so long.

528
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:43,346
If you don't admit it, I'll ask him.

529
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:44,429
No need.

530
00:39:46,354 --> 00:39:47,827
He'll not answer even if you ask him.

531
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:50,294
This fellow is weird.

532
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,091
Why?

533
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:54,835
How should I say this?

534
00:39:56,369 --> 00:40:00,549
Ram's voice is sharper than a girl's voice.

535
00:40:01,722 --> 00:40:03,527
His ex-girlfriend broke up with him
because of that.

536
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:08,558
That's why he doesn't dare to talk to others.

537
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,421
No wonder he didn't answer my questions.

538
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:15,918
What a pity.

539
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:22,745
Hold on.

540
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,835
Hello. Okay.

541
00:40:27,316 --> 00:40:28,128
I get it.

542
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:29,542
That's all for now.

543
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:35,166
My husband is looking for me. I have to go.

544
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:41,391
Cool Boy. If you're done,
do you want to leave with my sister?

545
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:42,324
You two are going the same way.

546
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:45,091
It's late now.
It's dangerous to go by bicycle.

547
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:46,715
Hitch a ride with my sister.

548
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:48,068
Trust me.

549
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,203
Just accept it.

550
00:40:50,203 --> 00:40:52,730
You're my brother's friend.

551
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,436
I'll surely take care of you.

552
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,173
Let's go. Hurry.

553
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:00,549
We'll leave now.

554
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:02,775
Thank you, sister.

555
00:41:03,256 --> 00:41:04,549
Okay, let's go.

556
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:27,011
[Rotter Bohn]

557
00:42:47,256 --> 00:42:47,948
Bohn.

558
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,384
You're finally talking to me now.

559
00:42:51,557 --> 00:42:53,391
Duen, sorry.

560
00:42:55,045 --> 00:42:56,730
I know I'm short-tempered.

561
00:43:00,098 --> 00:43:03,226
But I promise, I'll not do it again.

562
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:05,842
Forgive me, okay?

563
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:11,978
If you don't forgive me,

564
00:43:13,572 --> 00:43:14,865
I'll keep kneeling here.

565
00:43:15,346 --> 00:43:16,489
I'll not leave.

566
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:33,542
Get up.

567
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:39,527
You've forgiven me, right?

568
00:43:42,294 --> 00:43:42,985
I don't know.

569
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,737
You'll not be so cruel to me.

570
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,158
Or else, why did you buy me rosemary?

571
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,572
Right?

572
00:43:56,158 --> 00:43:59,106
Do you know what this flower means?

573
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:06,534
It means Junior Duen loves Senior Bohn
from the bottom of his heart.

574
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:08,399
That's not,

575
00:44:10,324 --> 00:44:11,226
I'm just kidding.

576
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:16,339
It means, I'll make your life more colorful.

577
00:44:23,677 --> 00:44:25,782
Oh, is that the meaning?

578
00:44:27,136 --> 00:44:28,218
I didn't know that.

579
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:31,346
I know you knew it.

580
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:35,226
Besides, you give me rosemary
after I confessed to you.

581
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:40,519
Is that your answer?

582
00:44:49,963 --> 00:44:50,925
Why are you asking?

583
00:44:55,136 --> 00:44:56,218
Wasn't it obvious?

584
00:45:01,211 --> 00:45:03,557
But I want to hear it from you.

585
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:05,151
I'm not going to say it.

586
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:08,158
Please. I want to hear it from you.

587
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:10,294
Tell me.

588
00:45:23,918 --> 00:45:26,354
I'll only say it once.

589
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,933
The two of us are together.

590
00:45:38,474 --> 00:45:39,948
What? What did you say?

591
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:41,572
Can you repeat it?

592
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:44,188
I didn't hear it clearly.

593
00:45:45,482 --> 00:45:46,233
Repeat it, please.

594
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,173
Duen.

595
00:46:11,045 --> 00:46:12,128
I'm going to shower.

596
00:46:26,173 --> 00:46:28,248
[Special scene]

597
00:46:28,248 --> 00:46:30,053
I'll do a general examination.

598
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:33,151
Don't move.

599
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:37,722
Take a deep breath.

600
00:46:43,587 --> 00:46:44,910
Your heartbeat is fast.

601
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,963
Are you nervous?

602
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:48,429
Hmm, no.

603
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:52,248
I ran here just now.

604
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:56,850
Go get a real doctor.

605
00:46:59,436 --> 00:47:00,068
Okay.
