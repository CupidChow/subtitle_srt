[My Engineer]
[Episode 11]

2
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,345
The middle part was a little out of tune.

3
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:00,100
But it's okay.

4
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:02,166
Get ready for the contest this afternoon.

5
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:03,241
Hold on.

6
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:05,691
There's another matter.

7
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:06,266
What?

8
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,041
Here you go.

9
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:18,366
This is the one.

10
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:19,941
Everyone says this God of Earth

11
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,221
can make your dreams come true,

12
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,766
especially love matter.

13
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:32,166
God, please help me pass the contest.

14
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:33,666
If I pass it,

15
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:37,441
Mek and I will run around
the school park naked to repay you.

16
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,766
Sadhu.

17
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,991
Hey, why am I involved?

18
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,477
I don't dare to run around naked alone.

19
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:44,117
I'm shy.

20
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:46,291
Do you think I'm not shy?

21
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:49,666
Okay. That can do.

22
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,941
God, my friend is shy.

23
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,066
I'll change the way of praying.

24
00:02:56,291 --> 00:03:00,816
My friend and I will run around
the school park in school uniform.

25
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:02,366
Sadhu.

26
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:04,266
Does that count?

27
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:05,441
Of course.

28
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:08,416
You know that nowadays

29
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,656
it's harder for someone to run

30
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:12,832
in school uniform than naked.

31
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:36,916
Hey.

32
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:37,916
What?

33
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:39,441
I almost forgot.

34
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:44,541
Everyone says this God of Earth
likes to watch believers dance.

35
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,716
Those who perform for him when praying,

36
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:52,616
their wishes will come true faster.

37
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,516
So what? What do you want to do?

38
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,091
I want to perform for him.

39
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:03,541
How?

40
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:06,366
You know how to dance?

41
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:09,691
I have learnt a little bit
of ballroom dance before.

42
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,716
I can somehow dance.

43
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,316
But ballroom dance
has to be done in pair, right?

44
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:18,391
Hence you, my hubby,

45
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,016
have to dance with your wife.

46
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:21,666
Please.

47
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:22,466
No way.

48
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,541
Help me, please.

49
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:29,441
Your wish will come true.

50
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:32,616
Why should I do this thing?

51
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:37,241
Here, over here.

52
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:39,541

Mother, what's going on?

73
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:28,716
Does it hurt?

74
00:06:29,116 --> 00:06:30,666
Have you eaten?

75
00:06:32,616 --> 00:06:33,491
Sit down, sweetie.

76
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:35,741
I'll answer your questions one by one.

77
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,091
I'm fine right now.

78
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,091
So, don't worry.

79
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,491
I'll recover soon.

80
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:52,191
Then...

81
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,216
What book are you reading?
There are so many of them.

82
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,316
Oh.

83
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,416
A medical student gave it to me.

84
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:02,916
He told me a lot about medical knowledge.

85
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,766
He also told me that...

86
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:08,541
his father also had cancer.

87
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:11,241
But it was diagnosed too late.

88
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,591
The treatment wasn't in time.

89
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,741
So he asked me to learn these.

90
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:20,766
By the way,

91
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,216
He even brought me flowers yesterday.

92
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:26,816
He said I would be cheered up when I saw them,

93
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:28,016
so I can recover faster.

94
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,191
Let me help you.

95
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:50,366
Thank you.

96
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:03,616
Is there anything?

97
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:05,366
Nothing.

98
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:08,691
That day,

99
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:10,466
when I said something bad to you,

100
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:13,091
I'm so sorry.

101
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:18,366
It's okay.

102
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,541
Everyone would be worried,
when facing such a matter.

103
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:26,416
Such a matter makes me feel horrible,

104
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:28,641
because I feel helpless.

105
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:30,766
I could only wait for the examination report.

106
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:33,966
I don't know what will happen to my mother.

107
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:37,816
Actually, there's much you can do.

108
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,766
You have a cute smile.

109
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:44,016
If your mother can see your smile every day,

110
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,066
I think she'll be more confident.

111
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,741
Thank you, doctor.

112
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,641
I'm only a medical student.

113
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,616
Just call me Senior Thara.

114
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:59,541
But you'll be a doctor in the future.

115
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,991
Then I shall call you Brother Doctor.

116
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,016
Up to you.

117
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:09,416
Okay.

118
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:31,691
Sore throat?

119
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:34,191
What kind of flower you brought for me today?

120
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,491
I passed by the wet market today.

121
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:38,916
So I brought you this flower.

122
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,591
Cauliflower?

123
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,641
Do you want me to cook it?

124
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:49,991
I was in a hurry.
This is the only thing I could get.

125
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:51,066
Do you want it or not?

126
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:55,291
Alright.

127
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:00,916
But since you brought cauliflower,

128
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,741
why don't you sleep in my apartment tonight,

129
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:06,866
and cook this for me?

130
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:15,316
Let go of me.

131
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:34,066
Are you ready?

132
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,741
No.

133
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:52,991
Hold on.

134
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:54,341
I'm not ready.

135
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:07,941
No, Bohn.

136
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:09,491
What are you doing to me?

137
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:11,266
I'm not ready.

138
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:17,691
What are you afraid of?

139
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,366
I just want you to cook for me.

140
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:23,741
Oh.

141
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,416
I thought you want me
to do something else.

142
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:28,691
Okay, I'll cook for you immediately.

143
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,866
Give me an onion.

144
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:50,491
Get lost.

145
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,791
You're always using the same trick.

146
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:54,466
Stupid.

147
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:00,716
I'm going to cut this cauliflower now.

148
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:03,016
Do you want to take a photo of it?

149
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,041
Hurry, cut it.

150
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:06,366
Who would want to take
a photo of such a flower?

151
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,541
-Hello.
-Hello.

152
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:28,716
-I should sign here, right?
-Yes.

153
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:31,041
This is my registration form.

154
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:31,766
Okay.

155
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:42,466
Please have a sit.

156
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:43,059
Okay, sir.

157
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,416
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

158
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:13,216
Oh.

159
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:27,291
Are you Thannanee?

160
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:28,341
Yes.

161
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,616
This way, please.

162
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:35,541
It's going to start.

163
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:57,091
Hello.

164
00:13:57,391 --> 00:13:57,941
Hello.

165
00:13:57,941 --> 00:13:59,691
Please let me tune my guitar first.

166
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,291
Hold on a second.

167
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:10,548
Young boy.

168
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:11,866
This is a new song, Miss.

169
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:13,241
It hasn't been released.

170
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:14,866
This is its first appearance.

171
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,666
I'm the manager of Fon.

172
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:21,716
You're Fon's friend, right?

173
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:23,016
Yes.

174
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:24,641
You're joining today's contest,

175
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,266
so you can get close to Fon
if you're chosen, right?

176
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,516
I admire you for contributing so much.

177
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:36,666
But Fon is working hard to become a celebrity.

178
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:38,891
And this is inappropriate.

179
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:43,441
Your goodwill would destroy all her hard work.

180
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:47,666
If you really love her, you should know

181
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:50,366
what you should do.

182
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:06,466
Hello, I'm Fon, TRI28.

183
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:10,766
How did you feel when you join
the big family of TRI28?

184
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:15,816
I was very excited and happy
at the same time.

185
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:19,816
Because winning this contest is my dream
since I was a child.

186
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:25,341
I want to become a celebrity
to make good productions for everyone.

187
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,916
You're a beautiful girl, do have
someone who understands you?

188
00:15:29,341 --> 00:15:31,941
Someone who understands me? No.

189
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:35,841
Because I want to give my best
to sprint on this path.

190
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:38,866
I hope that everyone will support me.

191
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:53,841
Hi, mom.

192
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:55,741
Hi, you're back already.

193
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:56,791
Where's dad?

194
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,116
Your dad is out of town for a meeting.

195
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,316
He should be back sometime tonight.

196
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:10,166
And did he say where he's going
and who he's going with?

197
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:12,766
I don't know. He didn't tell me.

198
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:22,441
Why are you asking about him so much today?

199
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,716
It's nothing.

200
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:29,951
Rud, can you help me bring in
the clothes?

201
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:30,966
Sure, mom.

202
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:51,716
Are you still troubled?

203
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:54,291
If not, click in to see the photos
I uploaded yesterday.

204
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,091
Or are you even more troubled now?

205
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,915
[Pin: Let's go on hand-in-hand.]

206
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:22,491
Everyone has a good and a bad side.

207
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,491
But I'm sure he has his reason
when he does such a thing.

208
00:18:57,691 --> 00:19:00,541
Do not cross this pillow tonight, understand?

209
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,441
What does this mean?

210
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,416
I agreed to sleep with you,
but I didn't agree on everything.

211
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,316
Please understand correctly.

212
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,041
Duen.

213
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:35,916
Ram.

214
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,791
Where are you going?

215
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:41,541
What's going on?

216
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:50,891
I know about you and Pin.

217
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:58,866
Aren't you going to explain?

218
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:02,491
Just say something.

219
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:04,391
So I'll know that I misunderstood.

220
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:11,341
I'll leave now.

221
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:15,841
I can't stand looking at you.

222
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:19,616
Ram, hold on.

223
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:24,891
Don't tell anyone about it, okay?

224
00:20:32,116 --> 00:20:32,941
Don't worry.

225
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:38,516
I promise, I won't tell anyone.

226
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:44,941
Because I don't want them to suffer as I do.

227
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:28,266
Hubby, your wife is back.

228
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,316
Your wife is back.

229
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:38,716
Why did you get so drunk for a contest?

230
00:21:39,116 --> 00:21:42,116
The people there were so formidable.
How could I pass?

231
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:46,191
Let's drink beer to celebrate that I lost.

232
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:53,316
You're not getting drunk just because you lost.

233
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:55,066
What happened? Tell me.

234
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:01,441
Let's go back. Or else your wife will scold.

235
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:02,516
Whose wife?

236
00:22:02,516 --> 00:22:03,141
Your wife.

237
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:04,741
Oh? I have a wife?

238
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:05,666
I borrowed it.

239
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,416
Let's go, brother.

240
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:11,116
Walk straight.

241
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:25,766
Cool Boy.

242
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:28,216
Why are you standing here?

243
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:31,041
It's going to rain soon.

244
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,541
Tell me. What happened?

245
00:22:41,816 --> 00:22:43,566
I've told you there's nothing.

246
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:45,841
If you're not telling me, then go back.

247
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,341
Okay. You'll chase me away
no matter what I say.

248
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,416
I have no value anymore, right?

249
00:22:51,816 --> 00:22:53,416
That's why everyone is chasing me away.

250
00:22:53,516 --> 00:22:54,491
Who chased you away?

251
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,041
Fon's manager.

252
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:01,166
She found out that Fon and I have a relationship.

253
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,191
She told me not to bother Fon.

254
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,091
What did you say then?

255
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,291
Do I have a choice?

256
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:13,616
What she said is the truth.

257

Fon has a bright future.

258
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:21,466
She shouldn't be with useless trash like me.

259
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,716

Hey.

378
00:34:21,616 --> 00:34:22,616
Why are you staring at me?

379
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:24,741
Is there something on my face?

380
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:29,566
I want to be the first person you see.

381
00:34:29,941 --> 00:34:32,191
You're flirting with me, as soon as you get up.

382
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:38,516
Regarding what I asked you yesterday,
have you decided it?

383
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:47,316
You're sure that you want to choose me?

384
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:48,591
Of course.

385
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:50,391
What's going on?

386
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,966
Give me one year.

387
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:57,666
If you're not headstrong and
don't break up with me by then,

388
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:00,246
I'll live with you.

389
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:02,991
Oh? Another year?

390
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:04,291
That's too long.

391
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,091
I won't break up with you.

392
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:08,016
Can't you move in now?

393
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:10,466
I promise I won't break up with you.

394
00:35:10,516 --> 00:35:11,491
Okay?

395
00:35:12,216 --> 00:35:13,016
Okay?

396
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:13,866
What?

397
00:35:13,866 --> 00:35:14,316
Okay?

398
00:35:14,316 --> 00:35:15,641
Who let you cross the border?

399
00:35:16,441 --> 00:35:17,516
-Okay?
-Get there.

400
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:35,616
Ah, go away.

401
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:39,516
What's going on?

402
00:35:42,066 --> 00:35:42,791
Go away.

403
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:43,841
Don't get near. What do you want?

404
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:46,841
Go away.

405
00:35:46,841 --> 00:35:47,391
Stop.

406
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:16,966
Sorry. I'll take the dogs to Duen's house later.

407
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:19,466
It's okay. Let them stay.

408
00:36:19,966 --> 00:36:21,041
So you won't be lonely, right?

409
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:25,166
But you're afraid of dogs.

410
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:27,266
It's okay. Don't think too much.

411
00:36:27,516 --> 00:36:28,541
Keep eating.

412
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:50,041
Is this the Venus plant I gave you?

413
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:56,191
It has grown so much.

414
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,466
I'm surprised that you brought it along.

415
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:06,166
It's very important to me.

416
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:30,366
I didn't expect you to keep this.

417
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:33,087
During orientation, we were called
the Talkative Wife and Quiet Husband.

418
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:35,666
I thought you didn't like it
because I saw you dispose of it.

419
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:40,241
Who said I don't like it?

420
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:43,641
Why did you throw it away then?

421
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,016
This is such an honour.

422
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:51,366
Look. How good it looks.

423
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:53,116
Really.

424
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:56,091
We finally get the gear. Such an honour.

425
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:56,816
Mek.

426
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:57,916
Hi.

427
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:00,841
I'll leave first.

428
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:06,466
Quiet Husband?

429
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:08,416
I was teased by the seniors.

430
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:56,191
After the orientation, I threw the name card away.

431
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:58,766
I thought you didn't want me to use that nickname.

432
00:38:59,691 --> 00:39:02,941
But I didn't expect the whole school
to call me by that nickname.

433
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,866
So I let them be.

434
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:13,016
Now Talkative Wife and Quiet Husband
are no longer just nicknames.

435
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:15,966
Because from today on,

436
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:17,991
you're my wife.

437
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:26,891
Get here.

438
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,316
I'll put it on for you.

439
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:32,766
What are you doing?

440
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:34,266
Why are you acting alone?

441
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,641
Sorry.

442
00:39:58,941 --> 00:39:59,691
Oh, Duen.

443
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:01,716
Oh, Brother First. Hello.

444
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:03,816
Where are you going?

445
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:05,066
I'm rushing to pick my mother up.

446
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:06,741
You may have a look at the flowers.

447
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:07,816
I had my brother look after the shop.

448
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:08,266
I'll leave now.

449
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:08,941
Okay, brother.

450
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,666
Brother, goodbye.

451
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:10,766
Goodbye.

452
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:19,016
Oh, Senior Yim.

453
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:19,916
Oh, Duen.

454
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:24,491
Are you Brother First's
elder or younger brother?

455
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:26,216
I'm the youngest in the family.

456
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:27,191
What?

457
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,366
Do I look old?

458
00:40:28,941 --> 00:40:29,816
No.

459
00:40:31,191 --> 00:40:34,641
Hold on. If Brother Fang
and Brother First are elder than you,

460
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,316
your name supposed to start with F as well.

461
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:39,366
Have a guess.

462
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:40,366
I should guess?

463
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:42,091
I'm good at guessing.

464
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:46,666
Brother Fuel?

465
00:40:47,766 --> 00:40:48,541
No?

466
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,516
Brother Fat?

467
00:40:58,341 --> 00:40:59,141
Brother Fire?

468
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,141
Enough, Duen.

469
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:05,016
I'm called Frong.

470
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:07,216
Wow, such a cool name.

471
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:13,391
I come here often. But only now I know
you're the boss here.

472
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:15,091
The world is small.

473
00:41:15,216 --> 00:41:18,741
Now I know all the flowers
you bought were for Bohn.

474
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,541
If I knew it, I wouldn't sell them to you.

475
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:26,541
I heard that clearly.

476
00:41:27,991 --> 00:41:28,766
I was just joking.

477
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:32,441
Choose whatever flower you like.
I'll give you a discount.

478
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:33,941
Thank you.

479
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:39,091
Bohn, which flower do you like? I'll buy it for you.

480
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:41,466
Choose for me.

481
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:43,916
As usual.

482
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:45,841
Okay.

483
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:49,366
What about rose?

484
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:55,216
Senior Yim, no, Senior Frong.

485
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:57,128
I want this rose.

486
00:41:57,366 --> 00:41:59,166
You can also call me Senior Yim.

487
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:08,766
Oh, right.

488
00:42:10,216 --> 00:42:11,066
What's going on?

489
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:16,016
I promised to buy you ice cream.

490
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:19,241
Coincidentally, I'm taking Bohn
and my cousin to eat ice cream.

491
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:23,366
Four of us should go.

492
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:24,991
Okay.

493
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:27,916
If no one is against it.

494
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:32,566
No one is against it.

495
00:42:33,116 --> 00:42:35,241
Then I'll call you to confirm.

496
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:12,591
You're inviting more and more people.

497
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:14,566
Are you building an imperial harem?

498
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:17,341
What are you complaining about?

499
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:19,116
Last time, you...

500
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:23,591
The love bite that you left on my neck,

501
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:25,216
I didn't even whine about it.

502
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:28,041
But the love bite looks good.

503
00:43:28,091 --> 00:43:29,166
Nonsense.

504
00:43:29,591 --> 00:43:31,666
Look. How red it is.

505
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:33,116
You didn't kiss anyone before,

506
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:35,141
so you have no right
to comment on others' kissing skill.

507
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:44,441
How would you know that I didn't...

508
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,091
Who did you kiss?

509
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:52,416
Oh, that rotter Yim, right?

510
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:55,841
I'm not telling you.

511
00:43:56,866 --> 00:43:59,991
Just assume that I've kissed someone
before being with you.

512
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:06,916
Who is he? I'm going to kill him.

513
00:44:07,691 --> 00:44:08,916
Calm down.

514
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:11,491
Okay, I can tell you.

515
00:44:11,491 --> 00:44:13,191
But there's a condition.

516
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:17,241
On the day when we go for ice cream,
you're not allowed to flirt at me.

517
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:21,951
If you can do it, I'll tell you who he is.

518
00:44:23,066 --> 00:44:24,466
Okay.

519
00:44:25,616 --> 00:44:27,691
There's always something with you.

520
00:44:31,191 --> 00:44:33,216
How are you going to settle it with Fon?

521
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:37,116
I'm going to break up
with her face-to-face.

522
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:39,191
I don't want to say it on the phone.

523
00:44:40,316 --> 00:44:42,941
But I suppose she doesn't have time to see me.

524
00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:58,116
Thank you for helping me with Fon.

525
00:44:59,516 --> 00:45:00,216
I'll go now.

526
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:05,066
Can you not go?

527
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,816
I can't.

528
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:30,041
Hubby, your wife is back.

529
00:45:30,866 --> 00:45:32,516
Hey, Boss.

530
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:34,966
Are you teasing me?

531
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:36,916
I'll punish you then.

532
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:38,666
Hey, what are you doing to me?

533
00:45:41,816 --> 00:45:42,516
Mek.

534
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:46,441
I'm going to kill you.

535
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:14,116
Thank you

536
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:18,766
for giving them a room.

537
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:21,716
Oh, that room is not in used anyhow.

538
00:46:23,091 --> 00:46:24,791
So they can stay in there, right?

539
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:27,891
That's good.

540
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:40,866
-Uncle King.
-Uncle King.

541
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:43,066
Kew, Kram. It's been a long time.

542
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:44,591
How are you?

543
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,666
Wow, Brother Ram.

544
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:51,866
King, you are...

545
00:46:51,866 --> 00:46:52,441
We're being intimate.

546
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:53,241
Don't you like that?

547
00:46:54,891 --> 00:46:58,566
It has cheered the heart of a girl with fetish.

548
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:04,266
Why are you here early in the morning?

549
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:07,016
I have something urgent to do
and my husband is busy too.

550
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:09,691
Please take care of Kew and Kram for a while.

551
00:47:09,966 --> 00:47:10,866
I'll pick them up in the evening.

552
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:11,666
No problem.

553
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:13,591
I'll go now then.

554
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,691
Be good, Kew and Kram.

555
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:16,866
-No problem.
-No problem.

556
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,366
Okay.

557
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:22,641
Brother Ram, I'll go now.

558
00:47:24,866 --> 00:47:25,991
Mother is leaving, kids.

559
00:47:29,566 --> 00:47:30,166
Come in.

560
00:47:34,016 --> 00:47:36,266
Wow, tattoo.

561
00:47:37,116 --> 00:47:38,966
Cool.

562
00:47:39,391 --> 00:47:48,141
-Let us see it.
-Let us see it.

563
00:47:48,141 --> 00:47:50,341
Children, there's chocolate.

564
00:47:50,341 --> 00:47:51,766
It's in the usual place. Go get it.

565
00:47:51,766 --> 00:47:52,591
Over there.

566
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:54,391
-Yay!
-Yay!

567
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:04,941
Are you afraid of children?

568
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,343
Oh, my!

569
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:13,466
Ram, who isn't afraid of anything,
is afraid of children.

570
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:19,191
Because I don't get along with children.

571
00:48:20,341 --> 00:48:21,691
They're completely different from the dogs.

572
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:23,066
Oh.

573
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:26,316
Wow, dogs.
