[My Engineer]
[Episode 13]

2
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:54,475
Attention, everyone.

3
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:56,455
This is where we take rest.

4
00:01:57,405 --> 00:02:01,030
All of you may rest here later.

5
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:03,205
You can either go sightseeing

6
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,055
or play at the waterfall.

7
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:09,305
As for the tents, there's a service counter,

8
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,530
you may collect them there.

9
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:21,780
I'm fine. I just slipped.

10
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:27,980
My body is sticky. I'll go get change.

11
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:30,755
Okay, get back soon.

12
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,355
Okay.

13
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,180
I will miss you.

14
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,905
Hurry up. Students at the back, please catch up.

15
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,455
But if any student feels lonely,

16
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:43,655
you may sit over there to chat with me.

17
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,905
I'm so happy.

18
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:51,080
Hey, brothers.

19
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,330
Our Tamueng Ting group

20
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:53,530
should go play at the waterfall together.

21
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,655
How about that?

22
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,880
No.

23
00:02:57,705 --> 00:02:58,230
Why?

24
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,480
We came all the way here. Shouldn't we have some fun?

25
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,880
I'm saying no to the name, Tamueng Ting.

26
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,080
But I want to go to the waterfall.

27
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:08,180
Oh, you're not democratic at all.

28
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,055
What about this?

29
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,730
Let's listen to the voice of the audience.

30
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:14,305
Who likes the name, Tamueng Ting, raise your hand.

31
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,355
The voice is quite equal.

32
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,630
Can we end this topic now?

33
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,505
Let's go to the waterfall.

34
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Ting Ting, you want to come along?

35
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:24,930
Yes.

36
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,030
So I can see the firm muscles and abs of the men.

37
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,805
So I won't be an inexperienced girl anymore.

38
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:32,680
Dream on.

39
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:34,655
Let's go.

40
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,430
Let's call it Tamueng Ting then.

41
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,155
No.

42
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:40,205
Hey.

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,905
So what?

44
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,455
This name is cool.

45
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,630
Build the tent well, darling.

46
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,655
Let's go to the water.

47
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:51,530
Bohn.

48
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,055
Don't you want to come to the water with us?

49
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:54,855
I'm waiting for Duen to change.

50
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,180
Hurry.

51
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,605
Up to you then.

52
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,405
Let's go first.

53
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,230
Let's go. Hurry.

54
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:00,430
See you later.

55
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:02,780
I'll take Tamueng Ting
to have fun in the water first.

56
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,980
Stop saying that name.

57
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,180
I'm here.

58
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,130
Look. Is it good?

59
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,055
Yes.

60
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:17,480
Oh, Senior Yim.

61
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,755
Hey, your T-shirt is the same as mine.

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,680
Why are your T-shirts...

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,205
Oh, Senior and I bought these T-shirts together.

64
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:32,030
But what a coincidence.
We didn't plan to wear it together.

65
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,030
That's quite cute, Senior.

66
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:35,705
I don't think so.

67
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,855
You want to come
to the water with us, Senior?

68
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:44,105
Go ahead first.

69
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,130
I'm afraid if we go to the waterfall
together, the water will boil.

70
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,455
I'll have a walk around here.

71
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:51,480
The water will boil?

72
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:57,573
Let's go to the water.

73
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,555
What's going on with you?

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,305
We're here.

75
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:10,430
Oh.

76
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:11,655
Hurry up.

77
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,005
Boss, get down.

78
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,305
I'll take off my shoes first.

79
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,555
Be careful.

80
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,030
Hurry up.

81
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,380
-Oh.
-Mek, faster.

82
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,330
Let me see if it's nice here.

83
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:29,605
So cool. Thank you.

84
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,280
Wait for me.

85
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,455
The air is good.

86
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,055
Hold on.

87
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:51,405
Oh, so beautiful.

88
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,330
It's okay.

89
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,405
What's wrong with you?

90
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,205
Nothing.

91
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:03,605
Fellow members, let's have a diving competition.

92
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:06,430
Who dives in last is a dog.

93
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,980
Bring it on.

94
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,630
Come on.

95
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,580
Okay.

96
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,555
But let me hold your hand.

97
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:17,105
Hold on.

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,580
Who said we should dive?

99
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,580
Safety first.

100
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:23,180
What?

101
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:26,155
I'll also be safe.

102
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,505
So cold.

103
00:06:31,605 --> 00:06:33,105
I know who's a dog now.

104
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:34,505
It's Boss.

105
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:36,430
He's screaming like a dog.

106
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:40,105
What's going on?

107
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,455
Bohn, aren't you coming?

108
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:48,180
No. I have no mood.

109
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,730
He's pretending to be emotional.

110
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:58,855
I'll take a walk with King and the rest.

111
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,305
Hey, what is that?

112
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,705
Are you still pretending?

113
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:13,780
I don't think it was fun.

114
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,905
Are you angry?

115
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,430
I was just teasing you a little.

116
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,730
A little?

117
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:25,205
I'm your senior,

118
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:26,030
not your classmate.

119
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,755
You never care about my feelings.

120
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,405
So fierce.

121
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:36,355
Let's go. Let the couple settle it by themselves.

122
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,480
Let's go.

123
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,005
Sorry.

124
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,180
It's my fault.

125
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:49,030
I just wanted to tease you a little.

126
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,855
Don't be angry with me.

127
00:07:59,155 --> 00:07:59,905
Bohn.

128
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,080
Senior Frong.

129
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,405
Want to play in the water together?

130
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,705
Hurry, Senior Frong.

131
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,580
Senior Frong, come and have fun with us.

132
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,305
I shall delete it when I upload the photos.

133
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,280
[Bathroom]

134
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:05,805
Hey.

135
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,530
Are you looking for something?

136
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:10,805
I'm looking for my necklace.

137
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,080
I realized it's missing after I showered.

138
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,830
It should be somewhere here.

139
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,030
Let me help you look for it.

140
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,930
No need. I can find it.

141
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:26,205
It's okay. It's faster if we find it together.

142
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:30,080
Where were you showering just now?

143
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,755
Here.

144
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,930
Ting Ting, hurry. It's beautiful here.

145
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:52,180
Take a photo of me.

146
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,461
Are you taking my photo or yours?

147
00:10:58,705 --> 00:10:59,780
Yours.

148
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:02,155
Oh, my.

149
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,205
Why is my face so flat?

150
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,480
Just like the person called Leenam.

151
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:08,455
Take another better one for me.

152
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:12,255
That's how you look, of course, that's the result.

153
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,755
You should take it with a beauty camera.

154
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:16,180
Besides, Leenam looks very good. You're insane.

155
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,555
Oh, my. Why are you so fierce today?

156
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:22,655
Think about it. A beautiful woman like me,

157
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:24,455
is taking photos for you here,

158
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,255
yet no boy is taking my photo.

159
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,180
Instead, I have to take your photos. This is insane.

160
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,630
Look at yourself. Who would take your photos?

161
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,405
You'll have to take my photos forever.

162
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,205
Let's go.

163
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:36,655
I don't want to.

164
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:38,905
It looks good over there as well.
Hurry take a photo of me.

165
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:40,880
Hurry up.

166
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:43,305
I hate every single one of you.

167
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,880
I get it.

168
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:58,705
You want me to be aware
of the wound on my head, right?

169
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,855
The water isn't even waist-deep.

170
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,330
There's nothing to be worried about.

171
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:33,130
Senior King.

172
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,055
I tried to be careful.

173
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,180
But it's too slippery here.

174
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,530
I'm really fine.

175
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,930
I can keep on playing.

176
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,055
No way.

177
00:12:57,855 --> 00:13:01,430
Hey, you don't allow me to play with water?

178
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:04,605
Can I not?

179
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,355
Even if you keep following me,

180
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,355
I wouldn't cool down, Duen.

181
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:26,430
I'm not Duen.

182
00:13:28,905 --> 00:13:29,705
Mai.

183
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:32,230
Hold on, Bohn.

184
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,230
You really don't plan to talk to me?

185
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,980
I have nothing to talk to you.

186
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:39,155
Hold on.

187
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:42,255
Don't you want to see me?

188
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:44,380
Why?

189
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,880
I'm much better than your boyfriend.

190
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:50,330
He's just a brat. What's so good about him,

191
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,205
that makes you fall so deeply in love?

192
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,530
A silly person like him wouldn't have the brain to...

193
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,330
Stop speaking ill about my boyfriend.

194
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,155
And stop bothering me.

195
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,605
In short, I will never be interested in you.

196
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,955
Bohn.

197
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:09,880
What are you doing?

198
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:12,480
Leave him, then be with me.

199
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,430
Impossible. I will never like someone like you.

200
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,580
I love Duen.

201
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,305
Stop using such dirty tricks on me.

202
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,530
This is my last warning to you,

203
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,005
stop bothering me,

204
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:27,580
or I'll give you a lesson.

205
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:50,555
What?

206
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,780
Did you make it yourself?

207
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:06,655
Thank you.

208
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,755
How is it? Does it look good on me?

209
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,605
Quite good, right?

210
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:20,880
Here, follow me.

211
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,705
Take a good photo of me. Tang, get it?

212
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:23,405
Okay.

213
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:24,305
-Junior Ting.
-Here I am.

214
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,505

215
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,130
I want to know if I look good with this.

216
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,380
It's so cute. Did you make that yourself?

217
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,155
A kind person made it for me.

218
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,905
Ram, go away. I want to take a photo of Senior.

219
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,380
It's okay. Take a photo of both of us.

220
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:47,105
Okay.

221
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:49,180
Smile sweetly.

222
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:52,605
One, two, three.

223
00:15:53,805 --> 00:15:55,655
Okay.

224
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,680
Here you go.

225
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,130
Hey, such a good photo.

226
00:16:02,555 --> 00:16:03,255
Send it to me.

227
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:04,455
No problem. Each for 5 THB.

228
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,155
Tang and I are going to take photos there.

229
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:07,780
Okay.

230
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,130
Alright, call for me if there's anything.

231
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,980
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye, see you later.

232
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,005
I think Ram and King are a good match.

233
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:17,580
They look like a cute couple.

234
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,380
You're speaking really "softly".

235
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:35,580
It's quite fun here.

236
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,230
Feel the fresh air.

237
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:39,180
You can also forget about
your father's matter for now.

238
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:53,230
I made you overthink, didn't I?

239
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,955
Sorry, it wasn't intentional.

240
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,455
Hey.

241
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:30,855
We looked for it in the bathroom just now.

242
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,030
We have looked around here as well.

243
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:36,130
Did you go somewhere else?

244
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:40,955
I was at the campsite and waterfall.

245
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,930
Is that item very important?

246
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,705
Yes. My father gave it to me.

247
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,355
Okay. Let's search for it
in the places you mentioned.

248
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:02,955
Over there.

249
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:22,880
Bohn.

250
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,280
Where did you go just now?

251
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,230
I was just taking a walk around here.

252
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,605
Really? Where?

253
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:45,655
Why couldn't I find you anywhere?

254
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:49,630
I was just around here. Why are you asking so much?

255
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:08,955
Senior, how can I find out
who I am sleeping with?

256
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:10,955
Actually, you can sleep wherever
and with whoever you want.

257
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,080
You may discuss it among yourselves.

258
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,330
But I can still check the name list for you.

259
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,305
Junior, are you one of
the two people registered last?

260
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:23,755
From management college and medical college.

261
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:26,005
Oh, yes. I'm from management college.

262
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,955
If you have no friends along,

263
00:19:29,055 --> 00:19:31,005
you have to sleep with Brother Doctor.

264
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,880
I think he also came alone.

265
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,930
Besides, there's only one tent left.

266
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,455
Okay, no problem.

267
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:50,380
Alright. I'll pass you the stuff then.

268
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,405
I will go there first.

269
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,755
Thank you.

270
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,530
It seems we have to sleep in a tent together.

271
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:02,330
That's good. If I knock on my head again,

272
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:03,980

00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:36,680
What are you thinking about?

372
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,505
I recall that back then,

373
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,755
my parents loved to take
my brothers and me to Khao Yai.

374
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,830
We were camping like this too.

375
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,280
Brother First, Brother Fang and I
would play around the bonfire.

376
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:06,305
Then we would make pork hotpot to eat.

377
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,030
We would snatch the food
until our father scolded us.

378
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:12,780
Talking about it makes me feel funny.

379
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,205
I would like to go there again.

380
00:28:20,455 --> 00:28:23,830
But we will never be complete anymore.

381
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,930
I feel sorry for you.

382
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:29,080
Yes.

383
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,530
I am very sad.

384
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,080
But what I feel saddest about is

385
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,014
that I couldn't say goodbye to my father

386
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:44,955
on the day he left.

387
00:28:46,105 --> 00:28:47,855
The necklace that I lost

388
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:53,355
is like my father to me.

389
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:05,580
I understand you.

390
00:29:08,055 --> 00:29:11,780
I didn't have the chance to
bid farewell to my father properly either.

391
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:15,505
My father had a brain tumor for many years.

392
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,380
But our family thought he was just sick.

393
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:21,330
Sometimes, he spoke clearly, but sometimes not.

394
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,630
Sometimes he remembered things,
sometimes he did not.

395
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,655
But in the end,

396
00:29:32,255 --> 00:29:33,480
my father couldn't be saved in time.

397
00:29:34,705 --> 00:29:35,655
My father

398
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,430
didn't leave me anything.

399
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,980
But whenever I think about him,

400
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,930
he's right here,

401
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,730
right in my heart.

402
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:52,427
I think your father

403
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:54,611
is in here as well.

404
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,280
Bohn.

405
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:16,230
Where were you?

406
00:31:16,805 --> 00:31:18,330
I was just taking a walk around here.

407
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,130
Why couldn't I find you anywhere?

408
00:31:21,205 --> 00:31:24,255
I was just around here. Why are you asking so much?

409
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:13,455
Senior King.

410
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:14,830
Senior King.

411
00:32:56,305 --> 00:32:56,980
Sorry.

412
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,280
Maybe when I was playing with water,

413
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:01,555
my head hit on a rock,

414
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:04,305
hence, my wound is inflamed and I have a fever.

415
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:06,805
Why didn't you tell me?

416
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,530
Sorry.

417
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:14,980
I didn't want to disturb you.

418
00:33:39,355 --> 00:33:40,130

419
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:58,980

Then queue up. We will depart to plant trees later.

444
00:35:56,205 --> 00:36:00,055
Juniors, everyone has
a little sapling in hands, right?

445
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:04,730
I will have you look for empty land later.

446
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:09,092
The first step is of course digging.

447
00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:10,680
Dig a deep one.

448
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,755
After digging, place the little saplings
into the hole.

449
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:19,455
When it's done, tie the base well with a rope.

450
00:36:19,455 --> 00:36:20,630
Tie it well.

451
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,755
Okay, babies. Start working.

452
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:32,255
Yes, that's right.

453
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:33,230
Dig it deep.

454
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,455
Okay, it's just a small matter.

455
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,805
You're the best.

456
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:57,930
Here, let me help you.

457
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,655
Did you argue with Duen?

458
00:37:16,255 --> 00:37:18,030
No.

459
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:22,830
But he obviously saw you just now.

460
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,180
Perhaps he thinks that I'm still mad with him,

461
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:33,180
hence he ignores me.

462
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:43,230
Oh, that's right.

463
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,130
Deeper.

464
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:46,880
Dig it. Dig it deep.

465
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:47,655
Deeper.

466
00:37:48,255 --> 00:37:49,005
Dig it.

467
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,130
Deeper. Dig into my heart.

468
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:54,805
Are you planting trees

469
00:37:55,155 --> 00:37:56,830
or are you doing something else?

470
00:37:57,605 --> 00:38:00,455
Sorry. Because I see how hard you work,

471
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,705
my thought went side way.

472
00:38:01,805 --> 00:38:03,580
Alright. Put the sapling in.

473
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:20,880
Hey.

474
00:38:22,055 --> 00:38:22,905
What's going on?

475
00:38:23,855 --> 00:38:25,880
I want to get my phone, but my hands are dirty.

476
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,743
[Fon]

477
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,180
Who called?

478
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,405
Oh, I don't know. It's probably just a wrong call.

479
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,955
You rubbed your hands on my trousers.
Did it worth it?

480
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,255
Sorry, hubby.

481
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,905
I did it because I love you.

482
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:51,455
Sorry.

483
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:57,205
I didn't want to disturb
the two of you being sweet,

484
00:38:57,705 --> 00:38:58,380
but Boss,

485
00:38:59,155 --> 00:39:01,055
where are the ropes I asked you to prepare?

486
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:03,630
Oh, ropes, right?

487
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:04,705
Hold on.

488
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,880
Hey, what's going on?

489
00:39:15,705 --> 00:39:17,930
I may have forgotten them at the campsite.

490
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,630
Hey, how can that be?

491
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,055
I told you to prepare them.

492
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:25,730
Hurry. Go and get the ropes.

493
00:39:26,355 --> 00:39:27,430
The juniors need it.

494
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,380
Okay, wait for me then.

495
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:31,655
Mek, come with me.

496
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,305
You forgot it, you should collect it yourself.

497
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:37,430
Why not? But you're my hubby.

498
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,480
We should go through thick and thin together.

499
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,380
Hurry, come with me.

500
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,630
Come with me.

501
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,880
Hurry up.

502
00:39:48,905 --> 00:39:50,605
Junior Frong.

503
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,905
How was it? Did you sleep well last night?

504
00:39:53,305 --> 00:39:54,105
Quite well.

505
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:57,055
What about Brother Doctor?
Didn't you wake up with him?

506
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:01,730
Didn't Senior Thara come along to plant trees?

507
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,380
No.

508
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,430
Weren't he at the campsite?

509
00:40:11,305 --> 00:40:12,405
How is it?

510
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,555
Alright, fellow juniors.

511
00:40:21,655 --> 00:40:24,480
Let's rest here for an hour.

512
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,430
You may drink and chat.

513
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,130
Just help yourself.

514
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,355
What happened between you and Mai?

515
00:40:46,605 --> 00:40:48,180
Something small did happen.

516
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,655
But I don't think it's something small.

517
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:52,855
He looks like he's afraid of you.

518
00:40:53,955 --> 00:40:54,730
What did you do to him?

519
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,255
I didn't do anything to him.

520
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:00,080
But he did do something to me.

521
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,080
He kissed me suddenly.

522
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,630
What?

523
00:41:05,905 --> 00:41:06,730
Did you tell Duen?

524
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,955
No.

525
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,330
He wouldn't be jealous after all.

526
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,780
It wouldn't make a difference.

527
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:16,280
Oh.

528
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:17,955
I agree.

529
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:19,955
It wouldn't make a difference.

530
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:20,830
Right?

531
00:41:21,905 --> 00:41:23,280
No matter what, he will be angry with you.

532
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,455
Why?

533
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,005
Think about it, Bohn.

534
00:41:26,205 --> 00:41:27,305
If you tell him now,

535
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:29,555
he may be angry with you,

536
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:31,180
but it will pass in just a while.

537
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:34,055
But if you pretend as nothing happened,

538
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,180
and he finds it out later,

539
00:41:37,755 --> 00:41:38,855
it would be hard to settle.

540
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,130
Besides, I noticed this morning that,

541
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,255
he was all normal.

542
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,405
He was talking normally to the others,

543
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,455
but he didn't get near to you.

544
00:41:51,305 --> 00:41:55,005
He doesn't talk to you, doesn't look at you,
doesn't even care about you.

545
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,380
As if you didn't exist.

546
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,630
Perhaps he already knew about you and Mai.

547
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,080
Senior, did you see Duen?

548
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,230
Duen? I haven't seen him for a while.

549
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,830
Look at the camera.

550
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:31,930
Is it really good, Ting?

551
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,155
Why does it look weird?

552
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,330
-It's good. Trust me. It's cool.
-Really?

553
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,055
Yes.

554
00:43:43,305 --> 00:43:43,930
Like this?

555
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,805
Raise it higher. It looks cool.

556
00:43:46,405 --> 00:43:48,455
You really should thank me.

557
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:57,980
Duen.

558
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:07,755
Keep taking. Come on.

559
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,805
But you...

560
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,455
Hurry up. I'm being your model.

561
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,530
I worth a lot. Hurry up.

562
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,280
Hurry.

563
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,705
Duen, sorry.

564
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,380
Talk to me, okay?

565
00:44:39,055 --> 00:44:39,930
I beg you.

566
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,630
This time, let's do a cool face.

567
00:44:43,755 --> 00:44:46,180
Like a serious face. That's it. Take a photo.

568
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,555
Duen, don't pretend like I didn't exist.

569
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,280
Talk to me, okay?

570
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,680
I beg you.

571
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,955
Just clear it up with Senior first.

572
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:06,955
Even I feel upset for you.

573
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,755
Besides, Senior, if you make my friend sad,

574
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,155
you'll be dead.

575
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,480
Ting.

576
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:26,430
You're angry with me, right?

577
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,730
I know that you knew about it.

578
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:50,721
Regarding the kiss between Mai and me,

579
00:45:54,205 --> 00:45:55,555
I didn't want to lie to you.

580
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,905
But I didn't want you to feel uncomfortable.

581
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:01,705
I don't want to hear that.

582
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:07,080
We're a couple. Why are you still lying to me?

583
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:16,205
If we can't

584
00:46:18,255 --> 00:46:19,605
trust each other even as a couple,

585
00:46:20,755 --> 00:46:21,805
I think we should just break up.

586
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,030
Duen, don't say that.

587
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,230
Hey, don't say that, okay?

588
00:46:30,055 --> 00:46:31,330
I can do anything you want.

589
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,105
Don't say that.

590
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:35,805
I love you.

591
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:41,405

592
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,355
then let me go.

593
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,305
Take it as my last request.

594
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,080
