[My Engineer]
[Episode 6]

2
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,545
Here you go.

3
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,545
Father Bohn, goodbye.

4
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,195
This is my home.

5
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,795
Remember the route for next time.

6
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,200
Bohn, what's the matter?

7
00:02:26,895 --> 00:02:28,420
You looked angry at the school.

8
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:29,745
No, it's nothing.

9
00:02:30,795 --> 00:02:31,795
Tell me.

10
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:33,795
Are you mad with me?

11
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:37,120
I'm not mad with you.

12
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:39,095
I'm mad with myself.

13
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:39,645
What?

14
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,995
I want to go after you seriously.

15
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,145
But I don't know anything about you.

16
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,695
It started from the book matter.

17
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,095
Someone gave it to you first.

18
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:54,445
The same goes for the charity activity.

19
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:56,895
Ram knows that you're allergic to insect bites.

20
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,595
He also knows what you like to eat or not.

21
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:02,095
I don't know you well as others do.

22
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:06,870
You can ask me whatever you want to know.

23
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:09,345
What's your full name?

24
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:11,245
Thesada Ratdananamchok.

25
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:12,170
Your birthday?

26
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,495
19th December. My star sign
is Sagittarius. That's a bonus.

27
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,770
What do you like or dislike to eat?

28
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,174
What genre of songs do you like?

29
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:20,670
Oh.

30
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,520
Where do you like to go?

31
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,020
I like sour food. You knew this.

32
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,270
I don't like bitter food.
I like to listen to pop songs.

33
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:30,054
I like to go anywhere fun.

34
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:31,920
Because my father doesn't allow me to go.

35
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,245
Any questions?

36
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,295
Yes.

37
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,970
Do you like to be pursued by me?

38
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:50,220
You don't like it, right?

39
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:52,920
That's right.

40
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,795
I'm unlike your senior.

41
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,377
Gentle and kind.

42
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,670
Bohn, you really like to...

43
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,770
think about nonsense.

44
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,870
I didn't want to tell you this.

45
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,495
But that week when you disappeared,

46
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:20,245
I felt empty inside.

47
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,095
If another boy goes after me,

48
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,520
I wouldn't really like it.

49
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,845
But what you do now...

50
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:34,920
isn't resentful to me.

51
00:04:40,795 --> 00:04:41,695
Then...

52
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,895
I shall ask you one last question.

53
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,620
Let's have a date, Duen.

54
00:04:53,845 --> 00:05:00,820
♪ I want you to know
that beautiful love has no rules ♪

55
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:07,920
♪ No matter male or female,
as long as we love each other ♪

56
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:15,287
♪ The important thing is that
someone knows my thoughts ♪

57
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,695
Hello, freshmen.

58
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,947
Due to the delay of
the charity activity's preparation,

59
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:41,020
we need everyone to help prepare this activity.

60
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,120
From now on, until the work is done.

61
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,545
Get it?

62
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,170
Get it?

63
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:50,520
We get it.

64
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,570
Let's have a date, Duen.

65
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,745
No way.

66
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Have a date with me please, Duen.

67
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:07,870
Have a date me. I want to know you more.

68
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:14,545
Don't you need to prepare the charity activity?

69
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,870
I heard you're running out of time.

70
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,020
No, who said that?

71
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,695
Phu.

72
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,520
When must you get it done?

73
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:24,670
Sunday.

74
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,195
Be honest.

75
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:30,670
Actually by Friday.

76
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,495
But it can be postponed.

77
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,714
So,

78
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:37,845
if you can get the preparation done by Friday,

79
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,220
I'll have a date with you.

80
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:40,945
Hey.

81
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:42,920
How is it possible?

82
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,627
I don't know. Or else, you'll have to hold it in.

83
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,995
That's it. I'll go now.

84
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,770
Bye.

85
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,078
Hey, be quick.

86
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:00,877
You're not allowed to leave until it's done.

87
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:05,239
Sorry, it slipped off my hand.

88
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,045
Slipped off? I think it was intentional.

89
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,270
What's that?

90
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:14,795
Revenge? Alright.

91
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,370
Thank you.

92
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:42,145
Hey!

93
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,095
Why are you sleeping?

94
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,395
Get up.

95
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,945
Phu.

96
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,720
You're so sleepy.

97
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,820
Why don't you sniff some cold ointment?

98
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:53,220
I've sniffed it, Senior.

99
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,770
But I still can't take it.

100
00:07:58,945 --> 00:07:59,520
Hey.

101
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,845
I think this is too much for the juniors.

102
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,270
Oh, no.

103
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:07,620
What should I do?

104
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,945
This can't be done in time.

105
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,295
Actually,

106
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,945
I still have a backup plan.

107
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,695
But I don't know if anyone else...

108
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:18,820
will do it with me?

109
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,945
I'll do anything at this point.

110
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,745
But what plan do you have?

111
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,095
Duen, you're bullying the seniors
with such a condition.

112
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,570
Will they make it in time?

113
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,845
Hurry up.

114
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,695
Because I know they'll never make it in time.

115
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:43,145
That's why I did it.

116
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,395
My senior Bohn.

117
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:48,770
I'll wipe your tears.

118
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:50,645
Go ahead.

119
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,695
No.

120
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:56,820
Why are there so many people?

121
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:00,170
Most importantly, they're all female.

122
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,970
I don't see any engineering boys here.

123
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:02,970
That's right.

124
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:03,945
What's going on?

125
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:07,795
Oh.

126
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,695
-Hello, senior.
-Hello.

127
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:12,045
Hey, junior Duen.

128
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,070
You're drawn here as well?

129
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:16,570
Drawn? What do you mean, senior?

130
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,420
Because we can't get ready in time.

131
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,220
So I have to use plan TRI18+.

132
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:24,270
TRI18+?

133
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,420
Have a look here.

134
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,320
Here.

135
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:31,095
No time to rest nor shower.
Looking forward to help from kind ones.

136
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,095
Disgusting.

137
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,945
Once it's posted,

138
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:38,945
all the girls came in a hive.

139
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,195
I think it's worth too.

140
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:42,520
Not bad, right?

141
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:44,320
Alright now.

142
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,670
Thank you for your kind help, juniors.

143
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,795
I would like to announce that the work is done!

144
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:56,743
-Great.
-What's going on?

145
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:01,820
I've fulfilled my promise.

146
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:07,145
The pope of the TRI18+ group is here.

147
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:08,695
Ting.

148
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,445
Duen, talk to senior first.

149
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,820
Ting and I will help tidy up.

150
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,320
Oh.

151
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,280
Come with me.

152
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,071
Let's go.

153
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:18,524
Hurry up, Ting.

154
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:19,670
Where are you guys going?

155
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,945
Hurry, let's go.

156
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,745
This doesn't count. You were cheating.

157
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,045
I don't care. It is done.

158
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:30,920
That's all.

159
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:33,245
Answer me. Can we go on a date now?

160
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:34,170
What are you doing?

161
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,320
So can we go on a date now?

162
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:45,570
Okay, fine! We'll go. Stay away from me.

163
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,595
I'm afraid of you.

164
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,995
Isn't it good?

165
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,145
Or you like it when I do that?

166
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,945
Who likes it? Get away from me.

167
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:57,845
I'm leaving now.

168
00:10:58,745 --> 00:10:59,545
Where to?

169
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,370
Oh.

170
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:07,095
I'm very hungry.

171
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:09,095
It looks really good.

172
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,820
Hello.

173
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,670
Hello, seniors.

174
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,395
Oh, junior Mek.

175
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:17,020
Why are you so late?

176
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:18,470
We've been waiting for so long.

177
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,120
Sorry. There was some work in college.

178
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,095
A handsome who contributes to the society.

179
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:24,420
So cute.

180
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:26,245
Do you remember me? I'm the makeup artist.

181
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,795
Of course, you're so cute.

182
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:29,995
How can I forget you?

183
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:32,245
Oh, you're...?

184
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:35,170
Oh, don't you remember?

185
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,920
He's the junior who acted as the corpse.

186
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:39,370
I think he's called Bun, right?

187
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,495
I'm called Boss, senior.

188
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:45,470
I was acting as the corpse that
served as a foil to the leading man.

189
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:48,145
Where do we sit then?

190
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:50,145
Sit here, junior Mek.

191
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:52,620
Go sit with Fon.

192
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,620
As for Mek's friend, sit over there.

193
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:02,220
Why don't I sit with you?

194
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,270
It's okay.

195
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:06,045
You're the leading man.

196
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:07,270
You should sit here.

197
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,445
Go ahead. The seniors are waiting for you.

198
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,870
Go ahead.

199
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:21,645
Have you eaten?

200
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:24,220
Hello, I'm Boss.

201
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:26,245
Not Bun from the crews.

202
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,295
What do you want?

203
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,620
I'll get you something.

204
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,020
I'll eat with you here.

205
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:22,370
Hey, the chance is here.

206
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,345
Go talk to her.

207
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,770
No.

208
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:29,170
Why? Don't you like her anymore?

209
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,745
Do you remember the cartoon on Fon's script?

210
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,545
[To Boss, all the best.]
[From Fon.]

211
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:45,170
I think it's familiar.

212
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,145
So I had a look at my primary school student log.

213
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,245
I found that the writings were the same.

214
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:53,345
So she's your primary schoolmate?

215
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:57,995
Yes. She was tanned and fat.

216
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,045
She looked completely different then.

217
00:14:00,795 --> 00:14:02,795
Great. You two will have more topics.

218
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,320
It isn't so easy.

219
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,520
She doesn't even remember me.

220
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,945
She's now the leading woman.

221
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,020
I reckon she wouldn't want to have
anything to do with a small potato.

222
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,145
-I know...
-Mek.

223
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,895
Take a photo with the crews.

224
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:20,645
Let's go.

225
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,895
Here, let's gather.

226
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,895
Let's take a photo. Quick.

227
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,420
Here.

228
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:33,595
Yeah!

229
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,364
Let's change to another pose.

230
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,270
Yeah!

231
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:07,070
[Cool Boy.]

232
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,145
[Talk to me.]

233
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,820
[Why are you so cool?]

234
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:03,720
Hey everyone.

235
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,670
Hello, senior King.

236
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,120
Hello. What are you doing?

237
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,595
Homework. We have to submit it tomorrow,
but it's not yet done.

238
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:13,020
Oh, right, Senior.

239
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:16,895
I heard you're the best student
of this college, right?

240
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,795
Can you please give us some guidance?

241
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:20,997
Who said that?

242
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:23,645
But that's true.

243
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,545
Since you've said so,
it wouldn't be good if I reject you.

244
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,095
Here, let me teach you guys.

245
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:31,495
Thank you, senior.

246
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:32,120
You're welcome.

247
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:36,270
Ram, why you don't thank him?

248
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:37,270
Hurry.

249
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:41,245
Come on.

250
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,895
What do you not understand?

251
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,995
Earth.

252
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,970
Do you have any question?

253
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:11,545
Can you do it, Cool Boy?

254
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,120
If not, let me teach you.

255
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:18,820
What you don't know is the same as others.

256
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:19,920
Weren't you listening?

257
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,645
Place P here.

258
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,895
Get it? Just leave it here.

259
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:27,995
Can you remember that?

260
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:37,045
♪ Having you is like
having the whole world ♪

261
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,020
Hey, everyone. If there's nothing else, I'll leave.

262
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,845
Thank you for teaching us.

263
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:45,661

Oh, right, Cool Boy.

267
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,095
I saw that you didn't know how to do your homework,

268
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:56,645
so I summarized a note for you.

269
00:17:56,645 --> 00:17:58,570

270
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,745

00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:02,870
I'm leaving. Bye, everyone.

272
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,395
Goodbye, senior.

273
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:03,920
Bye.

274
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,245

275
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:07,795
Oh, my, why did he make you a note?

276
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,195
You're not even his direct junior.

277
00:18:09,195 --> 00:18:09,795

278
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,045
Why are you video calling me?

279
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:27,070
You could text me via Line.

280
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,145
You're scolding me, yet you picked up the call.

281
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,245
I'll hang up then.

282
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:31,595
Hey, hold on.

283
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,845
Where do you want to go for a date tomorrow?

284
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,870
Hmm, tomorrow...

285
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,995
I want to go to the floating market.

286
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:43,420
Floating market?

287
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:46,545
Others normally go to malls or somewhere cool.

288
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:48,270
But my boyfriend wants to go to a floating market.

289
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,245
You can't even fulfill this request?

290
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:51,695
Hold on. Don't be anxious.

291
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,020
Even if I have to go around the earth,

292
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,745
I'll take you to wherever you want.

293
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,870
Why do you want to go to the floating market?

294
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:03,995
Because my family used to take me
to floating market.

295
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,995
I think the atmosphere there
is better than malls.

296
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,420
No matter people, food,

297
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:12,070
or...

298
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:14,145
Are you tired?

299
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,320
Yes. I'll switch off my laptop now.

300
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,270
Hey, can you keep the laptop on?

301
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:21,645
Why?

302
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:26,220
Please. I want to watch you fall asleep.

303
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:28,095
Haven't you slept with someone via video before?

304
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:30,095
No.

305
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:33,745
Great. I'm the first one who sleeps
with you via video.

306
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,070
Whatever. I'm going to sleep now.

307
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,420
[I don't dare to shut my eyes, in fear
that you may disappear. #BohnDuen]

308
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:23,770
Seniors, I'll go back now.

309
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,220
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

310
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,970
Goodbye.

311
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,845
Be careful on the road.

312
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,620
Hey, how are you going back?

313
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:33,070
I'll wait for a taxi at the station.

314
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,195
What about you?

315
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,195
Do you want me to send you?

316
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,745
Junior Mek.

317
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:40,745
I'll pass by your house.

318
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:41,820
Do you want us to send you back?

319
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,970
Okay?

320
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,770
Let's go.

321
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,620
Okay?

322
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,345
Hey, it's okay.

323
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:48,670
Go ahead with the seniors.

324
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,445
Aren't you going the same way as them?

325
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,095
Take good care of them.

326
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:54,395
I shall go now, seniors.

327
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:55,795
Goodbye.

328
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:56,270
Bye-bye.

329
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,220
Hey.

330
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:07,770
Let's go, junior Mek.

331
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:08,895
Let's go.

332
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,420
Where are you going?

333
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:44,795
Number 70 of Lat Phrao road.

334
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:47,120
Oh, okay.

335
00:21:57,445 --> 00:21:59,920
When a car comes, should we go back together?

336
00:21:59,995 --> 00:22:00,995
Because we're going the same way.

337
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,220
Alright.

338
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,070
It's the same way.

339
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,670
Miss Fon, how do you know we're going the same way?

340
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:13,220
Of course, I know.

341
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,770
How would I not know?

342
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,869
Didn't we study in the same primary school?

343
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,345
Wow, Miss Fon, you remember me.

344
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:30,070
Of course.

345
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:35,520
Why didn't you tell me then?

346
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:37,795
You don't want to talk to me?

347
00:22:38,395 --> 00:22:39,620
No.

348
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:41,720
I thought you forgot about me.

349
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Hence, I didn't dare to greet you.

350
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,745
But I do remember you.

351
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,895
Because you have helped me back then.

352
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:51,221
Helped?

353
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:55,395
Have I helped you before, Miss Fon?

354
00:22:56,045 --> 00:22:57,970
Stop calling me Miss Fon.

355
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:00,845
It sounds weird.

356
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:05,020
Okay, I'll not call you Miss Fon then.

357
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,120
I'll call you Stinky Fon.

358
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,170
Okay?

359
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:11,019
No way.

360
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:13,020
Okay, I'll call you Fon then.

361
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:17,595
Back then, a group of students called me fat.

362
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,420
They didn't let me skip with them.

363
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,170
Then you appeared...

364
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:24,220
to scold them.

365
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,145
You invited me to play football.

366
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:27,395
Do you remember?

367
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,395
Oh.

368
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,145
We were in need of a goalkeeper.

369
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,720
I saw that you were big,

370
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,245
so I thought you could block the goal.

371
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:41,501
But now I think you're a technician.

372
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,795
I'm a technician?

373
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,470
What technician?

374
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,720
A cute one who can fix my heart.

375
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:09,095
Thank you for that day anyhow.

376
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:10,720
I had a lot of fun.

377
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:11,920
You're welcome.

378
00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:15,844
But to be honest,
we're still in need of a goalkeeper.

379
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,520
Oh, I'm not coming.

380
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,820
Here's a taxi.

381
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,295
Okay, you shall get in first, Miss Fon.

382
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:30,545
Thank you.

383
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,770
Thank you for remembering me.

384
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,720
How can I forget?

385
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,070
Oh, my.

386
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:02,395
You didn't switch off the laptop since last night?

387
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:06,095
Yes. Because you look stupid when you sleep.

388
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,495
I was happy looking at you.

389
00:25:07,495 --> 00:25:10,495
What stupid? I'm going to shower now.

390
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:13,795
Hold on. Take the laptop along.

391
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:15,270
I want to watch you shower.

392
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,245
Are you insane?

393
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,070
Alright then. I'll only watch you change.

394
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,470
Psycho.

395
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,470
I get it, Brother Frist. I'm tidying up in the shop.

396
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:38,220
Excuse me.

397
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:41,545
I came to collect the jasmine I ordered.

398
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,345
Sorry, we're closed.

399
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,520
You're closed so early?

400
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,770
Your boss told me to collect it at this hour.

401
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,070
I have no time today.

402
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:56,820
I'm busy.

403
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,520
Frong, a customer is collecting flowers?

404
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:02,870
How do you know someone wants to buy flowers?

405
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:06,495
That's a regular customer. Just sell it to him.

406
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:07,220
Please.

407
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,195
Alright then.

408
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:09,945
I'm hanging up.

409
00:26:17,595 --> 00:26:18,445
I want 2 bouquets, please.

410
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,995
I'm not selling it to you. Please leave.

411
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,745
Why aren't you selling them to me?

412
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:27,645
Not selling.

413
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,845
Why?

414
00:26:29,495 --> 00:26:30,770
I just don't want to.

415
00:26:31,895 --> 00:26:32,595
Why then?

416
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:33,970
No reasons.

417
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,145
When do you come here normally?

418
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,945
Tell me.

419
00:26:39,795 --> 00:26:40,620
Why are you asking this?

420
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:42,645
I'll come when you're not around.

421
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:44,720
I'll come here every day.

422
00:26:45,195 --> 00:26:46,270
If you come every day,

423
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,895
I'll see you every day, right?

424
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,395
I said I don't want to sell to you.

425
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:09,320
Okay, I surrender.

426
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,745
It's okay.

427
00:28:02,495 --> 00:28:03,595
Hello, brother.

428
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:05,170
Oh, Daonua.

429
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,495
Stop sulking.

430
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:20,695
I didn't say that it'll be a two-person date.

431
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,470
It's too soon to enjoy the world of two.

432
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:28,095
Right?

433
00:28:28,395 --> 00:28:29,770
Thank you, Brother Bohn.

434
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,195
I always want to go to the floating market.

435
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,520
Why do you want to go to the floating market?

436
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,770
Back then, my mother and father
used to take me there.

437
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:43,795
But today, father Bohn and mother Duen
are taking me there instead.

438
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:48,120
I have such a cute daughter.

439
00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:50,070
How can I refuse to not take you along?

440
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:51,520
Right, mother Duen?

441
00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:52,895
Nonsense.

442
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:54,145
Watch out or I'll hit you.

443
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:57,870
Wow, turns out mother is always
so fierce to father.

444
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:08,695
I want to take a selfie
with mother and father before we depart.

445
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:10,220
Okay. Here.

446
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,420
I'll take the phone.

447
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:14,795
Why are you standing there, mother?

448
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:15,970
Take a selfie with me.

449
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,595
Here, hurry.

450
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,145
Here, let father take the photo.

451
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,595
We'll take a photo together, mother.

452
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:31,295
Hurry.

453
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,870
We look like a family.

454
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:54,170
Is it cute?

455
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:55,245
Yes.

456
00:29:55,245 --> 00:29:56,270
Is it cute?

457
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,920
Daonua, look.

458
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,620
Did you see that?

459
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,270
I want to eat that.

460
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,045
Do you want to go?

461
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:14,220
I would like to have a look at desserts.

462
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
Okay, let's go.

463
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:16,795
Hey.

464
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,195
Hold on.

465
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,470
What's going on?

466
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,545
We'll be with Daonua the whole day.

467
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:24,345
It's inappropriate to address
each other as usual.

468
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,695
You should just call me senior Bohn.

469
00:30:26,695 --> 00:30:28,970
I'll call you junior Duen.

470
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:29,995
Okay?

471
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:30,545
Hey.

472
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,145
Can't we change the form of address?

473
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,395
Wouldn't "you" and "me" be okay?

474
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:37,245
Why?

475
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,795
You call Tee and the rest seniors.

476
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,295
Because they deserve my respect. Unlike...

477
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,720
Okay, for the sake of Daonua.

478
00:30:53,095 --> 00:30:55,145
Here, give it a try.

479
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:57,895
Hurry.

480
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:02,270
Senior Bohn.

481
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,920
It's disgusting.

482
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:06,270
It's a tongue-twisting.

483
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,170
My junior Duen is so cute.

484
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,195
Father Bohn, mother Duen,
there are many desserts there.

485
00:31:16,195 --> 00:31:17,845
Let's go and have a look.

486
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:18,170
Let's go.

487
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,495
Okay, I'll take you there.

488
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:20,895
Let's go.

489
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:55,170
Why are we working here for Bohn,

490
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,445
while he's happily on a date?

491
00:32:57,595 --> 00:32:59,595
Are you lazy or jealous?

492
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:00,520
It must be jealousy.

493
00:33:01,445 --> 00:33:02,670
They're happy at the floating market.

494
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,945
Hubby, take me there as well.

495
00:33:06,395 --> 00:33:07,120
Please.

496
00:33:07,595 --> 00:33:09,570
Isn't it better to have fun after work?

497
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:32,720
Oh, now you're coaxing your husband.

498
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,245
You're always so bright when you have a girl.

499
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:37,020
Who?

500
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,120
What? What girl?

501
00:33:39,795 --> 00:33:41,820
It's just a friend who's teasing me.

502
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,545
Really?

503
00:33:42,545 --> 00:33:43,470
Do your homework.

504
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,495
Done.

505
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:48,695
I'm going back.

506
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:50,295
I'm taking my laptop back too.

507
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,945
I'm done as well.

508
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,195
My body needs salmon today.

509
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,420
Want to eat salmon together?

510
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,195
No.

511
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,545
My car has broken down. I have to go back by bus.

512
00:33:58,545 --> 00:33:59,307
What?

513
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:00,570
It'll be hard to get a bus when it's late.

514
00:34:01,395 --> 00:34:02,220
I'm leaving now.

515
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:04,095
I have something to do.

516
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:05,120
What's going on?

517
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,920
I have something to do as well. Sorry.

518
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:11,045
What?

519
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:12,620
Enjoy the salmon alone.

520
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:16,295
Alright, all of you may leave.

521
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:17,795
I'll eat alone.

522
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:19,495
I'm not begging you guys.

523
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:47,720
Have you been waiting for long?

524
00:34:49,195 --> 00:34:49,945
That's great.

525
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,220
Why did you come to college on Saturday?

526
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,145
You thought it's Monday, right?

527
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,345
Are you going back now?

528
00:35:38,395 --> 00:35:39,095
Leave then.

529
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,970
I can go back myself. I'm wet anyway.

530
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,570
I'll be at the bus station soon. Just go first.

531
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:50,845
♪ Having you is like having the whole world ♪

532
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:51,920

537
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,395
I want that shirt.

538
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:07,720
That's so cute.

539
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,295
I'll get it to show you.

540
00:36:13,545 --> 00:36:15,095
Here, let's see.

541
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,270
It fits very well.

542
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,320
It looks good.

543
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,320
Do you like it?

544
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,220
Yes.

545
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,545
I want a new shirt too.

546
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,570
Then you...

547
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:33,220
Senior Bohn, you should buy it yourself.

548
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,070
Then...

549
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:36,241
please choose one for me, junior Duen.

550
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:36,845
Please.

551
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:37,795
No way.

552
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,545
I will not complain no matter what you choose.

553
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:41,320
I promise.

554
00:37:06,595 --> 00:37:08,520
Here. Take a white one.

555
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,945
Black absorbs heat. You'll die of heat.

556
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,320
But when a white shirt is wet from sweat,

557
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,620
it sticks to the body.

558
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:17,808
Other girls may stare at me then.

559
00:37:18,295 --> 00:37:19,620
You said you wouldn't complain.

560
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,920
White it is then.

561
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,445
Do you have anything to say?

562
00:37:22,595 --> 00:37:25,470
No, I have nothing to say at all.

563
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:27,220
But...

564
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,820
I'm just sad that you're not worried about me.

565
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,795
I'm not worried about you.

566
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,720
You're an adult. You should take care of yourself.

567
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,120
Give it to me.

568
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,770
How much do these two cost?

569
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,070
400 baht.

570
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,645
400 baht?

571
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:43,095
Yes.

572
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:43,695
Okay.

573
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,645
Your family is cute.

574
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,345
She means we're a family.

575
00:37:50,845 --> 00:37:53,495
Are you insane? She means we're brothers.

576
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,745
You want a piece of me?

577
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:02,070
Okay.

578
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,520
Thank you.

579
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:09,845
Here you go.

580
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,295
Why didn't you say we were heading the same way?

581
00:38:28,245 --> 00:38:29,595
You're taking the bus too?

582
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:35,220
Hey, the bus is here.

583
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:42,741
You're pulling me again. I'm not a dog.

584
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:50,895
Why are you pulling me so hard?

585
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,995
Let go.

586
00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:06,595
Do you like tattoos?

587
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,270
I would like to have a tattoo too.

588
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,695
Does it hurt?

589
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,453
You want to get a tattoo?

590
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,345
Are you talking to me, Cool Boy?

591
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:27,270
Yes. I want to have a tattoo
of my name behind my ear.

592
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,370
But I'm afraid of needles.

593
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,770
Do you remember I told you that...

594
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,245
I was traumatized by a dog bite?

595
00:39:32,595 --> 00:39:37,420
That's why I don't like anything sharp.

596
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,695
Hey, I have said so much.

597
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,845
Aren't you saying anything?

598
00:39:54,745 --> 00:39:55,420
Is it tasty?

599
00:39:58,345 --> 00:39:58,895
Yes.

600
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,420
You still have a sweet tooth. You didn't change.

601
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,220
Even after I lost weight,

602
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,945
I still can't stop eating sweet stuff.

603
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:08,495
Really?

604
00:40:09,195 --> 00:40:09,870
By the way,

605
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,295
how could you lose so much weight?

606
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:15,345
Why do you want to know?

607
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:19,595
Just tell me you're crossed in love.

608
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,995
Is it?

609
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,495
No.

610
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,670
Here's the story.

611
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,595
When I was in primary school,

612
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,995
a friend told me he likes girls in good shape.

613
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:33,445
So I decided to change myself after I graduated.

614
00:40:34,595 --> 00:40:37,320
You should thank your friend.

615
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,420
Really?

616
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:38,920
Yes.

617
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,145
Thank you.

618
00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:47,995
Did I tell you that?

619
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:51,920
I overheard your conversation
with your friends.

620
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:58,995
Fon, that must be hard, right?

621
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,270
No.

622
00:41:01,245 --> 00:41:02,745
Doing sports is interesting.

623
00:41:02,745 --> 00:41:03,370
No.

624
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:06,745
I mean that you still remember me.

625
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,420
You're shy secretly, right?

626
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,195
I'm not shy.

627
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:13,745
Not shy, is it?

628
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:28,670
I can pay for this meal.

629
00:41:28,845 --> 00:41:30,495
No. We should split the bill.

630
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:31,520
That's fairer.

631
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,495
Do you still have work to do?

632
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:36,720
Yes. It's about time.

633
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,195
Let's hurry.

634
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:38,170
Let's go then.

635
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,620
Please.

636
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:41,720
Okay.

637
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,013
Thank you.

638
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:43,995
How was the cake? Good?

639
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,420
I want to pay.

640
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,295
Brother, I forgot my phone here.

641
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,595
Why did it run out of power?

642
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,620
Oh, thank you.

643
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:44,270
What song is this?

644
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,870
That's too intense.

645
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:47,095
Give me your phone.

646
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,670
Listen to this.

647
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,295
It matches such a rainy day.

648
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:02,495
They're sharing the earphone.

649
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:06,645
I recognized that they're a couple
as soon as they got on.

650
00:43:06,645 --> 00:43:08,870
I would like to marry them.

651
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,745
But they already have husbands.

652
00:43:10,895 --> 00:43:14,669
You don't know if they're married,
but they're a couple.

653
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,820
I hope they'll be together.

654
00:43:20,995 --> 00:43:22,720
Sadhu!

655
00:43:25,495 --> 00:43:28,770
Cool boy, the girls over there thought
we're a couple.

656
00:43:29,195 --> 00:43:29,995
Do you want to be a couple with me?

657
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,495
Is that your glasses?

658
00:43:36,745 --> 00:43:37,570
Can you lend it to me?

659
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,245
If you don't answer,

660
00:43:43,395 --> 00:43:44,350
I'll take it as yes.

661
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,145
I have always wanted to try it.

662
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:50,895
I want to know how it looks like.

663
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:54,520
Am I handsome?

664
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,145
Hey, since we're at it,

665
00:44:09,545 --> 00:44:11,170
lend me your phone for a selfie.

666
00:44:12,845 --> 00:44:13,845
My phone is power off.

667
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,699
Please, lend it to me.

668
00:44:17,445 --> 00:44:18,320
Please.

669
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,220
Lend me your arm.

670
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,145
I want this tattoo in the photo.

671
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:04,070
Is it cool?

672
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,020
Send it to me.

673
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,120
You have arrived home?

674
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,045
Thank you for sending me.

675
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:26,695
What's going on?

676
00:45:52,195 --> 00:45:55,495
You gave me the note,
I give you an umbrella. We're even.

677
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,045
Father Bohn.

678
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,545
Mother Duen.

679
00:46:13,945 --> 00:46:15,520
I want a younger sibling.

680
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:22,420
Junior Duen, what should we do...

681
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,020
to get Daonua a younger sibling?

682
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,070
