[My Engineer]
[Episode 12]

2
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:47,385
Wow, puppies!

3
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,785
The dogs are here.

4
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,410
Cool Boy.

5
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,285
Oh, my goodness.

6
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,135
Kew, take the dogs away.

7
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,935
Take the dogs away, Cool Boy.

8
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:02,856
Come on.

9
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:04,560
Let the leash go.

10
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,585
I think we should take the children out.

11
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:30,085
Or else there will be a mess.

12
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,385
Hey.

13
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:46,460
Have you been here for long, Senior Yim?

14
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,410
Not really.

15
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,210
My cousin will be here soon.

16
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,710
Let's wait for a while, Senior.

17
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:04,635
Brother Thara, we're here.

18
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,660
Brother Thara, this is Senior Frong.

19
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,035
Senior Frong, this is Brother Thara.

20
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:19,310
He's my cousin.

21
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,210
We know each other.

22
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,860
Right?

23
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,710
Yes.

24
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,510
How did you get to know each other?

25
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:27,935
It's a long story.

26
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,185
He's the family member of my patient.

27
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:31,435
Oh.

28
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:34,110
That's good. Then we won't feel awkward.

29
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,460
Let's order ice cream.

30
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,285
Waiter, we would like to order ice cream.

31
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:47,335
Thank you.

32
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,360
This looks good.

33
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,085
What do you want?

34
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,610
I want this one.

35
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:55,960
This looks good.

36
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:57,985
Two portions, please.

37
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,760
Hey, I want a strawberry sorbet.

38
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:05,285
What do you want?

39
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,235
This one.

40
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,435
And this one.

41
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:14,210
Here, thank you.

42
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,910
Are you unhappy?

43
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,010
Because I said you aren't allowed
to tease me today.

44
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,585
Wow, it's yummy.

45
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:33,435
How yummy is that? Let me try it.

46
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:34,435
Take it yourself.

47
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:36,610
Alright.

48
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,535
Curse you, Bohn.

49
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:43,910
Why don't you just take the whole thing away?

50
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,810
Alright then.

51
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,760
I'll let you have my ice cream later.

52
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:55,260
That's enough. Are you trying to revenge?

53
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,610
Just eat.

54
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,710
That's too much.

55
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,185
Look at this quarrelsome couple.

56
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,285
Is it yummy?

57
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,185
It's enviable, right?

58
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,985
I should have brought Cupcake out.

59
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,710
Is Cupcake your dog?

60
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,760
No.

61
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:14,810
Look.

62
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:16,510
It's a lizard.

63
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,260
Isn't it cute? Look.

64
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,385
It's quite cute.

65
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:27,685
Look. Everyone at that table
is handsome. Think about it.

66
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,935
Look properly. They're dating each other.

67
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:36,985
What a shame. All handsome boys are homosexual.

68
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,260
Those girls think we're a couple.

69
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:43,635
It seems we do look matching.

70
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:50,810
I'm going to the washroom.

71
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,635
Brother Thara,
how did you get to know Senior Frong?

72
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,479
Do you remember the patient that I'm taking care of?

73
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,760
Yes, I remember.

74
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:11,585
That's Frong's mother.

75
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,060
Really, brother?

76
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,735
How is her mother now?

77
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:21,510
She's being treated step-by-step.
And she is getting better.

78
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,660
But I'm not sure if he's still
worried about his mother?

79
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,885
Why do you care about Senior Frong so much?

80
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:30,985
Because I saw he was crying.

81
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:33,160
How is that not worrying?

82
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,335
Now that I see him smile,

83
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,085
I think he is better that way.

84
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:56,460
Uncle King, I'm bored. Let's have some fun.

85
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,285
What do you want to play?

86
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,010
Horse-riding racing.

87
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,860
If we win, you two must kiss.

88
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:08,960
Hey, what kind of challenge is that?

89
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,610
Where did you learn this?

90
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:12,985
Mother said if we manage
to take a photo of you two kissing,

91
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:14,310
she will buy us a new game.

92
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,510
Sister, what nonsense
did you teach your children?

93
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,410
Okay, what about this?

94
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,360
See that tree?
Those who reach there first, win.

95
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:27,835
You should prepare yourself
for not having a new game.

96
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:28,960
Two weaklings.

97
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,560
Faster.

98
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:31,560
Cool Boy, run faster.

99
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:36,035
Oh, my, look.
It's Brother Handsome and Brother Manly.

100
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:38,460
They're playing horse-riding game in the park.

101
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,335
Hurry, take a photo and send it to mother.

102
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:21,835
But they are not kissing.

103
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,185
This is another kind of happiness. Trust me.

104
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,660
They're so lovely.

105
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:43,010
Are you okay, Cool Boy?

106
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,410
Are you taking photos?

107
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:51,535
Take as much as you like.

108
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:53,160
I'm sure you won't get any new game. Trust me.

109
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,610
Did you see that?

110
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:02,948
Brothers are having lots of fun.

111
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:06,935
They just couldn't stop.

112
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:09,760
Yes. I even saw them kiss.

113
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,960
When they stood up,
he even placed his hand on his chest.

114
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,132
So sweet.

115
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:33,135
They're being very intimate.

116
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:35,210
Thank you.

117
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,085
Oh, right, Brother Thara.

118
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,810
Bohn's college has a charitable event
at the end of this semester.

119
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:42,485
Do you want to come, brother?

120
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,410
Can students from other colleges attend as well?

121
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,435
Sure. I'm going too.

122
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,160
Senior Yim, you should come too.

123
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,635
Let's first see how my mother's condition is.

124
00:09:58,385 --> 00:10:00,685
I can only go if she gets better.

125
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,360
Don't worry.

126
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,060
Just plan the trip.

127
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:09,635
That means both of you are coming?

128
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,510
Bohn, help them arrange seats.

129
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:15,585
Okay.

130
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:18,760
Can we go back now?

131
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,335
Okay. Let's go.

132
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,035
Goodbye, seniors.

133
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:22,985
Goodbye.

134
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,860
How are you going back?

135
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,385
I'm planning to take a taxi to the hospital.

136
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,035
I came here with a vehicle.

137
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:38,185
Let me send you.

138
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,960
Get on.

139
00:10:57,435 --> 00:10:59,010
Get on, don't worry.

140
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:07,560
Wear this. Safety first.

141
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:16,910
Hold on to me.

142
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,660
Sorry.

143
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,185
I normally drive fast. But I'll be slower today.

144
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:32,660
Let's go.

145
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:55,110
Let's go back.

146
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,560
I have been an obedient baby today.

147
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,185
Can you tell me now, who you gave your first kiss to?

148
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:04,785
Don't worry.

149
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,935
Because he's in the car.

150
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:11,560
Who?

151
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:15,260
Could it be that he's not a human?

152
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,835
Yeah. He's not a human.

153
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,885
So creepy.

154
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:31,435
He's a doll.

155
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,935
When I was role playing with Sister Dao,

156
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:40,085
she made me the father and Jenny the mother.

157
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,485
After that, Sister Dao asked me to kiss Jenny.

158
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:47,060
Hence, that was my first kiss.

159
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:52,310
I shouldn't have trusted your words.

160
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:55,101
You can no longer be cured.

161
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:58,135
Who told you to be jealous like an idiot?

162
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:02,535
Did you give your first kiss to any human?

163
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,210
Why are you asking this?

164
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,835
If no, then I'll give you an agenda.

165
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,735
So you can prove to others.

166
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,235
It's too early to kiss me.

167
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:25,910
Kiss Jenny first.

168
00:13:54,785 --> 00:13:55,610
What's going on?

169
00:13:57,835 --> 00:13:58,485
Nothing.

170
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:02,185
Is it because

171
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,760
you are thinking about my cousin?

172
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:08,660
Why would I be thinking about your cousin?

173
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:11,860
When we were eating ice cream,

174
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,860
I saw you keep looking at him.

175
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,560
It feels like you're not happy about
Duen and Bohn being together.

176
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:24,160
Don't go.

177
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:25,585
Sorry.

178
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:29,685
Don't apologize.

179
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,435
Because I don't feel anything about
your cousin anymore.

180
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,235
Don't feel anything?

181
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,835
Forget about it.

182
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:41,385
I don't want to mention this anymore.

183
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:45,760
Okay, I just want to tell you,

184
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,735
someone like you,

185
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:48,860
won't be crossed in love for long.

186
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,610
I'm not crossed in love.

187
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,260
Alright, let's not talk about this.

188
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,935
Let's go to visit your mother.

189
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:56,710
Let's go.

190
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,360
By the way,

191
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:01,410
are you the youngest at home?

192
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,610
Yes. What's up?

193
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:07,185
No wonder. Let's go.

194
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,410
What do you mean?

195
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,960
On the way sending Kew and Kram
back to Sister Kumfah,

196
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:22,385
I saw something nice,
so I bought it for you.

197
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:39,335
I bit my tongue.

198
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,356
I ate too fast. Not sure if it's bleeding.

199
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:45,860
I'm so tired.

200
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,185
Wow. Being intimate under such bright daylight.

201
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Aren't you ashamed of little elf and little angel?

202
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:56,960
What about you?

203
00:15:57,385 --> 00:15:58,485
Where are you heading to
in such a formal attire?

204
00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:00,110
Are you receiving an award?

205
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,835
No.

206
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:04,023
Our manner and behavior don't
correspond to the college's regulation.

207
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:06,310
So we're dressing up today
to bring respect to the college.

208
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:08,635
That's better.

209
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:09,735
You two are serious people.

210
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,135
Do you want to eat?

211
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:14,035
-Can I eat that?
-Sure, this is...

212
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:15,160
Won't I be a third-wheeling?

213
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,035
Then I shall take it.

214
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:20,285
No, we have something to do.

215
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:25,360
I was about to see them being intimate.

216
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,285
Where are you hurrying to?

217
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,185
What's up?

218
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,335
When I prayed for the success of my love,

219
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:48,285
I didn't expect the love that God has for me

220
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,485
is you.

221
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:54,660
What's up? Are you disappointed?

222
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,635
No.

223
00:16:57,235 --> 00:17:00,310
To be honest, you don't have to
help me repay the wish.

224
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:04,160
I prayed myself, I'll repay it myself.

225
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,910
It's okay. My wish has something
to do with love as well.

226
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:09,635
Now the wish

227
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,010
has come true.

228
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,210
This God is really celestial.

229
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:21,885
Are you ready to repay the wish?

230
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:23,135
Of course.

231
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:25,660
You shall take off your top
and I'll take off my pants.

232
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,674
I'm just kidding.

233
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,360
Why are you hitting me?

234
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,210
Mek, wait for me.

235
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,710
Are you thinking about
your father's matter again?

236
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,935
Okay.

237
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,110
No one has a perfect life.

238
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,235
Ups and downs are norms.

239
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,035
Everything will pass.

240
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,010
If you would accept it, then don't overthink.

241
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:55,860
Come one, smile.

242
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,560
Cool Boy, smile.

243
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:01,710
Cool Boy.

244
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,810
Smile.

245
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:05,260
You smiled.

246
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,385

Didn't you say that you're out

Yes, I was. Now I came back.

259
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,885
Why did you come back so soon?

260
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,735
What's going on, child?

261
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,435
I'm worried about you, mother.

262
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,885
Don't worry about me.

263
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,685
I'm fine.

264
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,110
Cousin invited me to a charitable event.

265
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:44,760
Go ahead, child.

266
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:47,935
But what if anything happens to you...

267
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:53,460
I have three children.
Your brothers will visit me.

268
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,360
Don't overthink, child.

269
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:02,160
I'm fine.

270
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,960
The examination result is out.

271
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,135
How's the result?

272
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,860
The professor is coming here to talk to you.

273
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:14,885
I was too excited, so I came to tell you first.

274
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:22,485
Your son is here as well.

275
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:25,610
The examination result is out.

276
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,335
Turns out the tumor is just a normal cyst.

277
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:36,860
Thank you, doctor.

278
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,935
You may be discharged tomorrow.

279
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:42,310
I will arrange an appointment
of the cyst removal for you.

280
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,810
You may be at ease now.

281
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,135
I shall not disturb your rest then.

282
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:48,285
Just call for the nurses when you have any need.

283
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:49,335
Okay.

284
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,235
Thank you, doctor.

285
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,360
Thank you, doctor.

286
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:53,310
Thank you.

287
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:57,135
I told you I'm fine.

288
00:21:57,135 --> 00:21:58,460
I told you not to worry.

289
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:04,210
I'm happy for you too, auntie.

290
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:07,060
Thank you, Doctor Thara.

291
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,885
I'll leave now.

292
00:22:09,135 --> 00:22:09,610
Okay.

293
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:15,910
Mother, I'll be back soon.

294
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:16,635
Okay.

295
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,960
Brother Doctor.

296
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:28,360
Yes?

297
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,110
Thank you.

298
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,635
What for?

299
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,685
I didn't do anything.

300
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:41,185
Thank you for caring for my mother so well.

301
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,560
That's just my duty.

302
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:49,585
I told my mother about the charitable event.

303
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:52,135
Now that my mother is getting better,

304
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,360
I think I can go.

305
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,285
Do you have time to go?

306
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,335
Hmmm...

307
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,610
I...

308
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:05,310
I'm not too sure.

309
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,585
What's wrong?

310
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,785
But I would like you to go.

311
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,035
I mean

312
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:16,681
I don't have any friend to go there.

313
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:19,110
It'll be good if you can come along.

314
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:23,685
Then I'll let you know if I can make it.

315
00:23:25,385 --> 00:23:26,085
I'll leave now.

316
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,560
Brother Doctor.

317
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:31,685
Let me know at once if you can make it.

318
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,110
Hey, what are you doing?

319
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,760
Calm down.

320
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:19,185
Stop barking. Hold on. Calm down.

321
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,460
I'll help you.

322
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,185
Senior King.

323
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,310
Senior King.

324
00:24:56,785 --> 00:24:57,610
Senior King.

325
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,685
Senior King.

326
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,310
Senior King.

327
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,335
I dreamed that I was stitched.

328
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,885
You weren't dreaming.

329
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,410
How could you let them stitch me?

330
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:45,035
I'm afraid of needles.

331
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:46,910
I know.

332
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:57,460
Don't move.

333
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:17,585
You can't join the charitable event.

334
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,060
Hey, I have to go no matter what.

335
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:21,685
I promised my grandmother

336
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,710
to visit her after the event.

337
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,935
But your wound...

338
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:29,760
Okay, I'll take medicine after a meal.

339
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,135
I'll sleep at 8 p.m. sharp. I'll be fine tomorrow.

340
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:42,610
Thank you.

341
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:58,335
When did you start getting tattoos?

342
00:28:01,785 --> 00:28:02,435
At third grade in high school.

343
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:09,135
It's beautiful.

344
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,235
Why did you get this tattoo?

345
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,235
This is a dream catcher to chase away nightmares.

346
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,035
Have you had nightmares before?

347
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,785
Do you still have nightmares
after getting the tattoo?

348
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:38,785
It's okay.

349
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:42,010
I have had nightmares as well.

350
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:44,810

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,210
What's up?

372
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,935
Today is the last day you should give me flowers.

373
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:55,135
I thought there will be a surprise
like a rain of roses.

374
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,660
I'm not that romantic.

375
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:01,785
But I have something for you.

376
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,060
This.

377
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,585
I want the last flower to be the most special one.

378
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,110
So you can keep it forever.

379
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:43,010
If you don't have to send me flowers,

380
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,285
would you still come to see me every morning?

381
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,210
No.

382
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,935
But I'll see you every noon or afternoon.

383
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,710
Duen, have I told you?

384
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,760
You're incredibly cute.

385
00:32:16,825 --> 00:32:18,775
I know I'm cute. Why did you compliment me?

386
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,285
You have hit me so hard.

387
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:36,664
♪Having you is like having the whole world♪

388
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,975
♪Your love filled my heart♪

389
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:44,588
Fellow juniors, those who
join the charitable event,

390
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,551
[Two days later]

391
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:47,098
if you're ready,

392
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,111
put your belongings on the bus.

393
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:49,816
Okay, senior.

394
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:51,007
Get in.

395
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,487
As for the girls, I can help you
carry your belongings.

396
00:32:58,608 --> 00:32:59,195
What's going on?

397
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:01,645
Hurry, we're going to be late.

398
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,289
Hey, look.

399
00:33:03,658 --> 00:33:06,728
They came together in a couple outfit.

400
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,492
I wonder if their underpants
are in the same color.

401
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:11,410
Hurry up.

402
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,178
Brothers.

403
00:33:14,665 --> 00:33:15,671
Is our team complete?

404
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:18,759
Ram is still missing. He should be here soon.

405
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,228
Why is that girl standing among handsome boys?

406
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,762
That's right. So annoying.

407
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:28,222
There are only a few boys around.

408
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:30,073
Is she planning to have them all by herself?

409
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:36,040
Hey, you.

410
00:33:36,712 --> 00:33:37,819
Don't be envious of me.

411
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:39,379
Because these handsome boys

412
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:41,493
are all homosexual.

413
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:44,681
I'm the only one left.

414
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:47,987
Standing alone among them.

415
00:33:49,816 --> 00:33:51,007
Keep it up, Junior Ting Ting.

416
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,410
What's up, everyone?

417
00:33:56,795 --> 00:33:58,457
The group outfit I prepared is good, right?

418
00:33:58,591 --> 00:33:59,262
Hello, senior.

419
00:33:59,262 --> 00:34:03,423
It's quite cool. But you look like a folk dancer.

420
00:34:04,547 --> 00:34:07,651
What folk dancer? This is a boy band.

421
00:34:08,104 --> 00:34:11,661
But our team has Junior Ting Ting now.

422
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:15,436
What should we do then?
Let me come up with a new name.

423
00:34:17,953 --> 00:34:18,758
What should it be?

424
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:22,768
Forget about it. You'll ruin everything.

425
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,594
It won't be mistaken this time.

426
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,037
Don't worry.

427
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,483
Let's call it Tamueng Ting.

428
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:34,631
How about it?

429
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:37,047
You don't get it, right?

430
00:34:37,097 --> 00:34:40,932
I combined Tang, Tee, Bohn, Mek, Boss

431
00:34:40,932 --> 00:34:43,658
Ting, Ram, King, Phu and Duen together.

432
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,017
Let's call it Tamueng Ting.

433
00:34:46,023 --> 00:34:46,460
How about it?

434
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,329
I shouldn't have any expectation for you.

435
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:52,651
Hey, isn't that good?

436
00:34:55,453 --> 00:34:56,695
See you on the bus, senior.

437
00:34:57,332 --> 00:34:58,607
The name sounds good.

438
00:34:58,607 --> 00:34:59,799
Don't you think the name is good?

439
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:00,688
Good, isn't it?

440
00:35:01,174 --> 00:35:03,154
Why don't we use this name I just figured?

441
00:35:03,926 --> 00:35:04,815
Ping Buenrabom.

442
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:06,611
Hey, isn't that good?

443
00:35:10,755 --> 00:35:11,728
Oh, Brother Thara.

444
00:35:12,483 --> 00:35:14,547
You came eventually.

445
00:35:14,832 --> 00:35:17,064
Yes. I'm excited.

446
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:19,463
My first time leaving Bangkok.

447
00:35:21,644 --> 00:35:22,399
Hold on, brother.

448
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:24,765
Haven't you left Bangkok many times?

449
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:26,795
I mean Cupcake.

450
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:28,691
This is my first time taking it out
for a distant trip.

451
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:32,903
Look.

452
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:36,542
Greet Brother Duen.

453
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:37,936
Greet the brothers.

454
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:38,389
Hello.

455
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:40,403
Is it cute?

456
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:41,342
It's quite cute.

457
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:44,681
I'll go first, brother.

458
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:47,332
Hold on. Don't you want to talk more?

459
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:48,674
What about you?

460
00:35:49,211 --> 00:35:50,017
No need, senior.

461
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:51,174
Let's get on the bus.

462
00:35:53,188 --> 00:35:54,530
Let's go to have fun.

463
00:35:58,003 --> 00:35:59,043
Alright, everyone.

464
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:00,755
The bus is departing soon.

465
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,104
Those who're ready, get on the bus.

466
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:04,379
Hurry up.

467
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:13,691
Bohn, Duen, Mek, Boss, Ting Ting, Tang, Phu.

468
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:15,402
Everyone is here.

469
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:20,184
But it sounds like someone is missing.

470
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:30,570
Hello.

471
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,416
Hello. Where are you?

472
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:34,547
In dorm. What's up?

473
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:35,956
How dare you say that?

474
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:37,953
The bus is departing soon. Hurry here.

475
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,473
Hey!

476
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:41,191
Wait for me.

477
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:41,929
I'll be there soon.

478
00:36:44,983 --> 00:36:47,147
Cool Boy, the bus is departing.

479
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:48,693
Cool Boy, get up.

480
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:52,164
Why are you in gaze? Hurry to shower.

481
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:52,852
The bus is departing.

482
00:36:55,503 --> 00:36:57,231
Hurry up. Let's shower together.

483
00:36:57,231 --> 00:36:58,070
Lest we won't make it.

484
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:05,033
Bohn, can I sit by the window?

485
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:05,486
Sure.

486
00:37:06,644 --> 00:37:07,382
You want to see the view?

487
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:09,161
Yes, let's change.

488
00:37:16,308 --> 00:37:16,946
Are you excited?

489
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:18,020
Of course.

490
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:19,865
But not because of the activity.

491
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:20,939
It's because I'm going with you.

492
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,634
Wow, it's so exciting.

493
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:29,345
Sorry.

494
00:37:29,983 --> 00:37:30,956
What did you say just now?

495
00:37:31,308 --> 00:37:33,103
I was listening to.

496
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:34,362
Forget about it.

497
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,999
Sorry. Is anyone sitting here?

498
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,795
No.

499
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:49,815
Oh, Brother Doctor.

500
00:37:51,677 --> 00:37:54,077
Great. I can sit with someone I know.

501
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:55,486
Have you been here for long?

502
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:56,275
Quite a while.

503
00:38:02,332 --> 00:38:03,540
Hello.

504
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:06,023
Hello.

505
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:06,879
Are you wide awake?

506
00:38:07,113 --> 00:38:09,060
Yes.

507
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,570
You sound feeble.

508
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:11,694
Once again.

509
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:13,271
Are you awake?

510
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:14,983
Yes.

511
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,509
Before we depart,

512
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:20,805
let me tell you roughly about the itinerary.

513
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:23,808
The journey takes three days in total.

514
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:27,617
It'll probably be afternoon
when we arrive at the destination.

515
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,217
Everyone may first rest freely.

516
00:38:30,956 --> 00:38:31,996
As for the next day,

517
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:34,848
we'll plant trees together.

518
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:36,140
On the last day,

519
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:38,657
we'll camp on the mountain at night.

520
00:38:40,368 --> 00:38:40,922
Awesome.

521
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,670
The bus will start driving soon.

522
00:38:46,442 --> 00:38:47,801
However...

523
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,006
Our happy journey will start soon.

524
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:52,197
Hold on a second.

525
00:38:57,449 --> 00:38:58,674
Exciting, right?

526
00:38:58,674 --> 00:38:59,529
Hey, I'm here.

527
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,298
Ram. Ram is here.

528
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:04,093
Oh, here you are.

529
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:07,013
Everyone is here.

530
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:09,513
Sir, please be ready to go.

531
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:10,419
Start driving, sir.

532
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:12,617
Great.

533
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:13,825
Sorry for being late.

534
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:14,781
It's okay.

535
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,677
What happened to your head?

536
00:39:17,214 --> 00:39:20,150
Oh, last night I hit my head

537
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,482
at the corner of a table.

538
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:23,120
Really?

539
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:27,751
You two came together?

540
00:39:28,556 --> 00:39:29,747
Were you two together last night?

541
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:32,063
I bumped into him at the school entrance.

542
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,110
Oh, really?

543
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:34,781
Is it, Cool Boy?

544
00:39:35,368 --> 00:39:37,163
I shall pretend that I believe you.

545
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:39,949
Go ahead and sit there. I kept the seats for you.

546
00:39:40,452 --> 00:39:40,754
Go.

547
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:41,325
Where?

548
00:39:41,408 --> 00:39:42,583
There. Go.

549
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:45,083
You came together.

550
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,231
Hello.

551
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:48,858
You're so slow.

552
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,002
Everyone, we'll depart now.

553
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:57,835
Let's go, sir.

554
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:21,291
Do you want it?

555
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:23,371
No.

556
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:33,120
Is it that yummy?
You're eating like a child.

557
00:40:49,428 --> 00:40:50,502
The view is so beautiful.

558
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:54,378
What's so beautiful?

559
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:57,130
We haven't even left the city. It's just buildings.

560
00:40:57,448 --> 00:40:58,774
I haven't come to this area before.

561
00:40:59,697 --> 00:41:00,905
Can't I be a little excited?

562
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:02,163
What's there to be excited about?

563
00:41:03,656 --> 00:41:04,932
Haven't your family taken you out before?

564
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:07,616
They have. But I didn't go with them.

565
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:08,875
Because I had to take exams,

566
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:09,848
to be a doctor.

567
00:41:14,663 --> 00:41:15,804
Here, let me take photos of you.

568
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,878
Okay.

569
00:41:17,985 --> 00:41:18,556
Thanks.

570
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:24,428
Hold on. Take a good one.

571
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:25,586
Take it back then.

572
00:41:25,972 --> 00:41:26,643
I will edit it.

573
00:41:27,264 --> 00:41:28,220
I will edit it.

574
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,898
What are you looking for?

575
00:41:35,351 --> 00:41:37,968
The snacks I bought yesterday.
Did you see it?

576
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:42,566
I saw that you left it this morning.

577
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:43,405
So I took it for you.

578
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,116
Why is my hubby so cute?

579
00:41:51,022 --> 00:41:52,096
Let me kiss you, okay?

580
00:41:52,398 --> 00:41:53,153
Let me kiss you.

581
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:56,384
You're really...

582
00:42:01,307 --> 00:42:02,045
What's going on?

583
00:42:03,673 --> 00:42:04,764
I'm having a little motion-sickness.

584
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:05,988
But it's not so bad.

585
00:42:16,106 --> 00:42:16,710
Thank you.

586
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:26,794
Give me your hand.

587
00:42:29,025 --> 00:42:29,797
What for?

588
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:31,005
Just give it to me.

589
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,780
I read a magazine once.

590
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,576

I can't take it anymore.

620
00:45:09,948 --> 00:45:11,575
The boys around me are being intimate.

621
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:13,941
As a single woman, I have no foothold.

622
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:15,317

But go until the bus stops.

628
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,484
Sit first. Calm down.

629
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:34,914
This bus is weird.

630
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,573

00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:00,048
Why do you want it?

636
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:02,084
I want to change your Facebook settings

637
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:02,967
to "in a relationship" with me.

638
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:04,629
Are you fooling around with me?

639
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:08,051
I'm not.

640
00:46:09,327 --> 00:46:11,541
I'm serious.

641
00:46:12,447 --> 00:46:13,521
What serious?

642
00:46:14,477 --> 00:46:17,749
The whole school knows about our relationship.

643
00:46:18,135 --> 00:46:19,242
Why change the settings?

644
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:21,441
That's different.

645
00:46:24,712 --> 00:46:25,769
How should I tell you?

646
00:46:26,877 --> 00:46:27,716
All these while,

647
00:46:28,773 --> 00:46:30,165
I haven't done this to anyone.

648
00:46:31,843 --> 00:46:32,682
But I want to do this with you.

649

[Special Scene]

650
00:47:01,222 --> 00:47:02,749
But if you really want to vomit,

651
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,175
I have a plastic bag.

652
00:47:06,004 --> 00:47:06,843
Let me demonstrate,

653
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:10,014
how to puke correctly on a bus.

654
00:47:10,652 --> 00:47:11,323
First step,

655
00:47:11,323 --> 00:47:12,934
you have to open the bag.

656
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,769
Then hang it on your ears.

657
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:16,424
Like this.

658
00:47:17,162 --> 00:47:18,823
Then pull it down a little, so you can see.

659
00:47:19,528 --> 00:47:22,262
After this step, you have to take a deep breath.

660
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,897
Afterwards,

661
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:27,128
if the elderly or children are present,

662
00:47:27,128 --> 00:47:30,249
you have to wear your bag first for safety.

663
00:47:30,249 --> 00:47:31,793
Then, hold the side of the bag tight.

664
00:47:32,598 --> 00:47:33,357
You must hold it tight,

665
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:36,122
so your vomit wouldn't spill on others.

666
00:47:36,507 --> 00:47:37,044
Then you shall...

667
00:47:42,078 --> 00:47:42,900
Brother Doctor.

668
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,058
Are you okay?

669
00:47:46,373 --> 00:47:48,068
I think I have been acting too seriously.

670
00:47:48,705 --> 00:47:49,997
But I want to show you
the steps clearly.

671
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,172
Do you want to try?

672
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:53,655
It's okay. I don't want to vomit.

673
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:54,712
Don't you want to try?

674
00:47:54,846 --> 00:47:55,383
No need.

675
00:47:56,776 --> 00:47:57,330
Alright then.

676
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:58,085
Take some rest.

677
00:47:59,007 --> 00:47:59,897
Call me if there's anything.

678
00:47:59,897 --> 00:48:00,853
Okay.

679
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,175
I have two plastic bags.

680
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:03,672
For emergency.
