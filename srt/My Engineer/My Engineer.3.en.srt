[My Engineer]
[Episode 3]

2
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,975
Let's go.

3
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,975
Senior, please don't use my friend again.

4
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:09,250
Hey, wait.

5
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:11,400
Duen is drunk.

6
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,900
I came with a car.
I'll send him back.

7
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:15,125
That's alright.

8
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,075
We can go back on our own.

9
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:20,225
I insist.

10
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:22,085
Who are you to him?

11
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,150
Let's go.

12
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,125
What's your relationship with that junior?

13
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,025
What?

14
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,975
Calm down.

15
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:42,175
I'm only asking about your relationship
with the junior from Medical College.

16
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,025
Because the matter of you two is now
on the school's intranet.

17
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:47,497
[Medical student gave
engineering student a flower.]

18
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:52,250
Where?

19
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:55,775
Medical student gave
engineering student a flower.

20
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,850
They have uniforms, gears and wife.

21
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:01,500
I was just fooling around with him.

22
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,700
He started it first.

23
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,250
Besides, it's fun to tease...

24
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,475
a silly person like him.

25
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,275
But a playboy like you wouldn't
be misunderstood by girls.

26
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,650
That's true. Just like two days ago in the bar.

27
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:20,575
You and that junior behaved like a couple.

28
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,725
Hey, hold on.

29
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,501
Would it be like a drama series?

30
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,575
After fooling around,

31
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,300
they may realize that...

32
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,050
they love each other.

33
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,850
Hey.

34
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,975
As far as I know,

35
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,102
there are only two reasons...

36
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,200
when two tease each other.

37
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:40,406
It's either love...

38
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:41,550
or hate.

39
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,825
But to someone like Bohn,

40
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,875
it should be hate, right?

41
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,800
That's right.

42
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,050
If it's because of love,

43
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:51,522
in order to hide the love,

44
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,750
he'll keep annoying the other with sharp tongue.

45
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,975
Bohn likes to annoy the junior...

46
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:58,000
with his sharp tongue as well?

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,825
That's right.

48
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:02,775
He even likes to order others around
to attract attention.

49
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,625
Hmm.

50
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,925
Bohn likes to order the junior around as well.

51
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:07,625
That's right.

52
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,025
Most importantly, when he is asked about
the relationship between them,

53
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,375
he always refuses to answer.

54
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:15,725
Bohn is stubborn.

55
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:17,625
That's enough.

56
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,325
I don't like him.

57
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:23,325
If you don't believe it,

58
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,700
I will call him to stop sending me flowers.

59
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,850
Hello, Roach. I have something to tell you.

60
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,300
Hey. See me at the backyard of the school now.

61
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,925
Duen. Duen.

62
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,625
Duen.

63
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:06,150
Hello. What's going on?

64
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,300
Look. A new florist.

65
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:11,975
From now on, I don't have to...

66
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:13,900
walk far to buy you flowers.

67
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:16,175
That's the shop.

68
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,250
What?

69
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,600
Let's check it out.

70
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,850
Wow, it's beautiful.

71
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:37,125
These are artificial flowers.

72
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,475
When I look at them from outside, they look real.

73
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:45,875
They didn't look fake.

74
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,700
Hi.

75
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:57,850
Hi.

76
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:58,750
How can I help you?

77
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,750
I'll have a look around.

78
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,700
Okay. Do have a look.

79
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:05,050
Let me know if I can help.
I'll be tidying up back there.

80
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,629
Okay. Thank you.

81
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:07,150
Alright.

82
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,425
Choose whatever flower you like.

83
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:20,850
Duen.

84
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:23,412
I would like to say...

85
00:06:23,412 --> 00:06:26,125
Look at these two. Which do you prefer?

86
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,975
The blue one.

87
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:38,400
Listen to me first.

88
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:39,500
I would like to tell you...

89
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,525
What about these two?

90
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:48,000
The yellow one.

91
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:54,750
I would like to tell you...

92
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:57,250
Wow, it's white. Do you like it?

93
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,800
Buy whatever you want.

94
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,425
It's good enough if it's from you.

95
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,675
You...

96
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,675
What you mean is...

97
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:21,025
you're happy as long as I give you flowers?

98
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:22,375
Because you can tease me.

99
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,225
Bastard.

100
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,625
Think whatever you want.

101
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,200
I would like to tell you...

102
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,675
to stop giving me flowers.

103
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,175
So cute.

104
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,800
So chubby.

105
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,775
I'll call you gas tank.

106
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:05,775
Were you taking a photo of me?

107
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,500
What? Are you crazy?

108
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,450
Narcissistic.

109
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:12,925
Whatever.

110
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,375
Hold on. But you wanted to tell me something.

111
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,050
That was...

112
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,050
Don't give me flowers at Gears Statue tomorrow.

113
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:41,000
Teacher is calling roll. Hurry.

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,575
Really?

115
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:44,125
Yes. He's calling roll.

116
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,575
Bohn.

117
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:51,300
Aren't you waiting for flowers
from your junior today?

118
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,825
No. I told him yesterday to stop giving me flowers.

119
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,625
So you wouldn't make fun of me.

120
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,350
Hey, where are you going?

121
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:07,825
The classroom is there.

122
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,700
I know.

123
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,550
I'm going to the toilet.

124
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:13,150
Do you have any problem?

125
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,525
You always go to the toilet
before the class starts.

126
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,175
I think I want to pee as well.

127
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,125
Lazy people excrete more.

128
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,250
Why are we meeting at the backdoor
instead of Gears Statue?

129
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,675
Or are you shy?

130
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,975
Who's shy? I'm not.

131
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:46,700
I just want a change in surroundings.

132
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:56,200
You're not shy?

133
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:58,325
Why did you put the flower in your bag then?

134
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,175
Or else it'll be wilted by the wind.

135
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,425
Don't ask so much, okay?

136
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:07,475
Oh, no.

137
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:28,800
What's wrong with you?

138
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,550
My clothes are dirty now.

139
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:35,325
I wasn't focusing.

140
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,050
When there's nothing else, leave.

141
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,925
Just leave.

142
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,600
Are you chasing me away?

143
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,925
Leave. Go wherever you want.

144
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:48,550
Is it possible?

145
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,925
Your father is here.

146
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,500
Who is this?

147
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,050
Oh, Bohn.

148
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,525
What's the scent?

149
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,375
Did you smell it?

150
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:04,125
Yes.

151
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:04,825
It smells like...

152
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:07,925
flowers.

153
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,650
It should be rose.

154
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,475
Red.

155
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,525
Something's wrong with your nose.

156
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,275
There's no scent of rose.

157
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,325
Right.

158
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,000
I told him not to give me flowers anymore.

159
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,600
It's good to stop tangling with the junior.

160
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:29,250
Why?

161
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,500
A while ago, I saw that he was having a lot of fun...

162
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,050
with your opponent, Frong.

163
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:41,325
Wow. Love triangle.

164
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,100
Gay love triangle.

165
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,900
Today, we'll revise the law of gravitation.

166
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,450
Who remembers the law of gravitation of Newton?

167
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:10,800
Every creature on earth
is attracted to each other.

168
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:13,150
In short, when this creature is human,

169
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,650
this mutual attraction is called predestined.

170
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,350
Lastly, according to the third law
of Newton, this mutual attraction...

171
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,700
will have equal applied force and counter force.

172
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:34,125
When two people look into eyes of each other.

173
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:36,425
Stop!

174
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:45,275
I will apply for a day off.

175
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:46,700
I don't feel so well today.

176
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:49,575
Oh.

177
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,525
What's going on with him?

178
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,775
Hello, mother.

179
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,050
Hello, son.

180
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,300
Are you in class?

181
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,125
No. I'm heading home.

182
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:19,525
Great. I need your help urgently.

183
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:21,225
What's up?

184
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,200
Hey. I'm here.

185
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:28,200
I thought you're skipping the morning class.

186
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,050
I woke up late.

187
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,200
Did you get up late or were you
sending someone flower?

188
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,675
This...

189
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:41,575
Did all of you see it?

190
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:42,500
Yes!

191
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,600
Be honest. Or we'll force you to answer.

192
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:50,325
Why do you send the senior flowers every morning?

193
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,300
It's...

194
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,725
It's a long story. I'll summarize it.

195
00:13:58,925 --> 00:13:59,825
It's...

196
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,200
Senior punished me.

197
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,775
He wants me to give him flowers
at Gears Statue every day for a month.

198
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:09,100
I think he has gone too far.

199
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:10,575
Calm down, Ram.

200
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:13,250
I have promised him.
I have to do it no matter what.

201
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:14,200
Just calm down.

202
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,875
We shall carry on with our reports.

203
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,250
I have to pick up my sister in the afternoon.

204
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,125
I shall look for information.

205
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,350
Calm down, Ram.

206
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,650
I want to help him with the books.

207
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,850
Okay.

208
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:47,825
I'm so hungry.

209
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,925
Hey, everyone.

210
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,775
Let's go eat something.

211
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,025
No. I'm going to the library.

212
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,150
As for me, I have a date.

213
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,575
Sorry. Bye.

214
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,425
Okay, get lost. You two...

215
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:03,950
I'll go eat with my hubby.

216
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:07,375
Hubby?

217
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,900
Let's do something fun.

218
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,425
Did a girl text you again?

219
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:19,850
Oh, no.

220
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:20,875
You...

221
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:22,200
How did you know?

222
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,475
I could tell from your happy expression.

223
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,275
Who?

224
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,300
Do you remember we went
to Nang's birthday party?

225
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,350
Her friend added me on Line.

226
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:32,950
She's asking me out for a meal.

227
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:37,200
Is it good like that?

228
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:38,925
Bohn and Nang had a fight not long ago.

229
00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:41,325
But we're getting along well.

230
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,575
She invited me.

231
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,675
It'll be impolite to reject her.

232
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,975
We shall...

233
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,125
have fun later.

234
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:52,975
I'm so sorry.

235
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,275
Bye-bye, friend.

236
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,250
I shall go now.

237
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:58,575
I'll compensate you in the future.

238
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,550
Bye.

239
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,750
Father, you're back.

240
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,375
Yes, I'm so tired.

241
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,550
Give me a hug.

242
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,700
I'm still tired. Can you kiss my tiredness away?

243
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,300
No. Brother Duen doesn't allow you to kiss me.

244
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:38,225
But we're acting as father and mother.
Of course, we can kiss.

245
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,275
Really?

246
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:42,875
Hold on, you Kuman.

247
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,800
Daonua, let's go back.

248
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:47,025
Don't play with him anymore.

249
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,750
Can I play with Ben for a little while?

250
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,375
Coincidentally, his brother
is picking him up today.

251
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:53,675
But he'll come later.

252
00:16:53,775 --> 00:16:54,650
Brother?

253
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,150
Okay. His brother should give him
a lesson as well.

254
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,525
How could he let his brother do this?

255
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,850
Terrible.

256
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,100
Hi, bro.

257
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:17,675
Excuse me...

258
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,925
for inviting you so suddenly.

259
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,650
Coincidentally, my friends
don't have time to eat with me today.

260
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,175
You can ask me out anytime.

261
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:27,750
I always have time.

262
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,325
But may I ask you something?

263
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,800
I heard you have a boyfriend.
Is it true?

264
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,875
Why don't you ask him to eat with you?

265
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,500
That...

266
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,275
I broke up with him.

267
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, really?

268
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,600
He doesn't have time for me.

270
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,150
Whenever I ask him out, he always says
that he doesn't have time.

271
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,225
Are all men like that?

272
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:51,125
Of course not.

273
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,000
There's a good man here,

274
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,900
who's always ready for you.

275
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,825
You have to give him a chance.

276
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:19,875
I want to take a photo for Instagram.

277
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:21,525
Boss, please hold this for me.

278
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,275
No problem.

279
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,225
Here, I'll help you.

280
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,850
It's beautiful.

281
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,475
You're good in posing. Thank you.

282
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,550
Seeing you smile,

283
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:37,850
I'm happy as well.

284
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:41,775
Ging, the chicken breast meat has to be marinated.

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,307
Someone who's crossed in love
has to have someone new.

286
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,625
Let's eat, okay?

287
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,650
Okay.

288
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:00,675
Bohn, your brother is a foreign Kuman.

289
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,975
So what?

290
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,725
My aunt married a foreigner.

291
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:06,050
I don't know what's your problem.

292
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,750
No wonder his personality
is as bad as his appearance.

293
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:11,500
Do you know...

294
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,775
your brother kissed my sister's cheek yesterday.

295
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:15,475
So what?

296
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,950
I can even kiss your cheek.

297
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,725
What are you talking about?

298
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't want to talk to you.

299
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,400
Daonua, let's go home.

300
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,400
Let's never get involved with them again.

301
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:32,350
How are you going back?

302
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:33,625
Should I send you?

303
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:34,675
Stop annoying me.

304
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,650
Hey.

305
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,475
Or do you have a date?

306
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,375
Why are you asking so much?

307
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,275
Are you my boyfriend?

308
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,225
You're not even my friend.

309
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,200
Stop annoying me.

310
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,375
Here, Daonua.

311
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:54,275
Let's go home.

312
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:07,475
You kissed a boy before?

313
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,000
Their cakes are quite good.

314
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:21,000
Are we coming here to eat again?

315
00:20:21,175 --> 00:20:24,075
Again? That means we'll meet again?

316
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,925
Yes, but...

317
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,550
It's okay if you have a date
with someone else.

318
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,600
Not at all.

319
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,825
Even if I have,

320
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,850
I would come to eat you...

321
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,200
I mean eat cakes.

322
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:42,950
Ging.

323
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:54,650
Who is this ugly guy?

324
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,100
Calm down, babe.

325
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,150
If you're looking for someone new,

326
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,350
can't you find someone
who's handsomer than him?

327
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:06,675
What are you thinking about?

328
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,875
Taking this ugly guy as your boyfriend.

329
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,050
He's not my new boyfriend.

330
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:17,125
He's a friend of my friend.
I bumped into him in the shop.

331
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,950
Then he invited me to sit with him.

332
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,975
I sat with him out of politeness.

333
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,275
What?

334
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:24,300
Hey, you ugly guy.

335
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,675
Don't you know Ging has a boyfriend?

336
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,150
Calm down, brother.

337
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,600
Ging invited me.

338
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,300
Are you slandering my girlfriend?

339
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,175
You're ugly and have bad personality.

340
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:39,225
You should get a lesson from me.

341
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,174
It hurts.

342
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,803
Babe.

343
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Which part hurts?

344
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,725
It hurts.

345
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,825
That's enough.

346
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't think they're following.

347
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,775
Why did you appear suddenly?

348
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,900
Don't blame me. I found it weird that
she's asking you out suddenly.

349
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:10,225
That's why I followed you.

350
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,075
It was just as you said.

351
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,075
She asked me out just to tease her boyfriend.

352
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,825
I'm a fool.

353
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,325
You reminded me about it before.

354
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,550
Hey.

355
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,725
I'm used to it.

356
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,325
Those people that I get closed to...

357
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:27,900
were all like that.

358
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,031
Maybe I really look like...

359
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,875
a dog.

360
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,225
My appearance is a disadvantage.
Maybe I look like a fool.

361
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:38,900
You're not a fool, Boss.

362
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,875
You're just too kind.

363
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,675
That's why they take advantage of you.

364
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,450
That woman is no good for you.

365
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,025
Sooner or later,

366
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:48,475
you'll meet someone who really loves you.

367
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,325
Trust me.

368
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:51,525
Mek.

369
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,625
My hubby's words are really touching.

370
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,975
Can you give me a hug then?

371
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,525
Nah.

372
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:01,250
Stay away from me.

373
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,900
Hey.

374
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,200
Your hand is injured.

375
00:23:07,175 --> 00:23:08,825
It must have been caused by the fight.

376
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,950
Fortunately, I have some plasters.

377
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,200
You should be more careful next time.

378
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:16,675
Give me your hand.

379
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:25,725
Your hand is bleeding.

380
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,475
What are you looking at?

381
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,750
Always looking at me.

382
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,275
Here you go.

383
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:48,875
Take them.

384
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,700
You can use them tomorrow.

385
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,050
Take them.

386
00:23:53,425 --> 00:23:55,000
I know you don't have it in your dorm.

387
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,925
Let me know when you come next time.

388
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:07,450
Why are you looking at me like that?

389
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,950
Brother Duen, the ice cream looks good.

390
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:33,675
I would like to buy you one.

391
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:35,725
But it's raining soon.

392
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,000
Let's go home.

393
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,900
Just one, Brother Duen.

394
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,250
Okay, let's go.

395
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,750
Which flavor do you want?

396
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:51,375
Let's have a look.

397
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:51,775
Let's go.

398
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,450
The shop is full.

399
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,300
Let's eat next time.

400
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,850
But I really want an ice cream.

401
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:15,575
Let's have it next time. There's no seat.

402
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:16,675
Okay?

403
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:18,500
Let's go home.

404
00:25:22,475 --> 00:25:23,125
Duen.

405
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,950
You may sit with me.

406
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,875
Is it yummy?

407
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:38,575
Open your mouth.

408
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:43,725
Yummy?

409
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,525
Is this brother your friend?

410
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,825
Not really.

411
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,850
But this brother saved me.

412
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,325
That's how we met.

413
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,150
What's his name then?

414
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:04,925
I'm Duen. What's your name?

415
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:09,900
Yim.

416
00:26:11,575 --> 00:26:12,925
That's a nice name.

417
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,175
Thank you for your compliment.
What's your name?

418
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,075
I'm Daonua.

419
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:21,225
Daonua is a nice name.

420
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,400
Do you like animation?

421
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,375
Yes. Do you know about it as well?

422
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:33,000
Of course. I have many toys at home.

423
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,950
If you have time,

424
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,225
come and play at my place.

425
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,550
Senior, what do you want?

426
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,025
Are you flirting with my sister?

427
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:44,525
You have misunderstood.

428
00:26:44,675 --> 00:26:47,625
Even if I'm, your sister wouldn't be the object.

429
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,250
Whatever.

430
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,575
Why do you always smile when you talk to me?

431
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,075
Oh, didn't you say that my name is Yim?
[Yim means smile in Thai]

432
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,704
I'll ask you seriously.

433
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:04,325
Did you forget my name
or were you teasing me?

434
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,825
Senior, when you told me your name,

435
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,575
a car coincidentally passed by, so I didn't hear it.

436
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:13,775
What's your name? Tell me.
So I can address you properly.

437
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:15,775
My name is...

438
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,900
Forget about it. Just call me like that.

439
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,650
Only the three of us know my name.

440
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,225
Right?

441
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:23,975
What, Senior?

442
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,650
Why are you making this complicated?

443
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,625
Okay, as you like. You're called Yim.

444
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,700
Call me Senior.

445
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,150
I'm a sophomore.

446
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,975
Okay, Senior Yim.

447
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,250
Junior Duen.

448
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,600
It's sour.

449
00:27:53,425 --> 00:27:54,450
Are you taking photos of me secretly?

450
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,425
No.

451
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,625
I'm taking it openly.

452
00:27:58,625 --> 00:27:59,800
Show it to me, Senior.

453
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,250
Why? You're afraid it may look ugly?

454
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,950
Alright, fine.

455
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:07,575
I can delete it for you.

456
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,800
Are you in a hurry to go back?

457
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,075
I want to ask for your favor.

458
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,425
Ask for my favor?

459
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:39,250
Looking for a water container?

460
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:44,900
Here you go.

461
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:53,800
Are you feeding the cats?

462
00:29:57,025 --> 00:29:58,175
Are you a freshman?

463
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,875
You look foreign.

464
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:04,200
Why are you ignoring me?

465
00:30:04,825 --> 00:30:07,400
You look like a mixed-blood.
Are you an exchange?

466
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,525
Can you speak Thai?

467
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,850
Hello. What's your name?

468
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,575
Where are you from?

469
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:16,175
Bonjour.

470
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:17,300
Konichiwa.

471
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,025
Anyeong.

472
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,050
I'm afraid of dogs.

473
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,250
I thought it was for cats.

474
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:27,950
Take it away.

475
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,100
Eat slowly.

476
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,700
You can speak Thai.

477
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,050
Why didn't you answer me?

478
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:35,100
Where are you going?

479
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,350
Take the dog along.

480
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:38,100
Hold on.

481
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,200
You!

482
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,200
Hey!

483
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:53,200
Excuse me.

484
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:55,550
Please choose one for me.

485
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:57,850
Because I'm bad in choosing clothes.

486
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,525
Choose for me.

487
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,575
Senior, are you serious?

488
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,225
But I have to tell you.

489
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:04,750
I'm insensitive to fashion as well.

490
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:09,275
It's okay. Anything you choose will be fine.

491
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,225
Alright.

492
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,050
But I have to tell you.

493
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,850
Don't regret it in the future.

494
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,025
This one, Senior.

495
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,475
This one.

496
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:39,350
Why did you choose this?

497
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:41,125
Because I think it looks good.

498
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,125
Besides, they're cheap.

499
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,275
But I don't think you like it, right?

500
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,000
Then I shall put it back.

501
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,300
It's okay.

502
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,400
Let's take this.

503
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,675
Senior.

504
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,075
Don't take it reluctantly.

505
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,925
I'm not reluctant.

506
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,650
I really want it.

507
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,725
I can wear it during the break.

508
00:31:58,825 --> 00:31:59,500
Really?

509
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:03,325
Then I'll buy one as well.

510
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:04,825
So I can wear it with you.

511
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,350
So others will not only stare at you.

512
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:09,775
I think more people will stare.

513
00:32:10,325 --> 00:32:12,100
Oh, that's right.

514
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:16,350
But I can't have you feel embarrassed alone.

515
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,250
I'll take one as well.

516
00:32:18,475 --> 00:32:18,950
Hold this.

517
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:37,850
Senior, who are you to him?

518
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:40,925
Are you my boyfriend?
You're not even my friend.

519
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,925
Stop irritating me.

520
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,800
A while ago, someone saw that he was with Frong.

521
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,450
Traffic jam. Are we there yet?
My stomach aches.

522
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,925
I can't hold it in any longer.

523
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,400
Bohn.

524
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,782
Mek said the Medical College junior
is with Frong.

525
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,300
It's true.

526
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,850
[Taking him for ice cream.]

527
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,625
Hey, where are you going?

528
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,700
It looks like it's going to rain.

529
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:34,075
There's no taxi.

530
00:33:39,825 --> 00:33:42,800
What a coincidence.

531
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:43,750
We meet again.

532
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,325
Get in.

533
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,325
Why are you here?

534
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:47,250
Hurry up.

535
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,375
It's going to rain. Get in.

536
00:33:53,425 --> 00:33:55,000
Didn't you see the cars are waiting?

537
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,925
How did you know I'm here?

538
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,700
It's fate which brought me here
to see you waiting like a dog.

539
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:06,125
I wouldn't believe that.

540
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:09,275
A psychopath like you
must have been following me.

541
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,550
Brother Duen, I'm hungry.

542
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,450
Hold on. We'll be home soon.

543
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,275
I'll cook for you as soon as we're home.

544
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,025
But it takes a while until you reach home.

545
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,358
Didn't you just buy something?

546
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,300
Do you want to cook in my condo?

547
00:34:30,725 --> 00:34:31,800
It's nearby.

548
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,875
Dream on.

549
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,725
Can't you cook?

550
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:39,300
My brother cooks very well.

551
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,350
Even my mother praises him.

552
00:34:42,175 --> 00:34:42,825
That's right.

553
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,575
I'm hungrier as I speak.

554
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,125
Let's go home. So I can go to the toilet.

555
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:55,875
So?

556
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,800
Do you want to come to my condo?

557
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,775
Take them. You can use them tomorrow.

558
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:22,350
I know you don't have it in your dorm.

559
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,825
Are you hungry? I'll cook for you now.

560
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,325
Yes.

561
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,125
Since you're here,

562
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,550
why don't you shower in my room?

563
00:37:01,675 --> 00:37:02,675
I have clothes for you to change.

564
00:37:03,825 --> 00:37:04,475
No need.

565
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:06,350
I came here to cook for my sister.

566
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,700
I'll leave after I cook.

567
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,175
Then I shall watch TV while waiting.

568
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,825
Do you want to watch with me?

569
00:37:18,825 --> 00:37:19,250
Yes.

570
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,975
Let's go.

571
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,075
Let's watch TV.

572
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,275
Daonua.

573
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,325
Please pass me the onions.

574
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,625
Hey.

575
00:37:50,825 --> 00:37:51,875
Where's my sister?

576
00:37:53,425 --> 00:37:54,650
What are you doing?

577
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,450
Don't you want me to kiss you?

578
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,738
I mean onion. Are you crazy?
["onion" sounds like "kiss" in Thai]

579
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,050
So where did my sister go?

580
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,025
She's watching animation with Ben.

581
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:06,375
Let me help you.

582
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,425
Here.

583
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,800
What?

584
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,600
Wear it.

585
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,975
My mother bought this apron long ago.

586
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,825
It's not used.

587
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,425
Are you trying to tease me?

588
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:51,600
I'm used to wearing apron.

589
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,575
Because I always wear one at home.

590
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,825
It matches you.

591
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:02,450
I used to dream about having a partner
who's good in cooking.

592
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,100
Then go look for one.

593
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,350
Why are you telling me?

594
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,050
Here, have a try.

595
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:45,075
Do you like it?

596
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,000
Yes.

597
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,875
That's good.

598
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,775
Sit over there. Stop disturbing me.

599
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,525
No, I want to help you here.

600
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,300
Get there. The oil may spill on you.

601
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,475
Insane.

602
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:03,750
Don't try to scare me.

603
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,475
I'm not afraid.

604
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:06,950
Alright then.

605
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,625
Hey!

606
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,250
Wow.

607
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,150
Okay, I shall wait for you there.

608
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,950
Are you taking video of Brother Duen secretly?

609
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,250
No.

610
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,075
That's cute.

611
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:50,350
It's just like my father peeks
my mother while she is cooking.

612
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,350
But my mother is naked.

613
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,400
You know a lot.

614
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,150
Here.

615
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,725
Wow.

616
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,275
What is that?

617
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:07,425
It looks good.

618
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:07,800
Let me try.

619
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,525
How can you eat with hands?

620
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:11,375
Go get the cutlery.

621
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:14,025
What? I can't even have a bite?

622
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:14,850
Hurry.

623
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,075
So fierce.

624
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,200
The way you're being fierce
to Brother Bohn, is like our parents.

625
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:26,725
That's right.

626
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:27,600
Look.

627
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,400
Father just wants to try.

628
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,525
Yet mother is so fierce.

629
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,075
Who is father? Who is mother?

630
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,950
Do you want to role play?

631
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,250
Ben and I want to join as well.

632
00:41:41,525 --> 00:41:45,425
Okay. So I'll be the father,
your brother is the mother.

633
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,475
The two of you will be our children, okay?

634
00:41:48,525 --> 00:41:49,125
Okay.

635
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,600
Bohn, we'll be in trouble if they get used to it.

636
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,750
Let them be.

637
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,375
Children, let's eat then.

638
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:57,875
Here.

639
00:41:57,925 --> 00:41:58,750
Yeah.

640
00:41:58,925 --> 00:41:59,725
Here.

641
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,925
Pass me a plate.

642
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,525
Brother, can I watch animation with Ben?

643
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:21,800
She really likes Conan.

644
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,925
I have every episode of Conan movies.

645
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:28,300
Next time, Daonua.

646
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,800
We're going home soon.

647
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:33,575
How are you going back?
It's still raining.

648
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:34,925
Most importantly,

649
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,050
there's always flood downstairs when it rains.

650
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,375
The car can only be driven out tomorrow morning.

651
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:48,600
What do we do then?

652
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,375
Actually...

653
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,325
you may stay here tonight.

654
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,600
Ben and I can lend you our clothes.

655
00:42:59,675 --> 00:43:01,548
Daonua can watch animation with Ben as well.

656
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:02,316
Okay?

657
00:43:02,475 --> 00:43:04,875
Can we spend a night here? Yeah.

658
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,350
Who said I'm spending a night here?

659
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,175
Are you planning to take her for a swim?

660
00:43:10,175 --> 00:43:12,000
There are cockroaches and rats in the water.

661
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,175
Yesterday, I saw a crocodile of this size.

662
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,425
That's scary. Why don't we stay here?

663
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,175
Okay, brother? Please.

664
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:28,500
Okay.

665
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:30,575
Then we shall stay here tonight.

666
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:32,075
Awesome.

667
00:43:32,075 --> 00:43:33,900
My brother is the cutest.

668
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:39,500
Let's start with the first episode.
We shall be done the next morning.

669
00:43:41,475 --> 00:43:42,350
Let's watch it together.

670
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,100
You planned this, right?

671
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,050
I have to stay in any case.

672
00:43:54,275 --> 00:43:55,175
Hmm...

673
00:43:56,525 --> 00:43:58,375
The towel is in the bathroom,
Brother Duen.

674
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,575
Brother Ram, you came back to get your stuffs?

675
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,075
Wow.

676
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:27,500
I thought it's for the cats.

677
00:44:28,325 --> 00:44:30,050
Go away.

678
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:36,525
Why are you smiling?

679
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,000
Don't hide it from me.

680
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,200
Let me guess.

681
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,750
You must have met a funny person nearby.

682
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,300
He must have done something funny to you.

683
00:44:49,325 --> 00:44:50,474
Dogs are surely involved,

684
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,225
because you smile when you see dogs.

685
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,350
Am I right?

686
00:44:57,775 --> 00:44:58,250
Busybody.

687
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,525
Look. You're shy.

688
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:06,000
I guessed it right, right?

689
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:18,375
Hey.

690
00:45:19,725 --> 00:45:20,725
You're taking so long.

691
00:45:21,175 --> 00:45:22,075
Stop rushing, okay?

692
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,250
Could it be that you can't reach your back?

693
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,150
Do you need help with rubbing your back?

694
00:45:28,275 --> 00:45:28,925
No need.

695
00:45:50,175 --> 00:45:53,025
[Private chef. Do not disturb.]
[#BohnDuen]

696
00:46:07,475 --> 00:46:08,000
Bohn.

697
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,350
Thank you for lending me your clothes.

698
00:46:18,825 --> 00:46:19,725
You're welcome.

699
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:21,700
What are you staring at?

700
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,400
It's...

701
00:46:26,975 --> 00:46:29,300
Why did you wet my room?

702
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:31,350
Alright then.

703
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,225
Here, let me help you.

704
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,575
No need.

705
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,200
You're really overbearing.

706
00:46:55,025 --> 00:46:55,775
Are you done?

707
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:00,300
I have uniforms.

708
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,000
What are you talking about?

709
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:04,600
I have gears.

710
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,350
I know you have gears.

711
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,725
You study engineering. Of course, you have gears.

712
00:47:10,725 --> 00:47:12,125
But I don't have a wife.

713
00:47:12,275 --> 00:47:12,850
What?

714
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,100
Why are you telling me this?

715
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:18,700
As I thought,

716
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,750
a fool like you wouldn't understand.

717
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,425
Oh.

718
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,375
Why are you scolding me?

719
00:47:23,525 --> 00:47:24,875
Get to the point.

720
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,475
Why are you beating around the bush?

721
00:47:26,575 --> 00:47:27,375
Are you crazy?

722
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,875
I want to go after you.
