[Episode 8]

2
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,677
Oh, Tee.

3
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:57,940
Are you here to see King?

4
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,752
Yes, sister.

5
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,556
Hello.

6
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:02,812
Oh, Ram.

7
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:06,391
You know each other?

8
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:08,797
Oh, he's my direct junior.

9
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:12,045
Oh, my.

10
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:14,481
This world is so small. We're destined to meet.

11
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:17,789
I'll talk to him for a while.

12
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:20,256
Ram, you may first put your bicycle in the car.

13
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:32,496
King found a mixed-blood husband.
Why didn't you tell me?

14
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:34,120
Husband?

15
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:37,639
You mean Ram?

16
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:41,699
Stop kidding. They're just senior and junior.

17
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:47,925
If that is the case,
would he post their photo on Facebook?

18
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:50,842
Look at his new profile photo.

19
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:53,007
That's right.

20
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:54,271
What?

21
00:02:55,714 --> 00:02:58,060
The arm in the new profile photo is Ram's?

22
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,075
Yes. I found out by one look.

23
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:04,135
As soon as I opened the door,

24
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:09,970
they were hugging each other tightly.

25
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:20,827
They were flirting in the room.

26
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,549
Especially when he had to go.

27
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,917
No!

28
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,511
No!

29
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:37,940
No!

30
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,308
It's just like a romantic movie.

31
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:48,707
Wow.

32
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:50,030
Really?

33
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,902
Of course.

34
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:52,857
They were more attached than what I described.

35
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,992
But I should stop talking now.

36
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:56,466
I don't want to spoil my brother's reputation.

37
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:02,782
If there's any good news, update me.

38
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:04,887
Okay?

39
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:13,850
Why did I know about such a thing?

40
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,260
My brother and my direct junior

41
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:18,472
were hugging each other.

42
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:20,195
They even flirted

43
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,271
and felt sad about separation?

44
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:39,895
Oh, right. I'll collect something
at my mother's before sending you back.

45
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:41,218
It's nearby.

46
00:04:48,827 --> 00:04:51,263
I'll only say it once.

47
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,075
We're having a relationship now.

48
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,564
[Rotter Bohn]

49
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:24,406
Hello.

50
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:25,940
Hello.

51
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:28,135
Please connect me to my boyfriend.

52
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,308
Your boyfriend is asleep.
Do you want to leave a message?

53
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,489
Please tell him that I'm at home.

54
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,466
Okay, I'll pass it on to him.

55
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:43,774
Please ask him if he wants to

56
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:45,850
have a date tomorrow.

57
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,917
What? Didn't we already
have a date two days ago?

58
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:52,466
Yes, we did. But a different venue this time.

59
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,714
Besides, we were not alone last time.

60
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:57,368
Oh, okay.

61
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,015
I'll pass that on to your boyfriend.

62
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:04,195
But I can't guarantee that he'll go.

63
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:05,940
I'm sleepy now.

64
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:07,173
Goodbye.

65
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:08,827
Duen, don't hang up.

66
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:09,429
Duen.

[Duen: Wait at your boyfriend's house

68
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:50,120
Wait for me here.

69
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:51,233
I'll get you a glass of water.

71
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:48,195
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:49,639
Hold on.

73
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:51,714
What should I do now?

74
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,759
Get change.

75
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,835
Come with me. Hurry.

76
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:02,481
This is King's room.

77
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:04,857
Just choose one shirt in the wardrobe.

78
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:07,594
I'll let King know.

79
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:31,925
Ram, I told King about the T-shirt.

80
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:33,729
You may return it to him later.

81
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:43,444
Oh, right, King told me about your voice.

82
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:46,090
Sharp voice isn't a big deal. Don't be shy.

83
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:49,098
Just talk to me. I won't make fun of you.

84
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,353
Thank you for sending me back.

85
00:09:57,188 --> 00:09:58,662
Your voice isn't sharp at all.

86
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,887
Yes, I'll leave now.

87
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:06,421
Oh.

88
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,015
This King.

89
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:13,940
How dare he lie to me?

90
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:37,459
Why did you lie to your sister?

91
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:40,376
You knew it?

92
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:51,023
Are you mad?

93
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:31,444
Wait at your boyfriend's house tomorrow noon.

94
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,023
Oh, my God.

95
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:02,902
Bohn, sorry.

96
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,496
I set my alarm on a wrong day.

97
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:06,060
That's why my phone didn't ring.

98
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:08,857
It's okay.

99
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,992
It's just the first date anyhow.

100
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,211
I'm sorry.

101
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:20,135
Sorry.

102
00:12:58,271 --> 00:12:58,782
Hmm!

104
00:13:03,353 --> 00:13:05,338
He's showing off that he's on a lovely date.

105
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:06,120
Hehe.

106
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:08,466
What about me?

107
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,932
I'm writing a report here with my husband.

108
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:14,361
I have a girlfriend as well.

109
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,226
I also want to go on a date.

110
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,970
Serve you right. You want to be
the boyfriend of a celebrity.

111
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,744
You should wait until your next life for a date.

[Fon]

113
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:34,842
Finally have time to talk to your boyfriend?

114
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:42,782
Is the training hard?

115
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:45,789
I miss you so much, honey.

116
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:49,549
Don't worry about me.

117
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:50,842
I'm fine.

118
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,338
What?

119
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:57,609
What did

120
00:13:58,632 --> 00:13:59,504
you say?

121
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,594
Okay. Alright.

122
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:07,654
What happened?

123
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,323
She asked me out for a date.

124
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,053
She has time.

125
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:16,947
What should I do?

126
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,985
Isn't it good? She cares about you.

127
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,549
Why are you unhappy?

128
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:26,060
I'm worried. I have never dated her properly.

129
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:29,669
Hubby.

130
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,624
Be your wife's coach.

131
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:35,113
Please. Be your wife's coach.

132
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:39,083
Be your wife's coach.

133
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,586
Okay, okay.

134
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:42,391
Really?

135
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:45,759
Thank you so much.

136
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:51,985
Why did you bring me here?

137
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:54,090
Hey.

138
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:56,406
You said Fon likes to take a walk, right?

139
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:57,789
I think this place is rather good.

140
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,143
There are even bicyclers here.

141
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:02,421
If I take her here,

142
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:03,895
what should I do next?

143
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:06,180
There's much you can do.

144
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,323
Have dessert together.

145
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:08,947
You can also

146
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:10,090
cycle with her.

147
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:13,218
That's a good idea.

148
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,398
I always wanted to cycle with my girlfriend.

149
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,752
But it's a small pity that

150
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:20,797
I don't know how to cycle.

151
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,038
That's not just small.

152
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,361
Hehe.

153
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,511
Teach me, please.

154
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:31,714
Please.

155
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:33,489
Okay?

156
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,195
Hey, don't be silent.

157
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,023
Teach me.

158
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:40,753
Can I do this?

159
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:41,248
Let's go.

160
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:48,376
Will I fall?

161
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:50,120
Mek.

162
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:52,466
Hold tight, Mek.

163
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:13,098
I don't want to cycle anymore.

164
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:18,331
You just started, yet you already gave up.

165
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,376
Practice more. What if you can make it?

166
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:23,323
Trust me. Hold on a little longer.

167
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:42,692

Fortunately, there's a shop nearby.

204
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,308
After you cycle with Fon,

205
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,722
you can come here for dessert.

206
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:47,233
But I would like to have Thai steamboat.

207
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:48,917
There's one opposite.

208
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:51,053
You're picky.

209
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:53,489
Listen to me. Girls

210
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,865
like a cute place with a good atmosphere,

211
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:58,060
a shop which is worth to post on Instagram.

212
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:00,917
What's bad about Thai steamboat?

213
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:05,639
You're shaking your head again.

214
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,233
I want Thai steamboat.

215
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:14,000
Thank you.

216
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:17,278
Thank you.

217
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:26,060
We have a promotion now.

218
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,045
After ordering this set meal,

219
00:20:28,045 --> 00:20:30,779
if you take a photo to paste
in the shop, you'll have a 50% discount.

220
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:31,835
Are you interested in it?

221
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:34,211
50% discount?

222
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:35,444
Yes, 50%.

223
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:36,316
Alright then.

224
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:39,203
I'm going to take now.

225
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,338
Okay.

226
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:43,925
One, two, three.

227
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:49,459
50%.

228
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:51,083
That's great.

229
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:54,782
Ms, how is it?

230
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,346
Are we handsome?

231
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:57,519
Eyes were closed.

232
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:00,316
It was you, right? You closed your eyes.

233
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:01,880
Once again.

234
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,541
Okay, Ms.

235
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,211
One, two, three.

236
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:11,173
Okay. Thank you.

237
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,466
Thank you, Ms.

238
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:18,178
That's quite good.

239
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:20,797
She even helped take our photos.

240
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:26,000
Sit right here. I'll be back.

241
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:30,517
Hurry up. I won't bother to wait for you.

242
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:40,586
Ms.

243
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:42,331
Ms.

244
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:43,293
What's going on?

245
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,353
Ms, could you give me the first photo?

246
00:21:47,594 --> 00:21:48,526
Oh, of course.

247
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:49,459
Here you go.

248
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:50,271
Thank you.

249
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:22,331
Look. This movie looks great.

250
00:22:26,632 --> 00:22:28,165
Okay. I'll let you choose.

251
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:29,880
As you wish. Here.

252
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:32,015
I want to watch this.

253
00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:34,541
Are you sure?

254
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:37,068
If we weren't too late,

255
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:38,902
other movies would be available.

256
00:22:41,368 --> 00:22:42,211
Okay. Alright then.

257
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,519
Then you'll buy the tickets, I'll buy drinks.

258
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,889
Buy tickets?

259
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:55,359
How to buy?

260
00:22:58,842 --> 00:23:00,256
Curse you.

261
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:12,526
Brother.

262
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:15,474
Are you buying movie tickets in an App?

263
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:17,008
Oh, yes.

264
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,767
Click here. Did you see it?

265
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,812
Then over here.

266
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:27,564
It worked. Thank you.

267
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:30,872
Would it be a problem if I ask for your name?

268
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:31,925
I'm Duen.

269
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:34,632
Oh, I'm called Pluem.

270
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:36,947
Are you watching a movie with friends?

271
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,165
Oh, you're here with your boyfriend.

272
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:05,579
No, we're just friends.

273
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:11,053
That means Duen is single, right?

274
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:17,158
Yes, single. Single.

275
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:18,301
I have no one yet.

276
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:22,692
Then, may I go after you?

277
00:24:32,707 --> 00:24:34,331
Oh, hold on, Bohn.

278
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:37,549
Sorry.

279
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:39,654
Actually, that crazy guy is my boyfriend.

280
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:48,677
Bohn.

281
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:51,594
Bohn.

282
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:53,218
Bohn.

283
00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:54,406
Talk to me.

284
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,827
You started it first.

285
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:02,541
You said I wasn't your boyfriend.

286
00:25:03,383 --> 00:25:05,639
Besides, he talked to me first.

287
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,203
I ignored him.

288
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:12,947
You're not talking, right?

289
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:14,962
Okay.

290
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,797
It's annoying to talk to someone

291
00:25:16,797 --> 00:25:18,451
as unreasonable as you.

292
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:29,308
You were chatting with that boy, right?

293
00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:31,353
Why do you care?

294
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:34,180
You were the one who said
you weren't my boyfriend.

295
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:36,947
I said that, because I was angry
that you were talking to him.

296
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:41,639
You're my boyfriend.
You can't chat with others randomly.

297
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:44,496
Who said I was chatting with others?

298
00:25:47,985 --> 00:25:48,647
Here you go.

299
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:56,436
I'm very upset that I ruined our first date.

300
00:25:57,218 --> 00:25:58,842
But you wouldn't listen to me when I talk.

301
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:02,361
So I coax you with text messages.

302
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:03,774
Forgive me, please.

303
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:05,489
Sorry.

304
00:26:19,414 --> 00:26:23,233
I have forgiven you when I read the message.

305
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:27,444
Bohn, you made me very nervous.

306
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,188
Regarding this morning when I was late.

307
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:36,797
I was just fooling around with you.

308
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:38,391
Rotter Bohn.

309
00:26:39,594 --> 00:26:41,068
You were so cute

310
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:42,632
when you're lost.

311
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:47,985
Do you know when you said I was just your friend,

312
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:51,955
I thought it was embarrassing
for you to be with me.

313
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:57,128
I was afraid that you may be embarrassed.

314
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:05,038
Because everyone said that I have a
bad attitude, I'm foppish and not loyal.

315
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:09,579
If you think it's embarrassing to be with me,

316
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:11,624
it wouldn't be weird.

317
00:27:20,256 --> 00:27:21,223
Listen to me.

318
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,534
I don't feel embarrassed to be with you.

319
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:25,103
Besides, I'll tell everyone

320
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,421
that I'm in a relationship with you.

321
00:27:27,053 --> 00:27:28,045
I also believe that

322
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:30,782
my friends will be okay with it.

323
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:35,474
Not okay.

324
00:27:50,632 --> 00:27:52,135
Sorry, everyone.

325
00:27:53,008 --> 00:27:54,211
I didn't tell you that

326
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:55,895
I'm already in a relationship with him.

327
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,165
It was OK that you were fooling around,

328
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:14,421
it is different now that you're being serious.

329
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:16,105
You know how Senior is.

330
00:28:16,406 --> 00:28:17,218
That's right.

331
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,436
My good baby.

332
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:21,669
Don't be sad.

333
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,624
I know,

334
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:26,541
no matter how handsome,
good and tempting Bohn is,

335
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,035
fine, but he's not loyal.

336
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:33,489
Ting, are you complimenting or scolding him?

337
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,414
Ram, help me say something.

338
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:41,910
Ram saw Senior's behavior,

339
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:43,474
he surely can't take it.

340
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:53,218
I don't know what kind of person he is.

341
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,323
But since I met him,

342
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:57,368
he hasn't been doing bad things.

343
00:29:04,105 --> 00:29:05,699
What you told me,

344
00:29:06,632 --> 00:29:08,256
is to believe in my feelings, right?

345
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:23,985
If you have thought it through,

346
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:26,992
we will not stop you from being with him.

347
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,684
Ting, why did you say that?

348
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:33,669
Don't you want to stop him?

349
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:35,835
Didn't you see his heart is no longer here?

350
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:37,519
This is his deepest desire.

351
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,293
Wouldn't you try to stop him?

352
00:29:39,504 --> 00:29:41,278
What do you want me to do?

353
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,947
So, if you have thought about it thoroughly,

354
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,654
we will not stop you from being with Senior.

355
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:08,677
However,

356
00:30:09,248 --> 00:30:11,835
he has to pass our test first.

357
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:12,586
What?

358
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,173
What test?

359
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:33,218
You want me to buy flowers for Duen?

360
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,684
I thought it would be a tougher test.

361
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:43,925
We're not done, Senior.

362
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,023
You have to buy a rose

363
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:49,644
from the flower boy who sold flowers to Duen

364
00:30:49,644 --> 00:30:51,564
before 9 in the morning.

365
00:30:52,466 --> 00:30:54,090
Who sells flowers at that time?

366
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:56,586
That's right. Isn't that too much?

367
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,504
Phu, that's not at all.

368
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:02,541
Our Duen could do it.

369
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:05,820
Oh.

370
00:31:07,143 --> 00:31:08,586
This is revenge, right?

371
00:31:15,534 --> 00:31:17,579
No problem. I accept the challenge.

372
00:31:36,556 --> 00:31:38,481
Sir.

373
00:31:40,135 --> 00:31:43,684
My friend said there's a flower boy around here.

374
00:31:43,744 --> 00:31:45,128
Have you seen him, Sir?

375
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:47,113
Oh, souvenir?

376
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:49,459
There's still quite a bit to walk, boy.

377
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:51,955
No, sir.

378
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:53,610
A flower boy who sells flowers.

379
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,677
Oh, hammering wood.

380
00:31:57,128 --> 00:31:58,752
What type of hammer do you want?

381
00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:01,699
No, sir.

382
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,496
Flowers! Flowers!

383
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:06,962
Oh, the flower boy who sells flowers.

384
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:10,030
Why did you ask for a hammer then?

385
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,158
There was a flower boy
who sold flowers at the opposite.

386
00:32:13,158 --> 00:32:13,759
Really?

387
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:16,976
But they moved.

388
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:20,767
Moved?

389
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:22,662
Yes, moved.

390
00:32:22,662 --> 00:32:25,789
Do you know where they moved to?

391
00:32:26,602 --> 00:32:27,684
I don't know.

392
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:28,195
Don't know?

393
00:32:28,195 --> 00:32:28,857
Yes.

394
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,496
Why does he keep asking?

395
00:32:36,195 --> 00:32:38,842
Hm, he only knows how to ask.

396
00:33:04,556 --> 00:33:05,218
Do you like this?

397
00:33:08,346 --> 00:33:10,301
Venus flytrap. Are you interested in it?

398
00:33:12,346 --> 00:33:13,732
Do you have the seed?

399
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:15,444
Because I like to plant them myself.

400
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:18,962
They're hard to grow.

401
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:23,203
To be honest, I bought them as a plant to sell.

402
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,023
I think you should buy the plant.

403
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,977
It's at 8.59 a.m. There's a minute to go.

404
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,738
Will my Brother Bohn make it?

405
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:49,016
What should we do?

406
00:33:49,016 --> 00:33:49,910
You're doing it again.

407
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,624
Ting, on whose side are you?

408
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,579
I'm here.

409
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,346
8 o'clock, 59 minutes, 50 seconds.

410
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:06,511
It's considered as pass.

411
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:13,399
Actually, I could have been here earlier.

412
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,226
But the flower boy moved to Ayutthaya.

413
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:19,233
But it's not too bad. I bought souvenirs for you all.

414
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:22,361
You went to Ayutthaya to buy a flower?

415
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:26,060
I can do it even if it's further. For you.

416
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:34,932
Thank you so much. It looks really tasty.

417
00:34:36,496 --> 00:34:39,023
May I be with Duen now?

418
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:45,368
I would like to say yes.

419
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,556
But that's the first test from me.

420
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,797
There are three tests for you from my friends.

421
00:34:55,714 --> 00:34:56,406
Hey.

422
00:34:57,609 --> 00:34:58,752
Isn't this too much?

423
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:00,286
No.

424
00:35:00,857 --> 00:35:02,120
If he can't do,

425
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:03,925
how can we entrust you to Senior?

426
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:08,587
Okay.

427
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,993
Just tell me what you want me to do.

428
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:14,301
You start first, Phu.

429
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,770
You shall buy him a glass of raspberry juice.

430
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,444
Just one glass.

431
00:35:29,218 --> 00:35:32,045
But it's okay if you don't have time.

432
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:33,729
I can buy it for you.

433
00:35:35,023 --> 00:35:36,526
You may move on to Tang's test.

434
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:56,797
You asked Duen to gift you flowers at Gear Statue,

435
00:35:58,241 --> 00:35:59,532
so you must give Duen flowers,

436
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:02,331
and then say you love Duen
loudly in the classroom.

437
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,624
Duen, I love you.

438
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:04,647
What are you doing?

439
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:05,940
Do you know...

440
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:08,496
here is a school.

441
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:09,820
It's not a playground.

442
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:13,158
You've grown up. Why you didn't
think before doing it?

443
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,767
Reflect yourself.

444
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:29,669
Sorry, Ms.

445
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,027
And...

446
00:37:32,196 --> 00:37:33,759
this is for you, Ms.

447
00:37:37,669 --> 00:37:38,511
I'll go now.

448
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,113
There's one last test left.

449
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:53,459
Tell me what you want me to do.

450
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:01,308
Fight me.

451
00:38:01,308 --> 00:38:02,120
What?

452
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,564
[Boss]

453
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:53,248
What's up?

454
00:38:56,496 --> 00:38:57,368
What should I do?

455
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,654
What if I act weirdly unintentionally?

456
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:00,917
Don't be afraid.

457
00:39:01,218 --> 00:39:02,181
You'll surely do that.

458
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:02,993
Hey!

459
00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:04,767
I'm not kidding.

460
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:08,587
What if she fell from the bicycle,

461
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:13,188
and was eaten by a lizard?

462
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:16,015
Calm down.

463
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:17,248
Calm down.

464
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,135
Fon likes the real you.

465
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,594
Because you are who you are.

466
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:27,865
Hey, you're right.

467
00:39:30,632 --> 00:39:31,474
This hubby

468
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,188
always helps this wife.

469
00:39:35,577 --> 00:39:36,310
That's all. It's almost time.

470
00:39:36,978 --> 00:39:37,579
Bye-bye.

471
00:40:52,346 --> 00:40:54,421
Hey, to be honest,

472
00:40:54,962 --> 00:40:58,150
you're fighting him so seriously to get Duen?

473
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,504
Hey, do you know it?

474
00:41:03,865 --> 00:41:05,068
Ram is fighting him,

475
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:07,263
because he doesn't want Bohn to be with his friend.

476
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,376
One is his friend, the other is his partner.

477
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,962
Who will your boyfriend choose?

478
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,474
I've tied Duen up.

479
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:25,008
You may fight him as much as you want.

480
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,962
Help.

481
00:41:27,474 --> 00:41:28,797
Tang, let me go.

482
00:41:28,797 --> 00:41:30,331
Ting Ting, what are you doing?

483
00:41:31,925 --> 00:41:33,158
Let me go.

484
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:35,985
No. Or else you will stop them from fighting.

485
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:38,632
Of course. Why let them fight?

486
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:39,775
Don't you think it is stupid?

487
00:41:40,105 --> 00:41:41,639
Do you have nothing better to do?

488
00:41:42,602 --> 00:41:43,925
This is nothing.

489
00:41:43,925 --> 00:41:46,211
The leading males in movies
always fight for leading females.

490
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:47,835
That's extremely romantic.

491
00:41:48,947 --> 00:41:49,910
I understand Ram.

492
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,143
He treats you like his son.

493
00:41:51,353 --> 00:41:52,466
When someone is going after you,

494
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:53,790
he'll surely want to protect you.

495
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:57,399
But even so,

496
00:41:59,323 --> 00:42:01,338
I don't want them to fight.

497
00:42:02,842 --> 00:42:04,045
You know it as well,

498
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,729
Ram

499
00:42:06,481 --> 00:42:07,083
is...

500
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:19,895
What? Ram is a boxer?

501
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:22,060
Yes, I've investigated him.

502
00:42:22,932 --> 00:42:25,699
Phu said, Ram learned to box
when he was in Grade Three.

503
00:42:34,662 --> 00:42:35,558
So what?

504
00:42:36,978 --> 00:42:39,203
I have defeated some boxers too.

505
00:42:40,376 --> 00:42:41,880
But Phu also said,

506
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:44,827
he was in the national youth team.

507
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,677
He was expelled after the first day of training.

508
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:51,023
Why?

509
00:42:51,113 --> 00:42:52,526
Because he defeated everyone there.

510
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:53,128
What?

511
00:42:53,669 --> 00:42:56,165
I'll bet 1,000 baht on Ram.

512
00:42:57,038 --> 00:42:57,699
Me too.

513
00:43:00,857 --> 00:43:02,271
But don't worry, Bohn.

514
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:05,368
We'll bet a lot on him.

515
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:06,692
So we'll have money
to pay your medical bill, okay?

516
00:43:07,444 --> 00:43:09,098
If you can no longer take it,

517
00:43:09,368 --> 00:43:10,181
just lie down.

518
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,023
Stay down.

519
00:43:11,113 --> 00:43:12,617
So the senior will stop the fight.

520
00:43:15,744 --> 00:43:17,820
I heard the senior also bet on Ram to win.

521
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,474
I'll bet 1,000 baht on you.

522
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,496
You're pretty well informed.

523
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,323
I will not give in.

524
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:39,143
Just don't make Duen sad.

525
00:43:49,218 --> 00:43:50,120
Be careful.

526
00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:52,376
Senior Bohn is great as well.

527
00:43:52,587 --> 00:43:54,030
But don't use your full power.

528
00:43:54,391 --> 00:43:55,865
He's our senior after all.

529
00:43:56,264 --> 00:43:58,421
He can order us around. Remember that.

530
00:44:23,714 --> 00:44:24,917
Do not attack the fatal parts.

531
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:26,541
Do not hit the private part.

532
00:44:27,805 --> 00:44:28,767
Have sportsmanship.

533
00:44:30,481 --> 00:44:30,902
Fight.

534
00:44:35,895 --> 00:44:37,038
If you want to be with Duen,

535
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,632
defeat me.

536
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,602
Go.

537
00:45:09,338 --> 00:45:11,233
I think it's time for the result.

538
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:35,504
[Special scene]

539
00:46:00,406 --> 00:46:02,391
I came here as soon as I saw your message.

540
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:07,624
Coincidentally,

541
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:10,060
Fon has work suddenly.

542
00:46:10,722 --> 00:46:11,437
So

543
00:46:12,075 --> 00:46:13,188
she can't come.

544
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,699
I've chosen the latest bicycle.

545
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:42,391
Oh right. There's a good BBQ shop nearby.

546
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:43,083
I'll take you there.

549
00:46:59,474 --> 00:47:02,632
I didn't eat anything the whole day.

00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,331

Hey.

553

Wait for me.

Hey, Mek.
