[My Engineer]
[Episode 2]

2
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,850
Do you know...

3
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:12,250
how adorable you are?

4
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,575
What are you saying, Lizard Man?

5
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:28,325
Why are you praising me?

6
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,900
I'm not praising you...

7
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:38,850
but the flower.

8
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:43,925
So, I kept my promise for today.

9
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,925
I'm leaving.

10
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,150
Hey, don't leave yet.

11
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:48,625
What's wrong with you?

12
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:52,925
Leave me alone.

13
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,075
I'm fine.

14
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,075
Where are you going?

15
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,600
The library.

16
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,850
I'm going for a nap...

17
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,250
before my afternoon class.

18
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,100
I looked for the flower for you since morning.

19
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:10,600
I'm sleepy. My eyes are closing.

20
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,975
The library is quite far though.

21
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:16,700
Why don't you sleep at my classroom?

22
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,750
Are you crazy? Your teacher will scold me.

23
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,700
It's alright. My friends usually
bring their girlfriend to sleep too.

24
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,425
I'm not your girlfriend though.

25
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:30,425
I'm leaving.

26
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,925
[Library]
[Under Maintenance]

27
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:52,450
Oh.

28
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:06,100
Why are you following me?

29
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,500
You might be lost.

30
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:09,800
What now?

31
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,400
It's a long way back to the Medical College.

32
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,675
Come and sleep at my class.

33
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,000
Dream on.

34
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,925
I'll not be sleeping at your class.

35
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:32,325
I've told you no one would say a word. See?

36
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,000
You can sleep here.

37
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,700
Just like at your own home.

38
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,950
Bohn,

39
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,350
didn't you bring girls over usually?

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,975
What is this now?

41
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,375
My boyfriend.

42
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,600
I got my hands on a medical student.
Am I great?

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
Oh...

44
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,300
You can't keep your hands to yourself.

45
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,900
Touching here and there as you please.

46
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,200
It's a long story.

47
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,650
Just think of him as my friend who is just sleepy.

48
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,850
Your lab coat is so thin.

49
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,925
It's not warm enough.

50
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,600
Wear my uniform instead.

51
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,850
It's a bit dirty...

52
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,500
but at least it's warm.

53
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:56,200
Wow!

54
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,900
You're awesome.

55
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,100
So manly.

56
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,200
Bohn, what are you saying?

57
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:04,975
You idiot.

58
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:09,350
You!

59
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:11,925
The student who took Bohn's uniform.

60
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:14,325
Treat him well.

61
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:17,200
Woo!

62
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,750
Bohn.

63
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,375
You brought me here to embarrass me?

64
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:33,350
Hurry up!

65
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,775
Here's your sour mango.

66
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:40,850
Oh.

67
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,925
Duen is not picking up my calls.

68
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:45,700
I wonder if he finds what he wanted?

69
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,075
It's already been a few hours.

70
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,301
He should be together with Ram.

71
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:57,525
TingTing, Tang, what are you eating?

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,800
Come, there's mango and guava.

73
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,475
I'm here to see if you want to...

74
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,675
get some food
since I have no class at noon.

75
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,525
Is it nice?

76
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:10,225
Oh, where's Duen?

77
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:12,325
He is not with you?

78
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:16,775
Damn!

79
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,775
I'll see you next week.
Don't forget to submit your test.

80
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:25,350
Alright.

81
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:26,700
Bye.

82
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,150
Bye.

83
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,600
Well, look at this.

84
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,575
What is this?

85
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:38,925
Bohn.

86
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,675
Are you having lunch with us...

87
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,825
or with him?

88
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,975
Pack your stuff if you are eating with us.

89
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:49,675
You can leave first.

90
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,800
So you can eat him instead?

91
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll wait for him to wake up.
I don't want to disturb him.

92
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,925
You take good care of him.

93
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:03,475
Unlike my mute husband here.

94
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,950
He'll fall asleep...

95
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,550
if I don't pay attention to him.

96
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,675
Hey, wait a second.

97
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:14,875
Are you angry? I'll let you sleep twice.

98
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,200
See you there.

99
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:18,650
Bye.

100
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,100
You won't get me this time.

101
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:55,075
Where's everyone?

102
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:56,675
They went for lunch.

103
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,325
I'm waiting for you to wake up
and return my uniform.

104
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,525
Sure.

105
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:03,900
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:05,375
Wake me up next time.

107
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,175
You don't have to wait.

108
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:09,500
Don't feel sorry.

109
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:11,400
Treat me to lunch...

110
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,200
as a punishment.

111
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:13,750
What?

112
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,575
You are doing it again.

113
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,075
Okay, you can decide where to go.

114
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,550
It can't be worse than yesterday's place though.

115
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,425
Let's go. I'm hungry.

116
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,600
Let's go.

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,800
You talk a lot.

118
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,350
There's a shop like this in our school?

119
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,600
It's a secret spot for medical students.

120
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,375
Other students don't know about it.

121
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:01,350
You should thank me for bringing you here.

122
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,625
Alright.

123
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:04,625
Talk after the food's here.

124
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,108
You're in trouble if the food's bad.

125
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:18,975
Yes.

126
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,100
Thank you.

127
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,550
Why is everything a dessert?

128
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:34,900
Where's the rice?

129
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,225
I'm tired. I only want desserts.

130
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,525
Desserts?

131
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,582
Orange cake, strawberry cake
and strawberry shaved ice.

132
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:44,900
Pregnancy cravings?

133
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,950
I'm not. I just like sour food.

134
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:50,200
It's delicious.

135
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:55,800
Amazing.

136
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,325
Why are you smiling?

137
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,475
You are a messy eater.

138
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,275
Am I?

139
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,550
You'll be still wiping until tomorrow in that way.

140
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:37,875
You are so messy, eating like a kid.

141
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
I'm not a kid.

142
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,075
It's because it's delicious.

143
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:45,025
Try it.

144
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,125
No way. I haven't eaten anything yet.

145
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,200
Just eat.

146
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,325
How was it?

147
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,350
Delicious?

148
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,675
It's average.

149
00:11:58,325 --> 00:11:59,650
I can see it in your eyes.

150
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,175
You like it.

151
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,825
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

152
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,225
You don't have to treat me this time.

153
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,675
I picked up 1,000 baht this morning.

154
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:30,025
My mom said it's not good to take it.

155
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:32,350
It's bad if I keep the money.

156
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:35,900
Take it.

157
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,100
What's this?

158
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:46,200
Don't you know this is used for games?

159
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,650
Oh.

160
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,625
I thought it's real.

161
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:54,100
Fake money nowadays looks so real.

162
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,600
It's hard for people to differentiate.

163
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,700
Only idiots like you can't differentiate it.

164
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:04,400
What did you say? I heard you.

165
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,767
Who're you calling an idiot?

166
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,675
Give me your phone.

167
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:10,175
Why do you want it?

168
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,782
Just give it to me. Quick.

169
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,050
Really.

170
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:25,775
This is my number.

171
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,725
Call me if you're...

172
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,100
still lost tomorrow.

173
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,175
Regarding the flower,

174
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:37,975
you can get it anywhere if you like.

175
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:40,275
You don't have to get it from kids on the street.

176
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:41,725
Otherwise, I don't know how you'll end up.

177
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,225
Alright, I understand.

178
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,100
I'm leaving.

179
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,125
Wow!

180
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:17,975
It's you again.

181
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,275
What kind of flower do you want for tomorrow?

182
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:22,400
What?

183
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,325
I mean the flower, what do you want?

184
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,650
So I can buy it for you.

185
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,925
So you chased me on your motorcycle...

186
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,050
just to ask me this?

187
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,275
Yes. Just give me an answer.

188
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm running late.

189
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,250
Just get me any flower.

190
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,225
No, you must pick one.

191
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,625
You'll be nagging if it's not to your liking.

192
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,325
Enough.

193
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,650
Get me a rose. Alright?

194
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,150
Alright. Bye.

195
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,625
This fool.

196
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,625
Duen, where were you?

197
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:19,125
Everyone is looking for you.

198
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:20,800
We almost called the police.

199
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,350
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,350
I went to find my friend
at the Engineering College.

201
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,475
Just like how I told you.

202
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,225
Who do you know besides Phu and Ram
at the Engineering College?

203
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,500
Well, I know someone else.

204
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:39,850
Anyway, let's focus on study.
I can't keep up otherwise.

205
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,950
Everyone, Duen is back.

206
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,425
He went to the Engineering College
to find a friend.

207
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:54,400
Do you think someone like him
will have other friends there?

208
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,800
Perhaps he found a lover there.

209
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,950
Damn, Duen has a boyfriend?

210
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,275
It's strange.

211
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:03,950
I find it strange too.

212
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:09,250
If you are gossiping about me,
please do it in a group chat without me.

213
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:31,200
Bohn, the perfect guy who made Duen feel inferior.

214
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,975
What kind of profile was that, Lizard Man?

215
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,300
Felt humiliated after reading it?

216
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,275
Do you think that only you can do it?

217
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,275
Damn.

218
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,850
Why do you have someone
sending you a photo of his body?

219
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,700
Is he the one you went to find in the morning?

220
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,575
Yes, I mean no.

221
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,300
So, yes or no?

222
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,500
Yes.

223
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:32,975
He is a pervert.

224
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:34,950
He teases me by sending this picture.

225
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:36,050
A pervert?

226
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:39,175
Don't give in to him. He will feel excited
if you are embarrassed.

227
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,875
So you need to embarrass him.

228
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:44,275
What are you doing?

229
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:47,600
Just wait and see.

230
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:02,950
Done.

231
00:18:08,425 --> 00:18:10,150
When did you take a picture of me?

232
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,950
You sent it to him?

233
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,875
He will be embarrassed
because your body looks better than his.

234
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:27,200
[Nang]

235
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,100
Hello, Nang.

236
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,475
Bohn.

237
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:38,400
Do you remember what day is today?

238
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:43,350
It's Friday.

239
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,000
Cut the act.

240
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,575
I know you remembered my birthday.

241
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,925
You're making fun of me.

242
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:52,825
Well,

243
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,500
you know me well.

244
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,675
Let's meet at the bar at 9 p.m.

245
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,509
I'll be waiting for your present.

246
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,500
Also, bring your friends over.

247
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,050
My friends wanted to know them.

248
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,550
Alright. See you there.

249
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,625
Alright.

250
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:29,100
Dad.

251
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,175
Why are you here today?

252
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,450
You're not going back to the force?

253
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,050
I'll go back in a few days.

254
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,050
I'm here to see my daughter.

255
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,100
You only worry about your daughter.

256
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,075
Your son is standing here...

257
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:45,325
and you never worry about him.

258
00:19:47,575 --> 00:19:48,850
I worry about my son too.

259
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:51,250
I'm worried that he is too nice like a girl.

260
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:52,675
Act like my son.

261
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,825
Be enthusiastic and confident.

262
00:19:58,725 --> 00:19:59,225
Take it.

263
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,350
What's this for?

264
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,350
Throw a party and invite some girls.

265
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:07,100
Introduce your girlfriend...

266
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,025
after I come back from the force

267
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,225
Take it back. I don't want it.

268
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,350
Time for me to go.

269
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:21,850
Take good care of my wife and daughter.

270
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:26,900
Dad, wait.

271
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,650
-Fold the leaf like this.
-Like this?

272
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,150
This way.

273
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,000
Picking up Dao for your mom?

274
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,450
Yes, my mom is busy today.

275
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,050
The foreign child that plays with Dao is new here?

276
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,475
He doesn't look familiar.

277
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,725
Yes, he is Ben. He transferred from England.

278
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,875
His Thai is still bad...

279
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,575
so he doesn't have a lot of friends.

280
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,725
Only Dao will play with him.

281
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:09,625
Duen.

282
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:10,600
Hello.

283
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,550
Hello, ready to go home?

284
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,900
We need to get some ingredients for dinner.

285
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:16,625
Alright.

286
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:19,675
Bye, Ben. See you tomorrow.

287
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,075
Bye, honey. I love you.

288
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,775
Well, he is not used to Thai culture.

289
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:41,900
Children need some time to adjust.

290
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,825
Please calm down.

291
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,906
Hello, mom.

292
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:58,225
Give me a moment, dear.

293
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,600
I miss you. You've been away for so long.

294
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,700
-Are you tired from school?
-No.

295
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,756
Stupid blonde! Crazy child!

296
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:10,300
Kid with no manners!

297
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:12,075
What's wrong?

298
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:13,625
Do you know that?

299
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,125
A kid took Dao's first kiss today.

300
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,625
The kiss that I protected is gone.

301
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:22,750
All because of that blonde kid.

302
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,550
Blonde kid?

303
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:26,775
How can you say that about Ben?

304
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,875
Ben is my new friend.

305
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,175
Oh, he's your friend.

306
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,475
My daughter is charming like me
when I was young.

307
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,475
Mom, this is not the time to be happy.

308
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,725
He should be punished.

309
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,550
Let's call the police.

310
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,600
Come on. This is normal among children.

311
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,425
You don't have to make a fuss out of it.

312
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,900
My pretty girl, let's go and make dinner.

313
00:22:59,275 --> 00:22:59,575
Let's go.

314
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:03,150
Get me the bag with the ingredients.

315
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,450
What should we make today?

316
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,775
Hey.

317
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,476
Mom! Hold on!

318
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:13,725
What should we make?

319
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,500
So we are not doing anything?

320
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,525
We are talking about Dao's first kiss.

321
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,300
Am I the only one...

322
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:23,900
who thinks this is a big deal?

323
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,775
What's wrong?

324
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:35,375
Huh?

325
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:37,475
You called everyone.

326
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:39,400
Free tonight?

327
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,250
Yes.

328
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:40,700
Yes.

329
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:41,375
Why?

330
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,950
Let's have a drink.

331
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,550
What?

332
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,125
Cheers!

333
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,350
You are the only excited one.

334
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:00,325
What's wrong with Duen?

335
00:24:00,325 --> 00:24:03,600
He usually rejects us
but he is the one inviting us today.

336
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,925
I'm not sure. No worries.

337
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,750
This is the Engineering College's turf.

338
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,575
My friends can handle anything...

339
00:24:09,675 --> 00:24:11,550
if Duen gets into trouble with someone.

340
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,200
You are so reliable.

341
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,225
Of course.

342
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,225
He's here.

343
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,625
Over here, Duen!

344
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,550
Hello.

345
00:24:27,225 --> 00:24:28,250
Come here.

346
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:33,250
You look charming.
Your drink is wrong though.

347
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,575
What's wrong?

348
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:38,775
I know they are not selling much...

349
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,425
at the bar,

350
00:24:40,475 --> 00:24:42,125
so I drank something first.

351
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,675
Idiot.

352
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,150
You can get food at a bar. We have to eat too.

353
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,375
Look at you. All dressed-up.

354
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,150
Usually it's just pants and slippers.

355
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,800
Are you possessed?

356
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,450
My mom possessed me.

357
00:24:55,525 --> 00:25:00,075
She dressed me up like this
when she knew I'm coming to drink.

358
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,350
So, why do you call us out here?

359
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:05,800
Something wrong?

360
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:15,325
I'm angry as I think of it.

361
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:17,450
It got to me.

362
00:25:19,975 --> 00:25:21,355
I had too much yogurt.

363
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:22,575
I'll head to the washroom.

364
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,225
I'll tell you after I come back.

365
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:25,025
I can't hold it in.

366
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,575
What a big butt.

367
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:29,325
He's so loud like a madman.

368
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,285
What's wrong with him?

369
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:33,000
Cheers!

370
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,250
How annoying.

371
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,425
I'm sorry.

372
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,825
It's alright. It's my fault that I bump into you.

373
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,300
First time here? I don't think I've seen you before.

374
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,775
Yes.

375
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,925
I'm going.

376
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,850
What's the rush? Do you have Line?

377
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,275
Add me. Perhaps we can have fun next time.

378
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:21,500
It's alright.

379
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,700
You don't like that I'm asking you out...

380
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,075
or you're afraid that we are going
to do something else?

381
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,700
Hey, look who's talking with Duen.

382
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,475
Wow, she's a beauty.

383
00:26:45,575 --> 00:26:47,725
I'd better leave.

384
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,875
Wow.

385
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,280
You're aggressive today....

386
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,650
from your looks to behavior.

387
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,325
I'm not hitting on her.

388
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:04,700
She's the one that hit on me.

389
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,100
I rejected her and came over as fast as I can.

390
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:11,625
What did you say to her? She looks angry.

391
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:13,175
She's angry?

392
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:13,725
Yes.

393
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,625
I told her I'm sorry because...

394
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:21,550
my mom told me not to mingle
with girls who hit on guys at a bar.

395
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,700
I just had goosebumps.

396
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,125
No wonder she's angry.

397
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,075
Am I wrong?

398
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,600
My mom really said that.

399
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,750
That's alright, don't be disheartened.

400
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,550
Anyway, why did you call everyone out?

401
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,975
It hurts me to talk about this.

402
00:27:45,425 --> 00:27:49,725
I've never experienced
something like this in my whole life.

403
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,400
My sister...

404
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:59,250
My sister's first kiss was taken by someone else.

405
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:09,000
What are you doing?

406
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,675
We had a bet on what you're going to tell us.

407
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:14,200
Three of us said it's about study.

408
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,800
He said it's about your sister.

409
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,250
Hey, I'm serious.

410
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,350
Don't you think it's absurd?

411
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:26,275
Fine, I won't talk to you anymore.

412
00:28:27,825 --> 00:28:29,250
I'll drink until I'm dead.

413
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:39,650
All bark and no bite.

414
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,625
You think I won't drink?

415
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,375
How was it?

416
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:14,600
♫Happy birthday to you♫

417
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:30,875
You're so cute. You still remember my birthday.

418
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,025
She's still pretending.

419
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,675
She's the one who asked Bohn to buy the cake.

420
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:39,500
It's the truth.

421
00:29:44,275 --> 00:29:45,747
Hey, look.

422
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:49,025
Is that the Man of the Moon, Bohn,
who's holding the cake?

423
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,350
Yes. He's our college's senior.

424
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:55,350
He's cute. I'm envious.

425
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,575
I want a romantic and cute guy like him
to give me a surprise too.

426
00:29:59,575 --> 00:30:01,274
I want it so much.

427
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:02,424
That's enough.

428
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:10,125
Am I still a coward now, Phu?

429
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,425
I'm Tang, Phu is over there.

430
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,875
You're drunk, Duen.

431
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,150
Who's drunk, Tang?

432
00:30:19,775 --> 00:30:21,600
I'm Phu, Tang is over there.

433
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,200
I'm so confused.

434
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,575
Ram, a question.

435
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,150
Is it true that Duen started to strip...

436
00:30:33,475 --> 00:30:36,400
when he was drunk the last time?

437
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:45,292
The air conditioner is cold here.

438
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,400
So what?

439
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,425
We'll provide free hugs.

440
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:50,125
You can get a refund hug...

441
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,975
if you're not satisfied.

442
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,750
For you.

443
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,875
It's the latest perfume.

444
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:09,975
How do you know I like this?

445
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,475
You are the cutest.

446
00:31:14,925 --> 00:31:18,775
She is the one that asks Bohn
to buy that specifically.

447
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,350
You don't have to thank me.

448
00:31:25,775 --> 00:31:28,043
I don't really remember your birthday.

449
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:32,075
Luckily, you reminded me over the phone...

450
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,525
and asked me to get you the perfume.

451
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,800
I need to go to the washroom.

452
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,725
That's nice.

453
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,400
Bohn really likes to joke around.

454
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,000
Anyone of you here is still single?

455
00:31:58,975 --> 00:32:00,925
My friends wanted to know you.

456
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,400
I'm not.

457
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:05,325
Me neither.

458
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:08,800
But there's someone else up for grabs.

459
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,450
Damn!

460
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:13,750
What?

461
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:16,400
What a player.

462
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,925
Sadly, everyone is taken.

463
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,925
Except for me.

464
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,050
Focus when you are driving.
If you are getting lost,

465
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:28,500
focus on me instead.

466
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:31,299
I know you are single.

467
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,225
I can also see the reason why you are single.

468
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,225
My friend is waiting for the right person.

469
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:44,475
But tonight, he will still be staying single.

470
00:32:49,275 --> 00:32:52,600
Well, he is just joking.

471
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,250
It's common among us.

472
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,550
We always badmouth each other.

473
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:01,207
Let's do something else. Have a drink.

474
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,375
Come on. Cheers!

475
00:33:03,475 --> 00:33:04,775
Cheers!

476
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,975
Bottoms up.

477
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,061
Oh!

478
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,775
My dear Bohn.

479
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:34,450
Not greeting me when you're here?

480
00:33:35,175 --> 00:33:36,575
Hello, Tiao.

481
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:37,725
Hello.

482
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,550
I was thinking to ask you
for a free round after I'm drunk.

483
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:47,800
You shouldn't be driving here then.

484
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,600
By the way,

485
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,100
a question.

486
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,825
The girl you gave the birthday cake to.
Is she your girlfriend?

487
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,300
No, she's not.

488
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,050
I'm not serious.

489
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,675
You know I don't like commitments.

490
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,275
Keeping options open I see.

491
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:10,750
You're here to get yourself drunk too.

492
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,875
I don't mind telling you this.

493
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,275
I saw the girl hitting on
that guy over there just now.

494
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:32,625
He's getting high.

495
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,225
Stop it!

496
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,450
It feels hot. I'm so hot.

497
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:45,550
Hey! Stop stripping!

498
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,525
What took you so long?

499
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,275
Your washroom is in the universe?

500
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,425
I talked with Tiao.

501
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,500
Hey.

502
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,925
Isn't that the medical student
you brought to our college today?

503
00:35:17,225 --> 00:35:19,800
It feels like he doesn't belong here.

504
00:35:23,675 --> 00:35:24,550
He drinks too.

505
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,575
Stop spacing out. Drink.

506
00:35:26,575 --> 00:35:28,575
Come on. Cheers.

507
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,000
Phu, pour me another glass.

508
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,050
I'm Ram.

509
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,025
Are you drunk?

510
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,050
How do you know I'm drunk?

511
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,525
Our minds are in sync.

512
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:12,250
You saw me, right? Where are you? Tell me.

513
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,050
Who are you talking to?

514
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,325
Give me back my phone.

515
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,400
No. I won't return it until I know
who you are talking to.

516
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,550
Why did you lock your phone?

517
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,125
Tell me your passcode.

518
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:36,000
Listen to me.

519
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,200
Something protected means...

520
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:41,575
its owner doesn't want anyone to mess with it.

521
00:36:53,775 --> 00:36:55,225
Well,

522
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,250
I'm sorry.

523
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,300
I am jealous.

524
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,125
I only have you in my heart.

525
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,600
I'm afraid someone will take you away.

526
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,850
Please forgive me.

527
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,650
Nang, let's go to the washroom.

528
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,349
I want to fix my makeup.

529
00:37:13,475 --> 00:37:15,425
My face is stinging somehow.

530
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,000
Forgive me, alright?

531
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,650
Let's go.

532
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,875
Bohn.

533
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:39,600
Don't you think that's too much?

534
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:42,175
Although she does deserve it.

535
00:37:44,025 --> 00:37:45,650
I had a chat with Tiao.

536
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:47,872
He said that Nang tried to hit on Duen...

537
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,825
before we arrived.

538
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:51,450
Is that true?

539
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:53,650
Why him though?

540
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,250
It's nothing.

541
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:57,450
You are not serious anyway.

542
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:00,675
I don't like it when others do this to me.

543
00:38:17,975 --> 00:38:19,625
Hey!

544
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,975
Hey! Where are you going?

545
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:24,750
Bohn.

546
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:28,375
Duen.

547
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,950
Bohn.

548
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:40,400
I knew it. You're here.

549
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:44,100
Go over and sit at my table.

550
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,600
I've gone to meet you this morning.

551
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,225
You're still not satisfied?

552
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,275
Morning?

553
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,075
This means...

554
00:38:52,325 --> 00:38:56,200
the body in the picture belongs to you.

555
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,825
Ah! His body!

556
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,375
Act properly.

557
00:39:02,075 --> 00:39:03,850
Senior, why do you want him over there?

558
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:05,675
Hey, Phu.

559
00:39:06,825 --> 00:39:07,875
It's good that you're here.

560
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,475
Bring all your friends to my table.

561
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,200
Otherwise you will be punished.

562
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:18,850
Hey, don't sit there.

563
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:22,325
Get up. Move to his table.

564
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,100
I beg you. Please move to his table.

565
00:39:26,925 --> 00:39:29,025
The more, the merrier.

566
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,200
Trust me.

567
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,050
Are we moving? Let's move.

568
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,125
Duen.

569
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,650
Watch your step. Sit inside.

570
00:39:47,275 --> 00:39:47,925
Sit.

571
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:52,050
Hello, seniors.

572
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,450
Hello.

573
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,150
Hello, everyone.

574
00:39:57,425 --> 00:39:57,975
Bohn.

575
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:00,825
Why did you bring them to our table?

576
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:02,250
You'll see.

577
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:08,625
Enjoy yourselves.

578
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,500
Our juniors wanted to sit with us.

579
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,175
Any complaints?

580
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,350
Why would there be?

581
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:35,975
Is she praising me?

582
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:38,200
She is praising the juniors.

583
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,525
Hey! Hold on!

584
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,550
You are too drunk.

585
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,725
You've had enough.

586
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,275
Oh.

587
00:40:50,675 --> 00:40:52,850
What else can I do if I can't drink?

588
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:57,506
Give me your phone so I can play games.

589
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:01,825
Take it.

590
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,225
Take it back.

591
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,125
What's wrong?

592
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,742
It's protected.

593
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:12,342
Something protected means...

594
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,275
you don't want anyone to mess with it.

595
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,925
Here, I've unlocked it for you.

596
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,900
Thank you.

597
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,325
How do you play this game?

598
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:56,125
You just have to line them up.

599
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,075
How? Show me.

600
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:05,700
Like this.

601
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:08,050
Click here.

602
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:11,275
What? Speak louder.

603
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,600
It's too noisy here.

604
00:42:13,975 --> 00:42:15,975
They seem to be very close.

605
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,250
Click here.

606
00:42:21,175 --> 00:42:21,750
Here.

607
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,575
Try it.

608
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,475
Why does she look familiar?

609
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:40,750
Why?

610
00:42:41,975 --> 00:42:43,450
Have you seen her before?

611
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,625
I'm sleepy.

612
00:42:49,325 --> 00:42:50,400
I wanted to go back.

613
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:54,200
Hey, it's your birthday today.

614
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,375
Stay. You always stay
even after the place is closed.

615
00:43:03,325 --> 00:43:04,075
Oh!

616
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,800
I know!

617
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,025
Don't trust him. I did not hit on him.

618
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:15,000
He hit on me first.

619
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:17,700
What are you talking about?

620
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,425
He only told me how to complete the stage.

621
00:43:28,675 --> 00:43:29,900
It's interesting...

622
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,200
how the guilty one...

623
00:43:34,225 --> 00:43:35,779
always speaks first.

624
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,150
Is she your girlfriend?

625
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,975
No.

626
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,225
That's good.

627
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:53,075
She has a bad personality.

628
00:43:53,075 --> 00:43:57,275
My mom said that a girl who hits on guys at a bar...

629
00:43:57,975 --> 00:43:59,525
is not for a real girlfriend.

630
00:44:14,925 --> 00:44:15,800
Did I say something wrong?

631
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,988
That's ruthless.

632
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,500
Seeing people as a rebound.

633
00:44:19,975 --> 00:44:21,900
She got what she deserved.

634
00:44:28,425 --> 00:44:29,050
Let's go.

635
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:33,025
Senior, please don't use my friend again.

636
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,150
Let's go.

637
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,275
Hey, wait.

638
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,450
Duen is drunk.

639
00:44:41,225 --> 00:44:43,150
I came with a car. I'll send him back.

640
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,750
That's alright.

641
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,250
We can go back on our own.

642
00:44:48,675 --> 00:44:50,275
I insist.

643
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,150
Who are you to him?

644
00:44:57,825 --> 00:44:58,525
Let's go.

645
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,400
We are leaving first. I'm sorry, everyone.

646
00:45:05,425 --> 00:45:07,500
Bye.

647
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,625
Sorry. See you next time.

648
00:45:10,325 --> 00:45:11,275
It's alright.

649
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:12,175
Bye.

650
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:13,375
Let's go. Wait for me.

651
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:45,700
Am I a toy to you?

652
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,550
No.

653
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:48,400
I don't see you as my toy.

654
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,625
I think that you are cute.

655
00:45:54,175 --> 00:45:55,500
Let me poke you.

656
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,875
Is my skin smooth?

657
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:11,575
Not really.

658
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,225
But your skin is.

659
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,175
Yes. I know.

660
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,850
Where is everyone?

661
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,975
They went for lunch.

662
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,150
I'm waiting here for taking my uniform back.

663
00:46:42,225 --> 00:46:44,225
Anyway,

664
00:46:45,025 --> 00:46:47,250
your uniform smells nice.

665
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,375
I'm leaving.
