We have a guest!

14
00:01:10,993 --> 00:01:12,463
Hey!

15
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:15,302
- Welcome! - Hey!

16
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:16,832
There he goes!

17
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:18,202
Sir!

18
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:21,303
- Who's coming? - Hey!

19
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:49,463
Look who it is.

20
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:51,532
He's a national star.

21
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:54,773
Goodness. It's an honour to meet you.

22
00:01:58,043 --> 00:01:59,273
Did you think I'd say that?

23
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:01,282
You crazy pervert.

24
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:06,082
Where did you hide your daughter after you killed her?

25
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:07,823
Just tell us.

26
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:10,591
How was it?

27
00:02:10,592 --> 00:02:11,752
Was it good?

28
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:13,053
Did you enjoy it?

29
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:15,092
You jerk!

30
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:19,562
Hey, hold it.

31
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:22,203
Look at him.

32
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,373
Should I get warmed up today?

33
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,541
One.

34
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:28,572
Two.

35
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:30,173
Three.

36
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:33,512
How noisy.

37
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:34,812
What? You loser.

38
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:39,312
How dare you talk?

39
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:33,803
Why are you doing this to me?

40
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:36,042
I was wrong.

41
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,012
Please let me go.

42
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:39,912
I'll do whatever you ask.

43
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:41,183
Please...

44
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,083
Geum La Hui...

45
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,653
Why did you meet her?

46
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,852
What kind of deal did you make with her? Tell me.

47
00:03:50,423 --> 00:03:53,152
Did that wench blame me for everything?

48
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:54,523
Darn it.

49
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,462
I'll tell you!

50
00:04:02,463 --> 00:04:04,373
I'll tell you everything!

51
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:06,002
I found out...

52
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:09,472
that Bobble was her daughter, and I blackmailed her.

53
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:11,673
I said if she didn't give me money,

54
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,613
I would post it online...

55
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:15,841
and tell everyone.

56
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:18,812
You should be ashamed of yourself!

57
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:20,882
I'm so sorry!

58
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:23,593
But...

59
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:25,593
she's even worse.

60
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:28,222
She asked me...

61
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:30,493
to stop Bobble from doing a live stream.

62
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:33,433
If I couldn't,

63
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:36,103
she said I could kill her!

64
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:38,873
You evil jerk!

65
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,572
What?

66
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,873
She said you could kill her?

67
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:46,812
Yes. I swear I'm telling the truth.

68
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:53,252
I have the entire call recorded on my phone.

69
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:58,423
I'll give you a million dollars.

70
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,723
In return, stop that girl.

71
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:03,632
If you want, I could give you 500,000 dollars more.

72
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:06,363
Do whatever you can to stop her!

73
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:09,033
Kill if you must.

74
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:15,002
How...

75
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:18,442
It's her own daughter!

76
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:20,942
Is that why you killed her?

77
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,642
No! I didn't kill her!

78
00:05:22,743 --> 00:05:24,382
I didn't kill her!

79
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:26,483
I was just going to scare her, but she ran away!

80
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:29,751
But I swear, I didn't kill her.

81
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:31,022
Please let me go.

82
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:34,093
Why did you start Scarlet Letter?

83
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:35,793
What kind of grudge do you have?

84
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:39,093
That wasn't something I wanted to do either.

85
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:42,332
I just did it because someone told me to.

86
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:44,733
Who made you do it?

87
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,272
Was that Geum La Hui too?

88
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:48,803
Well...

89
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:50,743
Well...

90
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:01,723
Even if you don't talk,

91
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:05,793
there are other ways to find out!

92
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:10,163
- Kill him! - Sir!

93
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:19,373
Stop!

94
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:21,303
I'll talk!

95
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:26,913
Who is it?

96
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:29,543
Who made you do it?

97
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:31,283
Who?

98
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:36,723
Who did Joo Yong Ju get caught by? Darn it.

99
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:40,762
Darn it!

100
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:43,863
Hey, you idiot! Don't you know how to drive?

101
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:45,832
What are they up to?

102
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:48,132
Hey!

103
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,103
You're terrible at driving!

104
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:52,072
Yang Jin Mo!

105
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:56,743
Get in the car!

106
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,343
What are you doing? Hurry up and drive!

107
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:00,812
Hurry!

108
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:03,512
Darn it!

109
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:09,582
Get on the sidewalk!

110
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,093
What are you doing? Get him!

111
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,562
I'm sorry, Mr. Bang. We lost him.

112
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:27,103
Do whatever you can...

113
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:31,772
to make sure to bring Yang Jin Mo...

114
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:34,382
in front of me.

115
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,582
Kill him...

116
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:39,012
and bring his head if you have to.

117
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:41,053
I'll hire some more people.

118
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:42,783
Geum La Hui...

119
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:46,392
What does she have in her name?

120
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:49,493
She has the townhouse in Dogok-dong...

121
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:51,432
and the building in Seongsu-dong worth 30 million dollars,

122
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,832
both of which you bought her.

123
00:07:53,062 --> 00:07:55,062
Why is that hers?

124
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:57,632
The house and the 30 million dollars...

125
00:07:58,702 --> 00:08:00,843
were both given to my granddaughter!

126
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:03,202
Go to the courts...

127
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:06,343
and have all of that seized right away...

128
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:08,543
and make her give all of that back!

129
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:09,743
Yes, sir.

130
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:12,382
A murder without a body!

131
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:14,021
Who's the culprit?

132
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:15,983
- Lee Hwi So! - Lee Hwi So!

133
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:18,793
Let's punish Lee Hwi So, the scum of the earth!

134
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:22,362
- Jingle - Jingle

135
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:25,832
- Baduk's bell is jingling - Baduk's bell is jingling

136
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,433
(Lee Hui So deserves the death penalty.)

137
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:32,102
- Bobble's bell is jingling - Bobble's bell is jingling

138
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:33,332
There's her mom!

139
00:08:35,203 --> 00:08:37,472
- Where are you going? - Don't do this. Move.

140
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:38,671
Please, let me go!

141
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:39,842
What are you saying?

142
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:41,213
You're not going anywhere.

143
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,483
- Let go! - What are you doing?

144
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:52,723
Do you have nothing else to do?

145
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,391
You're here all day banging on your drums.

146
00:08:54,392 --> 00:08:55,421
Are you having a party?

147
00:08:55,422 --> 00:08:57,092
This is the home of a victim who lost her daughter!

148
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:58,093
The victim!

149
00:08:58,094 --> 00:08:59,791
Are you on her side because she lives downstairs?

150
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,732
You're supporting a criminal.

151
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,202
Do you want me to post your face on the Internet?

152
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:04,402
Take my photo!

153
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:06,432
Do you think I'm scared? Do it!

154
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:08,743
- Really? - Take her photo.

155
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:11,372
- Hey! - He's a criminal!

156
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:13,141
- Take my photo! - Hey!

157
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:16,142
- Do it! - Enough!

158
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:20,583
Honey, come on out. You have a guest.

159
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,882
Hello, sir.

160
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,092
I was going to call you...

161
00:09:26,093 --> 00:09:29,622
because I was worried about my honey's health.

162
00:09:29,623 --> 00:09:31,333
You came just in time.

163
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:32,733
I asked him...

164
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:36,063
to come today for you.

165
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,372
Me?

166
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:39,103
It's a geriatric pregnancy and your first,

167
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:42,142
so I should take special care of you.

168
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:44,943
Take her pulse.

169
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:46,142
Yes, sir.

170
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:49,083
Gosh, honey.

171
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:51,613
I'm an OB-GYN.

172
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:53,713
I'll take good care of myself.

173
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:56,453
Please check Mr. Bang.

174
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:58,021
I'm worried he might collapse.

175
00:09:58,022 --> 00:09:59,353
Let him check you!

176
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,073
How is she?

177
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:15,972
I have a weak pulse,

178
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:17,943
so you can't feel it. Right?

179
00:10:19,743 --> 00:10:20,743
Congratulations!

180
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:23,382
Your baby is very healthy.

181
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:27,953
Based on her pulse, I believe that it's a son.

182
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:30,921
"A son?"

183
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,323
A son? Me?

184
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:34,493
Yes.

185
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:36,192
- Dr. Park. - Yes, sir?

186
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:37,761
You can go now.

187
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,833
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:47,032
See? The baby is healthy.

189
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:49,472
I've been taking extra good care of myself.

190
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:51,243
Aren't you happy that it's a boy?

191
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:53,171
We got some good news,

192
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:55,812
so why don't you and I go to Jeju Island...

193
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:56,882
You!

194
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:00,823
Honey, why...

195
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,521
What if something happens to the baby?

196
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:06,922
How long were you planning to lie to me...

197
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:10,262
about your fake pregnancy?

198
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:19,431
It's been four days since Bang went missing.

199
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:21,202
The people are distraught...

200
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:23,271
as there are still no updates on her whereabouts.

201
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:24,942
The police have announced...

202
00:11:24,943 --> 00:11:27,681
that due to the possibility that Bang could've gone down the river,

203
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:30,983
they will expand their search area to the Han River basin.

204
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:33,921
Up until now, there has been no trace...

205
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:36,381
of Bang's cell phone or personal items,

206
00:11:36,382 --> 00:11:38,651
so they cannot confirm if she is still alive.

207
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:40,891
- As a result, - Where on earth are you hiding?

208
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:42,222
there are more questions than answers.

209
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:44,261
Are you dead or alive, Bang Da Mi?

210
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:45,732
They have asked to refrain...

211
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:46,992
from spreading false rumours.

212
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:48,233
We're in trouble, Ms. Geum.

213
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:50,202
Taeyang Investment Industry Development...

214
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:52,473
is taking back their 20-million-dollar investment.

215
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,501
What? What's the reason?

216
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:57,672
I don't know. They just gave us a notice.

217
00:11:58,073 --> 00:11:59,572
If we lose this investment,

218
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:01,613
we have to stop production of the drama.

219
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:03,713
And this...

220
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:06,613
We received a letter from the court.

221
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:09,622
The creditor, Bang Chil Sung, has requested a seizure...

222
00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:12,152
on Geumbit Building which is registered under your name.

223
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:14,292
A seizure...

224
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:25,833
I'm sorry!

225
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:29,502
Please forgive me.

226
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:31,572
I wanted to have your child so badly...

227
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:33,011
that I unintentionally lied to you.

228
00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:36,312
I must've lost my mind for a second.

229
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:37,752
Your pregnancy...

230
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:40,182
means nothing to me.

231
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,993
Why did you lie about Da Mi?

232
00:12:45,453 --> 00:12:47,692
That wasn't a lie.

233
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:50,761
A girl named Bang Da Mi really came to my hospital...

234
00:12:50,762 --> 00:12:51,963
Shut your mouth!

235
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:58,002
Look. Da Mi...

236
00:12:58,103 --> 00:12:59,171
(No trace of pregnancy in her uterus)

237
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:01,373
never had a child!

238
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:03,373
Why?

239
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:06,473
Was it because of money?

240
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:10,652
To pay back your ex-husband's debts?

241
00:13:12,953 --> 00:13:15,182
- Sir... - Prepare yourself.

242
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:17,752
I'm going to make sure...

243
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:20,792
your medical license gets revoked!

244
00:13:20,993 --> 00:13:24,792
I'm going to take back my building!

245
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:28,703
If you had honestly told me you needed money,

246
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:30,563
I would've given it to you.

247
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:35,443
Because my feelings for you...

248
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:38,613
were true.

249
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:46,012
Bang Chil Sung.

250
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:50,823
You would've given me money?

251
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:54,823
Who do you think you're trying to fool?

252
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:58,391
If I had mentioned money to you,

253
00:13:58,392 --> 00:14:00,463
you would've taken my hospital out of your building.

254
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:03,102
You would've thrown a huge fit to make sure...

255
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:04,833
I could never step foot in this house again.

256
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:07,031
It's not like you can take...

257
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:09,072
all of that money with you when you die,

258
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:11,842
but all you care about is money. You frugal little Scrooge!

259
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:13,342
Cha Ju Ran!

260
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:14,782
It's been five years!

261
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:16,382
The only favour you gave me...

262
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,612
was the 100 dollars you took off my rent...

263
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:20,282
and then you bragged about it!

264
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:23,552
You would've given me money?

265
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:25,092
No way!

266
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:26,922
If you had hated me so much,

267
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:29,761
you should've left sooner!

268
00:14:29,762 --> 00:14:30,792
Why should I?

269
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:33,932
I want the money that I worked for.

270
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:36,962
Pay me for being your personal physician...

271
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,171
and for sleeping with you for five years.

272
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:40,203
How dare you throw a tantrum?

273
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:42,843
Don't you feel bad for that girl?

274
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,372
Even if she were dead,

275
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:47,542
was it my fault?

276
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:51,882
You're the first person who abandoned Da Mi.

277
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:55,622
If you had really thought of Da Mi as your granddaughter,

278
00:14:55,623 --> 00:14:58,093
you should've believed her when she said it wasn't her.

279
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:02,122
Even when the world was cursing and pointing fingers at her,

280
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:04,063
you should've protected her!

281
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:11,733
Da Mi died because of you!

282
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:13,801
It's because of you, a man who's so worried...

283
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:15,802
that something bad would happen to his money!

284
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,412
Understand?

285
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:18,873
Get out.

286
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:20,813
Get out!

287
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:24,213
Hey! Drag this woman out of here!

288
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:29,782
Why should I? This is my house.

289
00:15:30,252 --> 00:15:32,551
Hey! Let go of me.

290
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:34,422
I said let go of me! You...

291
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:36,092
Have you lost your minds?

292
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:37,733
I refuse to leave!

293
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:40,432
What did I do wrong?

294
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:42,363
Let go of me!

295
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:45,902
Let go!

296
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:52,672
Hey!

297
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,782
Why would that old man suddenly...

298
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:09,262
Did he figure it out?

299
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,762
(Chairman Bang)

300
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:22,172
Hello.

301
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:24,743
The money that I gave you...

302
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:28,243
was used to kill my granddaughter.

303
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:33,382
I swear on the deity...

304
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:36,382
that the rest of my money...

305
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:38,892
will be used...

306
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,162
to kill you, Geum La Hui.

307
00:17:08,353 --> 00:17:10,083
(Geum La Hui)

308
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:13,452
What?

309
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:15,563
You're going to tell him I'm not pregnant?

310
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:17,422
That's not the problem.

311
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,492
Chairman Bang has started...

312
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:21,303
his revenge for Bang Da Mi.

313
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:27,302
What are we going to do?

314
00:17:27,303 --> 00:17:28,802
If they take back their investment,

315
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:30,671
all the actors who haven't signed on will leave.

316
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:31,912
Are you serious?

317
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:33,441
Once something is mine,

318
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,382
it stays mine even if it's broken and turned to dust.

319
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,982
It's not over until I say it's over!

320
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:41,583
(Seoul Detention Center)

321
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,492
Honey!

322
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:52,932
Da Mi... Did they find her?

323
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:56,632
Not yet.

324
00:17:57,162 --> 00:18:00,273
Don't worry. She'll come back safely.

325
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:02,671
She's never disappointed us before.

326
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:04,171
I'm sure she's alive.

327
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:05,273
I'll find her.

328
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:07,982
Of course, my daughter.

329
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:11,382
Have some of the memories come back from that night?

330
00:18:12,952 --> 00:18:14,783
Only bits and pieces.

331
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,881
It's probably because of the drugs.

332
00:18:16,882 --> 00:18:19,191
They said they found drugs in your system.

333
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,961
I've never taken drugs!

334
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:23,563
I know. I trust you.

335
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:30,363
They said they found the same drug on our veranda.

336
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:32,732
Who did it?

337
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:35,603
Who came to the house?

338
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:37,402
No matter how much I think about it,

339
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:39,773
there's only one person.

340
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,412
Captain Nam Chul Woo from Deokseon Police Station.

341
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:46,452
Captain Nam?

342
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:49,283
He came into the house looking for the escapee.

343
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,263
My goodness...

344
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:57,462
It's nice and cold.

345
00:18:57,932 --> 00:18:59,132
Okay, then.

346
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:09,603
He must've drugged my drink.

347
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:12,612
Why? Why would he do this to me?

348
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:14,013
Your time is up. Come out.

349
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:15,512
Hold on.

350
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:17,951
Honey. Da Mi's grandfather said he'd help us!

351
00:19:17,952 --> 00:19:20,411
So you can't give up. Understand?

352
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:21,982
Is there anything else you remember?

353
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:23,452
Honey!

354
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:36,131
(Teen reported missing from Seoul Culture Forest...)

355
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,262
(My husband is not that kind of person!)

356
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:38,332
(Please find my missing daughter, Da Mi!)

357
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,402
(Medical Certificate)

358
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,671
(Medical Certificate)

359
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:43,772
(Patient Name: Bang Da Mi)

360
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:44,773
(No trace of pregnancy in patient's uterus)

361
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,612
(Could not find lochia in the patient's uterus.)

362
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:50,543
(No trace of pregnancy.)

363
00:19:58,753 --> 00:20:00,853
That's it for today. Class president?

364
00:20:01,093 --> 00:20:03,293
Attention. Bow.

365
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,533
- Thank you. - Thank you.

366
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:10,863
- Gosh. - Why is my body so sore?

367
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:13,472
Who are you?

368
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:16,702
Hello. I'm Da Mi's mom.

369
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:19,441
Hello, ma'am.

370
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:21,142
Is she the criminal's wife?

371
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:23,382
How brazen of her.

372
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,712
I came because I had something to ask you.

373
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:29,053
What happened the last day Da Mi went to school?

374
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,782
Who was the student who fought with Da Mi?

375
00:20:30,783 --> 00:20:32,023
I need to meet them.

376
00:20:32,922 --> 00:20:34,462
I cannot tell you that.

377
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:36,592
It was just Da Mi's accusation.

378
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:38,363
That student was very hurt as well.

379
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:40,632
As their homeroom teacher, I must protect the victim.

380
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:42,832
Da Mi is your student too.

381
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,972
Da Mi is no longer a student of Myeongju Girls' High School.

382
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:46,632
She was expelled before she died.

383
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:48,602
Da Mi is not dead yet.

384
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:49,873
Don't speak so carelessly.

385
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:54,543
Everyone. Please tell me.

386
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,612
Why did that student do that to Da Mi?

387
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:58,552
Tell me what you know. Please.

388
00:20:58,553 --> 00:20:59,952
You cannot do this.

389
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:01,283
I need to proceed to class.

390
00:21:01,382 --> 00:21:02,852
Class president. Call the security guard.

391
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:03,853
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:05,421
Anything is okay,

393
00:21:05,422 --> 00:21:07,421
so please tell me something. I beg of you.

394
00:21:07,422 --> 00:21:09,491
- Ma'am. Please calm down and leave. - Do you not know anything?

395
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:10,593
Please!

396
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:13,533
The school has decided to cover up...

397
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,803
the fight between Mone and Da Mi.

398
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,472
If anyone posts videos...

399
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:20,273
or comments online,

400
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,103
the school will track the IP address and punish the student accordingly.

401
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:24,972
So keep your mouths shut.

402
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:27,543
Answer!

403
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:30,442
Tell me who it was.

404
00:21:30,513 --> 00:21:31,882
I need to know!

405
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:35,152
Please!

406
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:38,293
Why won't anyone tell me anything?

407
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:40,353
Please tell me!

408
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:46,492
Did you see that?

409
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,373
How insane.

410
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:02,313
The girl who had the baby...

411
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:05,813
was Han Mone.

412
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:08,682
Han Mone?

413
00:22:09,482 --> 00:22:11,293
You can look her up online. She's an actress.

414
00:22:13,152 --> 00:22:14,823
Da Mi accused Mone...

415
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:17,992
of planning all of this to frame her.

416
00:22:19,563 --> 00:22:20,833
I believe Da Mi.

417
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,103
Han Mone was the one who had a baby!

418
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:30,941
I've kept my mouth shut for this long...

419
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:32,273
to protect Mone's secret.

420
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:34,512
But I can no longer keep silent...

421
00:22:34,513 --> 00:22:36,212
while my dad is being accused.

422
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:39,352
Everyone.

423
00:22:39,353 --> 00:22:41,922
- Everyone. - Stop the broadcast and come out!

424
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:44,282
- Everyone. - Why is your teacher hiding this?

425
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:47,222
She's the one who lied about seeing Da Mi have a baby.

426
00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:50,991
All of our classmates also turned their backs on Da Mi.

427
00:22:50,992 --> 00:22:52,162
But I...

428
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:56,003
think they are so despicable.

429
00:22:56,702 --> 00:22:58,732
I'm Bang Da Mi from Class 2-7.

430
00:22:59,632 --> 00:23:00,802
That night,

431
00:23:00,803 --> 00:23:03,103
someone did have a baby in the art room.

432
00:23:03,202 --> 00:23:05,513
(I report Han Mone's secret.)

433
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:16,783
That fake witch.

434
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,753
You can come down now, Han Mone.

435
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:22,162
I'll make sure everyone knows what kind of person you are.

436
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:24,063
(Send)

437
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,033
(Your mail has been sent!)

438
00:23:34,432 --> 00:23:35,972
Please don't lose...

439
00:23:36,702 --> 00:23:37,803
to Han Mone.

440
00:23:46,313 --> 00:23:48,283
(Honest and virtuous)

441
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:51,182
(Myeongju students)

442
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:54,793
Han Mone.

443
00:23:56,293 --> 00:23:57,692
Do something.

444
00:23:57,962 --> 00:23:59,891
Please stop the old man...

445
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:01,632
with that smart head of yours you used to threaten me.

446
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:04,033
You made this whole mess!

447
00:24:04,462 --> 00:24:07,073
If you hadn't sold me out to Scarlet Letter,

448
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,172
none of this would've happened.

449
00:24:09,803 --> 00:24:11,941
My company is about to go down!

450
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:13,212
It's the same for me.

451
00:24:13,343 --> 00:24:14,642
If I lose my medical license,

452
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:16,912
I won't be able to make a living.

453
00:24:23,053 --> 00:24:24,891
- Who is this? - Hello.

454
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:26,593
I'm from the realtor's office.

455
00:24:26,892 --> 00:24:28,593
I was told you put the house up for sale.

456
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,732
I never did that.

457
00:24:38,232 --> 00:24:40,432
Do you know how tough that man can be?

458
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:43,002
We could never...

459
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:44,773
beat him in a fight.

460
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,412
Are you suggesting we just sit and wait to die?

461
00:24:50,982 --> 00:24:53,952
We have nothing to lose now.

462
00:24:58,952 --> 00:25:00,023
That old man...

463
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:01,992
hasn't revised his will yet, right?

464
00:25:02,492 --> 00:25:03,593
The hospital building...

465
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:05,662
is mine for now.

466
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:07,432
He said I would get...

467
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:11,632
his entire inheritance once the baby was born.

468
00:25:20,942 --> 00:25:23,783
What are you thinking?

469
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:30,452
The same thing as you.

470
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,422
It can't be...

471
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:45,802
Did you find Joo Yong Ju?

472
00:25:45,803 --> 00:25:47,402
He still hasn't been found.

473
00:25:48,402 --> 00:25:49,472
But...

474
00:25:50,202 --> 00:25:51,843
you were right.

475
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:55,442
I got Bobble's family relation certificate.

476
00:25:55,813 --> 00:25:57,343
Her grandfather...

477
00:25:57,382 --> 00:25:59,053
is a very wealthy man.

478
00:26:01,422 --> 00:26:02,651
Bang Hyun Woo.

479
00:26:02,652 --> 00:26:04,892
Bang Chil...

480
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:09,822
Chairman Bang Chil Sung...

481
00:26:09,823 --> 00:26:11,432
of Taeyang Investment Industry Development?

482
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:15,103
Darn it! What is this?

483
00:26:15,432 --> 00:26:16,932
No!

484
00:26:17,103 --> 00:26:18,632
We poked a beehive.

485
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:21,472
He's a super cash-rich man only known by a few people.

486
00:26:21,702 --> 00:26:23,171
He can smell money from a mile away...

487
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:25,742
and always invests first in land about to be developed.

488
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:28,843
What will happen to Yong Ju, then?

489
00:26:28,912 --> 00:26:31,553
You fool! Is he important right now?

490
00:26:31,652 --> 00:26:33,382
My life is at risk here!

491
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:36,323
Then what should we do now?

492
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:45,533
Gather as many boys as possible.

493
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:47,692
Before that old man attacks us,

494
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:49,503
we'll attack first.

495
00:26:53,632 --> 00:26:55,573
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

496
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:58,141
- Thank you, everyone. - Here.

497
00:26:58,142 --> 00:26:59,741
- I think it will be a hit. - Me too.

498
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:01,712
Hello. I'm Han Mone.

499
00:27:03,382 --> 00:27:05,813
You're much more beautiful in person.

500
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:07,152
Mr. Ha Do Kwon.

501
00:27:07,382 --> 00:27:10,382
You know I'm playing Ma Doo Kyung, your homeroom teacher, right?

502
00:27:10,482 --> 00:27:11,622
I look forward to working with you.

503
00:27:11,623 --> 00:27:13,451
It's an honour to meet you in person.

504
00:27:13,452 --> 00:27:14,722
I look forward to working with you.

505
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:16,191
It's an honour for me. Take a seat.

506
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:17,293
Yes, sir.

507
00:27:18,023 --> 00:27:19,232
You arrived last.

508
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:21,462
I'm sorry.

509
00:27:21,803 --> 00:27:24,731
Director. I think this drama will be a hit.

510
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:26,573
We have a fresh, new face.

511
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:28,742
I think we might get on an online streaming platform.

512
00:27:29,972 --> 00:27:31,843
We should. It'll be a hit.

513
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:34,112
Okay. I think everyone is here now.

514
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:35,911
Let's start the reading.

515
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:38,552
I will be your director. My name is Kwak...

516
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:41,052
- I need to see her. - Please be quiet.

517
00:27:41,053 --> 00:27:42,582
- I need to. - You cannot do that.

518
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,422
- I need to ask her something. - Please, ma'am.

519
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:49,623
Who is that?

520
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:55,202
I'm...

521
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:57,863
Da Mi's mom.

522
00:27:59,232 --> 00:28:00,402
Who is Da Mi?

523
00:28:05,573 --> 00:28:06,672
Why did you want to see me?

524
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:10,083
How could you frame the friend that helped you?

525
00:28:10,642 --> 00:28:13,212
Did you think you could keep your secret forever if Da Mi disappeared?

526
00:28:13,882 --> 00:28:15,982
The secret that you were the one who had the baby at school!

527
00:28:17,382 --> 00:28:18,492
- What? - Baby?

528
00:28:20,192 --> 00:28:21,353
Excuse me.

529
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:24,093
Is this about Bobble, right?

530
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,592
There was a rumour that she was in the same school as Han Mone.

531
00:28:27,593 --> 00:28:29,932
So Bobble wasn't the one who had the baby...

532
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:33,972
Han Mone. Was it you?

533
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:37,942
I don't know what you're talking about.

534
00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:41,042
I'm not close to Da Mi at all.

535
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:42,282
I've never even talked to her.

536
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:43,712
Lies.

537
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:46,312
I know you and Da Mi...

538
00:28:46,313 --> 00:28:48,523
had a fight on the day Da Mi disappeared.

539
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:50,722
You planned it from the beginning, didn't you?

540
00:28:50,922 --> 00:28:53,252
Did you plan to use Da Mi as your scapegoat?

541
00:28:53,253 --> 00:28:55,063
How could you do that to a friend?

542
00:28:55,392 --> 00:28:57,093
How can you call yourself human?

543
00:28:57,392 --> 00:28:59,392
How could you?

544
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:01,461
I think you need to stop her, Director Kwak.

545
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:02,603
Ma'am!

546
00:29:03,763 --> 00:29:06,172
Outsiders are not allowed in here.

547
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:08,803
If you don't stop, we'll have to call the police.

548
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:10,103
Why are you just standing there?

549
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:11,502
Let's talk outside, ma'am.

550
00:29:11,503 --> 00:29:12,742
- Please. - Let go!

551
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:16,313
You don't deserve to be an actress.

552
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:19,052
Now that I know the truth, I'm going to show the world...

553
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:21,253
what you did to Da Mi. You wait and see.

554
00:29:23,922 --> 00:29:26,553
I apologize for causing a scene.

555
00:29:29,722 --> 00:29:31,662
What is this, seriously?

556
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:35,662
- Wait. - Unbelievable.

557
00:29:36,662 --> 00:29:38,303
Where is she going?

558
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:41,702
Han Mone.

559
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:42,972
Is this true?

560
00:29:43,472 --> 00:29:45,313
This rumour isn't new, is it?

561
00:29:46,273 --> 00:29:47,411
This is...

562
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,813
a big issue for our drama.

563
00:29:51,242 --> 00:29:53,753
Well...

564
00:29:54,382 --> 00:29:55,783
The thing is...

565
00:29:55,882 --> 00:29:57,053
Let's cancel...

566
00:29:58,652 --> 00:29:59,722
today's reading.

567
00:30:01,662 --> 00:30:04,492
It seems we might need a new actress.

568
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,863
Go home, everyone.

569
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:10,063
I can't believe this.

570
00:30:10,563 --> 00:30:12,872
Da Mi was an outcast since the day she came to my school.

571
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:14,971
She was jealous of me from the start.

572
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:16,472
She made it all up!

573
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,612
Mr. Ha. It's not true at all.

574
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:21,373
She's just taking it out on me.

575
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:23,141
Will you please believe me?

576
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:24,242
Hands off!

577
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:26,082
You brazen thing.

578
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:28,013
I hated you from the start.

579
00:30:28,623 --> 00:30:29,623
You're filthy.

580
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:30,982
Mr. Ha.

581
00:30:44,363 --> 00:30:48,033
Sir. I found the girl who framed Da Mi.

582
00:30:48,343 --> 00:30:49,373
Han Mone.

583
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:50,842
She's an actress.

584
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:52,873
Do you know who her agent is?

585
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:54,712
It's Geum La Hui.

586
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,142
Geum La Hui?

587
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:01,013
From now on,

588
00:31:02,053 --> 00:31:04,083
you can leave it to me.

589
00:31:09,093 --> 00:31:10,763
This won't do.

590
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:14,162
Call the journalists.

591
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:19,833
Tell them that I, Bang Chil Sung, am Bang Da Mi's grandfather!

592
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:25,512
Prepare a press conference immediately.

593
00:31:25,513 --> 00:31:26,573
Yes, sir.

594
00:31:31,952 --> 00:31:34,013
Seven Star Convention Hall.

595
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:36,482
Do whatever it takes...

596
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:39,552
to stop Bang Chil Sung from talking to the press.

597
00:31:39,553 --> 00:31:41,253
- Yes, boss! - Yes, boss!

598
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:13,492
Old man.

599
00:32:14,123 --> 00:32:16,263
You picked the fight with me.

600
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:18,962
You brought it upon yourself.

601
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:25,172
(Han Mone)

602
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:29,503
What is it?

603
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:32,043
I told you we should keep our distance for the time being.

604
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:34,441
Da Mi's mom came to the script reading.

605
00:32:34,442 --> 00:32:35,513
Her adoptive mom.

606
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:38,013
- What? - She knows everything.

607
00:32:38,242 --> 00:32:39,411
That I had a baby...

608
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:41,783
and framed Da Mi for it. Everything!

609
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:44,352
What do you want me to do about it?

610
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:46,952
Do you know you got mud on me too?

611
00:32:47,023 --> 00:32:48,151
Don't call me.

612
00:32:48,152 --> 00:32:50,262
Call your agent Geum La Hui!

613
00:32:50,263 --> 00:32:52,932
How can she help me when she knows nothing?

614
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,863
K. Talk to K for me.

615
00:32:57,232 --> 00:32:58,832
He could help.

616
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,731
I said he left for the States!

617
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:02,142
I can't reach him!

618
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:06,543
The bigger problem is Da Mi's grandfather.

619
00:33:06,912 --> 00:33:08,113
What about him?

620
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:11,013
Didn't you know her grandfather's loaded?

621
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:14,783
You went after someone you shouldn't have, you halfwit!

622
00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:28,461
(Calling: K)

623
00:33:28,462 --> 00:33:30,962
The person is unable to answer the phone.

624
00:33:31,103 --> 00:33:33,033
Please try again.

625
00:33:43,242 --> 00:33:46,013
No. I can't go down like this.

626
00:33:46,952 --> 00:33:48,823
I must find a way out.

627
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:09,772
Enjoy your meal, boss!

628
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:11,403
- Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal.

629
00:34:26,222 --> 00:34:28,592
What's the matter with you? Stuff your face.

630
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:30,023
Leave him alone.

631
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:32,233
He's not hungry yet.

632
00:34:38,362 --> 00:34:39,432
Inmate 1888.

633
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:42,043
Your lawyer's here.

634
00:34:49,182 --> 00:34:51,313
How the heck did he get a lawyer?

635
00:35:13,373 --> 00:35:15,742
I'm Kim Soon Pyung from Hanwool Law Firm.

636
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:18,273
I didn't hire a lawyer.

637
00:35:19,142 --> 00:35:20,342
Take a seat first.

638
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:22,083
Okay.

639
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:28,253
Do you know Chairman Bang Chil Sung?

640
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:31,423
He sent me...

641
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:33,653
to help you.

642
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:37,592
But as of right now,

643
00:35:38,423 --> 00:35:40,633
the proof and motive of murder is so clear,

644
00:35:40,963 --> 00:35:42,462
even the best lawyer in the world...

645
00:35:42,463 --> 00:35:44,333
can't prove you're not guilty.

646
00:35:44,432 --> 00:35:46,201
I really didn't do anything at all.

647
00:35:46,202 --> 00:35:48,773
I know that you feel wronged.

648
00:35:50,103 --> 00:35:53,043
Are you aware Chairman Bang will hold a press conference?

649
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:54,673
No.

650
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:58,713
Your wife didn't tell you, then.

651
00:36:00,483 --> 00:36:04,752
He's planning a press conference today at 6pm to prove...

652
00:36:04,753 --> 00:36:07,123
your and Da Mi's innocence.

653
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:11,563
I need to ask you some questions.

654
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:15,333
Captain Nam Chul Woo from the Deokseon Police Station.

655
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:17,133
Is there any animosity between you two?

656
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:18,873
Not at all.

657
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,503
He drugged me.

658
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:24,403
He has to be involved in what happened to Da Mi.

659
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,313
So that's what happened.

660
00:36:33,153 --> 00:36:36,083
He was promoted to Police Chief yesterday.

661
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:37,982
It's not even the promotion season,

662
00:36:37,983 --> 00:36:39,692
and of all his classmates,

663
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:42,023
he was the first to make Chief.

664
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:44,662
Don't you find that odd?

665
00:36:45,222 --> 00:36:46,662
I need to see him.

666
00:36:47,432 --> 00:36:49,003
I have something to say.

667
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:53,403
The press conference is at 6pm.

668
00:36:53,702 --> 00:36:57,443
We must prove before then that Captain Nam was involved.

669
00:36:58,443 --> 00:37:00,072
There's no time.

670
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:03,443
Only one person can save you, Mr. Lee.

671
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,112
Who's that?

672
00:37:07,253 --> 00:37:10,023
It's you.

673
00:37:21,733 --> 00:37:22,762
Is it true?

674
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:25,702
I want to speak with you alone.

675
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,071
(Agreement to Break Exclusive Contract)

676
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:35,342
Let's not waste our breath.

677
00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:37,812
There's more than enough cause to break the contract.

678
00:37:37,813 --> 00:37:38,813
Sign it.

679
00:37:39,353 --> 00:37:40,812
Give me a chance to explain myself.

680
00:37:40,813 --> 00:37:42,383
I don't care about the facts.

681
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,322
What's clear is that...

682
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:47,392
I can't work with an actor involved in this scandal.

683
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:51,092
Our management deal is over as of today.

684
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:52,531
I can't break the deal.

685
00:37:52,532 --> 00:37:54,133
Do you think you're making sense?

686
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:56,732
You're in your teens, and you had a baby.

687
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,503
The whole world is talking about it.

688
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:02,273
Didn't you know your past, present, and future would come out?

689
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,742
I don't know how this all came to be,

690
00:38:06,112 --> 00:38:09,781
but I bet the stupid girl fell for your shameless act.

691
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:11,642
Who are you worried about?

692
00:38:12,483 --> 00:38:15,552
The person you should care about is the actress you signed on.

693
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:21,091
You piece of trash.

694
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:22,722
Don't you have a sliver of a conscience?

695
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:25,592
I had a bad feeling about you when you lied about your age.

696
00:38:26,032 --> 00:38:27,361
That your family's rich...

697
00:38:27,362 --> 00:38:29,233
and your mom runs a business in the US.

698
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:30,903
They're all lies, aren't they?

699
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:33,032
I can't believe I fell for your dirty lies.

700
00:38:34,472 --> 00:38:37,443
Be grateful I won't sue you for breach of contract.

701
00:38:39,673 --> 00:38:41,173
Why should I pay you?

702
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:44,742
When I'm going to be your lifeline?

703
00:38:44,912 --> 00:38:45,952
What?

704
00:38:53,892 --> 00:38:56,862
It's true. I'm the one who gave birth.

705
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:59,092
You're telling the truth now?

706
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:02,562
You acted so dignified that I almost fell for it.

707
00:39:02,563 --> 00:39:03,633
But...

708
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:07,602
don't you want to know whose baby it was?

709
00:39:07,603 --> 00:39:08,633
Not at all.

710
00:39:09,642 --> 00:39:11,241
Sign the agreement and get lost.

711
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:13,313
It's not too late for me to tell you first.

712
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:15,142
I'll tell you...

713
00:39:15,642 --> 00:39:17,112
who the baby's dad is.

714
00:39:32,123 --> 00:39:33,862
I'll give you two hours.

715
00:39:34,162 --> 00:39:37,502
Today, an inmate will be released on bail.

716
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:40,032
I'll arrange it so you get released instead.

717
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:44,202
You'd better be on time.

718
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:46,572
Is that possible?

719
00:39:48,242 --> 00:39:49,713
Chairman Bang made it possible.

720
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,653
Use this.

721
00:39:56,653 --> 00:39:59,452
Captain Nam is on a break and will be at home.

722
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:03,193
I wish you...

723
00:40:04,293 --> 00:40:05,523
great success.

724
00:40:37,392 --> 00:40:38,423
Are you kidding me?

725
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:41,293
You expect me to believe that?

726
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:42,862
I'm not begging.

727
00:40:43,103 --> 00:40:45,202
I'm giving you a chance to use me.

728
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:47,833
If you still worry about the risk...

729
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:52,773
(Hengbok Bank)

730
00:40:53,572 --> 00:40:56,512
I'll return the two million dollars you gave when you signed me.

731
00:40:59,483 --> 00:41:00,583
My answer...

732
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:03,083
is no.

733
00:41:03,282 --> 00:41:04,653
Regardless of whose kid you had,

734
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:06,753
I won't get involved.

735
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,023
You 7, me 3, no down-payment.

736
00:41:10,923 --> 00:41:12,092
You 8, me 2.

737
00:41:13,563 --> 00:41:14,662
You 9, me 1.

738
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:19,532
I promise.

739
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:20,971
Once this drama's done,

740
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:23,503
I'll nab every commercial out there.

741
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:27,512
Wouldn't that be worth the gamble?

742
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:31,883
In return,

743
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,753
I need you to take care of this.

744
00:41:41,523 --> 00:41:42,563
Hello?

745
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:43,963
Where are you?

746
00:41:44,262 --> 00:41:46,162
Mr. Bang is going to hold a press conference.

747
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:48,362
He gathered every journalist out there.

748
00:41:48,392 --> 00:41:49,662
What should we do?

749
00:41:50,362 --> 00:41:51,833
- He's here! - Here he is.

750
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,443
Why would a mourning family want to talk to the press?

751
00:41:58,373 --> 00:41:59,813
Who's mourning?

752
00:42:00,173 --> 00:42:01,242
Da Mi...

753
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:02,883
isn't dead.

754
00:42:02,912 --> 00:42:05,583
Will you reveal something at the press conference?

755
00:42:06,853 --> 00:42:09,782
I'll reveal the truth about...

756
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:12,623
her adoptive father Lee Hwi So.

757
00:42:14,693 --> 00:42:16,793
- Why would you explain now? - Anything else, sir?

758
00:42:18,092 --> 00:42:20,492
You can hear the details at the press conference.

759
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,633
He's leaving.

760
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:27,802
- Gosh. - Darn it.

761
00:42:31,373 --> 00:42:32,412
Who's that?

762
00:43:17,483 --> 00:43:18,623
Who are you?

763
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,952
Did you feed me this?

764
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:23,822
Darn you.

765
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:26,963
What for?

766
00:43:27,633 --> 00:43:28,833
Who hired you?

767
00:43:32,503 --> 00:43:33,972
Hey, Lee Hwi So.

768
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:36,543
You're done for.

769
00:43:36,903 --> 00:43:39,341
You're in a swamp you can never get out of,

770
00:43:39,342 --> 00:43:40,813
you moron.

771
00:43:41,512 --> 00:43:43,342
Get a grip and tell the truth!

772
00:43:43,782 --> 00:43:46,282
What scumbag planned all this?

773
00:43:46,853 --> 00:43:47,982
Who was it?

774
00:43:47,983 --> 00:43:50,452
My Da Mi. Where is she?

775
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,253
I wouldn't know.

776
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,222
I just did as I was told.

777
00:43:57,492 --> 00:43:59,633
Who told you to do this?

778
00:44:05,873 --> 00:44:06,903
Give up.

779
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:09,202
You'll never find her.

780
00:44:12,273 --> 00:44:13,713
Tell me.

781
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:15,713
Tell me, you punk!

782
00:44:36,903 --> 00:44:37,963
Die.

783
00:44:55,682 --> 00:44:56,883
Sir.

784
00:44:57,253 --> 00:44:58,282
It's Lee Hwi So.

785
00:44:58,682 --> 00:44:59,822
Lee Hwi...

786
00:44:59,952 --> 00:45:02,353
How did you manage to call me?

787
00:45:02,563 --> 00:45:03,923
At Captain Nam Chul Woo's home,

788
00:45:04,923 --> 00:45:06,262
I found a bag of drugs.

789
00:45:07,262 --> 00:45:08,563
Show it as evidence.

790
00:45:09,262 --> 00:45:12,063
I'll come to where the press conference will be held.

791
00:45:12,302 --> 00:45:13,903
Where are you now?

792
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:15,602
At Captain Nam's place.

793
00:45:15,603 --> 00:45:19,673
How come you're there and not behind bars?

794
00:45:20,112 --> 00:45:21,842
You pulled some strings.

795
00:45:22,813 --> 00:45:24,313
The lawyer you sent me...

796
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:26,583
got me two hours.

797
00:45:26,883 --> 00:45:29,523
What lawyer are you talking about?

798
00:45:29,753 --> 00:45:32,282
I never sent you a lawyer.

799
00:45:33,052 --> 00:45:34,353
Kim Soon Pyung.

800
00:45:35,293 --> 00:45:36,693
You didn't send him?

801
00:45:37,923 --> 00:45:39,532
Get out of there right now.

802
00:45:39,992 --> 00:45:41,892
Go back to lock-up.

803
00:45:42,563 --> 00:45:43,862
No, wait.

804
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,403
I'll come to you.

805
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:47,403
Yes.

806
00:45:47,932 --> 00:45:50,403
Okay. I'll see you there.

807
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,002
Bye.

808
00:45:52,003 --> 00:45:53,373
What a mess.

809
00:45:55,512 --> 00:45:58,242
- Go to Deokseon Park quickly. - Yes, sir.

810
00:46:07,653 --> 00:46:08,753
Untie him!

811
00:46:13,092 --> 00:46:14,233
Are you all right?

812
00:46:14,532 --> 00:46:17,862
Lee Hwi So threatened me with a carved toothbrush...

813
00:46:18,463 --> 00:46:20,003
and took my phone.

814
00:46:20,503 --> 00:46:22,003
He took my phone.

815
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:23,943
We have an emergency. Code Zero.

816
00:46:24,003 --> 00:46:26,112
Inmate 1888 broke out.

817
00:46:26,173 --> 00:46:27,242
Come with me!

818
00:46:51,702 --> 00:46:54,072
(Deokseon, the safest city that is loved and respected)

819
00:46:55,972 --> 00:46:57,141
He's near Deokseon Park.

820
00:46:57,142 --> 00:46:58,173
Let's go.

821
00:46:58,802 --> 00:47:00,173
- Let's go. - Hurry.

822
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:08,782
(Do not smoke in Deokseon Park.)

823
00:47:33,112 --> 00:47:35,472
(Deokseon Park Suspension Bridge)

824
00:48:15,112 --> 00:48:16,282
Lee Hwi So!

825
00:48:16,682 --> 00:48:17,782
Is that you?

826
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:24,092
It's you?

827
00:48:24,762 --> 00:48:26,793
When did you get on my tail?

828
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,702
Cancel the press conference!

829
00:48:30,563 --> 00:48:33,532
We'll find you a place to waste away in comfort.

830
00:48:34,673 --> 00:48:36,173
That's best for everyone.

831
00:48:36,742 --> 00:48:38,142
Don't even dream of it!

832
00:48:38,802 --> 00:48:40,011
You dare...

833
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:43,182
attack my granddaughter?

834
00:48:43,443 --> 00:48:46,012
Do you think we killed her or something?

835
00:48:46,912 --> 00:48:48,083
What's clear...

836
00:48:48,452 --> 00:48:50,583
is that it wasn't Lee Hwi So!

837
00:48:52,353 --> 00:48:55,153
If you'd been this great a grandpa from the start,

838
00:48:55,392 --> 00:48:56,492
Da Mi,

839
00:48:56,762 --> 00:48:57,923
that girl...

840
00:48:58,822 --> 00:49:00,793
wouldn't have ended up that way.

841
00:49:00,892 --> 00:49:03,662
I'll pay for whatever it is I did.

842
00:49:04,032 --> 00:49:06,802
But you, Geum La Hui!

843
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:09,903
I swear on my life...

844
00:49:10,003 --> 00:49:12,003
that I will kill you!

845
00:49:12,912 --> 00:49:14,112
Cha Ju Ran!

846
00:49:15,412 --> 00:49:16,583
You too!

847
00:49:16,782 --> 00:49:18,612
Do you even have the strength to?

848
00:49:19,483 --> 00:49:22,452
You're an old man who's nothing without his money.

849
00:49:23,222 --> 00:49:24,253
So,

850
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:27,353
what gave you the guts to come here alone?

851
00:49:27,892 --> 00:49:29,563
How dare you?

852
00:49:30,523 --> 00:49:31,662
Let go!

853
00:49:32,023 --> 00:49:33,162
Let go!

854
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:38,261
Get off me, you witches!

855
00:49:38,262 --> 00:49:40,802
How dare you do this to me?

856
00:49:41,072 --> 00:49:42,173
Let go!

857
00:49:42,532 --> 00:49:43,572
Let go!

858
00:50:04,193 --> 00:50:06,563
Goodbye, honey.

859
00:50:38,862 --> 00:50:40,361
- There he is. - Catch him.

860
00:50:40,362 --> 00:50:42,392
Go away. Stand back.

861
00:50:42,592 --> 00:50:44,862
- Catch him. Come here. - Stand back.

862
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:46,202
Stand back.

863
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:48,133
Hey, stand back.

864
00:50:48,273 --> 00:50:49,333
- Hey. - Freeze.

865
00:50:52,242 --> 00:50:54,372
Ten minutes. Just give me ten minutes.

866
00:50:54,373 --> 00:50:56,681
Please. Just ten minutes. No.

867
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:57,813
- Let go. - No.

868
00:50:58,012 --> 00:51:01,083
No.

869
00:51:01,653 --> 00:51:03,451
No. Let go of me.

870
00:51:03,452 --> 00:51:04,952
Please.

871
00:51:05,623 --> 00:51:07,423
Get inside.

872
00:51:24,403 --> 00:51:25,471
Breaking news.

873
00:51:25,472 --> 00:51:27,542
Bang Da Mi's grandfather, Mr. Bang Chil Sung,

874
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:30,442
fell from the suspension bridge at Deokseon Park.

875
00:51:30,443 --> 00:51:32,182
The press conference has been cancelled.

876
00:51:32,742 --> 00:51:33,812
The police are...

877
00:51:33,813 --> 00:51:35,582
I'm free now.

878
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:38,752
He announced that he would reveal the truth about Lee Hwi So.

879
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:39,853
(Mr. Bang's mysterious fall. The accident is being investigated.)

880
00:51:40,753 --> 00:51:42,923
I'm Deputy Chief Prosecutor, Uhm Ji Man.

881
00:51:44,063 --> 00:51:45,492
Yesterday, around 6pm,

882
00:51:45,923 --> 00:51:48,793
Mr. Bang Chil Sung fell below Deokseong Park's suspension bridge.

883
00:51:48,963 --> 00:51:50,802
He died a little while ago.

884
00:51:50,963 --> 00:51:52,503
What is his cause of death?

885
00:51:52,702 --> 00:51:53,902
Did the fall kill him?

886
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:55,673
It was plain homicide.

887
00:51:56,642 --> 00:52:00,312
Around 4:10pm, October 2, the suspect, Lee Hwi So,

888
00:52:00,313 --> 00:52:02,641
had the intent to stop Bang Chil Sung's press conference.

889
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:04,482
So he assaulted his lawyer, whom he was in a meeting with,

890
00:52:04,483 --> 00:52:06,452
and escaped from Seoul Detention Center.

891
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:10,152
We assume that Lee lured Bang to Deokseon Park...

892
00:52:10,153 --> 00:52:11,552
and murdered him.

893
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:14,353
When he was arrested,

894
00:52:14,653 --> 00:52:16,592
Lee Hwi So was in possession of a large amount of drugs.

895
00:52:16,892 --> 00:52:19,062
We confirmed it was the same kind that he took...

896
00:52:19,063 --> 00:52:20,491
at the time of Bang Da Mi's disappearance.

897
00:52:20,492 --> 00:52:21,693
We, the police,

898
00:52:21,963 --> 00:52:25,102
promise that we will do our best to make sure we take...

899
00:52:25,103 --> 00:52:28,233
stern legal actions against the serial killer, Lee Hwi So.

900
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,272
I was supposed to meet Mr. Bang,

901
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,572
but that did not happen.

902
00:52:33,142 --> 00:52:35,611
Why were you going to meet with Mr. Bang?

903
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:37,142
To give him evidence.

904
00:52:37,713 --> 00:52:40,452
I found drugs in Captain Nam's house.

905
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:43,422
Captain Nam even admitted that...

906
00:52:43,423 --> 00:52:44,583
someone instructed him to do so.

907
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:48,052
You met me?

908
00:52:48,153 --> 00:52:50,362
You saw me yesterday. You were high on drugs.

909
00:52:50,822 --> 00:52:53,563
You're the one who was high on drugs.

910
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:04,602
Yesterday, I was investigating Bang Da Mi's last whereabouts.

911
00:53:04,603 --> 00:53:07,442
I went to the Youth Digital Crime Victims Support Center.

912
00:53:07,443 --> 00:53:09,983
You can check with their director.

913
00:53:14,883 --> 00:53:15,952
Yes.

914
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:17,681
Captain Nam came by yesterday,

915
00:53:17,682 --> 00:53:19,623
and he took my statement as a witness.

916
00:53:19,693 --> 00:53:21,022
I confirmed that Da Mi...

917
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,123
came to the center on the day she disappeared...

918
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:27,293
and that I drove her safely to Seoul Culture Forest.

919
00:53:33,273 --> 00:53:34,972
Please call Lawyer Kim Soon Pyung.

920
00:53:35,233 --> 00:53:37,702
He let me out in the place of someone...

921
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:39,103
who was being released on bail.

922
00:53:41,443 --> 00:53:42,511
What kind of power...

923
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:44,782
would a public defender have to do such a thing?

924
00:53:45,112 --> 00:53:47,213
I came to defend him out of the goodness of my heart.

925
00:53:47,452 --> 00:53:48,682
But then...

926
00:53:49,213 --> 00:53:50,452
I'm flabbergasted.

927
00:53:51,552 --> 00:53:53,552
He beat me up like crazy...

928
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,862
and tied me to a chair before he escaped.

929
00:53:57,992 --> 00:53:59,523
A public defender?

930
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:01,833
A public defender?

931
00:54:25,383 --> 00:54:27,051
(We mourn the passing of Chairman Bang Chil Sung.)

932
00:54:27,052 --> 00:54:28,892
(May he rest in peace.)

933
00:54:31,722 --> 00:54:32,762
- Ms. Cha. - Gosh.

934
00:55:01,853 --> 00:55:04,362
(We mourn the passing of Chairman Bang Chil Sung.)

935
00:55:04,423 --> 00:55:06,562
Through a press conference, Mr. Bang intended to...

936
00:55:06,563 --> 00:55:09,801
fully expose the wrongdoings of...

937
00:55:09,802 --> 00:55:12,202
her granddaughter's adoptive father, Lee Hwi So.

938
00:55:12,302 --> 00:55:14,502
But he passed away in vain.

939
00:55:14,503 --> 00:55:16,302
I can't believe it.

940
00:55:18,972 --> 00:55:22,713
Deprive the serial killer, Lee Hwi So, of his human rights...

941
00:55:22,912 --> 00:55:25,483
and sentence him to the death penalty.

942
00:55:25,813 --> 00:55:29,182
I dare implore the president.

943
00:55:29,753 --> 00:55:33,292
Please bring back the death penalty.

944
00:55:33,293 --> 00:55:34,622
- I have a question. - I have a question.

945
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:37,222
- I have a question. - I have a question.

946
00:55:37,463 --> 00:55:40,431
Mr. Bang's inheritance is hundreds of millions of dollars.

947
00:55:40,432 --> 00:55:42,391
Since he does not have any children, will his spouse...

948
00:55:42,392 --> 00:55:43,833
by common-law marriage inherit everything?

949
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:46,032
I don't really know much...

950
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:49,032
about Mr. Bang's inheritance.

951
00:55:49,373 --> 00:55:51,141
- I have a question. - I have a question.

952
00:55:51,142 --> 00:55:52,372
- Then how exactly... - Well then,

953
00:55:52,373 --> 00:55:54,841
- Lee Hwi So... - I'm not really feeling well, so...

954
00:55:54,842 --> 00:55:57,512
- Did he know about it already? - Please answer.

955
00:55:58,182 --> 00:56:00,582
- I have a question. - Is there anything you want to say?

956
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:02,582
- Please answer. - I have a question.

957
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:03,781
- Ma'am. - Please tell us.

958
00:56:03,782 --> 00:56:04,922
- Answer my question, please. - Please.

959
00:56:04,923 --> 00:56:07,721
- What are you going to do now? - Answer us.

960
00:56:07,722 --> 00:56:10,963
- What do you know? - What about the inheritance?

961
00:56:25,103 --> 00:56:27,972
Are you okay with both of you being here?

962
00:56:28,173 --> 00:56:30,282
Yes. Please proceed.

963
00:56:30,813 --> 00:56:33,853
Then I will execute his will.

964
00:56:37,123 --> 00:56:38,883
(Last Will and Testament)

965
00:56:45,423 --> 00:56:47,432
To Cha Ju Ran, Bang Chil Sung...

966
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:52,603
bequeaths the Seongbuk-dong house and ten million dollars in cash.

967
00:56:53,432 --> 00:56:54,972
- Ten million dollars? - Wait.

968
00:56:55,603 --> 00:56:57,471
Maybe there's a zero missing.

969
00:56:57,472 --> 00:56:59,072
If he's giving me a mere ten million dollars,

970
00:56:59,273 --> 00:57:01,471
who's getting his hundreds of millions of dollars?

971
00:57:01,472 --> 00:57:03,241
He has dozens of buildings in Gangnam.

972
00:57:03,242 --> 00:57:06,912
Currently, there are no buildings in Chairman Bang's name.

973
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:09,682
What kind of nonsense is this?

974
00:57:10,423 --> 00:57:13,253
You two fabricated the will, didn't you?

975
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:16,051
How dare you pull one on me?

976
00:57:16,052 --> 00:57:17,391
Give me the rest.

977
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,721
How does it make sense that he only gave me ten million dollars?

978
00:57:19,722 --> 00:57:21,692
Do you want me to take you to court?

979
00:57:21,693 --> 00:57:24,563
- Hey, you... - Let go of me so I can talk.

980
00:57:24,932 --> 00:57:26,562
Chairman Bang recently...

981
00:57:26,563 --> 00:57:28,833
disposed of all his buildings and land.

982
00:57:29,472 --> 00:57:31,942
The building your women's hospital is in, which he gave you,

983
00:57:31,943 --> 00:57:33,412
was the last one he owned.

984
00:57:34,543 --> 00:57:38,242
Then are you saying he cashed everything in?

985
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,173
What? It doesn't make sense.

986
00:58:10,242 --> 00:58:12,741
Where are all the money,

987
00:58:12,742 --> 00:58:14,911
possessions, and antiques that were in here?

988
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:16,253
Where is everything?

989
00:58:16,512 --> 00:58:17,552
He duped us.

990
00:58:17,822 --> 00:58:19,822
He played us over until the very end.

991
00:58:20,193 --> 00:58:22,122
Can't you tell from the way he sold his buildings in advance?

992
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,293
There's no way.

993
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:26,891
How would he have known he'd die for him to hide it all in advance?

994
00:58:26,892 --> 00:58:29,233
Maybe he opened a bank account in Switzerland.

995
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:47,353
Still, this wasn't bad.

996
00:58:47,813 --> 00:58:51,353
Thanks to Lee Hwi So being framed for Mr. Bang's murder,

997
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,192
we were able to protect what we have.

998
00:58:54,193 --> 00:58:56,153
Why is that important right now?

999
00:58:56,293 --> 00:58:59,023
All I got was a house and ten million dollars.

1000
00:58:59,392 --> 00:59:02,031
And I have to split it with you. Once I pay the tax,

1001
00:59:02,032 --> 00:59:03,092
I'll be left with nothing.

1002
00:59:03,262 --> 00:59:05,333
Isn't this a happier ending than ending up behind bars?

1003
00:59:05,563 --> 00:59:07,603
We prevented the worst from happening, anyhow.

1004
00:59:08,633 --> 00:59:09,932
It's strange, though.

1005
00:59:10,943 --> 00:59:13,242
How did Lee Hwi So end up being framed for the murder?

1006
00:59:14,142 --> 00:59:16,172
It's as if an invisible hand was helping us.

1007
00:59:16,173 --> 00:59:18,682
Everything went in our favour.

1008
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:22,112
If Lee Hwi So hadn't escaped just in time,

1009
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:26,423
would we have been safe?

1010
00:59:26,653 --> 00:59:29,292
The old man dying from sepsis on the operation table...

1011
00:59:29,293 --> 00:59:31,023
were the deities helping us out.

1012
00:59:33,023 --> 00:59:35,862
One thing's for sure. We're luckier than Bang Chil Sung.

1013
00:59:37,233 --> 00:59:39,903
From now on, remove Mr. Bang's name from your head.

1014
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:42,602
Don't open your mouth until he's in his grave.

1015
00:59:42,603 --> 00:59:44,443
You took the words out of my mouth.

1016
00:59:45,242 --> 00:59:46,972
Let's cut ties with each other from here on out.

1017
00:59:47,472 --> 00:59:49,842
You keep taking the words out of my mouth.

1018
00:59:52,412 --> 00:59:53,483
But,

1019
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:57,923
where did all of the old man's...

1020
00:59:58,253 --> 00:59:59,923
fortune go?

1021
01:00:00,552 --> 01:00:02,622
He was so stubborn about his way of living,

1022
01:00:02,623 --> 01:00:04,923
but he didn't get to spend his money properly before.

1023
01:00:17,503 --> 01:00:20,971
(Three weeks later)

1024
01:00:20,972 --> 01:00:22,342
(Court)

1025
01:00:32,983 --> 01:00:34,192
(My husband is not that kind of person!)

1026
01:00:34,193 --> 01:00:35,392
(Please find my missing daughter, Da Mi!)

1027
01:00:37,123 --> 01:00:38,563
(My husband is not that kind of person!)

1028
01:00:47,733 --> 01:00:49,503
Look at this, everyone. What is this?

1029
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:53,472
Do you know what I went through because of you?

1030
01:01:01,813 --> 01:01:03,082
Hey.

1031
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:04,353
Do Hyuk.

1032
01:01:06,523 --> 01:01:09,091
Hey, congratulations.

1033
01:01:09,092 --> 01:01:11,623
A year and six months in prison, and a three-year probation.

1034
01:01:16,392 --> 01:01:18,503
Stay low key, even in the passing wind.

1035
01:01:18,603 --> 01:01:19,633
Here.

1036
01:01:20,403 --> 01:01:21,532
Eat.

1037
01:01:22,633 --> 01:01:23,773
Thank you.

1038
01:01:23,903 --> 01:01:25,603
So, what about your mom and little brother?

1039
01:01:25,943 --> 01:01:27,712
I didn't tell them I was going to be on trial.

1040
01:01:27,713 --> 01:01:30,071
I'll just see them at home.

1041
01:01:30,072 --> 01:01:32,342
What are you? In elementary school?

1042
01:01:32,612 --> 01:01:34,653
Hey, don't be like that. Let's go have a drink.

1043
01:01:34,713 --> 01:01:36,583
I know a place that has pretty girls.

1044
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:39,483
You did a great job. Get in.

1045
01:01:43,253 --> 01:01:45,162
(Please find my missing daughter, Da Mi!)

1046
01:01:45,262 --> 01:01:46,762
Do Hyuk, don't look at that.

1047
01:01:47,463 --> 01:01:48,832
People like her...

1048
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:51,662
think they have the worst lives in the world.

1049
01:01:57,403 --> 01:01:59,372
(My husband is not that kind of person!)

1050
01:01:59,373 --> 01:02:01,373
(Please find my missing daughter, Da Mi!)

1051
01:02:13,853 --> 01:02:14,952
Mr. Yang.

1052
01:02:15,293 --> 01:02:17,392
We're outside Bang Da Mi's house. What do you want us to do?

1053
01:02:17,992 --> 01:02:20,432
Should we keep Min Do Hyuk's family alive?

1054
01:02:20,463 --> 01:02:22,032
Get rid of both.

1055
01:02:23,862 --> 01:02:25,463
We should trample on him,

1056
01:02:27,432 --> 01:02:28,873
so he doesn't act up ever again.

1057
01:02:29,702 --> 01:02:33,043
Why is he pretending to be righteous when he's just a gangster?

1058
01:02:34,912 --> 01:02:37,242
He doesn't have anything to do with Bang Da Mi.

1059
01:02:37,412 --> 01:02:38,713
Stupid jerk.

1060
01:02:39,142 --> 01:02:40,882
Min Do Hyuk's mom...

1061
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:42,753
has no luck at all.

1062
01:02:42,853 --> 01:02:44,753
She just happened to be Bobble's upstairs neighbour.

1063
01:02:48,923 --> 01:02:51,592
Chairman Bang, or whatever that old man's name is, is dead too.

1064
01:02:52,463 --> 01:02:55,133
The whole universe is in our favour, Mr. Yang.

1065
01:02:55,162 --> 01:02:56,963
Right. Wrap it up.

1066
01:03:00,032 --> 01:03:04,003
Hey, he's an important guest. Treat him accordingly.

1067
01:03:04,273 --> 01:03:06,142
Bring us your most expensive bottle.

1068
01:03:06,403 --> 01:03:08,213
What took you so long?

1069
01:03:10,012 --> 01:03:11,043
Raise your glasses.

1070
01:03:11,682 --> 01:03:13,412
You did a great job, Do Hyuk.

1071
01:03:13,983 --> 01:03:16,153
Let's celebrate.

1072
01:03:16,383 --> 01:03:18,782
Cheers!

1073
01:03:27,463 --> 01:03:28,732
She won't wake up easily.

1074
01:03:28,733 --> 01:03:30,503
We spiked her water with sleeping pills in advance.

1075
01:03:32,762 --> 01:03:33,873
Yes, sir.

1076
01:03:44,242 --> 01:03:45,912
- Gosh. - It's so cool.

1077
01:04:36,193 --> 01:04:37,503
(Tteokbokki 2 dollars Sundae 3.50 dollars)

1078
01:04:44,202 --> 01:04:45,503
Take care of yourself.

1079
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:46,873
Goodbye.

1080
01:04:49,242 --> 01:04:50,273
Take care.

1081
01:04:51,213 --> 01:04:53,281
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

1082
01:04:53,282 --> 01:04:55,552
I'll have two portions of tteokbokki and two portions of sundae,

1083
01:04:56,012 --> 01:04:58,051
but I'd appreciate it if you give me as much fish cake as you can...

1084
01:04:58,052 --> 01:04:59,923
and cover them in sauce.

1085
01:04:59,952 --> 01:05:02,091
My mom loves fish cake.

1086
01:05:02,092 --> 01:05:03,352
So we call her the Fish Cake Monster.

1087
01:05:03,353 --> 01:05:06,092
I think my little brother is getting good grades because he eats this.

1088
01:05:06,322 --> 01:05:08,361
He plans on becoming a judge.

1089
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,733
No, really. He actually does.

1090
01:05:09,932 --> 01:05:11,832
Your mom must be so proud...

1091
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:13,773
that she probably feels full even without eating tteokbokki.

1092
01:05:17,773 --> 01:05:19,373
There must be a fire somewhere.

1093
01:05:26,043 --> 01:05:29,682
Loving you is hard.

1094
01:05:30,282 --> 01:05:31,353
What?

1095
01:05:54,972 --> 01:05:56,012
Stay back.

1096
01:05:57,543 --> 01:05:58,983
It's dangerous. You can't go inside.

1097
01:05:59,012 --> 01:06:00,012
Mom...

1098
01:06:00,013 --> 01:06:01,912
My mom and little brother are inside.

1099
01:06:02,052 --> 01:06:03,982
They're inside. I have to go.

1100
01:06:03,983 --> 01:06:05,082
It's dangerous.

1101
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:06,353
Let go of me!

1102
01:06:15,762 --> 01:06:17,302
Mom!

1103
01:06:19,463 --> 01:06:20,903
Mom.

1104
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:24,273
Mom!

1105
01:06:26,342 --> 01:06:27,773
Mom...

1106
01:06:28,072 --> 01:06:30,373
Mom!

1107
01:06:32,642 --> 01:06:34,052
Mom...

1108
01:06:46,193 --> 01:06:48,892
I heard Bobble's adoptive mother set the fire to commit suicide.

1109
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:52,802
Why did they happen to be her upstairs neighbour?

1110
01:06:53,702 --> 01:06:55,872
The woman sprayed gasoline in front of their door...

1111
01:06:55,873 --> 01:06:59,342
so they couldn't even run away. They died, trapped inside.

1112
01:07:01,012 --> 01:07:03,512
The younger son was such a dutiful son...

1113
01:07:04,443 --> 01:07:07,083
that they found him dead while holding her mom's hand tightly.

1114
01:07:08,412 --> 01:07:09,752
Jae Hyuk.

1115
01:07:09,753 --> 01:07:12,483
I feel so sorry for them.

1116
01:07:14,423 --> 01:07:16,392
This is all Do Hyuk's fault.

1117
01:07:16,693 --> 01:07:18,462
He got caught up in bad things,

1118
01:07:18,463 --> 01:07:22,193
and his mom and little brother died because of him.

1119
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:24,532
Jae Hyuk.

1120
01:07:47,923 --> 01:07:50,253
Don't forgive me.

1121
01:08:03,373 --> 01:08:04,572
Bring her back.

1122
01:08:05,242 --> 01:08:06,842
Bring my mom back.

1123
01:08:07,342 --> 01:08:09,342
Bring my mom back.

1124
01:08:10,142 --> 01:08:11,412
Why did you do it?

1125
01:08:12,412 --> 01:08:14,483
Why did you kill my mom and brother?

1126
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:22,592
Mom...

1127
01:08:22,593 --> 01:08:24,093
(A check for 100,000 dollars)

1128
01:08:29,362 --> 01:08:30,902
(Condolence money)

1129
01:09:28,852 --> 01:09:31,822
(The Escape of the Seven)

1130
01:09:32,162 --> 01:09:34,031
My goal is now the global market.

1131
01:09:34,032 --> 01:09:36,462
It's so nice to see you all here on Jeju Island!

1132
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:38,561
Mone. I love you, my daughter.

1133
01:09:38,562 --> 01:09:40,561
It's today, right? The day Bang Da Mi disappeared.

1134
01:09:40,562 --> 01:09:43,231
Ran Women's Hospital. I used to be the director there.

1135
01:09:43,232 --> 01:09:45,842
You've never had a baby.

1136
01:09:45,843 --> 01:09:48,512
I'll leave my money to you.

1137
01:09:48,513 --> 01:09:51,342
- Da Mi, I'll find you soon. - Bobble.

1138
01:09:51,343 --> 01:09:53,642
Nobody here is free...

1139
01:09:53,643 --> 01:09:55,311
from this death.

1140
01:09:55,312 --> 01:09:56,811
Here. The cursed girl.

1141
01:09:56,812 --> 01:09:57,851
Enjoy it to the fullest.

1142
01:09:57,852 --> 01:09:59,652
I'll give you a taste of the abyss soon.
