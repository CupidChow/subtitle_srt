13
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:14,329
You crazy little...

14
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:16,258
How could you have a kid at school?

15
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,358
You said you weren't due for a while!

16
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:19,967
The baby...

17
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:22,599
The baby isn't crying, and its breathing is shallow too.

18
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,239
What am I going to do if the baby dies?

19
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:26,368
K doesn't even want the kid.

20
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:28,467
Hey, K gave me a message.

21
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:30,239
He said you guys were over. Give me the baby.

22
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:32,838
How can I trust you with my baby?

23
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:34,649
You said it was sick!

24
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,209
Are you going to take it to the hospital?

25
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:43,319
Promise me you'll save my kid. Okay?

26
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:44,989
Please.

27
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,658
Okay, so go.

28
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:47,929
Before someone sees you.

29
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,728
I'll call you if something happens.

30
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,998
Hurry!

31
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:05,909
Grandfather!

32
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:07,507
I'm here!

33
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:10,019
- Da Mi is here! - Just leave!

34
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:11,718
Grandfather!

35
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:14,489
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

36
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,817
- I swear I won't break my promise. - I don't want to hear it. Go!

37
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,259
I swear!

38
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:24,298
Don't open the door without my permission!

39
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:27,229
Your precious granddaughter will catch a cold!

40
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,567
My gosh!

41
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:31,067
You scared me.

42
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,269
I understand, honey.

43
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:43,209
It's supposed to rain all night.

44
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:45,318
What should I do?

45
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,389
Darn it.

46
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:00,669
My gosh.

47
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:03,538
Oh, dear. Look who it is.

48
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:05,269
It's the traitor.

49
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:07,807
Being in a police station suits you.

50
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:10,079
You can continue living like a piece of trash like this.

51
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:16,308
Get over here!

52
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:20,888
Hey, get the keys! Hurry!

53
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:22,018
Hey!

54
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,389
Hey. Do you think I'm scared?

55
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,128
You abandoned us first, you traitor!

56
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:28,889
Hey, hit me.

57
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,799
I said, hit me, you jerk!

58
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,299
Hold on!

59
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:37,038
I'm sorry...

60
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,468
for not taking care of you guys until the end.

61
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:40,968
Stop with your nonsense.

62
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:46,038
Listen to me carefully.

63
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:47,648
If things go wrong, you and I...

64
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,348
could die in prison without anyone knowing.

65
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:52,079
There's someone behind Yang Jin Mo.

66
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:53,848
Find out who that is.

67
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:57,019
What they wanted from the beginning was Taebaek Entertainment's land.

68
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:58,318
And you were just a pawn.

69
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,259
Do Hyuk. I need your help.

70
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:06,769
I brought the key!

71
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:09,269
- Hey! - Kang Ki Tak!

72
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,368
- What do you think you're doing? - Get over here!

73
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:37,399
Darn it!

74
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:41,967
You jerk! I don't have the money! What am I supposed to do?

75
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:43,328
Just go die then.

76
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:44,769
Where's the money you saved?

77
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:54,249
What are you doing?

78
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:08,088
Where's the money?

79
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:11,059
How many times do I need to tell you I'll go to prison if I can't settle?

80
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,558
Do you want me to go to prison?

81
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,198
Why would you steal someone's motorcycle...

82
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,629
and waste it on gambling? You idiot.

83
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:18,439
You're a senior. Why aren't you studying? Idiot.

84
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:21,209
Why are you nagging me when you're no better off?

85
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,708
You spent 5,000 dollars on playing video games.

86
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:25,478
- Hit me, you jerk! - Do you think I'm a pushover?

87
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,248
- Yes, I do. - What?

88
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:29,009
Just go to prison!

89
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:33,588
If that's the only way to fix your bad habit of stealing, just go.

90
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:36,618
Really?

91
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:37,988
I'll do what you want.

92
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:40,728
Your dad is a missing person, and your brother is a felon.

93
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:42,458
Your family is a complete mess,

94
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:43,858
so there's no way you can become a celebrity.

95
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:45,129
Congratulations.

96
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,298
Say one more word.

97
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,428
If you want to die tonight,

98
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,738
keep running your mouth!

99
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,238
Darn it!

100
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:01,949
Stop acting so pitiful. It's disgusting.

101
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:05,218
Did we ask you to give us money like other parents do?

102
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:07,288
Did you send us on trips abroad?

103
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:08,417
You did nothing for us,

104
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:11,019
yet you stuff your face every day like a pig.

105
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,759
That's enough.

106
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:16,928
If you can't hear, why would you show up at your kid's school?

107
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:19,129
Do you enjoy seeing your kid get bullied?

108
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,668
That's why all I do is play games.

109
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:22,728
Hey.

110
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,569
I'll give you a week to get my settlement money.

111
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:27,407
If not, I'll tell the world how Han Hui Su...

112
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:28,809
became Han Mone.

113
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:31,408
Get lost.

114
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,079
Screw this stupid family!

115
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:51,459
Mone, I'm sorry...

116
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:54,028
that I'm such a pathetic mom.

117
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:11,579
Look at the time...

118
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,728
Grandfather, please open the door!

119
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:36,168
Da Mi had five heart surgeries.

120
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,579
She has a stent,

121
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,209
and she has a harder time when it rains.

122
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,619
Mom...

123
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,297
I told you not to press the doorbell.

124
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:04,338
Why won't you listen?

125
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,717
The girl fainted.

126
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:27,689
- Call an ambulance. - Yes, ma'am.

127
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:59,358
- Da Mi! - Where's Da Mi?

128
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:01,657
- Da Mi. - Honey. Over here.

129
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:02,828
- Da Mi! - Honey.

130
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:05,698
Da Mi.

131
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:08,198
- Where is she? - Are you Da Mi's parents?

132
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:10,639
Hello.

133
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,198
We just spoke on the phone. I'm a friend of Da Mi's grandfather.

134
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:16,239
Where's Da Mi?

135
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:17,808
Did something bad happen to her?

136
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:19,437
She's getting tested.

137
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:21,808
Luckily, she's out of the woods.

138
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:24,878
She was brought to the hospital within the golden time.

139
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,448
And since I'm a doctor, she got urgent treatment quickly.

140
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,389
Thank you. Da Mi is alive thanks to you.

141
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:34,687
But it appears that she was out in the rain for a long time...

142
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:36,828
despite her heart condition.

143
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:39,758
Why was Da Mi found unconscious in front of her grandfather's house?

144
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,068
What were the adults doing?

145
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,198
Did something happen?

146
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:47,568
We have to know. We're her parents too.

147
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:51,078
You leave me with no choice.

148
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,908
You guys deserve to know the truth.

149
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:58,447
Geum La Hui is using her daughter to extort the chairman...

150
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:01,818
into giving her a home, a car, and money for her business.

151
00:10:02,188 --> 00:10:05,918
Da Mi fainted while coming to get money for her mom.

152
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:10,058
From the beginning, she brought Da Mi home...

153
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:12,859
to get an inheritance from her rich grandfather.

154
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:17,028
Why else would she bring home a child she abandoned?

155
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:20,368
"Abandoned?" Who?

156
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,668
Who else? It's Da Mi's birth mom.

157
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,838
That's not true.

158
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,009
She told us she lost Da Mi.

159
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:28,777
You're mistaken.

160
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,978
She lost her child in the subway and lived in a haze for years.

161
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:32,817
She even considered ending her life.

162
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:34,719
That's why she never got married.

163
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:37,818
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:41,889
Did you really believe that?

165
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:49,067
Geum La Hui is producing a drama for 100 million dollars,

166
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:50,798
and she's in financial difficulty right now.

167
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:53,268
If she doesn't get an investment right now,

168
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:54,639
her company is going to go under.

169
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:59,408
Do you guys realize the real reason why...

170
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:01,479
she took Da Mi from you?

171
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,207
I don't believe you.

172
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,948
I'm just giving you the facts.

173
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,619
It's up to you to decide.

174
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:11,817
Goodbye, then.

Da Mi. I'm here.

179

Can you hear me?

180
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:52,099
What happened?

181
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,197
You must've been so cold.

182
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:57,239
How sick were you to end up like this?

183
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,667
Why did you go to your grandfather?

184
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:03,339
I told you it was pointless!

185
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:05,908
Why were you being stubborn and didn't listen to me?

186
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:15,318
Were you planning to kill my daughter?

187
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,187
It was raining like crazy,

188
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:19,818
so why would you leave a girl with a heart disease out in the rain?

189
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,628
I didn't know.

190
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,499
Are you happy that you won against your only granddaughter?

191
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:27,198
Are you happy now?

192
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:29,428
Stop showing off...

193
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:31,969
that you have money!

194
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:48,917
(Rest Stop)

195
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,489
(Convoy)

196
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,808
Kang Ki Tak, don't move!

197
00:13:56,548 --> 00:13:57,589
Go.

198
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:00,158
Go and find him.

199
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,198
Darn it! Stop him!

200
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:11,499
You must've been so shocked.

201
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:14,238
She was just moved to a room.

202
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:16,469
I'm admitting her just in case so she can get some rest.

203
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:18,278
We want to check something.

204
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:20,808
Why did you take Da Mi from us?

205
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:24,078
Why did you show up in front of us after 15 years?

206
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:28,317
Obviously, it's because she's my daughter.

207
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:29,649
(Gangnam Cheong A Hospital)

208
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:32,259
Did you take Da Mi from us to get money for your business?

209
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,619
Answer me!

210
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,458
Is it true that you abandoned Da Mi, and you didn't lose her?

211
00:14:37,698 --> 00:14:40,527
I have no idea what you're talking about.

212
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:43,369
If not, how could you be so indifferent to Da Mi?

213
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,398
We told you rainy days were dangerous for her!

214
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,369
We begged you to take extra care of her!

215
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,509
So?

216
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:51,038
Did she die?

217
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:55,708
She's still alive.

218
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:57,277
Isn't that enough?

219
00:14:57,278 --> 00:14:58,379
Listen here.

220
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:03,989
Da Mi is 18 years old.

221
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:07,018
Are you making this fuss because she was in the rain?

222
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,889
Are you really a mom?

223
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,899
What do real moms do?

224
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:14,229
If my child is sick, should I faint alongside her?

225
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,068
Does being a mom mean I should cry and throw fits?

226
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,399
You lied about everything. Didn't you?

227
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,368
What you said about losing her and searching for her like crazy...

228
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:24,578
You're just using Da Mi for money. Aren't you?

229
00:15:25,038 --> 00:15:27,548
The one who needed money was Da Mi, not me.

230
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:32,778
She asked me to pay off your debt.

231
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,849
Did you not know?

232
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:37,389
The reason why Da Mi stood in the rain?

233
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,788
It was to pay back your 500,000-dollar debt!

234
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:43,458
If Da Mi almost died,

235
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:45,657
it's because of your incompetency!

236
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:46,797
Stop with your nonsense!

237
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:49,729
How much did you talk about money...

238
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:51,968
for her to beg me...

239
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:55,239
to pay off her parents' debt as soon as we met?

240
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,379
How much did you complain...

241
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:01,677
for her to stand out in the rain trying to appease her grandfather...

242
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:03,248
of his anger?

243
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:04,378
Geum La Hui!

244
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,149
- Be honest. - What?

245
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:07,749
You...

246
00:16:09,688 --> 00:16:11,519
kidnapped her. Didn't you?

247
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:13,089
What?

248
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:16,828
You deserve to be punished!

249
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:18,798
Listen here!

250
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,369
Honey.

251
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:23,599
Honey! Are you okay?

252
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:31,938
Honey...

253
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:34,778
I'm fine.

254
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:56,469
I'm sorry, Grandfather.

255
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:59,839
I won't break my promise ever again.

256
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,668
So...

257
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:04,038
please give us money.

258
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:07,009
I'll do whatever you ask.

259
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,779
Fine.

260
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:12,119
I'll give you the money.

261
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,518
In return, from this point forward,

262
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:20,289
forget about the people who have raised you.

263
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:23,228
Erase them. End things with them.

264
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:26,658
They never existed from the beginning.

265
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:30,768
Why must I do that?

266
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:35,708
I'm telling you that you only have one mom.

267
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,938
The only people who will always be on your side...

268
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:42,408
are your blood relatives, kid.

269
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,677
We were poor,

270
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:47,379
but I never felt like I lacked anything.

271
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,218
They sent me to academies like everyone else,

272
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:53,119
and they always gave me the best foods to eat.

273
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,359
They even ironed my underwear.

274
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:57,798
There are no other parents who could do that much.

275
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,859
Goodness.

276
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:01,497
It's a sin to be poor too.

277
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,467
They became poor because of me!

278
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:07,138
They got themselves into debt because of my hospital bills.

279
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:08,738
Stop talking back to me!

280
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,708
I can't bear the thought...

281
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,248
of my precious money...

282
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,488
going into the hands of complete strangers.

283
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:24,958
That's my rule in life.

284
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,359
If you go against that,

285
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:30,559
forget about my investment...

286
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:33,698
in your mom's drama.

287
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:38,238
I won't contact them again.

288
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:41,139
So...

289
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,168
please help Mom.

00:19:35,188 --> 00:19:37,088
I don't want to go to kindergarten!

292
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:38,328
I won't go.

293
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:40,598
Kids keep teasing me...

294
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,668
for having something scary in my chest.

295
00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:48,008
They said they wouldn't play with me because they were scared.

296
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,609
Da Mi.

297
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:53,938
That's a special thing.

298
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,408
You're lying.

299
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:58,217
Everyone called me a ghost.

300
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:00,379
A ghost with a hole in her heart.

301
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:04,018
- That's not true. - Da Mi. Actually,

302
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,218
I have something to show you too.

303
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:09,829
Here.

304
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:14,359
You have it too.

305
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:18,039
Look.

306
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,899
I have it too.

307
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,467
You both have it.

308
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:24,678
That's right.

309
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:29,309
That's proof that you're our daughter.

310
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:31,748
That's why your friends don't have it.

311
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:33,278
Really?

312
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,619
It's true, of course.

313
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:37,247
You're a beautiful, special girl.

so we can become stronger.

Oh, my. I'm a special kid!

317

- Wait for me! - Da Mi. You might fall.

318
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:54,299
You're going to fall. Be careful, Da Mi.

Sara!

329
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:39,718
The legendary member they were talking about was Hong Sara?

330
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,687
Hong Sara's agency must've already pulled some strings.

331
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:45,359
Are we just here to fill space, then?

332

00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,329
I tried to save the baby, but it died.

335
00:21:53,198 --> 00:21:54,329
Forget about the baby.

339
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:15,948
is this audition.

You got the main role. Did you expect this outcome?

367
00:23:59,258 --> 00:24:01,188
I'm from Hanbin Entertainment. Do you have an agency?

368
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,487
If you don't, please sign with us.

369
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,799
No. Sign with us.

370
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,258
Thanks for your interest.

371
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:09,399
I'll give it some more thought before deciding on an agency.

372
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:10,997
Thank you.

373
00:24:10,998 --> 00:24:12,869
- Excuse me. - Mone is coming through!

374
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:15,007
- Ms. Mone. - Excuse us.

375
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:16,838
Mone coming through.

376
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:17,908
Mone.

377
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:20,839
One second, Ms. Mone.

378
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:49,008
It's been a while, sir.

379
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:52,609
As you ordered, I pressured the bank...

380
00:24:52,978 --> 00:24:56,649
to bankrupt Taebaek as soon as possible.

381
00:24:56,908 --> 00:24:59,119
Goodness!

382
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,448
Game over.

383
00:25:01,718 --> 00:25:04,049
I died because of you, old man.

384
00:25:04,758 --> 00:25:07,188
Pardon? You died?

385
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:08,988
I apologize, sir.

387
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:14,599
You came for this, right?

388
00:25:21,468 --> 00:25:23,308
This is your reward for your good work.

00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:24,468
(2024 Gagok District Urban Development Business Plan)

390
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:28,379
Buy some land there so we can hold it. Near the well.

391

392
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,458
Thank you, sir.

393
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:43,359
Thank you, sir.

394
00:25:50,228 --> 00:25:52,437
I clearly said that Mr. Bang wasn't here.

395
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:54,468
Right. I came because I was told that he would be back soon,

396
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,168
so you don't have to worry.

397
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:00,879
Right.

398
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,879
You said something very interesting to Da Mi's adoptive parents.

399
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:07,379
Well, I didn't make anything up.

400
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:10,288
It's true that you made Da Mi get money for you.

401
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:11,958
It's also true that you're using your daughter.

402
00:26:12,218 --> 00:26:13,619
I wanted to thank you.

403
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,228
Thanks to you, things have gotten much easier.

404
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:18,128
Da Mi's adoptive parents...

405
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:20,799
have gotten away from Da Mi for good.

406
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:22,299
What?

407
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,798
Mr. Bang only cares about his blood relatives.

408
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,598
Can't you see that from how he took in Da Mi...

409
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,368
just because she was the daughter of his son,

410
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:30,508
despite that fact that his son was a terrible person?

411
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:33,937
Mr. Bang is not the type of person to give a single penny...

412
00:26:33,938 --> 00:26:36,079
to someone he isn't related to.

413
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:39,978
So you should give up now...

414
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:41,889
and live your life.

415
00:26:43,718 --> 00:26:45,319
Do you think Mr. Bang would just sit back and watch...

416
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,359
once he finds out what kind of person you are?

417
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:50,359
You strategically seduced a rich man and got pregnant.

418
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:52,828
And when he dumped you, you threw away your child.

419
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:54,498
Are you talking about yourself?

420
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:58,799
Aren't you the one strategically seducing a rich man?

421
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:01,539
- You... - No. This way.

422
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:04,668
Be careful.

423
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,208
Hey. Hurry it up.

424
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:10,649
Be careful.

425
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:14,988
Hurry.

426
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:18,389
Yes. Over here.

427
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,289
What's going on?

428
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:24,829
What are you doing, honey?

429
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,958
What are you taking out from the underground storage?

430
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,609
That's the 20 million dollars for the investment.

431
00:27:41,748 --> 00:27:42,779
Thank you.

432
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:05,698
Was this all in the underground storage?

433
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:07,938
The remaining 30 million dollars...

434
00:28:08,668 --> 00:28:12,279
is my early gift to Da Mi.

435
00:28:12,478 --> 00:28:13,539
Thank you.

436
00:28:14,178 --> 00:28:16,708
But, you have to make sure...

437
00:28:17,448 --> 00:28:19,248
the money doesn't go...

438
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:22,619
to her adoptive parents.

439
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:26,119
Never let her see those people.

440
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:28,258
I'll keep that in mind.

441
00:28:30,228 --> 00:28:33,529
Move these things to her house.

442
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,629
Yes, Mr. Bang.

443
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:36,198
Move them.

444
00:28:58,418 --> 00:28:59,488
Help me...

445
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:08,428
Done.

446
00:29:11,428 --> 00:29:14,667
Where can I meet Yang Jin Mo?

447
00:29:14,668 --> 00:29:16,539
The police are everywhere.

448
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:18,478
If you go outside now,

449
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:20,609
you'll get arrested before you can even take ten steps.

450
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:22,549
I'm not joking around right now.

451
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:24,349
Move.

452
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,379
I said to move.

453
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,748
Your mom and younger brother.

454
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:31,789
I have them.

455
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:37,029
I smuggled them to safety...

456
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:39,329
before Yang Jin Mo could get his hands on them.

457
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,129
Where are they now?

458
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:44,198
Where are they now?

459
00:29:44,629 --> 00:29:46,468
Gosh, you scared me.

460
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:49,767
You betrayed Kang Ki Tak...

461
00:29:49,768 --> 00:29:52,579
and was scheming with Yang Jin Mo before he betrayed you.

462
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:54,579
How dare you get mad at me?

463
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,218
I'm kidding.

464
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:05,589
This is Yang Jin Mo's hangout spot.

465
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,889
He comes here to drink at least two or three times a week.

466
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:12,428
So come here...

467
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:14,728
and wait patiently.

468
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:17,668
You'll see him soon.

469
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,168
I called dibs on you.

00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:27,608
(Rookie Han Mone won the role through a 1000:1 competition rate.)

471
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:30,007
(Who's Mone, who the role over Hong Sara?)

472
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:31,379
(Who is Mone?)

473
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:34,849
(Dislike)

(I know Han Mone's true colours.)

475
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:44,589
Ms. Han Mone?

476
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:46,059
We meet again.

00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:48,528

479
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:54,268
Hello.

480
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:55,809
I see you work out here.

481
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,808
I thought you had an extraordinary figure,

482
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:00,109
and this was how.

483
00:31:01,748 --> 00:31:02,779
Thank you.

484
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:04,879
I'll be frank.

485
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:07,248
I'm interested in you.

486
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:10,349
If you haven't decided on an agency yet,

487
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:12,559
would you like to work with me?

This is the first time I've ever wanted to bring someone to fame.

490
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,268
How much money are you going to give me?

491
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:32,379
Is two million dollars enough?

492
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:35,208
I think that's exceptional.

493
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:42,188
What do you see in me to invest such a large amount of money?

494
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:44,049
I like you.

495
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:48,559
I saw...

496
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:50,889
how you cut the power off...

497
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,129

00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:06,538
- What? - What's going on?

500

Who turned the lights off?

501
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:15,119
It takes talent to be able to sing without instrumental music.

502
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:17,747
Hong Sara can't sing while she dances at the same time.

503
00:32:17,748 --> 00:32:18,789
She gets out of breath.

504
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:21,059
Hong Sara brought it onto herself.

505
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:23,688
The competition wasn't fair to begin with.

506
00:32:25,728 --> 00:32:27,599
Take some time to think about it and call me.

Excuse me?

510

What do you mean by a tip-off? What kind of...

511
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:53,918
Read.

(I know Han Mone's true colours.)

513
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,129

Louder.

518
00:33:14,738 --> 00:33:17,309
"Han Mone pretends to be an angel in white."

519
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:19,678
"But she controls bullies behind closed doors..."

520

"and is a major delinquent who hangs out with men at night."

521
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:26,988
"She even gave birth in the school's art room."

522
00:33:32,658 --> 00:33:34,828
You don't believe this, do you, director?

523
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:36,099
I looked into it,

524
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,967
and there is a rumour that someone gave birth...

525
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:41,069
at Myeongju Girls' High School.

526
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:46,408
How would I believe that it wasn't you?

It really wasn't me, director.

00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:53,319
Then prove it.

If you can't,

531
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:59,458
your appearance will be deferred until we're sure about the rumour.

00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:03,789

548
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:02,187
- Then die. - What?

549
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:03,989
Then just die.

550
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:07,788
Do you still not know who K is?

551
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:11,558
If I talk, you'll also...

552
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:13,858
get abandoned like me.

553
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,698
You little...

554
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:18,528
You think I'll just let that happen to me?

555
00:35:18,529 --> 00:35:20,538
So get a hold of yourself.

556
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:25,538
I'm going to do whatever it takes...

557
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:28,108
to be the most famous star in Korea.

558
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:30,078
When that happens, I'll never abandon you.

559
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:31,748
So what's it going to be?

560
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:34,077
Are you going to help me or not?

561
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:35,387
How can I help you?

562
00:35:35,388 --> 00:35:37,018
There's no way.

563
00:35:40,558 --> 00:35:43,388
There actually is a way.

564
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:46,399
All we have to do is change the name...

565
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:48,768
from Han Mone to Bang Da Mi.

566
00:35:51,498 --> 00:35:52,667
Bang Da Mi?

567
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:53,969
We should strike first.

568
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,267
"The girl who gave birth at Myeongju Girls' High School..."

569
00:35:55,268 --> 00:35:56,308
"is Bang Da Mi."

570
00:35:58,038 --> 00:35:59,538
I have proof.

571
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:03,977
Where's Yang Jin Mo?

572
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:05,977
I don't even know who that is!

573
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:08,847
You dropped this at the Maple Hotel yesterday.

574
00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:10,017
Bobble.

575
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:11,887
It is. It's Bang Da Mi.

576
00:36:11,888 --> 00:36:13,659
Where is she running off to in this rain?

577
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:18,558
You prepared this beforehand.

578
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,228
The circumstantial evidence all points to Da Mi.

579
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:23,929
There's already a rumour in school that she has a sugar daddy.

580
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:26,299
I have more than enough friends who can give statements.

581
00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:27,938
What about her family?

582
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:30,808
I heard her adoptive parents lived in Deokseon.

583
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:33,308
Her adoptive parents?

584
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:37,949
The more provocative it is, the better. Right?

585
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:42,388
Why don't I paint a nice picture? It's been a while.

586
00:36:49,328 --> 00:36:50,458
Hey.

587
00:36:50,629 --> 00:36:53,199
I came up with a way to make a lot of money.

588
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:54,828
You should help me.

589
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,399
Money?

590
00:36:56,768 --> 00:36:57,828
How?

591
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:00,969
Fake news.

592
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:05,009
Create fake news during an online live stream.

593
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:07,339
Fake news.

594
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,909
Sounds fun.

595
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:13,379
The thing is...

596
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:16,588
You can intentionally ruin a life, but people won't be able to tell.

597
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:19,589
It's why people call streamers who do this "faceless killers."

598
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:22,828
If you wear these,

599
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,958
no one will know who you are.

600
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:36,167
This way, I won't get in trouble with K,

601
00:37:36,168 --> 00:37:37,637
and I can also rake in money.

602
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:39,109
I'll be killing two birds with one stone.

603
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:41,179
To have her work in the entertainment industry,

604
00:37:43,748 --> 00:37:44,847
her name...

605
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:46,918
should definitely be mentioned by online live streamers.

606
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:50,388
Jin Mo, what should the name of our channel be?

607
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,118
Joo Yong Ju, Hong Man Doo.

608
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:54,589
Why don't we combine your family names...

609
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:56,058
and call it "Scarlet Letter?"

610
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:01,098
That's perfect, Jin Mo.

611
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:05,598
All right. Cheers.

612
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,399
Right.

613
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:10,109
Your first target is...

614
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:12,138
a high school student who gave birth.

617
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:19,548
How shocking.

618
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:21,819
There's been a shocking incident.

619
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:22,988
A prestigious high school...

620
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:25,819
that sends 50 students per year to Seoul National University.

621
00:38:26,418 --> 00:38:27,457
On Friday night,

622
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:30,887
a group of students entered the art room to clean it.

623
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:31,989
But...

624
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:36,267
"I feel I'm going to throw up. Open the windows. Quickly."

625
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:37,498
Just then,

626
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:39,568
a girl yells.

627
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:41,198
(Scarlet Letter)

628
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,508
"Blood!"

629
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:45,207
- What? - Gosh. That's right.

630
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:48,379
A girl had secretly given birth in the art room.

631
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:50,279
Just then.

632
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,417
Can you all see this?

633
00:38:52,418 --> 00:38:55,077
She was holding something in her arms...

634
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:57,719
as she was running away in a hurry.

635
00:38:57,788 --> 00:38:59,988
I heard baby sounds at school.

636
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,428

00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:05,958
It says Myeongju Girls' High School, Bang Da Mi. Isn't this yours?

639
00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:08,029
Hey, Bobble. Hey, Miss Bobble.

Everyone at school knows about her.

650
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:27,049
She should change her name.

In the art room of a girl's high school in the Gangnam district,

654
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:35,989
a student gave birth, and news of it is sparking controversy.

655
00:39:36,288 --> 00:39:38,827
This controversy was started by a live streaming channel...

656
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:41,057
and is now being referred to as the "Bobble incident"...

657
00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:43,629

You're so shameless.

663
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:00,718
This is insane.

728
00:42:38,038 --> 00:42:39,879
You only liked me because I'm the chairman's son, didn't you?

729
00:42:40,078 --> 00:42:42,009
You think you'll be able to become a full-time teacher by doing this?

730
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:43,509
- Do you... - Gosh.

731
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:45,408
want to be a homewrecker?

732
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:46,518
What?

733
00:42:46,918 --> 00:42:48,418
"A homewrecker?"

734
00:42:48,748 --> 00:42:49,888
You jerk!

735
00:42:52,118 --> 00:42:53,219
Hey.

736
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:13,578
I brought my transfer documents.

737
00:43:14,308 --> 00:43:15,438
You.

738
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:16,949
When did you get here?

739
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,379
Just now.

740
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:21,279
Whatever you saw or heard here,

741
00:43:21,578 --> 00:43:23,089
you better not tell anyone.

742
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:25,418
Take it to your grave. Understand?

743
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:28,618
Answer me.

744
00:43:31,728 --> 00:43:32,798
Serves you right.

745
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:34,497
Goodness. Look at you.

746
00:43:34,498 --> 00:43:36,129
- Are you crying? - Are you crying?

747
00:43:39,598 --> 00:43:42,038
- Keep it up. - Look at her face.

748
00:43:42,098 --> 00:43:43,268
I want you gone from my sight,

749
00:43:43,808 --> 00:43:46,009
even if this is how it has to happen.

750
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:51,649
Don't try to get out of this.

751
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,719
Someone saw you give birth in the art room.

752
00:43:55,018 --> 00:43:56,219
Who is it?

753
00:43:56,489 --> 00:43:57,548
Bring the person here.

754
00:43:57,549 --> 00:43:58,788
Be honest.

755
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:02,418
You were forced to transfer because you got pregnant, right?

756
00:44:02,888 --> 00:44:05,288
You lied about it and came here and then dared to give birth?

757
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:08,798
Do you have proof that I gave birth?

758
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:10,798
- What if we do? - What is it?

759
00:44:10,799 --> 00:44:13,168
Mr. Park...

760
00:44:19,509 --> 00:44:20,638
That's yours, isn't it?

761
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:23,779
That's proof that you gave birth in the art room.

762
00:44:23,848 --> 00:44:25,409
I've never given birth.

763
00:44:25,748 --> 00:44:27,779
I'm telling the truth. Please believe me.

764
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:30,489
Tell Mone to come here.

765
00:44:30,788 --> 00:44:32,888
Mone will tell you I'm innocent.

766
00:44:33,418 --> 00:44:34,458
Okay?

767
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:37,129
Please.

(Artist: Han Mone)

769
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,168
You made your decision quicker than I thought.

770
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:46,268
Thank you for not making me wait.

771
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:49,168
It's like we recognized each other at first glance.

772
00:44:50,069 --> 00:44:51,569
I like you too.

773
00:44:52,978 --> 00:44:55,609
It feels like I was destined to meet you as a judge.

Aren't you a 2nd-year high school student?

776
00:45:07,188 --> 00:45:08,287
Why is your age...

777
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,828
I'm 20 years old.

778
00:45:10,288 --> 00:45:12,428
I studied abroad before coming to Korea,

779
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:13,929
so I had to repeat middle school.

780
00:45:15,598 --> 00:45:17,098
You said your mom was in America, right?

781
00:45:17,368 --> 00:45:18,469
She visits often.

782
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:21,637
Housekeepers have taken care of me since I was little,

783
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:22,668
so it's all right.

(LH Media: Geum La Hui)

785
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:35,917
Until you're notified of your disciplinary action,

786
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:37,118
stay home and reflect on yourself.

787
00:45:45,998 --> 00:45:47,029
Da Mi!

788
00:45:48,129 --> 00:45:51,997
Dad!

789
00:45:51,998 --> 00:45:53,569
- Da Mi. - Dad.

790
00:45:53,899 --> 00:45:55,637
It really wasn't me.

791
00:45:55,638 --> 00:45:58,207
It wasn't me. It's all wrong.

792
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,078
It really wasn't me.

793
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:01,537
I know it wasn't you.

794
00:46:01,538 --> 00:46:03,049
Who would if not me?

795
00:46:03,308 --> 00:46:04,648
Mom doesn't know, does she?

796
00:46:04,649 --> 00:46:06,247
She can't know about this.

797
00:46:06,248 --> 00:46:08,149
She'll pass out if she hears.

798
00:46:08,478 --> 00:46:09,649
I'll help you.

799
00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:12,917
First, we'll sue Scarlet Letter.

800
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:15,187
No. I can take care of this.

801
00:46:15,188 --> 00:46:16,489
I know how to.

802
00:46:16,629 --> 00:46:18,489
Dad, do you trust me?

803
00:46:20,498 --> 00:46:22,827
- Do you see that? - Who's he?

804
00:46:22,828 --> 00:46:24,129
It's okay, Da Mi.

805
00:46:24,728 --> 00:46:26,299
What is she doing?

806
00:46:27,038 --> 00:46:28,168
Are they dating?

807
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:30,239
What are they up to at a school?

808
00:46:30,438 --> 00:46:32,208
- Dad... - It's okay.

809
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:36,747
What a nice picture.

810
00:46:36,748 --> 00:46:38,748
Their hands are in just the right places.

811
00:46:47,118 --> 00:46:48,187
Okay.

812
00:46:48,188 --> 00:46:49,687
Hello, Mr. Yang.

813
00:46:49,688 --> 00:46:52,858
- Mr. Yang! - Hello!

814
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:54,098
Goodness.

815
00:46:54,299 --> 00:46:55,727
Why were you away for so long?

816
00:46:55,728 --> 00:46:57,898
I was going to cry if you didn't come again tonight.

817
00:46:57,899 --> 00:47:00,338
Goodness. Do you have that few regulars?

818
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:02,568
I need the popular Mr. Yang...

819
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,608
to bring in some customers.

820
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:06,577
Don't let anyone else in tonight!

821
00:47:06,578 --> 00:47:07,838
I'll rent out the place.

822
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,578
Let's start early tonight!

823
00:47:11,449 --> 00:47:13,117
- I'll get things ready. - Okay.

824
00:47:13,118 --> 00:47:14,819
- Wait in here. - Sure.

825
00:47:26,759 --> 00:47:29,828
- My goodness! - Hello!

826
00:47:30,969 --> 00:47:32,938
Congratulations, sir.

827
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:37,009
I heard Cherry is moving into Taebaek's old building.

828
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:39,069
I'm just a puppet. What do I know?

829
00:47:39,268 --> 00:47:41,578
I take the crumbs from the table.

830
00:47:42,038 --> 00:47:44,879
I know the people you hang with.

831
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:49,117
You're CEO of the country's biggest entertainment agency,

832
00:47:49,118 --> 00:47:51,187
but you won't settle at that.

833
00:47:51,188 --> 00:47:54,517
One day, you'll make the building your own...

834
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:55,558
Be careful.

835
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,828
Watch what you say.

836
00:48:00,228 --> 00:48:01,827
How's the Bang Da Mi thing going?

837
00:48:01,828 --> 00:48:05,399
We just got a few really nice photos.

838
00:48:05,498 --> 00:48:07,637
We have over two million subscribers already.

839
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:10,637
The response is almost explosive!

840
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,109
Yes!

841
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:15,839
The whole world's on our side.

842
00:48:16,348 --> 00:48:18,008
Min Do Hyuk caused a scene...

843
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:21,118
at Bang Da Mi's school before he was arrested, and it helped out.

844
00:48:21,348 --> 00:48:24,687
Min Do Hyuk's the one who came up with the "Bobble" nickname.

845
00:48:24,688 --> 00:48:25,888
What a moron.

846
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:27,788
He got it all wrong.

847
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:29,659
No.

848
00:48:30,828 --> 00:48:32,589
He helped us to the end.

849
00:48:33,399 --> 00:48:34,458
Should I thank him?

850
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:40,469
Bang Da Mi?

851
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:42,538
It wasn't her?

852
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:46,538
Good job.

853
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:50,278
My tummy hurts.

854
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:52,048
Drink as you wait. I need a toilet break.

855
00:48:52,049 --> 00:48:53,118
I have a stomachache.

856
00:48:53,649 --> 00:48:54,649
See you in a bit!

857
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:06,759
What the heck?

858
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:08,859
- Sorry. - Why you...

859
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:19,268
Yang Jin Mo?

860
00:49:32,348 --> 00:49:33,418
Da Mi.

861
00:49:34,918 --> 00:49:36,118
Why did you ignore my calls?

862
00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:38,458
Did you think I couldn't find you?

863
00:49:38,788 --> 00:49:40,799
Do you think you can run away forever?

864
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:45,268
Scarlet Letter. Was that you?

865
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:47,898
No! I really don't know anything about that.

866
00:49:47,899 --> 00:49:49,368
I don't believe you anymore.

867
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:52,268
Tell them you had the baby!

868
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:54,538
Da Mi.

869
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:56,978
The baby's dead.

870
00:49:58,279 --> 00:50:01,779
Tell everyone the baby's dead too!

871
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:03,417
Give me some time.

872
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,549
- Just a few days... - No.

873
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,359
I can't wait.

874
00:50:12,129 --> 00:50:13,858
You're my friend.

875
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:15,557
Don't you feel sorry for me?

876
00:50:15,558 --> 00:50:17,929
I'm a mess because I never fully recovered from childbirth.

877
00:50:18,569 --> 00:50:20,299
I'll die if you come after me too.

878
00:50:20,668 --> 00:50:21,937
I barely passed the audition...

879
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:23,808
and won the lead role.

880
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:26,508
Do you want me to give it all up now?

881
00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:28,279
Then what about me?

882
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:33,978
Do you not care you're ruining my life?

883
00:50:37,288 --> 00:50:39,719
You bought me this on purpose, didn't you?

884
00:50:40,118 --> 00:50:41,517
Because you have one too.

885
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:42,788
That's not true.

886
00:50:44,629 --> 00:50:46,598
I really liked you as a friend.

887
00:50:46,998 --> 00:50:49,768
I don't know about this. Believe me, Da Mi.

888
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:52,327
Then come to school tomorrow and tell the truth...

889
00:50:52,328 --> 00:50:54,098
in front of everyone.

890
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:57,069
You prove that I'm innocent!

891
00:50:57,538 --> 00:50:59,779
This is the last chance I'll give you.

892
00:51:00,009 --> 00:51:02,708
After that, you get nothing.

893
00:51:05,078 --> 00:51:06,847
Da Mi!

894
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:07,978
Get lost!

895
00:51:22,728 --> 00:51:24,928
You're so good at disappearing.

896
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:28,069
No, stop. My bad. I'm sorry.

897
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:29,569
What are you sorry about?

898
00:51:29,909 --> 00:51:32,538
The money. I disappeared with the money.

899
00:51:33,038 --> 00:51:35,909
The 100,000 dollars I promised. I'll wire it to you now.

900
00:51:36,409 --> 00:51:37,448
And?

901
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:39,308
For hiring you to stab me.

902
00:51:39,819 --> 00:51:40,949
Sorry about that too.

903
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:45,549
Say all that into this recorder.

904
00:51:45,748 --> 00:51:47,818
That you hired me to stage it all.

905
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:50,388
And that Ki Tak had nothing to do with it.

906
00:51:50,728 --> 00:51:52,028
Okay, fine.

907
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:53,228
There's one more thing.

908
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:55,699
Talk about what you did to Bang Da Mi.

909
00:51:56,969 --> 00:51:58,867
That had nothing to do with you.

910
00:51:58,868 --> 00:52:00,037
Let's go for another dive.

911
00:52:00,038 --> 00:52:02,668
Wait! Okay, I'll do it.

912
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:04,239
I'll do it.

913
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:08,078
I'll start recording now.

914
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:14,748
I, Yang Jin Mo, hired Min Do Hyuk...

915
00:52:14,978 --> 00:52:16,949
to attack me and made it...

916
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:20,418
look like Kang Ki Tak had given the order.

917
00:52:20,759 --> 00:52:23,129
And? What did you do to Bang Da Mi?

918
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:25,288
Bang Da Mi...

919
00:52:26,429 --> 00:52:29,057
You piece of crap!

920
00:52:29,058 --> 00:52:32,098
What right do you have to do this to me?

921
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:36,098
From now on, I'll call you "Diving King."

922
00:52:36,438 --> 00:52:38,038
No, wait!

923
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,077
They're onto you. Run.

924
00:52:41,078 --> 00:52:42,637
I'm almost done. I need one more thing.

925
00:52:42,638 --> 00:52:44,977
There's no time for this. Go!

926
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:46,108
Hey!

927
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:47,118
Where are you going?

928
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,048
- Hey! - Hurry.

929
00:52:50,049 --> 00:52:51,989
The recorder. Give it to me.

930
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:55,259
Who's here? Who else is here?

931
00:52:55,819 --> 00:52:58,029
Mr. Yang. What...

932
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:01,858
Bring those two to me right now.

933
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:04,069
And get Min Do Hyuk's recorder.

934
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:07,268
Two of you go this way!

935
00:53:07,368 --> 00:53:08,867
The rest, go round the back!

936
00:53:08,868 --> 00:53:11,207
- Give me the recorder. - Let's get out of here first.

937
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:13,208
- Hey, you! - Darn it.

938
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:17,009
Get them!

939
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:18,448
Run faster!

940
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:20,117
Circle round and get them!

941
00:53:20,118 --> 00:53:22,178
Stop!

942
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:23,188
Hurry up.

943
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,417
Hey! Min Do Hyuk!

944
00:53:27,418 --> 00:53:29,518
Hey, stop!

945
00:53:31,029 --> 00:53:33,057
This way! Get them!

946
00:53:33,058 --> 00:53:34,328
Stop!

947
00:53:35,529 --> 00:53:37,129
We'll kill you!

948
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:39,868
Get back here!

949
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:41,239
Hey!

950
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:46,239
Get them!

951
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:53,178
Get in here and hide.

952
00:53:53,179 --> 00:53:54,478
What is this place?

953
00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:56,278
I'll lure them away.

954
00:53:56,279 --> 00:53:58,287
Take the recorder to the police when the coast is clear.

955
00:53:58,288 --> 00:53:59,318
Get inside!

956
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,318
Where... I don't know where I am!

957
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:02,458
My gosh.

958
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:07,457
There she is!

959
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,969
You, go that way.

960
00:54:10,268 --> 00:54:11,667
Get her!

961
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,998
Be sure to get the recorder!

962
00:54:21,478 --> 00:54:22,538
Do Hyuk.

963
00:54:26,618 --> 00:54:27,719
What?

964
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:30,748
Dr. Cha, run some tests.

965
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:34,188
See if she shows signs that she gave birth.

966
00:54:34,558 --> 00:54:36,629
Me? That's a bit...

967
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:37,888
It's just a rumour.

968
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:39,928
It's complete nonsense.

969
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:42,958
There's no reason to refuse if she has nothing to hide.

970
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:45,328
Get tested.

971
00:54:46,668 --> 00:54:47,799
I will.

972
00:54:48,399 --> 00:54:50,808
If this is the only way to make you believe me,

973
00:54:52,768 --> 00:54:53,808
I'll get tested.

974
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:21,239
So, how did things go?

975
00:55:21,768 --> 00:55:22,998
What's the result?

976
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:26,609
I found out she had given birth.

977
00:55:28,109 --> 00:55:30,149
- What? - What are you saying?

978
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:32,509
No, I haven't!

979
00:55:32,808 --> 00:55:35,118
Test me again. Let's do the test again!

980
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:37,818
Why is everyone doing this to me?

981
00:55:37,819 --> 00:55:39,089
What are you up to?

982
00:55:39,118 --> 00:55:41,319
How dare you try to tear a family apart?

983
00:55:41,489 --> 00:55:43,958
What doctor has no conscience at all?

984
00:55:47,129 --> 00:55:48,159
Actually,

985
00:55:48,498 --> 00:55:50,529
there's something I couldn't tell you before.

986
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:52,498
Da Mi...

987
00:55:52,828 --> 00:55:54,799
came to my hospital recently.

988
00:55:58,538 --> 00:56:00,609
Why are you here? How can I help?

989
00:56:03,248 --> 00:56:05,847
I think I'm pregnant.

990
00:56:05,848 --> 00:56:06,949
How far along are you?

991
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:08,779
Seven months?

992
00:56:10,018 --> 00:56:11,089
I'm not sure.

993
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:13,188
My period is so irregular,

994
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:14,888
I didn't know I was pregnant.

995
00:56:15,558 --> 00:56:17,788
You're a minor. Where's your guardian?

996
00:56:18,828 --> 00:56:19,998
I don't have one.

997
00:56:20,129 --> 00:56:21,598
Your name is Bang Da...

998
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:25,568
Bang Da Mi?

999
00:56:25,569 --> 00:56:27,069
(Patient Registration: Bang Da Mi)

1000
00:56:28,638 --> 00:56:30,338
(Bang Da Mi)

1001
00:56:30,339 --> 00:56:31,938
Yes, Bang Da Mi.

1002
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:35,609
Can I have the abortion today?

1003
00:56:41,018 --> 00:56:42,048
Here.

1004
00:56:42,049 --> 00:56:43,288
I even have her chart.

1005

(Confirmed pregnancy)

1007
00:56:51,058 --> 00:56:52,328
Darn it!

1008
00:56:54,299 --> 00:56:56,199
You darn brat.

1009
00:56:57,929 --> 00:56:59,029
Da Mi.

1010
00:57:07,038 --> 00:57:08,109
Sir.

1011
00:57:08,609 --> 00:57:10,149
I don't trust Dr. Cha.

1012
00:57:10,449 --> 00:57:12,248
Let me take her to another hospital.

1013
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:14,918
That woman is duping you!

1014
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:17,688
How can you say that when you saw her chart?

1015
00:57:18,989 --> 00:57:21,058
You're a brazen little thing.

1016
00:57:22,558 --> 00:57:23,658
Grandpa.

1017
00:57:23,659 --> 00:57:26,328
Please, believe me this once.

1018
00:57:26,388 --> 00:57:27,497
Please, Grandpa.

1019
00:57:27,498 --> 00:57:30,128
Please give us a chance too, sir.

1020
00:57:30,129 --> 00:57:31,728
Please.

1021
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:34,767
Please.

1022
00:57:34,768 --> 00:57:37,239
It really isn't true.

1023
00:57:40,578 --> 00:57:42,138
You look dreadful.

1024
00:57:42,438 --> 00:57:44,078
You should go home.

1025
00:57:44,308 --> 00:57:46,848
I actually need to take things slow for a while.

1026
00:57:52,688 --> 00:57:54,558
Well...

1027
00:57:55,688 --> 00:57:58,788
It's not something to share at a time like this.

1028
00:58:01,259 --> 00:58:02,299
I'm actually...

1029
00:58:03,668 --> 00:58:05,399
pregnant, sir.

1030
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:07,598
What?

1031
00:58:08,768 --> 00:58:10,268
Is that true?

1032
00:58:11,469 --> 00:58:14,078
I hoped to tell you over a lovely dinner...

1033
00:58:14,879 --> 00:58:17,449
and watch you smile happily.

1034
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:19,179
But it came out right now.

1035
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:20,719
It's such a shame.

1036
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:22,018
What a lie.

1037
00:58:22,618 --> 00:58:24,719
You're saying you're pregnant now?

1038
00:58:25,118 --> 00:58:26,348
You expect us to believe that?

1039
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:27,759
I'm an OB-GYN.

1040
00:58:28,219 --> 00:58:29,489
I don't lie about these things.

1041
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:31,429
My darling.

1042
00:58:32,089 --> 00:58:33,228
Thank you.

1043
00:58:33,328 --> 00:58:35,859
You no longer have to fret about your granddaughter.

1044
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:38,328
I will give you...

1045
00:58:38,429 --> 00:58:40,238

1046
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:43,409
Okay, do that. Thank you, Dr. Cha.

1047
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:46,168
I'm so happy.

1048
00:58:49,009 --> 00:58:50,078
Good for you.

(Scarlet Letter)

1050
00:59:10,469 --> 00:59:14,468
Scarlet Letter has infiltrated Bobble's home.

1051
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:15,898
(Where are they? Bobble's place?)

1052
00:59:15,899 --> 00:59:17,367
(This is Bobble's home?)

1053
00:59:17,368 --> 00:59:18,668
(Scarlet Letter is insane.)

1054
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:26,577
Scarlet Letter will reveal...

1055
00:59:26,578 --> 00:59:31,219
the identity of Bobble's man.

1056
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:33,319
Come on.

1057
00:59:34,888 --> 00:59:36,359
Bobble's man...

1058
00:59:37,089 --> 00:59:38,359
turned out to be...

1059
00:59:38,629 --> 00:59:41,058
Bobble's adoptive father.

1060
00:59:45,668 --> 00:59:47,637
This is a massive shock.

1061
00:59:47,638 --> 00:59:51,868
She could have been a victim of grooming for more than ten years.

1062
00:59:52,109 --> 00:59:53,478
I demand the police...

1063
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:56,679
investigate this case right away.

1064
00:59:56,978 --> 00:59:59,909
Investigate.

1065
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:05,118
Investigate.

1066
01:00:08,518 --> 01:00:10,589
What else do I not know?

1067
01:00:13,558 --> 01:00:14,659
Your adoptive dad?

1068
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,268
I don't want to mention the disgusting man.

1069
01:00:18,629 --> 01:00:20,839
What kind of a life did you lead?

1070
01:00:23,098 --> 01:00:24,838
You know that's a lie.

1071
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:26,038
Shut your mouth!

1072
01:00:28,938 --> 01:00:31,478
The truth doesn't matter anymore.

1073
01:00:31,978 --> 01:00:34,248
The truth is what the world believes.

1074
01:00:35,779 --> 01:00:37,888
Go and get me a medical certificate!

1075
01:00:39,118 --> 01:00:40,688
Why do you need one?

1076
01:00:43,688 --> 01:00:44,929
My mom...

1077
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:46,958
would've hugged me first.

1078
01:00:47,429 --> 01:00:48,699
Because she's my mom.

1079
01:00:48,759 --> 01:00:49,958
Because she believes me.

1080
01:00:50,668 --> 01:00:52,898
Why don't you stop to think how hurt I am?

1081
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,469
Explain it, then!

1082
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:57,308
Without your grandfather,

1083
01:00:57,509 --> 01:00:59,208
you're a nobody.

1084
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:01,038
Me too,

1085
01:01:01,379 --> 01:01:03,308
and the drama, it'll all be ruined!

1086
01:01:03,549 --> 01:01:06,379
My life will be ruined!

1087
01:01:16,859 --> 01:01:17,888
Why did you...

1088
01:01:18,828 --> 01:01:19,989
abandon me?

1089
01:01:21,228 --> 01:01:23,299
I cried so much as I waited.

1090
01:01:30,909 --> 01:01:32,868
You didn't lose me on the subway.

1091
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:34,609
You left me there...

1092
01:01:35,009 --> 01:01:36,138
on the bridge.

1093
01:01:40,179 --> 01:01:41,748
I shouldn't have come here.

1094
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:44,319
I'll tell Grandpa.

1095
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,388
I'll see to it that...

1096
01:01:46,518 --> 01:01:48,489
you don't get any of his money.

1097
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:05,768
Mom, I can't breathe.

1098
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:42,078
(Enjoy Seoul's Culture Forest)

1099
01:03:10,168 --> 01:03:13,168
(Shocking! Who's Bobble, the high-school student mom?)

1100
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,118
(The Escape of the Seven)

1101
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,727
- Are you Bang Da Mi's mother? - I don't know the girl.

1102
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:33,698
You must be in shock, as Da Mi's mother.

1103
01:03:33,699 --> 01:03:35,497
Mone, you attend Myeongju High.

1104
01:03:35,498 --> 01:03:37,667
It's true someone gave birth in the art room.

1105
01:03:37,668 --> 01:03:39,267
I'm Nam Chul Woo from Deokseon Police Station.

1106
01:03:39,268 --> 01:03:41,238
If you come after my blood...

1107
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:43,668
Make sure he's done for good so he can never come back.

1108
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:45,708
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

1109
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:47,339
Prove your innocence.

1110
01:03:47,379 --> 01:03:49,577
I'm being threatened.

1111
01:03:49,578 --> 01:03:52,448
Bang Da Mi's trying to get herself killed.

1112
01:03:52,449 --> 01:03:54,279
Do whatever it takes to stop it!

1113
01:03:55,549 --> 01:03:56,819
Kill if you must.
