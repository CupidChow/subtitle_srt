(Episode 13)

13
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,130
No!

14
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:10,910
Min Do Hyuk.

15
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:12,839
Don't do anything from this point forward.

16
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,339
Shoot me!

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,410
If something happens to Matthew,

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,449
I'll kill you myself.

19
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:21,149
Let go!

20
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,890
- Hurry up! - Let go of me!

21
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,958
Hurry up!

22
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,030
Let go!

23
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,259
Hey!

24
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,229
Run away!

25
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,399
Hurry!

26
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:38,069
Whatever! Just die!

27
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,069
Go!

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,470
Go!

29
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,929
The truth will rise to the water's surface soon enough.

30
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:07,759
Matthew.

31
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:09,970
I really hope you are Lee Hwi So.

32
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:13,030
Please show me that you are Lee Hwi So.

33
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,810
Please show me that my concerns were all for nothing.

34
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,039
Do you need money?

35
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:20,710
No.

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,880
I came because I missed Mr. Bang.

37
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:26,680
Mr. Bang said that all this money...

38
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:28,850
belonged to Lee Hwi So.

39
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,120
Then he left the money to me...

40
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,690
and told me not to tell Hwi So.

41
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:37,460
He said that money makes people greedy.

42
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,759
What's the problem?

43
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:40,699
You suddenly want more money?

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,728
We need money to go after Sungchan Group.

45
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:46,169
I need money to protect those I care about!

46
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,669
You were very interested in money to the point that it seemed strange.

47
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:52,609
And...

48
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,639
Don't lie.

49
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,850
You were already in league with K!

50
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,109
Calm down.

51
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,119
We will find out the truth when Do Hyuk wakes up.

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,549
Don't try to defend her.

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,549
Do Hyuk might die!

54
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,289
I saw your crocodile shoes...

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,930
at the place where Do Hyuk got hurt.

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,459
I had to check...

57
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,970
(Sojung Hospital)

58
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:20,239
whether or not you were really Lee Hwi So.

59
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,539
Come to the Han River dock by midnight.

60
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,039
Take a taxi so that no one follows you.

61
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,710
How did you know about K's hideout?

62
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,619
A month ago, I was following Mone,

63
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,120
and I saw K's car by chance.

64
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,318
I asked the owner of a nearby food truck...

65
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,720
to let me know if she sees that car again.

66
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,120
What's the license plate?

67
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,719
It's 3482.

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,090
A red sports car.

69
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,630
(49M3482)

70
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,329
How much do you know about Matthew?

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,130
I know one thing for sure.

72
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,298
Matthew...

73
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,000
is different from Lee Hwi So.

74
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,669
He has become a complete noble already.

75
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,669
I fell for how sexy he looked while he was surfing.

76
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,410
Matthew surfs?

77
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,009
You didn't know?

78
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,609
He was practically a pro.

79
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,419
How can a death row convict be afraid of water?

80
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,060
This punk. He almost died in a river when he was young,

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,130
so he's terrified of water.

82
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,289
It was shocking...

83
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,330
Try to get out!

84
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:22,260
that Lee Hwi So enjoyed surfing.

85
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,070
That's because Lee Hwi So was deathly afraid of water.

86
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:29,499
Then, you can't become Lee Hwi So.

87
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:33,309
Geum La Hui.

88
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,739
I need your help.

89
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,979
Go after Matthew.

90
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,720
I'll take care of the aftermath.

91
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,660
It's not true. Right?

92
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,960
It can't be.

93
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:53,129
Matthew, you can't be K.

94
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,369
No.

95
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,830
I am K.

96
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,710
The K who you've been searching for so desperately.

97
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:08,410
The murderer K who killed Bang Da Mi and Bang Chil Sung.

98
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,109
Honey.

99
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,150
Hurry up and come home.

100
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,789
I'm in so much pain.

101
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,249
Hurry.

102
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,590
Honey! Hello?

103
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,280
What idiots.

104
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,809
It was also me who killed the detective on Jeju Island.

105
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:47,850
That jerk tried to catch me.

106
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:55,719
No one would've imagined...

107
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,929
that I got plastic surgery to look like Matthew.

108
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,900
I can change into anyone I want.

109
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:07,498
Don't come!

110
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:08,799
You can't come here!

111
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,309
No!

112
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,939
How did you like my tearful act?

113
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,379
Mr. Bang, Min Do Hyuk, and even you, Kang Ki Tak,

114
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,320
were totally fooled.

115
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,119
I verified that Chairman Bang died just now.

116
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:28,020
Congratulations.

117
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,660
Everything is going according to your plan, K.

118
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:34,600
That old man lived too long.

119
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:37,100
It hurt my pride.

120
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:47,640
Mr. Gu.

121
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:49,379
Get rid of Song Ji A.

122
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,879
We should make it a suicide. Right?

123
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,090
Whoever knows my name must disappear from this world.

124
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:05,429
Many people have died,

125
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,259
but my objective wasn't Bang Da Mi, Lee Hwi So, or Chairman Bang.

126
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,929
Only Min Do Hyuk.

127
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:15,039
I'm in trouble.

128
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,200
Then...

129
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:18,910
die.

130
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,749
How dare you...

131
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:25,879
speak my name out loud?

132
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,650
My father...

133
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,049
is on my side.

134
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,720
Forever!

135
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,950
He's on his son's side.

136
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,030
This should be good enough...

137
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,970
for Min Do Hyuk to believe. Right?

138
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,238
To be honest, my target...

139
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,969
wasn't Bang Da Mi's family.

140
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,439
It was yours.

141
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,239
I wanted to make you completely miserable.

142
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:13,059
Tricking Min Do Hyuk was a piece of cake.

143
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,030
I've already made him like me so much.

144
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,400
The origin of my unhappiness.

145
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,169
I'm already so excited to think about killing that jerk.

146
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,830
Who are you?

147
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,210
I said, who are you?

148
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,139
Me?

149
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,769
Who are you?

150
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,609
You're not Lee Hwi So. Right?

151
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,369
You're right.

152
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,279
It's me, K.

153
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,810
It's an honour that you recognized me first, Kang Ki Tak.

154
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,649
You're really K?

155
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,790
This doesn't make sense!

156
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,460
Making things that don't make sense happen...

157
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,159
is my forte.

158
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:53,659
You murderous lunatic!

159
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,970
Mr. Bang believed in you until the very end.

160
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,609
But you lied to him?

161
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,109
Why?

162
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:08,810
Where's Lee Hwi So?

163
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:10,549
Tell me!

164
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,710
Does someone as useless as him need to be alive?

165
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,420
Tiger!

166
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,060
Tie this crazy kid up right now!

167
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,560
I'm going to find out even if it means I tear you limb from limb.

168
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,430
Lee Hwi So.

169
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:35,470
I'm going to find him no matter what.

170
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,340
Do you think you can?

171
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,109
What do you think the likes of you can do?

172
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,739
Why you...

173
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:48,979
What are you doing?

174
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,350
Let go!

175
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,090
You're so naive.

176
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,960
Do you still not know how the world works?

177
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,259
What are you doing?

178
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,519
Why?

179
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:59,330
It's the innate nature of people like us...

180
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,100
to join people who have money and power.

181
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,509
This is as far as I'm willing to entertain you, Ki Tak.

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,739
You...

183
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:12,940
I'm...

184
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,509
I'm going to kill you.

185
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,560
(Obongjip)

186
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:38,528
Let's drink! Cheers!

187
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:39,800
- Cheers! - Cheers!

188
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,239
You're a genius!

189
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:51,810
Why didn't we think to get rid of Lee Hwi So?

190
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,619
Then does this mean K won't threaten us anymore?

191
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,748
Now that Lee Hwi So is gone,

192
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,289
there's no need for K to use us as human shields.

193
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,460
From now on, everything will be good!

194
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,658
Have something to eat first.

195
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:06,259
Open up. Goodness.

196
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,829
Is Ms. Geum treating us today?

197
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,129
Of course.

198
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,399
It's delicious because you gave it to me,

199
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,569
and it's even more delicious because Ms. Geum's buying.

200
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,369
Is it okay to be so happy all of a sudden?

201
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,450
Bear in mind...

202
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,908
that the chains are already going to be broken.

203
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:29,080
When I give you the sign, go after Matthew.

204
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,248
Act well so that he doesn't suspect anything.

205
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:32,889
Don't worry about the acting.

206
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:38,528
But is Matthew really dead?

207
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,459
The water level is high because of the last downpour,

208
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,999
and that area has a strong current.

209
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,029
Nobody could come out of there alive.

210
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:46,830
By the way,

211
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,700
I don't have to shoot that movie anymore. Right?

212
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,540
It's not over yet.

213
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:53,609
We still have Kang Ki Tak and Min Do Hyuk left.

214
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,350
The center is gone, so what can the rest do?

215
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:02,049
They don't have a reason to seek revenge.

216
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,549
It's not like they're related to Da Mi. Don't you think?

217
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,649
Ms. Geum.

218
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,858
Let's be honest.

219
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:11,090
What made you come up with this incredible plan?

220
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:13,429
Did you have a helper?

221
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,729
- A helper? - A helper?

222
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:18,599
Goodness.

223
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,639
I'm sure Ms. Geum had something to fall back on to do this.

224
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,940
Why does that matter?

225
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:27,340
As long as it's not Kang Ki Tak.

226
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:31,278
In any case, I can finally breathe.

227
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,079
Let's forget about the past...

228
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,018
and get drunk tonight. Let's even go for another round.

229
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,419
(No Paeng Hee)

230
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,349
Now that I don't have to worry about my mission,

231
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,518
this liquor tastes so sweet.

232
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,590
Excuse me.

233
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,029
- Not really. I'm good. - Okay.

234
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,559
Did something happen?

235
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,899
Is Han Na unwell again?

236
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,099
Someone was watching Han Na.

237
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,700
He even came to the hospital.

238
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:55,939
What did he look like?

239
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,710
I only saw him from the back.

240
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,239
But according to Han Na,

241
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:04,850
his nails were bumpy and covered in manicure.

242
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,950
Why are you asking about Min Do Hyuk?

243
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,519
Just because...

244
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,889
I don't like him.

245
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,629
It's Sim Jun Seok.

246
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,029
He...

247
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,700
knows about Han Na?

248
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,398
Pull yourself together, Paeng Hee.

249
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,639
You're Han Na's mom. Focus on protecting her.

250
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:32,539
If I leave now, I can get there in an hour.

251
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,609
Get her discharged from the hospital and leave.

252
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,499
Are you up?

253
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,199
What...

254
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,869
Matthew!

255
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,408
Are you okay?

256
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:10,139
Do you think I would die that easily?

257
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:16,378
Where's Kang Ki Tak? I'll go meet him.

258
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:17,819
I'll go and ask him...

259
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,190
why he chose to betray us.

260
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Do Hyuk.

261
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,989
Mr. Kang disappeared.

262
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,729
I searched his house and office,

263
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,070
but I couldn't find him.

264
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,440
Baek Ik Ho would know.

265
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:37,369
They were abandoned too.

266
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Just like you.

267
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:52,590
Matthew, I found this in Ki Tak's car. K's shoe.

268
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,518
I don't understand!

269
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,388
How could Ki Tak join Sungchan's side?

270
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,629
Mr. Kang is only human. He could get greedy.

271
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,699
I'd feel better...

272
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,299
if he abandoned me to live a better life.

273
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,799
But I think he was used by Sungchan...

274
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,999
and killed.

275
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,108
What are you talking about?

276
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:14,310
Don't you see why Chairman Sim approached him?

277
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,879
He's the one who had all of Chairman Bang's money.

278
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,879
But if they took that from him...

279
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,149
then ultimately...

280
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,550
Darn it!

281
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,158
Darn...

282
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,560
What I'm worried about more...

283
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,570
is that Mr. Kang knows too much of our secrets.

284
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:45,039
If Sungchan knows all of our plans...

285
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,979
No, I won't let that happen.

286
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,850
I'm going to kill everyone who ruined Ki Tak.

287
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,649
In the most cruel and painful way.

288
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,389
Get some more sleep.

289
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,629
Starting tomorrow, we'll really be at war.

290
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,899
Ki Tak!

291
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,719
Luka. Who am I?

292
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:33,889
Your name is Matthew Lee, sir.

293
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,218
You were born in Seoul in 1980.

294
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:38,259
You immigrated to New Jersey at the age of 11.

295
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,729
You were the youngest student to enter MIT's engineering program.

296
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,499
You graduated Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

297
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,029
Currently, you are the CEO of TIKITAKA.

298
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,899
No, you're wrong.

299
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,699
My name is Sim Jun Seok.

300
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,668
I'm the only son and heir to Sungchan Group...

301
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,609
and the center of everyone's envy.

302
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,389
Hey.

303
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,760
My life was perfect.

304
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,159
I have a father with absolute power and a warm mother.

305
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,600
I was a man who had everything.

306
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,469
My gosh, my son is incredible!

307
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:25,969
To celebrate Jun Seok entering high school at the top of his class,

308
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,879
I prepared a gift.

309
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,310
Train him well.

310
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,179
Really?

311
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,850
Thank you!

312
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,320
Thank you so much!

313
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:39,590
This is so amazing!

314
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:42,260
Gosh.

315
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,260
I love it!

316
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,330
Thank you, Father.

317
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,270
I was really happy.

318
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:04,510
But do you know...

319
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,949
what happened a month later?

320
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,419
The horse my father gave me...

321
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,719
died.

322
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:14,990
It fell off a cliff.

323
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,199
Okay. Open!

324
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:46,389
Hi!

325
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,300
Let's play.

326
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,649
Kang Ki Tak. It's your turn now.

327
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,590
Darn it.

328
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:27,959
Hello.

329
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,530
Hey, you son... Darn it.

330
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,840
Shouldn't you thank me for letting you live?

331
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:39,070
How long has it been?

332
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,480
Since when were you K, not Lee Hwi So?

333
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,409
I love how you're so direct.

334
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:50,719
Let's ask one question each to be fair.

335
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,919
How long has it been me?

336
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:57,290
Do you want to know?

337
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,399
It was more predictable than I expected.

338
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,800
Open the doors.

339
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,070
(Happy Corrections, Happy Citizens)

340
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,279
Let go of me! Why?

341
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,080
Why would he do that because of me?

342
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,319
After breaking his spine from the fall,

343
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,020
he had surgery to put in 50 pins, and he overcame that.

344
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:30,388
For the past six months,

345
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,029
he received physical therapy daily to get better.

346
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,159
With the sole purpose of becoming you, Hwi So.

347
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,369
I've figured out your plan.

348
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:57,619
(Operating Room)

349
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,990
We'll put you under now.

350
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,619
(Authorized Personnel Only)

351
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,030
We'll put you under now.

352
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:53,968
The person who got plastic surgery five years ago...

353
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:58,550
was me, Sim Jun Seok, not Lee Hwi So.

354
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,520
Even the tattoo is perfect.

355
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,760
What do you think? Isn't it incredible?

356
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:59,270
People really do love money.

357
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,780
People will sell out their parents and their children...

358
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,879
for money.

359
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:08,850
On that note,

360
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,649
good for you, Ki Tak,

361
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,689
for not being greedy...

362
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,619
about Chairman Bang's money.

363
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,730
It's my turn now.

364
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,230
Since when did you know...

365
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,429
that I wasn't Lee Hwi So?

366
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:28,939
My acting was quite good.

367
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,369
Do you want to know?

368
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:36,609
Lee Hwi So...

369
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:40,280
had a phobia of water.

370
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:43,250
That was the key piece of evidence.

371
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:48,219
That slipped by me.

372
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:52,459
I didn't know that fool couldn't even swim.

373
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,100
You're the fool.

374
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,760
From the beginning,

375
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,929
something about you was different from Lee Hwi So.

376
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,770
Why are you escaping from jail every day?

377
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:08,409
What are you trying to do?

378
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:10,040
I need to find my baby.

379
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,109
I'm going to get...

380
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:15,149
a small loft with Da Mi...

381
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,919
and live there with her.

382
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,560
If Da Mi turns out to be dead,

383
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:26,330
what will you do then?

384
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,100
I'll find those who did that to Da Mi,

385
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,399
rip them to pieces,

386
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:35,899
and fall into a fiery pit of misery with them.

387
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,139
Lee Hwi So was prepared to die...

388
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:41,070
after getting his revenge.

389
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,980
He wouldn't have thought...

390
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,879
about getting rich because of Sungchan Group's money.

391
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,149
Don't be silly.

392
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,919
People...

393
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:53,689
are cruel.

394
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:56,790
Even real fathers and fake fathers.

395
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,060
How dare you insult him?

396
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,530
You scum.

397
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,609
Stop spewing nonsense...

398
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,280
and tell me where the money is!

399
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:22,649
Fine!

400
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,320
I am very interested in money.

401
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:26,649
So spill it.

402
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,389
Where did you hide...

403
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,859
the old man's money?

404
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,148
Did anyone follow you?

405
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:53,178
No.

406
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,819
Is Han Na okay?

407
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,080
She had quite a scare.

408
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:58,020
Her treatment isn't done yet.

409
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,850
I'm all better now.

410
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,020
It doesn't hurt at all.

411
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,858
Han Na. We're going to play a game.

412
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,199
You know hide-and-seek, right?

413
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,199
Nobody can know where we are.

414
00:27:11,469 --> 00:27:14,299
We're going to call it the shadow game.

415
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,439
Do you think you can do it?

416
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:20,669
As long...

417
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,780
as Mom is with me.

418
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:38,290
Han Na.

419
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:40,358
Everything will be fine.

420
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,800
I'm here. Okay?

421
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,699
Let's go.

422
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,840
Where is the old man's money?

423
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,969
Just the land he bought with the information I gave him...

424
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,810
should be worth hundreds of millions, at least.

425
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:57,480
No. It could be worth billions.

426
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,080
And just in cash too.

427
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,750
Just tell me where Lee Hwi So is.

428
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:06,290
You can't act like that if you want to see Lee Hwi So.

429
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,719
That means Lee Hwi So is still alive.

430
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:14,459
Why didn't you kill him?

431
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,169
Is there something else you want from Lee Hwi So...

432
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,300
other than the business plan...

433
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,639
he wrote for TIKITAKA?

434
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:26,969
This jerk.

435
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,740
But your goal wasn't Lee Hwi So.

436
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,280
Lee Hwi So was just unlucky to get tangled up in your plan.

437
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:38,290
Your original target...

438
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,290
was Min Do Hyuk.

439
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:43,959
What could it be?

440
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,629
The inferior complex you have...

441
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,159
because of Do Hyuk.

442
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,040
This is why...

443
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:57,300
I don't like guys who are good at reading people.

444
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,480
(Hydrochloric Acid)

445
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,480
There's something nice here.

446
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,820
This is the end...

447
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,560
of our game.

448
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,269
(Matthew Lee)

449
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,300
(Doctor Oh. Come down here.)

450
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:07,770
(Equz)

451
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:25,959
It's a bit shabby,

452
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,189
but stay here until Han Na's passport is ready.

453
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,559
Get food delivered.

454
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,959
You cannot go outside.

455
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,300
What about you?

456
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,369
It'll be hard for me to come by.

457
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,169
If anyone follows me, you'll be in danger.

458
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,609
I'll keep looking for ways to leave the country as soon as possible.

459
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,909
This phone can't be wiretapped.

460
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,510
Don't throw it away this time.

461
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:45,510
I'll be in touch.

462
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,149
Please don't get hurt.

463
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,829
Hey.

464
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,560
Did you forget I was a gangster?

465
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm not going down easily.

466
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:29,189
(Equz)

467
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:40,100
What now?

468
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:26,750
You jerk!

469
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,230
Get out, you jerk!

470
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:50,040
What are you doing?

471
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,040
Darn it!

472
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,949
You wanted to see me?

473
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,820
I think we'll need something a bit stronger.

474
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,619
I'll get it ready right away, sir.

475
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:28,938
I injected the maximum amount of drugs.

476
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:31,510
His mind will soon become hazy, and he'll open his mouth.

477
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:38,750
Where did you hide...

478
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,189
the money?

479
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,219
I'm...

480
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,530
Kang Ki Tak.

481
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,399
I can't think of it.

482
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,369
I must keep the money safe.

483
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,510
I must keep Mr. Bang's money safe from this monster.

484
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,920
Where is it?

485
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,290
Tell me, Kang Ki Tak.

486
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:17,920
It's okay.

487
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,389
You'll feel better once you tell me.

488
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,529
Zero...

489
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:31,540
Zero...

490
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,080
One, nine.

491
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,279
Zero, one, nine?

492
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:40,210
Is that a password?

493
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,650
The location?

494
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,350
Where is it?

495
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,920
You're doing very well.

496
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,759
Don't worry and tell me everything.

497
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,560
A yellow...

498
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:00,130
see-saw.

499
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:03,540
A yellow see-saw?

500
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,770
Darn it. Why now?

501
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,839
Who on earth is calling me?

502
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,549
(Yang Jin Mo)

503
00:35:20,049 --> 00:35:21,150
What is it?

504
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,819
I have a favour to ask.

505
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,290
You have to say yes.

506
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,159
Were we so close?

507
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:31,198
Look after Madam No for me. She's in danger.

508
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,799
You're the only one who can help.

509
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:36,199
Why are you leaving me the person you searched everywhere for?

510
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:39,110
You know she has a thing for you, punk.

511
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,310
For all her life,

512
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,409
she cared only for you.

513
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,920
She never opened up to me.

514
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:51,679
She'll feel safer around you.

515
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,460
K is after Madam No.

516
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,920
Why?

517
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:01,659
The girl she's raising...

518
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,500
is K's daughter.

519
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:07,730
(Kang Ki Tak)

520
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:09,869
K's kid...

521
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,369
is alive?

522
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,980
Why is she with Madam No?

523
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,179
I needed something to blackmail K with.

524
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,249
But he knows everything now.

525
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,779
I don't care if I die.

526
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,520
Protect Paeng Hee and the kid.

527
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,549
What do you want me to do?

528
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,420
Send Paeng Hee and Han Na abroad.

529
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,630
Anywhere's fine if K can't touch them.

530
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:35,699
- I have a condition. - I'm listening.

531
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,429
Don't call Madam No ever again.

532
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:41,029
If you want them to live.

533
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:47,810
I swear to the deities I won't call her.

534
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,210
I promise.

535
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:51,380
Where are you?

536
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,350
At Cherry...

537
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,920
No. Taebaek Entertainment, basement level parking.

538
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:08,230
So that's why she bothered me so much.

539
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:10,460
(Sojung Hospital)

540
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:18,170
What? Choco.

541
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,880
Thank you.

542
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,449
She's my daughter?

543
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:40,560
Mr. Gu, it's me.

544
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,529
Go to Cherry Entertainment right now.

545
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,569
Han Mone...

546
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,819
Kang Ki Tak...

547
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:09,659
will help.

548
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,259
Aren't you pleased?

549
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:22,540
You must stay alive.

550
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,270
That's all I ask for.

551
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,259
- Let's go! - Do it. You can do it.

552
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,429
Yes, I can do it.

553
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,928
Hey!

554
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:51,130
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

555
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,400
Do you want to get kicked out?

556
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:56,540
Try to understand where they're coming from.

557
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,568
My dear actor has to get in shape for the movie.

558
00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:03,778
To be honest, I'm doing you a favour.

559
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:05,178
Once I get into shape,

560
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,909
you'll be the ones who get to ogle.

561
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:08,980
Yes, I'll get to ogle.

562
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,790
Dear actor, drink this up.

563
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:18,960
Good for you.

564
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,029
How sexy.

565
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,770
Thanks, Manager.

566
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,770
If you become ripped as well...

567
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,838
Will I go blind?

568
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,869
That would be a pity, but what can I do?

569
00:39:58,299 --> 00:39:59,730
I'm sorry, Ji A.

570
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,270
I came by way too late.

571
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,810
(Tuesday, August 15, 2023)

572
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,209
(October 2, 2023, I guess there is a god.)

573
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,579
(I was a coward, and I'm paying for it now.)

574
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,020
(If I hadn't ignored Da Mi then, would she be alive?)

575
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,218
(I knew Mone and Sungchan's heir...)

576
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:25,488
(I must meet Sungchan's chairman.)

577
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,759
(There's no way back, even if something scary happens.)

578
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,698
(I don't feel bad at all.)

579
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:32,928
(My heart is torn to shreds.)

580
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,400
(I miss my sister so much. Sorry, Sis.)

581
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:43,678
(Even if something scary happens...)

582
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,810
(I want to live like a decent human. Dear D...)

583
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,290
(The late Song Ji A)

584
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,460
Give me one shot.

585
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:03,929
To make them pay...

586
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,770
many times over for what they did.

587
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,649
Bottom's up.

588
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,350
- Cheers. - Bottom's up.

589
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,360
Here comes another shot.

590
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,860
- Cheers. - Cheers.

591
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,330
I must be out of my mind.

592
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:41,429
- You passed out? - I'm still awake.

593
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,439
What are you putting on?

594
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,439
- It's called maintenance. - Me too, maintenance.

595
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,739
Can you put that on my face too?

596
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,480
I'll become Han Mone too.

597
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,948
I'll become pretty like Mone.

598
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:56,749
Darling, am I pretty?

599
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,879
- You're pretty. - Am I?

600
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,520
Put on some more.

601
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,790
One, two.

602
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,190
There.

603
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,259
Kiss.

604
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:13,169
I was actually quite surprised and impressed with Ms. Geum.

605
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,170
What?

606
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,299
How did she get the idea of attacking Matthew?

607
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,408
I thought she was dreaming of marrying him.

608
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:21,769
Her and him?

609
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,379
Enemies can't marry.

610
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,239
They'd kill each other on their honeymoon.

611
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,020
You had help from Kang Ki Tak, didn't you?

612
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,789
You did.

613
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:38,118
How did he end up betraying Matthew?

614
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,429
Or did he help you out of love?

615
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,629
I feel so bad for the guy.

616
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,899
Ms. Geum doesn't care for him at all.

617
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,770
How do you know that?

618
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:50,298
Even if they've broken up, not even a deity...

619
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:52,269
can tell how a couple will end up.

620
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,969
If Ms. Geum liked Kang Ki Tak even one bit,

621
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:57,380
would she have come up with this kind of plan?

622
00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:00,779
- What? - It's so obvious you used him.

623
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,350
What?

624
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:04,179
What do you mean?

625
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,519
Matthew's body will surface soon,

626
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,289
and you'll need someone to go down for murder.

627
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,318
They wanted Matthew's money,

628
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:13,960
so Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak killed him.

629
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,999
Isn't that the story you're going for?

630
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,199
My goodness. Was that it?

631
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,400
I had no idea.

632
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,469
I have a lot to learn from you.

633
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:32,009
The more I know you, the scarier you become.

634
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:33,509
Bang.

635
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,480
I'll take that as a compliment.

636
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,819
Oh, right.

637
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,218
Today's shoot at the amusement park. I can skip it, right?

638
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,118
Of course you can.

639
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:45,520
Matthew's dead now.

640
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,589
I wonder when it'll be on the news.

641
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:51,198
Who is it?

642
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,968
Did you order more snacks?

643
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:54,900
- Gosh. - We already have so much.

644
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,838
I'm so full I might burst.

645
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,739
- What else did you order? - Yes.

646
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,690
What is it?

647
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,520
My goodness.

648
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,819
Matthew.

649
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,819
Matthew's alive!

650
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,089
What?

651
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:41,080
It's a ghost!

652
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,149
Oh, no!

653
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,318
Put me down.

654
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:46,749
My legs work just fine!

655
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,520
Watch my legs! My legs!

656
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:52,959
My neck hurts. Gosh.

657
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,060
This is nonsense.

658
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,559
How could he survive that?

659
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,600
Hands off.

660
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:02,500
Save me!

661
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,599
Let me off!

662
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,770
Stop this thing!

663
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,150
- Stop this! - Why are you doing this to us?

664
00:45:49,009 --> 00:45:50,380
Let me off!

665
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,170
Please spare me.

666
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,199
Oh, gosh.

667
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,540
You dared to set up a plan to kill me?

668
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,508
You should've become bat food on the island off Jeju,

669
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:22,149
but I treated you like humans.

670
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,719
Did you forget your crimes already?

671
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,589
Fine. If you don't want to die in comfort,

672
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,360
I'll show you what purgatory is like.

673
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,388
No!

674
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,690
- Please, no. - Spare me.

675
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:39,060
Whose idea was it?

676
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,040
Her. It was Geum La Hui.

677
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,068
Yes. I really didn't want to take part,

678
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:49,738
but Ms. Geum insisted.

679
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:52,408
I even completed the mission you set me.

680
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,408
I had no reason to plan this!

681
00:46:54,409 --> 00:46:56,179
I had no reason to betray you either.

682
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,119
Ms. Geum was the one who said this was our only shot.

683
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:02,249
How can you all turn on her?

684
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,520
Ms. Geum, I didn't say a word.

685
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:07,088
That you acted like you'd kill us if we didn't help.

686
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:08,229
I didn't say so.

687
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,699
You pathetic, disloyal fools.

688
00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:12,770
You're all cowards.

689
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,469
Fine. I'll take full responsibility.

690
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:18,139
You'll take the blame alone?

691
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,710
How?

692
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,239
Give us a little more time.

693
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,980
I'll do anything it takes so everyone fulfils their mission.

694
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,250
There's only one ending for a traitor.

695
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:32,580
Death.

696
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:34,549
I'll get the film back on track.

697
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,389
Trust us just this once, even if you kill us later.

698
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:43,699
Very well, then.

699
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,529
You have one more day.

700
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,540
If Chairman Sim doesn't bow in apology by then,

701
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:53,738
you'll find yourselves...

702
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:55,009
in the afterlife.

703
00:47:55,969 --> 00:47:59,080
Do whatever it takes to use your skill set...

704
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,548
to bring down Sungchan Group.

705
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:01,710
Okay.

706
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,349
Working separately won't get us anywhere now.

707
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:10,888
We must work together to fulfill the missions and survive.

708
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,559
We share the same fate.

709
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,029
That darn phrase!

710
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,860
I'm sick of it now.

711
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:19,500
Shall we all give up and die, then?

712
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,000
Just tell us what you're thinking!

713
00:48:24,299 --> 00:48:26,969
I heard that Michell is planning...

714
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,040
a press conference here tonight.

715
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,739
Call the journalists you know so the place is packed.

716
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,449
Who would come?

717
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,318
We all know how famous Michell is,

718
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:39,019
but no one will print her story.

719
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:42,118
All the media executives are afraid Sungchan will cancel their deals.

720
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,460
Do as you're told.

721
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,690
Say I'll pay a grand per head just for attending.

722
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,428
Mone, memorize your lines and be on standby.

723
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:49,560
We'll resume the shoot.

724
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,829
There's no way it will.

725
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,299
Shut your mouth and obey me!

726
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,540
I put everything I have on the line for this!

727
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,969
You all had better put everything but your life on the line.

728
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:03,209
Nam Chul Woo. Get Cha Ju Ran...

729
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,139
back into Chairman Sim's house.

730
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,480
Cha Ju Ran.

731
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:10,118
Get his key to Sungchan Gallery's VIP Room...

732
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:11,949
and a copy of his prints to Go Myoung Ji.

733
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:13,790
Okay.

734
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,519
The VIP room should have an infra-red detector.

735
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,889
- Be prepared. - Okay.

736
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,259
We'll regroup once we're ready.

737
00:49:21,029 --> 00:49:22,129
Get moving!

738
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,230
Okay.

739
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,580
(Director Michell, Urgent Press Conference)

740
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,459
Those people...

741
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,989
Is this how influential Michell is?

742
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:57,699
There are more famous directors here than any other film festival.

743
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,670
(Director Michell, Urgent Press Conference)

744
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:27,159
Hello, I'm Michell.

745
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:29,659
I wasn't expecting this big a crowd.

746
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,600
My movie "Dear D"...

747
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:35,199
is about a murderer without a face.

748
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:39,400
By depicting the death of a teen who was tortured with lies,

749
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:41,468
I want to say that we all...

750
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:43,980
agreed to what happened and became accomplices.

751
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,279
But right now,

752
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:49,949
an injunction to prohibit the shoot is in place,

753
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,679
and sponsors are backing out one by one.

754
00:50:52,819 --> 00:50:54,989
The whole project is in peril.

755
00:50:55,750 --> 00:51:00,230
Dear colleagues of mine who appreciate my work...

756
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:03,230
agreed to be here today to offer their support.

757
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,929
With respect and gratitude,

758
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:10,540
I'll sing you a song from the soundtrack.

759
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:21,110
You're not here anymore

760
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:25,480
I can't see you ever again

761
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:29,659
I loved you more than I loved myself

762
00:51:29,759 --> 00:51:34,089
And I hated myself for it

763
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:38,299
I knew we were lying to each other

764
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,239
But I loved you anyway

765
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:47,040
I was hopelessly drawn to you

766
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:51,509
The love I'd chosen

767
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:54,880
It was you

768
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:09,860
Whatever oppression we face, the truth and what the killer did...

769
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,100
must remain in your hearts.

770
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,029
If this movie were to never happen,

771
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:18,040
I can willingly accept that.

772
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,009
But that means...

773
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:22,369
I must reveal the guilty.

774
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,980
I'll reveal the names...

775
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,650
of the guilty party.

776
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:36,389
Let me...

777
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:37,759
do that for you.

778
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,670
I'm Geum La Hui,

779
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,540
the CEO of TIKITAKA Studio that's producing this movie.

780
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,409
It took a lot...

781
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,739
to take to the stage tonight.

782
00:52:57,179 --> 00:52:58,980
There was some pressure too.

783
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:00,880
Despite that,

784
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:02,909
this movie...

785
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:04,920
has to...

786
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,089
be produced and become a success.

787
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,659
As a mom, to make up for what I did.

788
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,199
What? As a mom?

789
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,769
What do you mean you want to make up for what you did as a mom?

790
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,369
Is there a personal reason?

791
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:27,739
Is it related to the late Bang Da Mi?

792
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:32,880
I am...

793
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:36,980
Bang Da Mi's biological mother.

794
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:45,560
I can say so now.

795
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:49,089
For...

796
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,900
my daughter who was wrongfully killed.

797
00:53:58,799 --> 00:54:00,009
As a mom,

798
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:03,139
as family of the victim,

799
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:05,540
I made this movie.

800
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,980
I'll fight the fake news to the very end.

801
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,750
I'll overcome any oppression.

802
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,489
Once again,

803
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,060
I ask Sungchan Group!

804
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,429
Who killed...

805
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,170
Bang Da Mi?

806
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:36,880
Sungchan's Chairman Sim and Sim Jun Seok must answer!

807
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,139
Also,

808
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,949
I strongly request the prosecution and police...

809
00:54:42,009 --> 00:54:44,150
to reinvestigate...

810
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,719
my daughter,

811
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:48,850
Bang Da Mi's case.

812
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,759
Are you really Bang Da Mi's mother?

813
00:54:53,759 --> 00:54:55,929
How did you end up drifting apart?

814
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:08,868
Why didn't you reveal this sooner?

815
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:10,309
Kang Ki Tak is...

816
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,739
planning to take you down.

817
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:16,278
He told us to attack you when we were by the river.

818
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,380
Of course, he and Baek Ik Ho...

819
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,989
won't come to your rescue.

820
00:55:24,089 --> 00:55:25,190
So,

821
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:26,889
what did you say?

822
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:28,429
I said I'd do it.

823
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:31,060
Why are you telling me about it, then?

824
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:35,029
I heard you two were engaged at one point.

825
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,670
Because I need you to live.

826
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:41,110
You know that...

827
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,179
I'm on your side.

828
00:56:04,299 --> 00:56:05,799
Do I look that simple minded to you?

829
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,500
Just do as Ki Tak says.

830
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,270
I'll fend for myself.

831
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:17,380
I don't care if you betray Ki Tak or not.

832
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,610
You're just one of the people I want to get back at.

833
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,779
So don't try to get smart.

834
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,850
Tell me your plan.

835
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,948
I can do anything you want.

836
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:30,589
What must I do to gain your forgiveness?

837
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,529
Forgiveness?

838
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:40,029
Put your life on the line and prove your loyalty.

839
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,670
Then I'll think about...

840
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,299
our relationship.

841
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,909
Matthew, can you still push me away after that?

842
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,170
I just changed my mind.

843
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:50,710
You, as a woman,

844
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,239
are quite alluring.

845
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:57,080
Is there a reason for all this?

846
00:56:57,819 --> 00:56:59,420
What's the truth?

847
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,659
Why didn't you reveal this sooner?

848
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,119
(Hydrochloric Acid)

849
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:51,639
Darn it.

850
00:59:16,449 --> 00:59:20,130
Message... Send help...

851
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,798
"The hat on the art room floor is your bobble hat."

852
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:07,810
(Mone, you're the best.)

853
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,739
Aren't you glad you get to be in the movie again?

854
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,409
But why does your face look like you're not?

855
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,879
If you came here to pick a fight...

856
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,520
with a tired actress after an all-night shoot, I'll decline.

857
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:24,690
Can't you see how rough my skin is because I'm lacking sleep?

858
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,790
I have to get ready for the next scene, so please leave.

859
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:32,199
(Glutathione)

860
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,270
Didn't you hear me?

861
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:46,440
The set must've been pretty scary for you.

862
01:00:47,049 --> 01:00:49,678
I'm sure it was a bit awkward to have to reveal to the world...

863
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,020
what crazy stuff you did.

864
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,020
You. Who on earth are you?

865
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:03,060
I'm sorry for the late introduction.

866
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:06,029
I am...

867
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,600
Song Ji A's older sister.

868
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,100
My Korean name is Song Ji Sun.

869
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,009
No way.

870
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:24,679
Ji A had an older sister?

871
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:26,380
Yes, she did.

872
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,448
I went to the US at 17 years old as if I was running away.

873
01:01:29,449 --> 01:01:31,489
And I came back to Korea after exactly 12 years...

874
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:33,529
to meet you, Han Mone.

875
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:37,100
You're lying.

876
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,599
Ji A was an orphan who didn't have a mom or any family.

877
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,969
Is that why you thought she was an easy target?

878
01:01:41,299 --> 01:01:42,798
Is that why you threatened her?

879
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,400
That she was a murderer who killed her father?

880
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,210
But it was actually me who killed our father.

881
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:49,909
What will you do now?

882
01:01:50,279 --> 01:01:52,179
Why don't you try threatening me too?

883
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:55,250
I'll take whatever you throw at me.

884
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,819
But in return, you'll have to be ready.

885
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,080
There's no one else...

886
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:02,589
who knows what kind of girl you are better than me.

887
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,060
("Dear D," The heroine of "Dear D," Han Mone)

888
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:10,329
- Ms. Han. - Ms. Han.

889
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,459
Is it true that you were friends with Bang Da Mi?

890
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,868
Do you have any relation with the true story?

891
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:15,599
Do you know anything about the Bobble case?

892
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,798
- Please give us a statement. - Ms. Han.

893
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,100
Mone says she's so happy to be back on set.

894
01:02:20,509 --> 01:02:22,110
Look how flushed she is from the excitement.

895
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:26,310
Please make sure Mone looks good in the photos.

896
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:31,249
How do you feel about being back on set?

897
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,419
What do you think about Sungchan Group's reaction?

898
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:36,349
I hear you know the name of Bang Da Mi's killer. Is that true?

899
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:38,319
- How long have you known this? - Please look over here!

900
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:41,460
I ask Sungchan Group!

901
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:45,230
Who killed Bang Da Mi?

902
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:50,500
Sungchan's Chairman Sim and Sim Jun Seok must answer!

903
01:02:51,339 --> 01:02:52,838
I strongly request the prosecution and police...

904
01:02:52,839 --> 01:02:53,908
(Geum La Hui, "Bang Da Mi of the Bobble Case Is My Daughter")

905
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:55,868
to reinvestigate...

906
01:02:55,869 --> 01:02:58,440
my daughter, Bang Da Mi's case.

907
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,360
Unfavourable conditions will continue from this day on.

908
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:14,459
I told you over and over not to have anyone hold a grudge against you...

909
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,289
and to keep your head down and be careful...

910
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,198
as much as possible.

911
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:20,099
What more am I supposed to be careful about?

912
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,100
I avoided everything you told me not to do.

913
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:25,600
I changed the location of my bed,

914
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:27,338
didn't even let cold food touch my lips,

915
01:03:27,339 --> 01:03:29,439
and only wore red underwear.

916
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,810
What use is all of that?

917
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,610
You did not cherish your relationships with people.

In a time like this when you have bad luck flowing in,

919
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:42,350
people who were wronged are crying in sorrow.

920
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:46,759
There is no way for you to avoid the unfortunate events.

921
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,199
Those people who were wronged...

922
01:03:57,299 --> 01:03:58,339
Who are they?

923
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:19,159
Oh, you got a call from the chairman, right?

924
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:22,960
He said he'd leave me in charge of his herbal medicine.

925
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:26,359
Ms. Han, you can just take your time to relax...

926
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,170
in the back room.

927
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,269
Ever since the chairman's late wife passed away,

928
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:36,270
I have not left the chairman's side for a single day.

929
01:04:36,569 --> 01:04:38,909
I can't allow the person who messed with his medicine...

930
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,279
to enter this house.

931
01:04:43,049 --> 01:04:44,819
And what will you do if you can't allow it?

932
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,750
I'm already here.

933
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:51,318
From now on, I'll be in charge of the items in the living room...

934
01:04:51,319 --> 01:04:53,119
and his outfits too.

935
01:04:53,219 --> 01:04:55,360
Would you please get lost?

937
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,279
- to Chairman Sim's house. - to Chairman Sim's house.

Now, all I have to do is to find the key to the gallery.

Then, my mission will be cleared.

942
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:23,819
All right.

Another plot twist has happened, and the tables have been turned.

955
01:10:39,139 --> 01:10:41,338
Ms. Geum La Hui made a tearful, heart-wrenching confession...

956
01:10:41,339 --> 01:10:43,569
that she was Bang Da Mi's biological mother...

957

and that this was why she produced this movie.

958

Not only that, she just submitted a petition for reinvestigation.

960
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:56,248
Will they join hands with the rich once again?

that you even came over to my side?

1059
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:43,919

Han Na.

1076
01:20:26,419 --> 01:20:28,929
I told you not to play around with the chairman.

1077
01:20:30,259 --> 01:20:31,429
It's okay.
