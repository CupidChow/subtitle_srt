14
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:17,352
Her blood is back flowing every time her heart contracts.

15
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,550
If she doesn't get surgery soon,

16
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:20,322
she could pass away due to dyspnoea...

17
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:21,891
and hypoplastic cardiac failure.

18
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:23,891
You should move her to a bigger hospital immediately.

19
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:28,191
I told you not to look for me.

20
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:29,961
You had her without my permission,

21
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:31,702
and now you want me to take care of you?

22
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:34,232
You plan to use the kid as an excuse to leech off of me...

23
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:36,202
and get money for the rest of your life. Right?

24
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:38,740
Who cares if she lives or dies?

25
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,512
It has nothing to do with me.

26
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:44,682

Mom?

37
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:36,391
Mom!

38
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:51,341
Mom!

39
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:55,512
Mom, where are you?

40
00:02:57,882 --> 00:02:58,952
Why did you...

41
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,922
abandon me?

42
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:04,162
I cried so much as I waited.

43
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,390
You didn't lose me on the subway.

44
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:07,831
You left me there...

45
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:09,692
on the bridge.

46
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:13,972
Because I was sick?

47
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:15,702
Because of the hospital bills?

48
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:23,542
Don't worry.

49
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,181
I didn't tell anyone.

50
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,551
What nonsense are you yapping about?

51
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:35,822
I never did that.

52
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:40,591
On the day you came to see me, as soon as I saw your dimples,

53
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:42,931
I was reminded of that day.

54
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:46,262
But I still wanted to get along with you.

55
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:49,300
I told myself you had a reason why you abandoned me.

56
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:50,341
But...

57
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:53,770
on that day I collapsed in front of Grandfather's house in the rain...

58
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:54,912
That day...

59
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:01,151
I saw you there.

60
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:09,651
Mom...

61
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:15,431
You were waiting for me to collapse, weren't you?

62
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:18,561
That way you could get money from Grandfather!

63
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,142
But...

64
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:29,142
you won't get what you want.

65
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,642
Now you're showing me how vicious you really are.

66
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:35,782
You're the one who let go of your last chance...

67
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,352
to be my mom.

68
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,631
I shouldn't have come here.

69
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:51,232
I'll tell Grandpa.

70
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:53,261
I'll see to it that...

71
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:55,472
you don't get any of his money.

72
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:09,912
Mom!

73
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:12,782
Mom, I can't breathe.

74
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:16,292
Mom...

75
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:27,301
Mom...

76
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:44,821
I never should've brought you here.

77
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:48,451
No...

78
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:52,592
I never should've had you.

79
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:04,342
You and I are really through.

80
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,032
Hey! Get over here.

81
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:32,431
You couldn't find them?

82
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:35,431
Find them even if they're dead!

83
00:06:36,371 --> 00:06:38,272
Comb this place thoroughly! Find them no matter what!

84
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:40,042
Get going, you idiots!

85
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:41,542
Hurry up and run!

86
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:44,212
Be sure to find the recorder too!

87
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:50,722
Are they still out there?

88
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:55,091
I'm so happy to spend time with my son...

89
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:56,251
after so long.

90
00:06:58,561 --> 00:06:59,561
Mom.

91
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:02,691
It's going to end soon. It'll be fine.

92
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:06,261
Okay.

93
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:10,501
As long as I have this recorder,

94
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:14,042
Ki Tak can be released too.

95
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,652
How dare she raise her hand at my precious daughter?

96
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:27,152
It must've hurt so much.

97
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:29,951
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:32,162
Why are you sorry?

99
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:34,191
I was foolish.

100
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:37,661
Because of my hospital bills, you had to sell the house,

101
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:39,131
quit your job,

102
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:41,332
and Dad couldn't become a professor.

103
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:43,602
I felt like it was all my fault.

104
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:46,971
That's why I wanted to repay our debts.

105
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:49,412
Why are you worrying about that?

106
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,611
You should've just abandoned me.

107
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:56,352
Why would you bring home a sick kid who couldn't get adopted?

108
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:58,782
All I did was spend your money.

109
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:01,092
I'm going to get really angry.

110
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:10,861
You saved me.

111
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:15,301
It was my own greed.

112
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:16,701
I raised you...

113
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:18,542
so that I could live.

114
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,240
I had five miscarriages,

115
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,142
and I didn't want to live any longer.

116
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:28,511
Then your dad took me to Jeju Island to make me feel better.

117
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:31,951
Honey.

118
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:33,792
Do you hear that?

119
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:36,721
- Where are you, Mom? - I think it's that girl.

120
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:42,792
That's where we met you.

121
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:45,431
Child, why are you crying?

122
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,032
Where's your mom?

123
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:49,372
She must've lost her mom.

124
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,142
What should we do?

125
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,211
Don't cry.

126
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:58,042
Honey, let's go find her mom.

127
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,242
Okay. Let's go.

128
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:02,680
- Do you know this girl? - I still remember...

129
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:06,252
the sound of your little heart beating that day.

130
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,320
- Did you lose your child? - That day,

131
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:11,792
you already had a place in my heart.

132
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:21,730
Watching you endure those difficult heart surgeries...

133
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:23,532
and survive...

134
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:27,112
made us so happy.

135
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,711
I refuse to send you to that woman again.

136
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:36,481
I'm not going anywhere ever again.

137
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:38,721
This is my home.

138
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:43,622
The person who framed you...

139
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:46,561
Did she have a child at school?

140
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:49,991
Yes.

141
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:51,331
I was with her.

142
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:55,032
I helped her because we were friends.

143
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:57,542
She did this to her friend who helped her out?

144
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:00,772
I'm going to make her tell the truth herself.

145
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:03,512
I can fix things tomorrow.

146
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,011
(Love)

147
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:06,242
Did she really come to school?

148
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:07,752
- Isn't that Bang Da Mi? - Hey!

149
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:09,651
- Oh, my. - That's Bang Da Mi.

150
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,080
- No way. - My gosh.

151
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:12,680
She's really brazen.

152
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:14,991
Is she announcing to the world her relationship with him?

153
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:16,350
My gosh. What a lunatic.

154
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,292
That's kind of romantic.

155
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:22,031
That's true love.

156
00:10:22,032 --> 00:10:23,731
Here's another lunatic.

157
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:25,061
You should say something.

158
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:26,862
Bang Da Mi looks like...

159
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:28,272
she's upset.

160
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:32,571
- No way! - Look at that.

161
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:34,341
Dad, what are they doing?

162
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:36,211
- It's okay. Let's go. - Look at that. It's crazy.

163
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,142
(Expel Bang Da Mi for ruining the school's reputation!)

164
00:10:42,081 --> 00:10:43,480
(Bang Da Mi should drop out for embarrassing the school!)

165
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:44,781
You can't go in!

166
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:47,051
I'm afraid our innocent children will learn from you.

167
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,851
Look at this brazen brat.

168
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:51,122
Our school is embarrassed because of you!

169
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:53,590
I'm going to kill you if this impacts college acceptances!

170
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:54,830
Watch your mouth!

171
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:56,090
How dare you show your face here?

172
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:57,231
You cradle-robber!

173
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:00,532
- Dad! Are you okay? - Yes.

174
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:02,100
- Take a photo of him! - Take his photo!

175
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:03,131
- Take his photo! - Do it!

176
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:04,902
Put it away!

177
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,542
Do you all want to get sued?

178
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:08,441
Move!

179
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:09,570
Move!

180
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,512
Move! Get out of the way!

181
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:13,241
- Let go! - Where are you going?

182
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:15,311
Let go of me!

183
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:17,012
Get out of here!

184
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:24,690
Let's go inside. Hurry!

185
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:26,621
- Hey, you jerk! - Come on!

186
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:29,831
- Get lost! - What are you doing?

187
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:31,931
Enough!

188
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:34,631
Can you all stop?

189
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:35,872
(Bang Da Mi should drop out for embarrassing the school!)

190
00:11:36,132 --> 00:11:37,470
You all have children too.

191
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:38,901
Is this all you can do?

192
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:40,501
Is this really all you can do?

193
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:42,042
Did you hit me?

194
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:43,941
You're dead! Get over here!

195
00:11:48,782 --> 00:11:50,051
Help!

196
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:54,652
The result of Bang Da Mi's disciplinary action...

197
00:11:55,492 --> 00:11:57,091
is expulsion.

198
00:11:57,762 --> 00:12:00,662
However, for the sake of this student's future,

199
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:03,331
we've decided to make arrangements...

200
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:05,200
to give her a chance to drop out.

201
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,730
I don't have her parents' contact information,

202
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:08,201
so I was going to go to her home.

203
00:12:08,372 --> 00:12:10,800
I'll go and get their signature on her withdrawal paperwork.

204
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:12,402
That's a good idea.

205
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:13,771
You should leave now.

206
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:16,012
- The dean should go too. - Yes, sir.

207
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:18,612
Good work.

208
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:24,151
How can her parents not show up...

209
00:12:24,152 --> 00:12:25,980
despite all this chaos?

210
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:27,651
That's why that child is so audacious...

211
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:29,992
Please hold another meeting of the disciplinary committee, sir.

212
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:33,421
- To clear me of the false charges. - "False charges?"

213
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:35,531
Hey. I told you to stay home and reflect on this.

214
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:36,991
How dare you show your face here?

215
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:39,830
How could you hold your head up high after having a kid?

216
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:41,331
Did you see it?

217
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:44,801
Did any of the teachers here see me have a child?

218
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:46,771
If you have, step forward!

219
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:47,772
Someone saw you!

220
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,581
Your homeroom teacher. Ms. Ko Myung Ji saw you!

221
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:54,512
Ms. Ko?

222
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:57,622
Is the person we're meeting her birth mom or her adoptive mom?

223
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,151
I'm not sure. The only relative on file is her grandfather.

224
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:02,550
I know it's a lot of trouble,

225
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,021
but if you resolve this well,

226
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:05,291
it'll be good for you.

227
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:06,362
Who knows?

228
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:08,330
You might be hired as a full-time teacher.

229
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:09,561
I'll do my best.

230
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:13,061
All while ensuring it doesn't negatively impact the school.

231
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:15,931
Goodness.

232
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,081
Hello, sir.

233
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:31,981
Bang Da Mi is here.

234
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,720
She wants us to hold another meeting saying she's being falsely charged.

235
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:36,951
Did you really see her have a child?

236
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:41,532
What happened?

237
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:44,231
Did you give birth to this baby?

238
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:47,571
Da Mi, what am I going to do?

239
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:49,431
What should I do?

240
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,201
Ms. Ko? Why aren't you answering?

241
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:55,612
Are you sure you saw her in the art room?

242
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:59,412
Yes. I saw her myself.

243
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:01,980
I'll give you a call back...

244
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,612
after I meet Da Mi's parents.

245
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,221
(Vice Principal, Mun Jun Hui)

246
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:18,132
Excuse me.

247
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:23,331
Are you Bang Da Mi's mother?

248
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,142
Who are you?

249
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:29,412
Hello. I'm Da Mi's homeroom teacher, Ko Myung Ji.

250
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:31,512
I have some urgent news I need to relay to you.

251
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:33,612
The disciplinary committee...

252
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:36,412
decided to have Da Mi withdraw from our school.

253
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:40,422
I think you came to the wrong place.

254
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:44,022
Isn't this Bang Da Mi's house?

255
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:46,761
This is her address.

256
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:47,930
You must be mistaken.

257
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:50,061
I don't know anyone by that name. Goodbye.

258
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:04,341
She's nothing to me anyway.

259
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:07,341
I did the right thing by registering her as that old man's family.

260
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,282
(The Girl Who Gave Birth in an Art Room)

261
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:18,522
I got rid of Bang Da Mi, but Geum La Hui will never give up.

262
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:21,191
I need to finalize this.

263
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:22,961
(We welcome all tips! "Scarlet Letter")

264
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:28,571
I know who Bobble's birth mom is.

265
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:33,772
She is LH Media's CEO, Geum La Hui.

266
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:35,241
Geum La Hui...

267
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:39,341
is a shameless woman who abandoned her child in the past.

268
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:44,522
She is hiding who she really is.

269
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:46,051
(Tip Received)

270
00:15:46,052 --> 00:15:47,221
Dr. Cha!

271
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:51,422
Gosh, how nice. Hey, Dr. Cha!

272
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:54,292
Hey, Dr. Cha!

273
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:55,661
You should go.

274
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:58,761
- What are you doing? Hey! - My gosh!

275
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:00,162
- Move over. - How nice.

276
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:02,971
- Oh, my. - Welcome, Mr. Ma.

277
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:04,672
Come inside.

278
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:16,412
Gosh, Dr. Cha.

279
00:16:16,882 --> 00:16:18,220
You're a doctor.

280
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:20,481
Why are you always breaking your promises?

281
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:24,152
Didn't I warn you not to show up at my hospital?

282
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:26,690
I need to see patients to pay you back.

283
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:27,960
How will this get you your money?

284
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:29,862
If this is embarrassing, hurry up and pay me back.

285
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:31,901
You have your husband.

286
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:33,161
How is that jerk my husband?

287
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:34,901
We got divorced ages ago!

288
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:36,631
I've never even seen that money.

289
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:38,902
Oh, man. You're really hopeless. You know that?

290
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:42,242
That's why you should have taken better care of your people.

291
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:45,310
What were you doing that you didn't notice your husband...

292
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,850
having an affair with a young nurse and stealing all your money?

293
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:49,550
I'll pay you back. I will.

294
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,851
Who said I wouldn't?

295
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:52,022
Go...

296
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:54,892
and tell your old boyfriend...

297
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:59,522
that your husband has a debt of a million dollars.

298
00:17:02,032 --> 00:17:04,091
Don't you dare tell him a word of that.

299
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:06,331
Then I won't pay you back...

300
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,302
and kill myself.

301
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:12,602
Did Bobble go home?

302
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:14,510
I don't know. She was here a minute ago.

303
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,771
I'm so stressed out because of Bobble.

304
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:18,680
I can't focus on my studies.

305
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:21,011
What's this? You're studying?

306
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:25,951
I'm Bang Da Mi from Class 2-7.

307
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,921
I couldn't just sit by while I was being falsely charged.

308
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,421
So after much thought, I'm standing in front of you today.

309
00:17:30,422 --> 00:17:32,221
What... That little...

310
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:34,861
- From this point forward, - Bang Da Mi, that...

311
00:17:34,862 --> 00:17:36,260
- I will only tell the truth. - Why that...

312
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:37,290
What is this?

313
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,662
- I won't make anything up. - We need to stop her!

314
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,072
That night,

315
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:43,770
someone did have a baby in the art room.

316
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,940
What an attention seeker.

317
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:46,941
When I walked into the art room,

318
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:49,511
there was someone else in there.

319
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:50,612
What?

320
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,511
It was Han Mone!

321
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,851
- What? - Han Mone?

322
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:56,312
- No way. - What is she saying?

323
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,821
Darn it!

324
00:18:03,822 --> 00:18:05,221
(Broadcasting Room)

325
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,221
Han Mone was the one who had a baby!

326
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:10,091
I've kept my mouth shut for this long...

327
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:11,332
to protect Mone's secret.

328
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:13,601
But I can no longer keep silent...

329
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:15,402
while my dad is being accused.

330
00:18:16,902 --> 00:18:17,941
Everyone.

331
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:21,270
- Stop the broadcast and come out! - Everyone.

332
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:22,641
From now on, just believe in me.

333
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:23,711
Hurry!

334
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,882
Hurry up and open the door!

335
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:29,311
Everyone. Please believe in me.

336
00:18:29,312 --> 00:18:31,250
I'll tell you all the truth!

337
00:18:31,251 --> 00:18:32,422
- Get out! - It's Han Mone!

338
00:18:43,632 --> 00:18:45,161
Mone had the baby!

339
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:47,500
It wasn't me!

340
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,201
- Let go of me! Please, let go! - Take her out!

341
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:53,371
Please, let me go!

342
00:18:53,372 --> 00:18:56,071
My gosh. What a creative lunatic.

343
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:58,312
Are you saying she auditioned the day after giving birth?

344
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:59,841
Mone had the baby,

345
00:18:59,842 --> 00:19:01,651
and she asked me...

346
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:03,750
to take the child out of the school!

347
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,521
Are you going to keep lying like that?

348
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:08,151
How could you frame your friend for what you did?

349
00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:10,450
If you keep acting like this, it won't end within the school.

350
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:11,990
Do you want to get investigated by the police?

351
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:14,122
- Let go of me. - Hold on.

352
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:15,731
What did you do with the baby?

353
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:17,332
Did you...

354
00:19:17,562 --> 00:19:20,230
Did you do something terrible to get rid of the evidence?

355
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:21,931
Don't do that to Da Mi!

356
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,511
Please. Stop with the witch hunt.

357
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:36,082
Da Mi...

358
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:40,122
That's enough.

359
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:44,922
I know more than anyone how desperate you are.

360
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:48,031
Your kindness and desire to protect your dad.

361
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:49,731
Right.

362
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:53,261
So please admit to it yourself.

363
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:55,531
This is really hard on me.

364
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:00,501
Okay.

365
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:03,672
I wanted to keep this a secret, but...

366
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:11,481
To be honest,

367
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:14,622
I knew that Da Mi was in love with her adoptive father.

368
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,162
What are you saying? You know that's not true!

369
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:20,490
How dare you try to use violence?

370
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:22,392
- Hold onto her. Stay quiet. - Let go!

371
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:23,761
Keep going.

372
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:28,332
The only sin Da Mi committed was loving her dad as a man.

373
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,871
It's a lie.

374
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:31,371
What are you talking about? Why are you doing this?

375
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:32,871
What did I do wrong?

376
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:35,372
I told her to stop, that it wasn't right.

377
00:20:35,471 --> 00:20:37,171
Didn't she feel bad for her adoptive mother?

378
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:38,941
Han Mone! Let go!

379
00:20:41,711 --> 00:20:44,281
Please come to your senses, Da Mi.

380
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:46,281
We must fix what's wrong.

381
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:49,220
- Your adoptive dad was wrong. - Shut up.

382
00:20:49,221 --> 00:20:51,961
- Hey. - I won't let you insult my dad.

383
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:53,791
This was your plan from the start. Right?

384
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:56,261
To frame me for everything!

385
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,102
Do you have evidence?

386
00:20:58,231 --> 00:20:59,661
Evidence that it was Mone!

387
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:01,872
Why do I have to look for evidence?

388
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,642
I'm the victim!

389
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:06,902
I'm the victim here.

She does?

393
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:19,052
Really?

394
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:23,922
You told me the secret in your locker.

395
00:21:25,521 --> 00:21:26,662
What's in her locker?

396
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:29,691
I can't say it.

397
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,461
Break open her locker right now.

398
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:35,000
It's a lie. None of it is true!

399
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:38,072
- Be quiet. - Please let me go.

458

Yes. School was just getting out.

459

He was standing right here, waiting for her.

460
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:02,672
As soon as he saw Bobble,

461
00:25:02,812 --> 00:25:05,010
he ran to her and hugged her so tightly.

462
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:07,082

463

Yes. What do you need?

549
00:29:32,241 --> 00:29:34,582

550
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:35,980
You'll have to come to the station with us.

551
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:37,552
What are you talking about? Why would I?

552
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,122
Come back with a warrant.

553
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:41,051
- Honey. What's going on? - Why would I? Let go.

554
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:42,391
Let go. Show me a warrant!

555
00:29:42,392 --> 00:29:43,821
Come back with a warrant.

556
00:29:43,822 --> 00:29:45,260
- Let go of me. Let go. - Honey.

557
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,862
- Let go, you punks. - Honey!

558
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:51,592
Are you okay?

559
00:29:51,802 --> 00:29:52,961

560
00:29:54,162 --> 00:29:55,302
What do you want this time?

561
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:57,201
What ridiculous claim will you make this time?

562
00:29:57,471 --> 00:29:59,841
Do you know what I went through because of you?

563
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,500
I know! That's why I'm here.

564
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:02,642
To make up for it.

565
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:06,040
Okay. Fine.

566
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,881
I honestly can't say anything for myself there.

567
00:30:07,882 --> 00:30:09,552
You're right. I was wrong.

568
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:12,882
I can't say anything even if you hit me and curse me.

569
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:15,021
But I want you to hear me out first.

570

571

He's the CEO of Cherry Entertainment.

575
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,700
He was at a hotel...

576
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:35,000
with a girl wearing your badge and a bobble hat.

577
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,812

580

There's no need to get so worked up.

581
00:30:46,852 --> 00:30:49,122
If you attack without a plan, you'll be the one who gets hurt.

and she has a lively charm.

638
00:34:38,682 --> 00:34:40,781
On top of that, I thought highly...

639
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:43,321
that she won a lead role without the help...

640
00:34:43,322 --> 00:34:44,492
of an agency.

641
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:46,321

a special appearance in "Power of Love."

643

(Power of Love)

645
00:34:52,362 --> 00:34:53,432
Maternal love.

646
00:34:53,702 --> 00:34:55,631
It's about mothers...

647
00:34:55,632 --> 00:34:58,201
travelling the world for ten years,

648
00:34:58,202 --> 00:35:00,202
looking for their kidnapped children.

649
00:35:00,572 --> 00:35:02,770
It was so sad but beautiful.

650
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:05,041
Ms. Geum, you're still single, right?

651
00:35:05,342 --> 00:35:07,980
- Yes. - You're not a mother yourself,

652
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,511
so is there a reason you chose to talk about maternal love?

653
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:12,151
I don't have kids of my own,

654
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,651

655
00:35:14,652 --> 00:35:16,020

657
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:20,322

659

662
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:35,641
do you have any criticisms about the current situation?

664
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:38,882
It's a truly shocking issue.

665
00:35:40,311 --> 00:35:43,111
People find each other too easily through phone apps...

666
00:35:43,112 --> 00:35:45,311
and become parents before they're ready.

667
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:48,520
I'm so concerned that families and society as a whole...

668
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,291
is crumbling at a disastrous rate.

669
00:35:51,021 --> 00:35:52,591
I hope that our drama...

670
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:55,021
will give everyone something...

671
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:56,391

I think a million dollars should do.

700

You spend 100 million on a drama,

701
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,060

00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:17,151
Let's do that again at another angle.

730
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,191
Okay.

731
00:40:26,862 --> 00:40:29,132
I know you made a deal with Yang Jin Mo.

732
00:40:29,271 --> 00:40:30,672
Do you want to know what I'll do?

733
00:40:31,302 --> 00:40:33,370
Then come to Seoul Culture Forest.

734
00:40:33,371 --> 00:40:34,871
It's your last chance to reveal the truth.

735
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:40,382
Liar, hypocrite.

736
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:42,241
I'll tell the whole world.

737
00:40:42,242 --> 00:40:44,211
How you abandoned and abused me.

738
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,322
Tonight at 7pm at the Seoul Culture Forest.

739
00:40:46,851 --> 00:40:48,580
It's your last chance to reveal the truth.

740
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:51,052
(Da Mi)

741
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:56,330
- Ring - Ring

742
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:57,960
- Bobble's bell... - Bobble's bell...

743
00:40:57,961 --> 00:41:02,231
Bobble has finally contacted Scarlet Letter!

744
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:07,440
Do you see this comment?

745
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:09,040
This one here.

746
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,140
(Bang Da Mi)

747
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:12,940
Bobble threw down the gauntlet!

748
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:15,681
She's really something.

749
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,080
It takes a lot for a minor to date a grown man...

750
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:19,951
and betray her adoptive mother.

751
00:41:19,952 --> 00:41:22,751
Okay! It's time to teach her a lesson!

752
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:25,790
Let's dole out some justice!

753
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:27,120
- Yes! - Yes!

754
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:28,421
- Yes! - Do it!

755
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:32,092
Tonight at 7pm, Scarlet Letter will be...

756
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:33,601
right here!

757
00:41:34,961 --> 00:41:37,702
See you at Seoul Culture Forest.

758
00:41:37,802 --> 00:41:41,641
- Justice! - Justice!

759
00:41:41,742 --> 00:41:43,411
Coming soon!

760
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:51,952
Do Hyuk!

761
00:41:54,882 --> 00:41:57,052
Do Hyuk!

762
00:41:57,952 --> 00:41:58,952
Mom!

763
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:01,521
Jae Hyuk!

764
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:04,191
Do Hyuk! No!

765
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:06,731
Jae Hyuk!

766
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:08,061
Darn you.

767
00:42:29,492 --> 00:42:30,952
Why are you doing this?

768
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:33,891
Didn't you find it odd?

769
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:36,491
Would Kang Ki Tak...

770
00:42:36,492 --> 00:42:38,632
let a guy who betrayed him...

771
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:40,632
and switched sides live?

772
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:48,842
Mom. No!

773
00:42:50,072 --> 00:42:52,371
I'm sorry. Please.

774
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:54,981
I'll do anything you say.

775
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:58,480
Leave my mom and brother alone.

776
00:42:58,481 --> 00:43:01,322
Why do you think Kang Ki Tak let you escape?

777
00:43:02,992 --> 00:43:04,391
Isn't that odd?

778
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:11,431
It was so you could see...

779
00:43:11,432 --> 00:43:13,762
your mom and brother die.

780
00:43:14,132 --> 00:43:15,132
Watch.

781
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:18,331
This is him getting back at you.

782
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:24,242
Mom... No...

783
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:27,612
No!

784
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:15,560
What's going on?

785
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:16,730
- Hey. - Paeng Hee.

786
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:18,861
- What's wrong? - Help us.

787
00:44:18,862 --> 00:44:19,961
Get up.

788
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:22,330
Hey, you made it.

789
00:44:22,331 --> 00:44:23,731
What are you doing?

790
00:44:24,032 --> 00:44:27,241
You've done more than enough damage.

791
00:44:27,242 --> 00:44:30,472
You duped me good, you witch.

792
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:34,440
My gosh.

793
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:36,211
If you so much as touch them,

794
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:37,911
I'll kill you all.

795
00:44:38,211 --> 00:44:39,922
I won't kill them.

796
00:44:40,822 --> 00:44:43,251
They're your sisters.

797
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:45,322
Hey.

798
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:49,661
Paeng Hee.

799
00:44:49,992 --> 00:44:50,992
Help me.

800
00:44:50,993 --> 00:44:52,131
- Paeng Hee. - Kill me!

801
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:53,302
Kill me instead!

802
00:44:53,702 --> 00:44:55,632
- Bash it. - Paeng Hee!

803
00:44:56,271 --> 00:44:57,432
Stop.

804
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:01,472
I'll do anything you want.

805
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,742
Don't hurt them.

806
00:45:23,061 --> 00:45:25,661
(Scarlet Letter)

807
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:39,981
I was waiting for you to call.

808
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:42,811
I'll give you a million dollars.

809
00:45:43,981 --> 00:45:46,152
In return, stop the girl.

810
00:45:47,182 --> 00:45:49,652
If you want, I could give you 500,000 dollars more.

811
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:52,992
Do whatever you can to stop her!

812
00:45:56,061 --> 00:45:57,331
Kill if you must.

813
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:12,342
Do Hyuk.

814
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:15,441
- My goodness. - Are you okay?

815
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,512
Oh, gosh. Do Hyuk.

816
00:46:18,211 --> 00:46:20,182
You're awake. Are you okay?

817
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:22,481
- Mom. - Yes.

818
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:24,422
Mom, are you all right?

819
00:46:25,092 --> 00:46:27,291
I'm here because I'm still alive.

820
00:46:27,492 --> 00:46:29,561
- My dear boy. - I'm fine too.

821
00:46:30,561 --> 00:46:32,191
Jae Hyuk.

822
00:46:32,532 --> 00:46:34,231
- We're okay. - Jae Hyuk.

823
00:46:34,632 --> 00:46:37,701
What a tearjerker.

824
00:46:37,702 --> 00:46:39,472
It's too emotional for me.

825
00:46:44,072 --> 00:46:45,271
Where's Madam No?

826
00:46:45,641 --> 00:46:47,141
- Did you hide her? - Don't.

827
00:46:47,612 --> 00:46:48,910
He saved us.

828
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:51,581
Will you get a grip?

829
00:46:51,682 --> 00:46:53,120
If it hadn't been for me,

830
00:46:53,121 --> 00:46:55,481
you and your family would've been wiped out, you punk.

831
00:46:57,422 --> 00:46:58,991
Knowing what you did,

832
00:46:58,992 --> 00:47:00,721
I'd have loved to have munched on popcorn...

833
00:47:00,722 --> 00:47:02,222
as I watched you and your family drown.

834
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:04,932
But I pitied you enough to save you.

835
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:07,031
Because you're a fool...

836
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,032
who got betrayed by someone you trusted.

837
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:11,472
Kang Ki Tak.

838
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:19,012
Do Hyuk.

839
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:20,842
Work for me.

840
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:24,652
I'll hire you an army of lawyers and get you out on probation.

841
00:47:25,152 --> 00:47:26,251
What do you want?

842
00:47:34,422 --> 00:47:35,561
Do Hyuk...

843
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:43,132
Kang Ki Tak.

844
00:47:43,702 --> 00:47:45,271
Crush him.

845
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:47,072
Make sure he's done for good...

846
00:47:47,371 --> 00:47:48,871
so he can never come back.

847
00:48:00,021 --> 00:48:01,081
What is it?

848
00:48:01,382 --> 00:48:03,552
Da Mi knows you were involved.

849
00:48:03,652 --> 00:48:04,822
Stop her.

850
00:48:09,121 --> 00:48:10,862
I'll serve you loyally forever.

851
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,331
Get me out of it.

852
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:17,371
Bang Da Mi's trying to get herself killed.

853
00:48:34,152 --> 00:48:35,222
Darn it.

854
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:56,672
Mister.

855
00:48:56,742 --> 00:48:59,011
How much longer must I be here for? I have no time for this.

856
00:48:59,012 --> 00:49:01,140
Sorry. I lost track of time.

857
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:02,481
Let him out.

858
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:04,612
Thanks.

859
00:49:07,422 --> 00:49:09,051
Thank you.

860
00:49:09,052 --> 00:49:10,452
Just a moment.

861
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:12,891
You've been through a lot. It was stressful, wasn't it?

862
00:49:13,222 --> 00:49:16,061
My goodness...

863
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:18,361
Here, drink this.

864
00:49:18,362 --> 00:49:19,561
No, thanks.

865
00:49:20,132 --> 00:49:21,461
- It's fine. - Come on.

866
00:49:21,762 --> 00:49:23,172
I have to dash.

867
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:24,402
Sorry.

868
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:28,342
- It's nice and cold. - Okay, then.

869
00:49:32,672 --> 00:49:34,441
Hey, Da Mi.

870
00:49:34,782 --> 00:49:35,911
Where are you?

871
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:37,052
Okay.

872
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,481
I'll come over.

873
00:49:38,581 --> 00:49:40,222
Mom will be there soon too.

874
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:41,521
Okay.

875
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:44,552
(Deokseon Police Station)

876
00:49:56,432 --> 00:49:57,932
- Da Mi. - Are you okay?

877
00:49:58,231 --> 00:50:00,041
Da Mi...

878
00:50:00,271 --> 00:50:01,870
You called for a taxi, right?

879
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:03,270
- Are you okay? - Gosh.

880
00:50:03,271 --> 00:50:04,641
- Let's go. - Oh, dear.

881

882
00:50:37,672 --> 00:50:39,741
Come over here!

Everyone!

884
00:50:53,021 --> 00:50:54,592
This is fun.

885
00:50:57,161 --> 00:51:00,501
It's almost time!

886
00:51:04,132 --> 00:51:05,230
Okay!

887
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:07,641
It's currently 6:58pm!

888
00:51:07,742 --> 00:51:11,871
Bobble has yet to show herself!

889
00:51:13,182 --> 00:51:15,081
Did she run away?

890
00:51:15,682 --> 00:51:17,751
I hope not!

891
00:51:19,152 --> 00:51:24,451
- Show yourself! - Show yourself!

892
00:51:24,452 --> 00:51:27,261
- Show yourself! - Show yourself!

893
00:51:27,262 --> 00:51:30,131
It's 7pm sharp!

894
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:34,202
Here we go live!

895
00:51:37,331 --> 00:51:38,501
It's her!

896
00:51:42,742 --> 00:51:44,242
I'm a victim.

897
00:51:45,371 --> 00:51:47,282
- Are you getting this? - What?

898
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:49,751
My dad Lee Hwi So...

899
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:51,481
ruined my life.

900
00:51:52,382 --> 00:51:53,521
What?

901
00:51:54,052 --> 00:51:55,350
Help me!

902
00:51:55,351 --> 00:51:56,491
Is that true?

903
00:51:56,492 --> 00:51:58,652
I'm being threatened.

904
00:51:59,152 --> 00:52:01,561
- Oh, my gosh. - What's going on?

905
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,790
(I will reveal the truth. Bang Da Mi)

906

Dad.

907
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:09,061
Don't do this.

908
00:52:12,932 --> 00:52:15,601
Dad. What are you doing?

909
00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:17,911

(I will reveal the truth. Bang Da Mi)

911
00:52:53,342 --> 00:52:55,311
The sound came from the auditorium!

912
00:52:56,141 --> 00:52:57,552
It's near the entrance!

913
00:53:13,461 --> 00:53:14,932
(Enjoy Seoul's Culture Forest)

914
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:23,771
Bobble is dead.

915

He's the killer!

916
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:38,291
Something truly shocking happened!

917
00:53:38,422 --> 00:53:41,322
Bobble was murdered!

918
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:44,932
She screamed for someone to save her...

919
00:53:45,362 --> 00:53:48,032
before she was shot!

920
00:54:08,152 --> 00:54:09,251
Honey.

921
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:17,632
Honey.

922
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:20,331
What happened?

923
00:54:20,532 --> 00:54:22,132
Wake up!

924
00:54:22,561 --> 00:54:24,432
Honey. Where's Da Mi?

925
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:25,870
Where's our Da Mi?

926
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:27,842
Where is she?

927
00:54:28,472 --> 00:54:30,672
Wake up, honey!

928
00:54:30,842 --> 00:54:32,972
Where is she?

929

Kang Ki Tak gave the order.

00:54:58,501 --> 00:55:00,801
The raid of Cherry Entertainment's party...

938
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:02,500
and the attempted murder of Yang Jin Mo.

939
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:04,311
It was all his idea.

940
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:09,541
Don't you dare change your statement again.

941
00:55:10,152 --> 00:55:11,210
Why did you escape?

942
00:55:11,211 --> 00:55:12,911
Kang Ki Tak threatened me.

943
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:16,221
He said he'd kill my mom and brother.

944
00:55:16,222 --> 00:55:17,791
That's why I ran away.

945
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:21,322
Detective, that punk...

946
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:25,190
He's a trashy thug worse less than a cent.

947
00:55:25,191 --> 00:55:26,330
This just came in.

Are you okay?

959
00:55:49,581 --> 00:55:54,121

confirmed that a 38 special revolver...

was missing from the armoury.

had a gun on him at the scene of the crime.

And we've confirmed that the gun...

988
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,041
was the same gun that had been stolen from the station.

Isn't this a happy ending for both of us?

01:00:57,532 --> 01:01:00,660
The fact that you're Da Mi's birth mother is buried for good,

1030
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:02,902

"Female Doctor JR," I think.

1044
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:20,882
You killed her?

1045

What did you do with her after you killed her?

1046
01:02:25,581 --> 01:02:27,182
Speak clearly!

Hey, you jerk.

1048
01:02:28,822 --> 01:02:31,620
Tell me where you hid her.

1049
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:32,651
Tell me.

1050
01:02:32,652 --> 01:02:33,891
We got the results from the National Forensic Service.

1051
01:02:34,762 --> 01:02:35,762
Okay.

1052
01:02:35,763 --> 01:02:36,790
The blood on the suspect's clothes...

1053
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:38,362
has been confirmed as the victim's.

1054
01:02:38,592 --> 01:02:39,762
We got it, then.

1055
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:42,731
We have our murderer.

1056
01:02:42,902 --> 01:02:45,371
But we don't have a body for the murder.

1057
01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:48,600
A few things are stopping me from proving he committed the crime.

1058
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:49,601
What are they?

1059
01:02:49,802 --> 01:02:52,512
The victim started her live stream at 7pm sharp.

1060
01:02:53,112 --> 01:02:54,641
I'm a victim.

1061
01:02:55,242 --> 01:02:58,551
The people arrived at the auditorium at 7:07pm.

1062
01:02:58,552 --> 01:03:00,211
- What? - What's going on?

1063
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,481
In just seven minutes,

1064
01:03:03,052 --> 01:03:04,592
where would he have dumped her body?

1065
01:03:04,891 --> 01:03:05,952
How should I know?

1066
01:03:06,722 --> 01:03:09,091
Apparently, the drug causes superhuman strength.

1067
01:03:09,092 --> 01:03:11,061
He must have run while carrying her.

1068
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:14,901
On top of that, there wasn't much blood from the victim at the scene.

1069
01:03:14,902 --> 01:03:16,132
That's strange to you?

1070
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:18,770
He teaches at a college.

1071
01:03:18,771 --> 01:03:21,471
You think he would have fired without aiming like an idiot?

1072
01:03:21,472 --> 01:03:24,012
He probably laid plastic wraps on the ground when he shot her.

1073
01:03:24,211 --> 01:03:26,871
He planned this out and used his brain.

1074
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:30,351
Detective Min, can't you think of this yourself?

1075
01:03:32,782 --> 01:03:33,822
Hey.

1076
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:38,491
We won't be able to investigate him until the drug wears out.

1077
01:03:38,492 --> 01:03:39,552
Let's move him to the hospital.

1078
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:48,492
My Da Mi.

1079
01:04:49,391 --> 01:04:50,862
Why did you kill her?

1080
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:53,691
Kill her? Who?

1081
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:56,731
Why you...

1082
01:04:58,331 --> 01:05:01,972
Why did you kill that young girl?

1083
01:05:03,072 --> 01:05:06,612
Were you worried she would expose what you did?

1084
01:05:06,711 --> 01:05:07,941
What are you talking about?

1085
01:05:08,512 --> 01:05:10,512
Why would Da Mi be dead?

1086
01:05:12,581 --> 01:05:14,751
If you want to at least stay alive,

1087
01:05:15,552 --> 01:05:16,782
spill everything.

1088
01:05:17,592 --> 01:05:18,621
My Da Mi.

1089
01:05:19,722 --> 01:05:21,421
Where did you dump her?

1090
01:05:21,422 --> 01:05:23,761
I didn't kill Da Mi.

1091
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:25,830
Bring me my daughter. Where's my daughter?

1092
01:05:25,831 --> 01:05:26,891
Find my daughter.

1093
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:37,541
Before Da Mi died,

1094
01:05:38,472 --> 01:05:40,371
she told us everything.

1095
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:43,011
That she was being threatened by you.

1096
01:05:43,012 --> 01:05:44,081
What?

1097
01:05:44,481 --> 01:05:45,552
She asked for help.

1098
01:05:46,682 --> 01:05:49,251
She asked to be saved, you punk!

1099
01:05:57,021 --> 01:05:59,061
Da Mi...

1100
01:06:00,032 --> 01:06:02,862
Don't go. Da Mi, no.

1101
01:06:03,061 --> 01:06:06,171
Don't go, Da Mi. No.

1102
01:06:06,172 --> 01:06:07,302
Da Mi...

1103
01:06:08,342 --> 01:06:10,371
Don't go.

1104
01:06:11,371 --> 01:06:13,981
Da Mi, don't go.

1105
01:06:16,441 --> 01:06:18,481
No. Da Mi, don't go.

1106
01:06:20,282 --> 01:06:21,350
Da Mi...

1107
01:06:21,351 --> 01:06:23,922
Yes. Prosecutor Jo.

1108
01:06:24,822 --> 01:06:26,492
I'm almost done.

1109
01:06:28,422 --> 01:06:29,461
No.

1110
01:06:30,932 --> 01:06:31,932
Da Mi...

1111
01:06:33,262 --> 01:06:34,331
Don't go.

1112
01:06:35,362 --> 01:06:37,230
Why would I kill Da Mi?

1113
01:06:37,231 --> 01:06:39,831
She's more precious to me than my own life. Why would I?

1114
01:06:40,172 --> 01:06:42,242
Why would I?

1115
01:06:44,811 --> 01:06:45,911
Why would I?

1116
01:06:46,411 --> 01:06:47,541
Why would I kill her?

1117
01:07:18,842 --> 01:07:19,971
Gosh.

1118
01:07:19,972 --> 01:07:21,612
What are you doing here?

1119
01:07:22,441 --> 01:07:24,080
Do you even have the mental capacity to go around like this?

1120
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:25,882
You don't even know whether your daughter is dead or alive.

1121
01:07:26,782 --> 01:07:28,480
You lied about her pregnancy and giving birth.

1122
01:07:28,481 --> 01:07:30,051
You're the one who drove her out.

1123
01:07:30,052 --> 01:07:32,621
Does the idea of splitting his inheritance drive you that insane?

1124
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:34,520
The old man has a large fortune.

1125
01:07:34,521 --> 01:07:35,690
Even if you use 100,000 dollars every day,

1126
01:07:35,691 --> 01:07:37,190
you still can't use up all that money.

1127
01:07:37,191 --> 01:07:38,661
What about you?

1128
01:07:38,891 --> 01:07:40,361
As soon as the old man abandoned his granddaughter,

1129
01:07:40,362 --> 01:07:42,362
you saw it as your chance to kick her out.

1130
01:07:42,661 --> 01:07:44,370
You got a lot of funding for the project.

1131
01:07:44,371 --> 01:07:46,601
You probably didn't need a daughter who was making so much noise.

1132
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:49,242
Or were you scared she might hurt your career?

1133
01:07:49,702 --> 01:07:51,711
Even if you have to strangle her adoptive father's throat,

1134
01:07:51,811 --> 01:07:54,282
don't you want to avenge your daughter as a mom?

1135
01:07:58,851 --> 01:08:00,211
As a mom?

1136
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:02,821
You've never been a mom yourself.

1137
01:08:02,822 --> 01:08:04,652
How are you so aware of how a mom would feel?

1138
01:08:06,351 --> 01:08:07,421
Does Mr. Bang know...

1139
01:08:07,422 --> 01:08:08,460
about your fake pregnancy?

1140
01:08:08,461 --> 01:08:09,560
Give it to me.

1141
01:08:09,561 --> 01:08:10,591
What?

1142
01:08:10,592 --> 01:08:11,762
Are you scared now?

1143
01:08:12,061 --> 01:08:15,131
You dared to pick a fight with me, Geum La Hui,

1144
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,501
without such determination?

1145
01:08:25,642 --> 01:08:26,711
What?

1146
01:08:28,982 --> 01:08:30,281
Why, that little...

1147
01:08:33,382 --> 01:08:34,621
What do you think you're doing?

1148
01:08:36,121 --> 01:08:37,422
I'm Da Mi's mom.

1149
01:08:38,321 --> 01:08:40,291
Please find my Da Mi, Mr. Bang.

1150
01:08:43,321 --> 01:08:44,461
Please help me.

1151
01:08:45,192 --> 01:08:47,701
No matter how hard I look, no one can help me.

1152
01:08:49,262 --> 01:08:51,531
Da Mi's dad would never harm Da Mi.

1153
01:08:51,901 --> 01:08:53,272
Someone else is responsible for the crime.

1154
01:08:53,302 --> 01:08:55,102
I don't want to hear this.

1155
01:08:59,371 --> 01:09:01,211
Da Mi got these documents herself.

1156
01:09:01,711 --> 01:09:03,410
Dasan Women's Hospital, Mirae Women's Hospital,

1157
01:09:03,411 --> 01:09:04,751
Baek Geum Ja Women's Hospital.

1158
01:09:04,852 --> 01:09:06,812
They all said Da Mi wasn't pregnant.

1159
01:09:07,651 --> 01:09:09,981
Did you ever think about how she must have felt...

1160
01:09:09,982 --> 01:09:11,392
going to the hospitals by herself?

1161
01:09:13,151 --> 01:09:14,521
(There's no sign of pregnancy in her uterus.)

1162
01:09:14,522 --> 01:09:17,661
How am I supposed to believe that this document...

1163
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,432
wasn't fabricated?

1164
01:09:19,461 --> 01:09:21,261
She's your granddaughter.

1165
01:09:21,262 --> 01:09:23,762
Can't that be enough for you to believe me?

1166
01:09:26,571 --> 01:09:27,842
Da Mi's dad and I.

1167
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:29,601
Da Mi's scar from her operation was so heartbreaking for us...

1168
01:09:29,602 --> 01:09:31,812
that we went and got the same scar tattooed on us.

1169
01:09:32,312 --> 01:09:35,411
I did it because she was my child and daughter.

1170
01:09:40,312 --> 01:09:41,722
If you still can't believe me,

1171
01:09:46,392 --> 01:09:47,762
kill me right now.

1172
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:49,991
If it means I can find my daughter,

1173
01:09:50,321 --> 01:09:52,031
I would gladly give my life.

1174
01:09:54,501 --> 01:09:55,562
Then,

1175
01:09:56,302 --> 01:09:58,901
are you saying everyone is lying?

1176
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:02,272
For what reason?

1177
01:10:03,371 --> 01:10:04,911
One thing is for sure.

1178
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,642
They want Da Mi to disappear.

1179
01:10:09,781 --> 01:10:11,111
Darn it.

1180
01:10:33,632 --> 01:10:35,001
Listen to me.

1181
01:10:35,102 --> 01:10:36,241
Now,

1182
01:10:36,972 --> 01:10:38,241
Da Mi is gone.

1183
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:41,241
The connection between you and Mr. Bang is broken.

1184
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:42,842
But it's different for me.

1185
01:10:43,312 --> 01:10:45,111
If I get pregnant today,

1186
01:10:45,451 --> 01:10:48,251
Mr. Bang's fortune is all mine.

1187
01:10:48,451 --> 01:10:49,621
What do you want to do?

1188
01:10:50,022 --> 01:10:52,451
Wouldn't it be better for you to negotiate with me?

1189
01:10:53,151 --> 01:10:54,522
Tell me your conditions.

1190
01:10:54,991 --> 01:10:57,091
If you keep your mouth shut, one million dollars...

1191
01:10:57,092 --> 01:10:58,092
No.

1192
01:10:59,461 --> 01:11:01,201
I'll give you two million dollars.

1193
01:11:05,172 --> 01:11:08,272
Watching you get kicked out of that house sounds more fun...

1194
01:11:08,772 --> 01:11:10,842
than two million dollars.

1195
01:11:11,012 --> 01:11:12,111
Wait.

1196
01:11:12,571 --> 01:11:13,741
What do you want?

1197
01:11:14,482 --> 01:11:15,581
Just name it.

1198
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,982
What if Geum La Hui already told him everything?

1199
01:11:23,852 --> 01:11:24,951
No.

1200
01:11:25,151 --> 01:11:28,892
The sly fox wouldn't risk it when it's not beneficial to herself.

1201
01:11:29,861 --> 01:11:32,491
I have to get pregnant quickly.

1202
01:11:32,961 --> 01:11:34,361
That's the only way I'll live.

1203
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:35,531
What are you doing?

1204
01:11:40,472 --> 01:11:41,802
Honey.

1205
01:11:42,371 --> 01:11:45,570
Didn't you say you were going to be late today?

1206
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:48,211
- Why are you drinking so much? - Well, I...

1207
01:11:48,982 --> 01:11:51,151
If something happens to the baby...

1208
01:11:53,151 --> 01:11:54,552
I'm too upset.

1209
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:59,092
I'm too distressed because of Da Mi.

1210
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:01,860
We have to find her body before it's reduced to earth...

1211
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:03,722
so we can hold a funeral for her.

1212
01:12:04,562 --> 01:12:05,931
You haven't heard anything yet, have you?

1213
01:12:05,932 --> 01:12:07,031
No.

1214
01:12:07,132 --> 01:12:08,562
What are we going to do?

1215
01:12:09,232 --> 01:12:11,071
If only Da Mi...

1216
01:12:11,472 --> 01:12:14,001
would walk in through that door tomorrow.

1217
01:12:15,772 --> 01:12:18,041
You must be tired.

1218
01:12:19,111 --> 01:12:21,982
I bought nice aroma oils.

1219
01:12:22,211 --> 01:12:23,982
I'll go and run you a bath.

1220
01:12:43,461 --> 01:12:44,571
Mr. Bang.

1221
01:12:45,932 --> 01:12:47,501
Mr. Hwang is here.

1222
01:12:51,071 --> 01:12:53,512
The document is about the person who runs Scarlet Letter.

1223
01:12:53,842 --> 01:12:55,281
His name is Joo Yong Ju.

1224
01:12:55,882 --> 01:12:58,611
He has five criminal records of assault and he used to be a hoodlum.

1225
01:12:58,882 --> 01:13:00,411
(Criminal Record)

1226
01:13:01,722 --> 01:13:03,422
This is the likes of the man...

1227
01:13:03,621 --> 01:13:06,392
who is shaking up the world right now?

1228
01:13:11,192 --> 01:13:13,291
How pathetic...

1229
01:13:13,632 --> 01:13:15,331
That's Miss Bang Da Mi's biological mother.

1230
01:13:21,802 --> 01:13:24,001
What? This is...

1231
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:27,911
For some reason, there was a huge transaction.

1232
01:13:28,512 --> 01:13:29,982
Geum La Hui...

1233
01:13:30,682 --> 01:13:32,751
bribed the guy...

1234
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:34,821
who was tormenting her daughter?

1235
01:13:35,552 --> 01:13:36,750
And this...

1236
01:13:36,751 --> 01:13:39,052
was at the Center. Miss Da Mi's wallet.

1237
01:13:45,961 --> 01:13:47,731
(Bang Da Mi, First allowance from Grandpa)

1238
01:13:47,732 --> 01:13:48,901
First allowance...

1239
01:13:49,661 --> 01:13:50,831
from Grandpa?

1240
01:13:59,142 --> 01:14:02,682
Bring in that gangster immediately...

1241
01:14:02,942 --> 01:14:05,012
even if you have to put him on a metal skewer.

1242
01:14:05,982 --> 01:14:07,411
I want you to get his confession...

1243
01:14:08,081 --> 01:14:12,592
about the deal he had with Geum La Hui.

1244
01:14:12,751 --> 01:14:13,892
Yes, sir.

1245
01:14:20,531 --> 01:14:22,131
(First allowance from Grandpa)

1246
01:14:22,132 --> 01:14:23,932
I should give my granddaughter some spending money.

1247
01:14:25,672 --> 01:14:27,672
What's wrong? Is it too little?

1248
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:29,142
No.

1249
01:14:29,772 --> 01:14:32,142
I'm happy because this is my first time...

1250
01:14:32,272 --> 01:14:33,711
getting an allowance from you.

1251
01:14:34,482 --> 01:14:35,642
I'll keep...

1252
01:14:35,882 --> 01:14:37,682
this money forever.

1253
01:14:37,781 --> 01:14:39,151
Thank you.

1254
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:42,052
Gosh.

1255
01:14:47,092 --> 01:14:48,361
Geum La Hui.

1256
01:14:48,961 --> 01:14:50,092
Cha Ju Ran.

1257
01:14:50,692 --> 01:14:54,291
If you two did something to my granddaughter,

1258
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:58,071
in the name of Bang Chil Sung,

1259
01:14:58,331 --> 01:14:59,732
I promise...

1260
01:15:00,732 --> 01:15:01,942
that you'll see...

1261
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:05,711
the fires of the abyss, no matter what.

1262
01:15:23,361 --> 01:15:25,132
Who are you people?

1263
01:15:30,802 --> 01:15:31,901
Hey.

1264
01:15:44,552 --> 01:15:45,812
You little...

1265
01:15:48,821 --> 01:15:50,022
Darn it.

1266
01:15:51,392 --> 01:15:53,522
Who are you people?

1267
01:15:53,692 --> 01:15:54,722
Take him away.

1268
01:15:57,022 --> 01:15:58,692
Do you know who I am?

1269
01:15:58,732 --> 01:16:00,331
Don't touch my face.

1270
01:16:00,661 --> 01:16:03,732
You punks!

1271
01:16:06,632 --> 01:16:07,802
The chairman is coming out.

1272
01:16:20,251 --> 01:16:22,352
Even if you're alive, you'll be in eternal agony.

1273
01:16:22,882 --> 01:16:24,922
And even in death, you'll suffer eternally.

1274
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:28,961
You're going to pay a terrible price.

1275
01:16:31,632 --> 01:16:33,531
I'm going to wipe you out.

1276
01:16:33,961 --> 01:16:35,701
All of you!

1277
01:17:08,732 --> 01:17:11,772
(The Escape of the Seven)

1278
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:13,131
It just started.

1279
01:17:13,132 --> 01:17:14,370
His revenge for Bang Da Mi.

1280
01:17:14,371 --> 01:17:15,671
We poked the hive.

1281
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:18,472
Why did you stigmatize Da Mi like that?

1282
01:17:18,512 --> 01:17:20,110
I never did such a thing.

1283
01:17:20,111 --> 01:17:21,410
She made the whole thing up.

1284
01:17:21,411 --> 01:17:23,080
Why was she attacked by him?

1285
01:17:23,081 --> 01:17:25,081
Do you remember what happened that day?

1286
01:17:25,151 --> 01:17:26,581
Did you feed me this?

1287
01:17:27,651 --> 01:17:29,421
Mr. Bang is going to hold a press conference.

1288
01:17:29,422 --> 01:17:31,191
Da Mi isn't dead.

1289
01:17:31,192 --> 01:17:32,421
We're going to hit first.

1290
01:17:32,422 --> 01:17:34,391
Don't forgive me.

1291
01:17:34,392 --> 01:17:36,691
There's nowhere else for me to back down.

1292
01:17:36,692 --> 01:17:38,191
What do you have in mind right now?

1293
01:17:38,192 --> 01:17:41,802
Geum La Hui, I'm going to use it to kill you.
