(in this drama are fictitious.)

11
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:01,476
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

12
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:10,587
It's so nice to see you all here on Jeju Island!

13
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:13,326
Shall we have some fun today?

14
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:18,626
Wasn't it today? The day they disappeared.

15
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:21,967
You guys had a special relationship.

16
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:24,307
Enough! Someone died!

17
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:31,307
Just bury them on an island.

18
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:34,446
If you go about 20 minutes by yacht, there's an abandoned island.

19
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:35,516
Just bury them there.

20
00:01:36,176 --> 00:01:37,747
This was self-defense.

21
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:39,546
We just need to bury the body.

22
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:41,586
As of this moment,

23
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:42,956
we all share the same fate.

24
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:44,257
Any traitors...

25
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:46,126
will be punished by death.

26
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,036
Are we really all going to die?

27
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,176
There's not a single person here...

28
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:02,607
who can protect you.

29
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:05,675
This is that girl's curse!

30
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:07,076
It's the curse of Bobble!

31
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:10,846
We didn't kill anyone.

32
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:13,247
We were just protecting ourselves.

33
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:24,226
We just need to be on the same page.

34
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:28,196
The seven of us are the final winners.

00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:37,946
(The Escape of the Seven)

(Episode 1)

38
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:24,125
(The first time Da Mi and I went to the aquarium.)

39
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:25,625
(My beautiful mom)

40
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:27,256
(My handsome dad)

41
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:29,196
Mom.

42
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:31,125
Did you wait long?

43
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:32,166
It's okay.

44
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:35,435
You don't need to bring anything.

45
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:36,665
I prepared everything for you.

46
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,206
That's what I told them too,

47
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:40,066
but my mom and dad keep packing things for me.

48
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:46,677
You must be so sad.

49
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,747
I know how you feel,

50
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:52,886
but I wanted to live with her for a few years...

51
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,957
and cook for her.

52
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:57,856
You understand. Right?

53
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:02,957
I raised her like my own daughter for the past 15 years.

54
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:06,767
I was always careful with her, so she wouldn't get hurt.

55
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:07,837
Da Mi...

56
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,467
had five heart surgeries.

57
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,066
She has a stent,

58
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:15,707
and she has a harder time when it rains.

59
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:17,677
I will be sure to keep that in mind.

60
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:20,416
I will take care of and cherish her...

61
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:22,577
more than anyone can.

62
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:28,957
Mom, at this rate, we'll end up staying here all day.

63
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:30,786
Stop rushing me.

64
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:34,356
You should say a proper goodbye to your mom and dad.

65
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:35,556
Well...

66
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:37,666
Thank you for raising me.

67
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:40,496
You're so beautiful, my daughter.

68
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,766
We...

69
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,536
have a special relationship...

70
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,906
since we share a child.

71
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,036
Can I treat you like a sister?

72
00:04:55,147 --> 00:04:56,817
No matter what anyone says,

73
00:04:58,447 --> 00:04:59,986
Da Mi is your daughter.

74
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:06,486
You have no idea how happy I am that you're Da Mi's birth mother.

75
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:12,197
Mom. Let's go. Please?

76
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:14,467
Let's say goodbye here.

77
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:17,637
Don't be lame and follow us out. Okay?

78
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:26,947
Bye!

79
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:14,655
I love this song too!

80
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:17,166
You and I have so much in common.

81
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:19,996
Our taste in music, blood type, and even our MBTI.

82
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:21,897
Don't force yourself.

83
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:28,406
I mean, you don't have to pretend to be happy.

84
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:35,577
They're probably crying.

85
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:37,546
My mom and dad.

86
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:39,387
You can visit them often.

87
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:42,156
Aren't you happy?

88
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:46,027
A completely different life is waiting for you.

89
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:59,106
This is so cool.

90
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:02,306
That!

91
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:04,176
I've seen it on TV!

92
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:27,897
How pretty.

93
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:29,467
It's this way.

94
00:07:42,877 --> 00:07:43,887
Awesome!

95
00:07:47,556 --> 00:07:48,986
No way.

96
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,837
That fish tank was a gift from your parents.

97
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:04,806
No way!

98
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:11,877
That's my house.

99
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:16,916
I tried to decline it because it didn't match the interior here.

100
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,856
But they're quite stubborn.

101
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:25,187
I just moved in, so things aren't quite settled yet.

102
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:27,726
I...

103
00:08:28,226 --> 00:08:30,056
rarely eat at home.

104
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:33,166
I really hate the smell of food in the house.

105
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:36,866
Then what about food?

106
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:42,376
We might live together, but we'll rarely see each other.

107
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,806
I come home after midnight on most nights,

108
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:46,106
and I go on business trips often.

109
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:59,157
Is this really my room?

110
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:02,126
I decorated it according to my style. Do you like it?

111
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:04,095
I love it!

112
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:05,726
I feel like I'm dreaming!

113
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:13,266
How pretty!

114
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:25,687
I prepared an outfit that your grandfather would like.

115
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:28,356
We should go say hello to him.

116
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:30,256
Okay!

117
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,726
Hello, sir. Have you been well?

118
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:38,096
This is Jo Su Ji, an actress who just joined us.

119
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:39,995
Hello.

120
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,697
I love this place.

121
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:42,766
Hey!

122
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,056
Hello.

123
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:03,386
I'm Yang Jin Mo, the CEO of Cherry Entertainment.

124
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:08,526
We, at Cherry Entertainment, only think about being in first place.

125
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:11,467
Alongside actress Jo Su Ji, who recently joined us,

126
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:15,096
we will do everything we can to ensure that our artists...

127
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,636
become top stars throughout the world.

128
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:18,707
Until we become the best...

129
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:20,975
Say it with me. Cheers!

130
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:23,177
- Cheers! - Cheers!

131
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:36,516
Who are you?

132
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,756
Who are you? What the heck do you want?

133
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:09,256
Hey, let's get started.

134
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,807
Don't lay a hand on our actors, you punks!

135
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:31,146
Get over here.

136
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:32,346
Come on.

137
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:35,976
We were so worried because we couldn't reach Jo Su Ji.

138
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:38,485
But as it turned out, Cherry took her from us.

139
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:39,546
Who are you?

140
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:40,787
Did Kang Ki Tak send you?

141
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:44,686
We had spent millions on her for five years and made her useable,

142
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:47,126
but you must have thrown your business ethics out the door.

143
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:50,896
Watch your mouth, you punk.

144
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:53,426
Is it wrong to scout an actress whose contract ended?

145
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:54,596
Yes.

146
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,077
I have a present for you.

147
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:05,876
It's a special gift that my friend, Kang Ki Tak, prepared for you.

148
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:22,756
- They're here! - Here they are!

149
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:26,297
(Convoy)

150
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:31,166
Is it true that you attacked Cherry Entertainment last night?

151
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,106
What's your grudge against Yang Jin Mo?

152
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:38,176
- Did something happen between you? - Please give us a comment!

153
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:40,775
During Cherry Entertainment's three-year anniversary party...

154
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:42,275
last night,

155
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:45,286
CEO Yang Jin Mo was attacked by a group of gangsters...

156
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:47,115
and is in critical condition.

157
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:50,615
The police's prime suspect in this attack is Kang Ki Tak,

158
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,385
- CEO of Taebaek Entertainment, - That idiot!

159
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:54,197
and have arrested him without a warrant.

160
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:56,525
Kang Ki Tak, who is under investigation,

161
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,796
was formerly a member...

162
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:01,437
- of the Joongang Gang. - Was Mr. Kang really behind it?

163
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:04,736
I heard he washed his hands clean of that life.

164
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:07,135
You should stay on your toes too.

165
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:10,677
He might end up stabbing you in the face next.

166
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:14,776
Just make sure to keep your promise to double my guarantee.

167
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:17,817
You know I betrayed Mr. Kang, who got me this far. Right?

168
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,816
The culprit, A, is a gangster...

169
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,586
I have my eyes on a building.

170
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:24,086
I lost a lot...

171
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,927
trying to bring you into our company. What is this?

172
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:31,526
The production budget for this OTT drama is 100 million.

173
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:35,466
We need to make sure the leading lady gets paid properly.

174
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:36,496
Right?

175
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:45,876
(Seoul Haneul Hospital)

176
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:58,856
Who the heck are you?

177
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:01,796
What are you doing here? Get out!

178
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:04,225
I did everything you asked for.

179
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:05,495
I caused a scene at the party.

180
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:06,796
I got caught on the CCTV cameras,

181
00:14:06,797 --> 00:14:08,336
and I confessed as though Ki Tak was behind everything.

182
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:10,067
But what's the problem?

183
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:14,036
If I managed to stab you while avoiding all your organs,

184
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:15,207
what should you do for me?

185
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,975
You have to pay me. But why won't you? It's simple.

186
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:20,106
Why are you making me mad?

187
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:22,375
Give me my money, you jerk.

188
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:23,917
Listen here, you punk.

189
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:27,657
I'm getting the cash ready with brand new 50 dollars bills.

190
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:29,516
Come back tomorrow at 10am.

191
00:14:29,557 --> 00:14:30,616
Happy?

192
00:14:30,657 --> 00:14:33,985
Don't ruin our perfect plan and get lost, you punk!

193
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:36,197
I will. I'll get lost right now. Get better soon!

194
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:40,067
Oh, there's one more thing.

195
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:43,095
Make sure to end things well...

196
00:14:43,096 --> 00:14:45,567
so that my guys don't get put in jail. Okay?

197
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,736
- Good luck. - Seriously? That...

198
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:50,537
That jerk. My gosh!

199
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,917
I put in all of your favorite side dishes.

200
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:05,057
If you run out, call me any time.

201
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:13,996
(Our family photos)

202
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,376
(Bank Book)

203
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:36,916
My daughter is kind and pretty,

204
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:39,226
so you'll be loved wherever you go.

205
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:41,226
I put in some spending money.

206
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:43,626
Spend it without hesitation whenever you need it.

207
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,797
I love you so much, my dear daughter.

208
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:48,567
Dad...

209
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:51,736
I'm sorry I was so mean.

210
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:56,006
I didn't want you to be hurt because of me,

211
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:59,307
so I did that to put your mind at ease.

212
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:04,917
I'm so sorry.

213
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:12,056
Before you came here,

214
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:14,427
I had no idea I was adopted.

215
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,996
That's how they raised me.

216
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:23,167
I can't live a single day without my mom and dad.

217
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:26,006
Goodbye.

218
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:27,167
I...

219
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:32,447
I spent my entire life looking for you.

220
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:34,947
I barely managed to find you.

221
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:37,146
How can I live apart from you again?

222
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:39,947
Just until you go to college.

223
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,356
Just until then...

224
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:45,886
Please let me be your mom.

225
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:48,726
You should give me a chance too.

226
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:52,996
There's nobody else who is as loved as I am.

227
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:56,736
So please, just go.

228
00:16:58,136 --> 00:16:59,837
That is if you really want me to be happy.

229
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:04,947
Can't you just see it as gaining another mom?

230
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,076
I looked into your parents,

231
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:10,316
and they sold their home and took out loans...

232
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:12,986
for your surgeries and hospital bills.

233
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:14,486
Five hundred thousand dollars.

234
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:16,857
Five hundred thousand dollars?

235
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,697
I can pay off that debt.

236
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:27,597
I can do anything for you.

237
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:42,716
What? Jo Su Ji isn't going to do it?

238
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:45,416
We might not have signed a contract, but we made a verbal agreement.

239
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:46,916
What are you talking about?

240
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,657
You know Jo Su Ji moved from Taebaek to Cherry.

241
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:53,055
I think Yang Jin Mo is up to something...

242
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:54,756
to get her paid more.

243
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:56,156
How much?

244
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:58,596
They said another show offered 100,000 dollars per episode.

245
00:17:58,597 --> 00:17:59,667
A hundred thousand dollars?

246
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,436
Everyone knows her last drama was 25,000 dollars an episode,

247
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:04,637
but they want 100,000 dollars now?

248
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:06,565
Are they out of their minds?

249
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,776
She wants 100,000 dollars because one drama was a hit?

250
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:11,647
Where's Mr. Yang right now?

251
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:14,146
He's in the hospital because he was stabbed.

252
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:15,515
He's not allowed visitors.

253
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:17,046
Do what you can to set up a meeting.

254
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:18,916
Don't you think it'll be hard?

255
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:20,417
I have to see him!

256
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:26,085
Hey. Do you know how much investment we got because of her?

257
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:28,397
We'll be out on the streets if we lose them!

258
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:39,707
I'm ready.

259
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:41,407
Shall we get going?

260
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:07,795
What were the three things you need to watch out for?

261
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:10,265
Don't talk back, don't be wasteful,

262
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:11,806
and be on time!

263
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:15,937
You can't be even a second late when you're meeting him.

264
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:18,076
He thinks waiting is insulting.

265
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,546
He's very temperamental, so you have to be on your toes.

266
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,516
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

267
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:27,957
Come and catch me!

268
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:30,486
My goodness.

269
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:33,555
Honey, where are you?

270
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:35,525
I'm right here, honey.

271
00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:37,995
Do you have to do this with an old man like me?

272
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:40,996
Honey, you're not a young man. You're a boy.

273
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,707
You're right. I'm a boy. A young boy.

274
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:48,336
Over here! I'm over here!

275
00:19:49,306 --> 00:19:50,736
Honey!

276
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,005
Where are you?

277
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:55,276
- Over here! - Hey!

278
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:57,847
That hurt.

279
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:00,646
Just wait until I catch you.

280
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:03,556
You'll be in big trouble!

281
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:08,397
- Over here! - Hey!

282
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,197
I caught you!

283
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:15,896
I told you...

284
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:18,506
you would be in big trouble if I caught you.

285
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,766
My baby...

286
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,407
Who are you?

287
00:20:28,046 --> 00:20:30,246
Hello.

288
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:43,857
Gosh.

289
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:50,897
The chairman will see you after he gets changed.

290
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,976
You don't resemble your mom at all.

291
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:00,806
It's nice to meet you. I'm your grandfather's friend.

292
00:21:01,746 --> 00:21:02,776
I see.

293
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:06,187
Shouldn't you say, "hello," first?

294
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,917
You're not very sociable.

295
00:21:09,486 --> 00:21:12,086
Your grandfather will be so disappointed.

296
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:19,296
Your grandfather has a girlfriend.

297
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:22,796
She's an OB-GYN and very smart.

298
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:26,736
Be sure you don't let her find any faults in you.

299
00:21:28,576 --> 00:21:30,576
I'm sorry if I upset you.

300
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,975
I must've been nervous...

301
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:34,617
because your home is so nice.

302
00:21:34,947 --> 00:21:36,475
Is that so?

303
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:38,815
Oh, right. May I go wash my hands?

304
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:40,146
Where is the restroom?

305
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:41,616
- Ms. Jo? - Yes?

306
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:42,986
Can you show her the way?

307
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:44,756
Come this.

308
00:21:45,326 --> 00:21:47,826
I heard you got a luxurious townhouse in Gangnam...

309
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:50,026
and a luxury car.

310
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:52,096
What more do you want...

311
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:54,197
that you brought that kid with you?

312
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:57,495
If you get too greedy, you can end up in failure.

313
00:21:57,496 --> 00:21:58,736
How embarrassing.

314
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,975
I don't think that's something a woman sleeping with an old man...

315
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:03,506
could say to me.

316
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:05,276
What?

317
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:09,716
Do you think anyone would believe you if you bring...

318
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:11,316
your long-lost daughter here?

319
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:13,447
You're the one who abandoned her.

320
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:15,687
It's not like the chairman has no idea.

321
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:18,387
He knows what you're thinking.

322
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:21,126
He gave you some money because he pitied you.

323
00:22:21,127 --> 00:22:22,127
Got it?

324
00:22:22,128 --> 00:22:24,897
The person who abandoned that child is the chairman's son, not me.

325
00:22:25,597 --> 00:22:27,065
The one who gave birth to her...

326
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:28,937
and raised her through all the hardships...

327
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:31,667
was me.

328
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:35,336
I lost her by mistake.

329
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:36,907
Lies.

330
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:40,207
Geum La Hui, you are nothing in this household.

331
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:42,877
You never even married the chairman's son.

332
00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:45,117
If you bring a child here,

333
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:48,387
do you really think you'll become a part of this family?

334
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:54,187
Stop pretending like you're my mother-in-law.

335
00:22:54,526 --> 00:22:56,726
Just like how I'm not the chairman's daughter-in-law,

336
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:59,526
you're not the woman of this household, either.

337
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:01,597
We're both...

338
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:05,066
nothing to the chairman.

339
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:07,367
Only...

340
00:23:08,536 --> 00:23:09,806
Da Mi is.

341
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:36,036
Your eyes and your nose are a spitting image...

342
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:39,066
of your late father.

343
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:43,776
You are no longer Lee Da Mi.

344
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:46,305
You're Bang Da Mi.

345
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:47,746
Yes, Grandfather.

346
00:23:50,147 --> 00:23:51,586
How's the new place?

347
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:54,516
Thanks to you, we moved in well.

348
00:23:54,857 --> 00:23:57,556
Thank you so much for all your consideration.

349
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:01,256
These are Da Mi's report cards.

350
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:03,597
Her report cards?

351
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:08,596
(Academic Transcript)

352
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:09,966
(Student: Lee Da Mi)

353
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:11,436
Oh, my.

354
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:15,637
You're in first place.

355
00:24:17,437 --> 00:24:20,677
Her intelligence must take after me.

356
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:23,946
I never had a chance to go to school,

357
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:27,286
but everyone told me I was smart enough to be a judge.

358
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:31,086
Who could be as smart as you?

359
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:35,126
Did you decide on which school you're transferring to?

360
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:36,956
Yes. Myeongju Girls' High School.

361
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:38,897
Myeongju Girls' High School?

362
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:41,597
It'll be hard for you to take first place there.

363
00:24:41,796 --> 00:24:44,096
Myeongju Girls' High School is quite prestigious.

364
00:24:44,097 --> 00:24:48,607
No. You have to do something hard for first place to mean something.

365
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:52,407
Right. Do you think you can place first in the school?

366
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,475
Yes, I'll try my best!

367
00:24:57,476 --> 00:24:59,586
I'll try my best to come in first place!

368
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:02,016
Right.

369
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:06,826
Gosh, I should give my granddaughter some spending money.

370
00:25:33,447 --> 00:25:34,515
Here.

371
00:25:34,516 --> 00:25:36,157
(Bang Da Mi)

372
00:25:42,056 --> 00:25:43,597
(One dollar)

373
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:50,637
What's wrong? Is it too little?

374
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:51,806
No.

375
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:55,075
I'm happy because this is my first time...

376
00:25:55,076 --> 00:25:56,336
getting an allowance from you.

377
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:58,347
I'll keep...

378
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:00,306
this money forever.

379
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:01,676
Thank you.

380
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:02,947
Is that so?

381
00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:04,947
Good.

382
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:07,316
Gosh, this kid.

383
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:09,357
I'll bring some tea.

384
00:26:10,157 --> 00:26:12,086
Let's see your skills, Da Mi.

385
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:13,627
Yes, ma'am.

386
00:26:20,726 --> 00:26:22,367
- Welcome. - Welcome.

387
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:24,366
- Hey. - Yes?

388
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:25,535
Aren't you going to clean the floor?

389
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:26,607
I will.

390
00:26:26,736 --> 00:26:28,306
Sorry, ma'am. I'll just finish this up first.

391
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,636
The customer who got a haircut left ages ago.

392
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:32,505
Why haven't you swept the floor yet?

393
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:34,476
Sorry, ma'am. I'm almost done. I'll get to it right away.

394
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:36,476
I'm so sorry.

395
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:39,086
No. Leave that.

396
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,387
Come here.

397
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:43,717
Pardon? One moment.

398
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:46,285
- A customer just came in. - Yes.

399
00:26:46,286 --> 00:26:48,496
- Shampoo their hair first. - Yes, ma'am.

400
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:51,197
Yes, ma'am. Miss. Please take a seat over here.

401
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:55,836
Oh, it's hot!

402
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:57,336
Are you crazy, lady?

403
00:26:58,506 --> 00:27:00,637
Goodness. What are you doing?

404
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:07,607
(Deokseon Hair Salon)

405
00:27:13,246 --> 00:27:14,387
Oh, my!

406
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:30,796
Hello?

407
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:32,266
It's me.

408
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:34,736
Hello? Do Hyuk?

409
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:37,005
Is this Do Hyuk?

410
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:38,006
Stop saying my name.

411
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:39,576
Of course, I'm Do Hyuk. Who else would I be?

412
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:43,117
Look at that temper. It is you.

413
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:45,286
Everything is fine, right?

414
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:49,156
I feel so much better after hearing your voice.

415
00:27:49,157 --> 00:27:50,316
Why do you want to hear my voice?

416
00:27:50,687 --> 00:27:52,386
I think you've already forgotten.

417
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:55,255
I stole the deposit for your salon and ran away.

418
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,555
That's your problem.

419
00:27:56,556 --> 00:27:59,396
Your life is always a mess because you're stupid.

420
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:01,736
Who cares about my salon?

421
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:03,766
How is your business going?

422
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:06,166
When will you come home?

423
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,536
Don't you miss your brother?

424
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:09,107
Oh, right. Do Hyuk.

425
00:28:09,177 --> 00:28:10,536
Jae Hyuk...

426
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:14,607
will graduate top of his class at Seoul University Law School.

427
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,816
Gosh. That's good news!

428
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:19,586
Now that you'll be the mother of a judge,

429
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:22,417
find a good place for a salon that'll suit your position.

430
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:24,156
Why a salon?

431
00:28:24,157 --> 00:28:25,786
My business was a huge success.

432
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:29,096
So please throw away that raggedy apron of yours.

433
00:28:29,097 --> 00:28:30,825
- What is that? Come on. - What?

434
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:32,995
I could pick something out of a trashcan...

435
00:28:32,996 --> 00:28:34,867
and dress better than that.

436
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:37,137
Are you looking at me right now?

437
00:28:37,637 --> 00:28:39,207
Where are you, Do Hyuk?

438
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,637
I'm going to pay you back, no matter what.

439
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:47,607
I'll pay you back,

440
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:50,046
so wait just a little longer.

441
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,597
How many times did I tell you...

442
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,097
never to waste anything?

443
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:09,196
So...

444
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:10,397
why did you do that?

445
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:12,107
Why?

446
00:29:17,937 --> 00:29:19,606
Are you trying...

447
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:22,275
to negotiate with me by using that kid?

448
00:29:22,276 --> 00:29:23,877
I'm not asking for a handout.

449
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:26,187
I'm asking for you to make an investment.

450
00:29:27,316 --> 00:29:29,417
This is the drama I'm working on.

451
00:29:29,586 --> 00:29:31,555
It's a blockbuster that needs 100 million dollars for production.

452
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:33,025
We've already cast famous actors.

453
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:34,456
If we sell the copyright overseas,

454
00:29:34,457 --> 00:29:37,295
I can guarantee a 200 percent return on investment.

455
00:29:37,296 --> 00:29:41,026
A drama like this can't make that much money.

456
00:29:41,097 --> 00:29:42,967
I'm confident it will succeed.

457
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:45,137
Please believe in me.

458
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:50,036
Da Mi is such a good girl.

459
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:53,506
She insisted on making the tangerine tea for you.

460
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:56,046
She is really so sweet.

461
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:57,516
Is that so?

462
00:29:57,717 --> 00:30:03,056
Let's try some of this tangerine tea that my granddaughter made for me.

463
00:30:08,357 --> 00:30:09,627
What is this?

464
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:12,627
How much tangerine syrup did you put in here?

465
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:15,536
Don't you know I have diabetes?

466
00:30:17,536 --> 00:30:18,735
Oh, my goodness.

467
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:20,836
She used enough syrup for one month's worth of tea.

468
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:22,906
But Ms. Cha...

469
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:24,005
I told you...

470
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:25,907
to add just one spoon.

471
00:30:26,276 --> 00:30:28,775
Da Mi must've made a mistake because...

472
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:30,975
she doesn't know you well yet. Please understand.

473
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:33,286
Instead of trying to get money out of me,

474
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,417
educate your daughter first.

475
00:30:38,826 --> 00:30:41,525
I'm sorry, Grandpa. I made a mistake.

476
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:42,726
What is this?

477
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:45,266
How dare you interrupt when the adults are talking?

478
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:47,166
I don't even want to look at you.

479
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:49,197
Get out of this house immediately.

480
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:03,275
I only did as she said.

481
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:05,586
I had no idea she would lie like that.

482
00:31:05,687 --> 00:31:07,946
I told you she was a cunning person.

483
00:31:07,947 --> 00:31:09,786
You should've known to be suspicious of her.

484
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:11,856
I'm sorry.

485
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:13,187
Get it together.

486
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:16,697
This isn't the peaceful countryside where you used to live.

487
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:20,127
To survive, you need to eat them before they eat you.

488
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:22,896
- Get out. - What?

489
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:25,167
Didn't you hear me? Get out.

490
00:31:26,907 --> 00:31:28,006
Yes, ma'am.

491
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,826
This is Geum La Hui, the CEO of LH Media.

492
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:53,826
Please let us meet Mr. Yang.

493
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:56,396
He's sleeping right now. Please come back another time.

494
00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:57,597
It'll only take a second.

495
00:31:58,867 --> 00:31:59,907
Goodness.

496
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:02,475
Gosh. It's really not going in.

497
00:32:02,476 --> 00:32:04,075
- Oh, goodness. - You can't do that, ma'am.

498
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:05,276
- Stop it. - Please leave.

499
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:07,576
Look at this.

500
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:12,546
I was worried for no reason.

501
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:14,946
On the news, they said you were in serious condition,

502
00:32:14,947 --> 00:32:16,617
so I thought you were fighting for your life.

503
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:20,526
You recover much more quickly than I thought, Mr. Yang.

504
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:24,026
I'm a very lucky person.

505
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:28,566
I heard you suddenly asked for 100,000 dollars per episode.

506
00:32:28,836 --> 00:32:32,137
Other places even ask for 150,000 dollars.

507
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:51,556
Please help me, Mr. Yang.

508
00:32:52,857 --> 00:32:54,127
Jo Su Ji...

509
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,857
is the actress I really need right now.

510
00:32:57,927 --> 00:32:59,826
I'll make sure she gets an Academy Award with this.

511
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:02,137
I'll make sure the drama is top quality,

512
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:04,836
so please sign the contract.

513
00:33:05,836 --> 00:33:07,036
I beg of you.

514
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:09,506
Ms. Geum.

515
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:12,076
What are you doing?

516
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:13,776
Goodness.

517
00:33:25,187 --> 00:33:28,996
This is why I can't hate you.

518
00:33:30,097 --> 00:33:32,427
Gosh. Okay.

519
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:34,526
Bring the money...

520
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:38,197
and stand in line. I'll at least give you a chance.

521
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:40,607
I can't...

522
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,006
lower the price.

523
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:45,707
It's 100,000 dollars...

524
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:47,407
for each episode.

525
00:34:07,627 --> 00:34:09,436
I don't like needles.

526
00:34:09,437 --> 00:34:11,036
They hurt.

527
00:34:11,497 --> 00:34:14,406
For your health, you need to get nutrient injections...

528
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:16,807
and eat good food.

529
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:18,947
Dr. Cha.

530
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:22,116
You're going to date...

531
00:34:22,117 --> 00:34:24,177
a younger guy right after I die, aren't you?

532
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:29,186
Just live for a long time if that makes you jealous.

533
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:33,057
Okay. Now it's time for your herbal medicine.

534
00:34:33,086 --> 00:34:34,456
Gosh. Herbal medicine.

535
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,396
Goodness.

536
00:34:39,697 --> 00:34:41,396
You have to drink it all. There.

537
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,666
- Gosh. It's bitter. - It's bitter?

538
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:49,076
This must be expensive.

539
00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:51,807
I got a discount from a friend of mine.

540
00:34:56,077 --> 00:34:57,775
You were disappointed...

541
00:34:57,776 --> 00:35:00,646
because Da Mi's mom spends money carelessly, right?

542
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:07,456
I thought you might feel upset,

543
00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:10,256
so I scolded her daughter a little bit.

544
00:35:11,827 --> 00:35:13,327
I hope I wasn't too hard on her.

545
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,767
Whether you're old or young,

546
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:18,637
you'll lose everything if you seem weak to others.

547
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:20,736
She seems like a good kid, right?

548
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,736
Even though she wasn't raised by her real parents,

549
00:35:22,876 --> 00:35:24,606
she turned out very well.

550
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:27,677
I have to get going now.

551
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:30,517
Why aren't you staying the night?

552
00:35:30,617 --> 00:35:32,186
It's so late.

553
00:35:32,287 --> 00:35:33,986
Just stay the night.

554
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:36,486
I should sleep at home.

555
00:35:36,586 --> 00:35:37,686
I'm more comfortable at home.

556
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:39,327

00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,986
to get pregnant.

564
00:36:44,186 --> 00:36:45,387
Please.

Please.

First allowance from Grandpa.

568
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,776
What are you doing?

569
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:12,447
My mom cooked that! Don't throw it away!

570
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:16,416
Your mom? Who's your mom?

571
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:18,415
Here, I'm your mom.

572
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:21,186
While you're here, you will follow my rules.

573
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:24,486
Did I or did I not say I don't accept the smell of food?

574
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:27,025
Your so-called parents are just the same.

575
00:38:27,026 --> 00:38:28,955
They should help you adjust,

576
00:38:28,956 --> 00:38:30,525
not cook for you your whole life.

577
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:32,996
Why? Did you brag about having a rich grandpa?

578
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:35,097
Are you acting up because I repaid your debt?

579
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:43,037
I won't eat it.

580
00:38:44,677 --> 00:38:48,077

(My beloved Dad)

582
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,157
Hi, it's me.

583
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:06,796
Did you sleep well, sweetie?

584
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,236
Did you have trouble sleeping in your new home?

585
00:39:09,566 --> 00:39:11,796
No, I slept well.

586
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,565
He wanted to call at the crack of dawn,

587
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:15,907
and I barely managed to make him wait until now.

588
00:39:16,077 --> 00:39:17,576
Did you visit your grandfather?

589
00:39:17,577 --> 00:39:19,847
Did you say hi? Was he nice to you?

590
00:39:20,046 --> 00:39:22,176
How do you like your fish tank?

591
00:39:22,177 --> 00:39:24,077
You'd always wanted one.

592
00:39:26,646 --> 00:39:28,416
Yes. I love it.

593
00:39:29,557 --> 00:39:31,585
Why do you sound like that?

594
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:32,686
Is something wrong?

595
00:39:33,427 --> 00:39:35,456
No. I just woke up...

596
00:39:36,756 --> 00:39:38,756
Da Mi, I know something's wrong.

597
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:40,026
Shall I come over?

598
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:42,467
Hi, Nan Young.

599
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:44,066
I messed up...

600
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:47,836
and forgot to put the food you sent in the fridge.

601
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:49,736
I had to throw it all out,

602
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,106
and Da Mi got upset.

603
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:54,847
I'm sorry to waste your precious food.

604
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:57,076
That's all it was?

605
00:39:57,077 --> 00:40:00,416
It's fine. I can always send more food.

606
00:40:00,617 --> 00:40:03,117
I'll console Da Mi.

607
00:40:03,816 --> 00:40:05,387
Don't worry. Bye.

608
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:22,066
Da Mi was crying.

609
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:23,677
I can tell from her voice.

610
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:26,705
She left just yesterday.

611
00:40:26,706 --> 00:40:28,247
She got emotional, that's all.

612
00:40:28,847 --> 00:40:29,916
You think?

613
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:32,847
Why do I feel so uneasy?

614
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:35,287
Did we do the right thing by letting her go?

615
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:38,416
That sounds like she's with her stepmom.

616
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:42,026
Da Mi went to be with her birth mom.

617
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,657
Until she settles in,

618
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:49,336
let's give her time, even though we miss her.

619
00:40:50,537 --> 00:40:51,597
Okay.

620
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:07,486
Do you have something to say?

621
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:11,255
After class today,

622
00:41:11,256 --> 00:41:13,287
I'll drop by Seongbuk-dong.

623
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:17,497
I'll visit Grandpa and make up for making him angry.

624
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,336
I'm sorry about earlier.

625
00:41:31,006 --> 00:41:33,106
Things didn't work out, and I was a bit on edge.

626
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:40,186
Aren't you overworked and tired? You didn't sleep much.

627
00:41:45,827 --> 00:41:47,426
Thanks for being understanding.

628
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:48,887

Don't visit your grandpa empty-handed.

630
00:41:53,296 --> 00:41:54,396
He likes injeolmi.

631
00:41:56,736 --> 00:42:01,037
It's my first day at school.

632
00:42:01,137 --> 00:42:04,037
Oh, sorry. I must leave now for a meeting.

633
00:42:04,206 --> 00:42:05,407
You must go to school alone.

634
00:42:05,977 --> 00:42:07,046
Can you manage?

635
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:09,847
Yes.

- You're so pretty! - Mone is awesome.

646
00:42:52,827 --> 00:42:55,585
She's too huge to be cooped up in here.

647
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:57,656
Who would debut if not her?

648
00:42:57,657 --> 00:42:59,566

651

Here. It's the money you gave me.

652

I can't do this anymore.

653
00:43:15,977 --> 00:43:17,815
I'm so anxious I barely sleep.

654
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:19,186
I think I have a panic disorder.

655
00:43:20,816 --> 00:43:22,585
Is it because you're smart?

656
00:43:22,586 --> 00:43:24,086
Did you come up with this idea...

657
00:43:24,387 --> 00:43:26,585
to get us to pay you more?

658
00:43:26,586 --> 00:43:28,287
I said this exam would be the last.

659
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:30,157
I have to go to med school.

660
00:43:30,497 --> 00:43:31,856
I'll be suspended if I'm caught.

661
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:35,396
You'll only get caught if you're darned unlucky.

662
00:43:35,727 --> 00:43:36,766
We did fine so far.

663
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:38,466

664
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:39,836

665
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:41,537

00:43:42,836 --> 00:43:43,936

Hey! Are you okay?

668
00:43:53,316 --> 00:43:56,755
We hung out with you only because you were smart.

669
00:43:56,756 --> 00:43:58,355
Did you think if you returned the money,

670
00:43:58,356 --> 00:44:02,026
I'd go, "Thanks for your services?"

671
00:44:03,427 --> 00:44:04,597
Get off me!

672
00:44:04,896 --> 00:44:06,497
I'll tell our teacher.

673
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:10,736
Say that again.

674
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:13,566
You'll do what to our teacher?

675
00:44:14,836 --> 00:44:17,735
Do you two need a severe beating?

676
00:44:17,736 --> 00:44:20,846
We have a video of you two taking our money,

677
00:44:20,847 --> 00:44:22,307
so what'll you do about that?

678
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:24,847
What'll happen if we post this on our website?

679
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:28,046
I suddenly want to find out.

680
00:44:28,847 --> 00:44:30,786
Don't do that. Sorry, forgive me.

681

See?

683
00:44:34,456 --> 00:44:37,756
Why bother getting on my nerves in the first place?

684
00:44:38,396 --> 00:44:40,196
- Will you keep doing it? - Yes.

685
00:44:40,197 --> 00:44:41,696
You morons. Darn you.

686
00:44:41,697 --> 00:44:43,936
Sorry. We take it back.

687
00:44:44,066 --> 00:44:45,795
- It's on you. - Sorry.

688
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:46,935
Hi, everyone.

689
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:49,537
Mone. Gosh, what's that?

690
00:44:49,876 --> 00:44:51,037
I haven't seen this before.

691
00:44:51,376 --> 00:44:52,376
It's a new release.

692
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:55,746
It's not yet available, but Mom sent it from the US.

693
00:44:55,747 --> 00:44:57,577
I'm so jealous of you.

694
00:44:58,017 --> 00:45:00,117
Do you like it? Do you want it?

695
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:01,986
Seriously? It's not even available yet.

696
00:45:02,657 --> 00:45:04,387
I can always ask Mom to send me another one.

697
00:45:05,256 --> 00:45:06,426
- No way. - How sweet of her.

698
00:45:06,427 --> 00:45:07,686
Hang on.

699
00:45:08,287 --> 00:45:09,926
Doesn't Suzy promote this?

700
00:45:09,927 --> 00:45:12,326
I thought the limited edition sold out.

701
00:45:12,327 --> 00:45:13,625
- Yes. - Where did you get this?

702
00:45:13,626 --> 00:45:14,767
Do this for me.

703
00:45:17,336 --> 00:45:19,335
- Look. - I'm so jealous.

704
00:45:19,336 --> 00:45:21,335
- Take a look. - Gosh.

705
00:45:21,336 --> 00:45:23,376
It suits you much better.

706
00:45:23,776 --> 00:45:25,907
I have one more. You can keep this.

707
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:28,045
I just love it.

708
00:45:28,046 --> 00:45:30,077
Don't you mind giving everything away?

709
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:32,545
I prefer sharing it with you.

710
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:35,416
- Gosh, how generous. - That's so nice.

711
00:45:35,787 --> 00:45:38,186
Silence. Get back to your seats.

712
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,557
You have a new classmate.

713
00:45:42,997 --> 00:45:46,166
You have a mock exam today, but please help her settle in.

714
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:48,066
- Introduce yourself. - Okay.

715
00:45:50,336 --> 00:45:53,166
Hi, everyone. I'm Bang Da Mi.

716
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:55,335
I used to attend Deokseon Girls' High School.

717
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,537
I've never been here, so I don't know anything.

718
00:45:57,936 --> 00:46:00,045
I hope we can all be friends.

719
00:46:00,046 --> 00:46:01,875
You did pretty well in that school.

720
00:46:01,876 --> 00:46:03,077
And in math too.

721
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:06,586
You all should study harder to keep your rank in class.

722
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:10,456
Where is Deokseon Girls' High?

723
00:46:10,956 --> 00:46:12,117
I've never heard of it before.

724
00:46:13,526 --> 00:46:15,525
Deokseon-myeon in Gyeonggi Province?

725
00:46:15,526 --> 00:46:16,597
It's not even a town.

726
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:18,456
Isn't that a real backward place?

727
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:21,697
You should've stayed there and gotten the local advantage.

728
00:46:22,296 --> 00:46:23,636
Why bother coming here?

729
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:25,565
Zero students from there went to Seoul National last year.

730
00:46:25,566 --> 00:46:26,767
My word.

731
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:28,806
They must all be dumb.

732
00:46:28,807 --> 00:46:29,906
Be quiet, all of you.

733
00:46:29,907 --> 00:46:32,477
- A school like that even exists? - That's insane.

734
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:45,016
Hey! You lunatic.

735
00:46:45,017 --> 00:46:47,726
- You're here early. - What time did I give you?

736
00:46:47,727 --> 00:46:49,355
I said to be here by ten. What kept you?

737
00:46:49,356 --> 00:46:52,556
Why are you taking out your anger at a patient...

738
00:46:52,557 --> 00:46:53,966
who can barely walk?

739
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:55,227
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

740
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:57,867
Pay up the 100,000 dollars you promised.

741
00:46:59,137 --> 00:47:00,367
I can't.

742
00:47:01,436 --> 00:47:02,436
(Seoul Haneul Hospital)

743
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:04,977
Pay up, you psycho.

744
00:47:08,247 --> 00:47:09,947
It's just your luck...

745
00:47:10,517 --> 00:47:14,186
that a security camera got a good shot of your face.

746
00:47:14,887 --> 00:47:16,517
Authorities identified you.

747
00:47:17,217 --> 00:47:18,255
(Wanted for Attempted Murder)

748
00:47:18,256 --> 00:47:20,686
They issued a BOLO for you.

749
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:25,157
Spend a few years in prison.

750
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:28,597
You dirtbag.

751
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:30,396
Isn't it for the better?

752
00:47:30,796 --> 00:47:33,306
You'll be reunited with Kang Ki Tak, the very guy you betrayed.

753
00:47:33,307 --> 00:47:36,206
You can reconcile over the dinner table.

754
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:39,977
My tummy hurts.

755
00:47:44,677 --> 00:47:46,185
My surgery was a success.

756
00:47:46,186 --> 00:47:48,086
I think you're mistaken.

757
00:47:48,986 --> 00:47:51,057
Do you think my boys won't come after you?

758
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:53,727
Boys!

759
00:47:54,526 --> 00:47:55,927
Get over here!

760
00:47:56,256 --> 00:47:57,597
What's up?

761
00:47:57,727 --> 00:47:59,125
Hey!

762
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,767
Can all you doctors please leave?

763
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,166
Should I tell you something funny?

764
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:10,537
The real loser here is you.

765
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:13,876
Your boys are my boys now.

766
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:17,747
Was this the plan from the start?

767
00:48:20,646 --> 00:48:23,557
You're all a load of traitors.

768
00:48:23,787 --> 00:48:25,057
Hey, you, scumbag.

769
00:48:25,617 --> 00:48:26,786
You can't do this to me.

770
00:48:26,787 --> 00:48:27,856
Do Hyuk.

771
00:48:28,787 --> 00:48:30,296
I don't want to hurt you.

772
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:33,025
Move it!

773
00:48:33,026 --> 00:48:34,596
Get him!

774
00:48:34,597 --> 00:48:35,696
- Hey. - Darn you.

775
00:48:35,697 --> 00:48:37,867
Hey, watch it!

776
00:48:38,066 --> 00:48:39,367
Careful!

777
00:48:41,566 --> 00:48:43,836
You can't even grab one guy?

778
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:51,946
Do Hyuk!

779
00:48:51,947 --> 00:48:53,947
Darn you!

780
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:56,556
Get him!

781
00:48:56,557 --> 00:48:58,485
Why can't you get just one guy?

782
00:48:58,486 --> 00:49:01,185
Hey, officer! Get over here!

783
00:49:01,186 --> 00:49:03,955
Get him! He's your guy!

784
00:49:03,956 --> 00:49:05,526
Where's he going?

785
00:49:05,657 --> 00:49:08,025
- Don't move! - He's insane.

786
00:49:08,026 --> 00:49:10,165
We're on the third floor, you psycho!

787
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:11,236
Get him!

788
00:49:18,537 --> 00:49:19,876
Go and get him!

789
00:49:22,747 --> 00:49:23,946
Let's go!

790
00:49:23,947 --> 00:49:25,217
- Go! - Hurry!

791
00:49:27,146 --> 00:49:28,347
- Stop! - Get him.

792
00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:33,387
- Get him! - Freeze!

793
00:49:33,756 --> 00:49:34,827
Darn it.

794
00:49:38,927 --> 00:49:41,166
Min Do Hyuk. Stop running.

795
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:45,236
- Darn it. - Hey, don't!

796
00:49:47,037 --> 00:49:48,066
What?

797
00:49:48,106 --> 00:49:49,977
Has he lost his mind?

798
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:13,497
Ms. Ko.

799
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:16,367
I think someone's cheating.

800
00:50:18,066 --> 00:50:20,506
Someone's cheating? Who?

801
00:50:20,836 --> 00:50:22,836
Check that pen.

802
00:50:25,436 --> 00:50:27,776
Is that true? Hand it over.

803
00:50:28,106 --> 00:50:30,116
- It's not. - Give me the pen.

804
00:50:30,117 --> 00:50:31,516
I said it wasn't.

805
00:50:31,517 --> 00:50:33,046
Then you can let me see it.

806
00:50:33,347 --> 00:50:35,017
- I said no. - Give it to me.

807
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:36,686
Darn it.

808
00:50:47,566 --> 00:50:48,767
There's no proof now.

809
00:50:49,396 --> 00:50:50,696
I didn't do anything.

810
00:50:50,697 --> 00:50:52,796
Swallowing that proves you were cheating.

811
00:50:53,836 --> 00:50:55,307
Tell me who wrote the note.

812
00:50:55,367 --> 00:50:57,376
Don't you know I'm 380th in the whole year?

813
00:50:58,336 --> 00:51:00,606
If I get the worst grades despite cheating,

814
00:51:01,276 --> 00:51:03,116
shouldn't you take pity on me?

815
00:51:03,117 --> 00:51:04,546
You're covering for someone, then.

816
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,586
Tell me who that is.

817
00:51:07,186 --> 00:51:09,416
You could get suspended if you don't tell.

818
00:51:11,256 --> 00:51:12,585
I don't want to tell.

819
00:51:12,586 --> 00:51:13,787
Wang Yu Jin!

820
00:51:14,256 --> 00:51:16,186
Hand in your paper and leave the classroom.

821
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,426
You'll get zero marks for this exam...

822
00:51:18,427 --> 00:51:19,996
and be prepared to be disciplined too.

823
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:21,166
Okay?

824
00:51:33,977 --> 00:51:36,005
I'm losing my mind I'm so annoyed.

825
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:38,146
How dare she rat us out like that?

826
00:51:39,177 --> 00:51:40,986
She was top of her class at Deokseon Girls' High.

827
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:44,057
How smart could she be if she grew up in the country?

828
00:51:44,157 --> 00:51:46,186
I could tell by her skirt length.

829
00:51:46,657 --> 00:51:48,057
She's a total outsider.

830
00:51:48,827 --> 00:51:49,927
Chief!

831
00:51:49,956 --> 00:51:51,996
I didn't give up to the end...

832
00:51:51,997 --> 00:51:54,367
who the pen was meant for.

833
00:51:54,697 --> 00:51:56,295
What about the next subject?

834
00:51:56,296 --> 00:51:58,336
The math girl got scared and backed out.

835
00:51:59,336 --> 00:52:02,306
Word will get out the moment Mone's grades drop.

836
00:52:02,307 --> 00:52:03,436
Go and tell her...

837
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,537
I'll pay 1,000 dollars per subject.

838
00:52:06,177 --> 00:52:08,375
- What? 1,000 dollars? - What? 1,000 dollars?

839
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:11,117
If she won't bite, go up to 1,500.

840
00:52:11,947 --> 00:52:13,915
What a great job this is.

841
00:52:13,916 --> 00:52:17,485
I'd work for you full-time if only my grades were good enough.

842
00:52:17,486 --> 00:52:18,616
Me too.

843
00:52:18,617 --> 00:52:21,657
I'll double your allowance.

844
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:27,696
Chief.

845
00:52:27,697 --> 00:52:30,037
You saw how I shielded you with my life.

846
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:32,066
I'm betting my life on you.

847
00:52:33,736 --> 00:52:35,906
As long as you don't betray me,

848
00:52:35,907 --> 00:52:37,606
I'll take you all the way.

849
00:52:38,177 --> 00:52:39,706
For the rest of our lives.

850
00:52:39,847 --> 00:52:41,375
Don't worry.

851
00:52:41,376 --> 00:52:42,806
We'll be sure...

852
00:52:42,807 --> 00:52:44,916
to get you into Korea National University of Arts.

853
00:52:45,146 --> 00:52:46,316
- Salute. - Salute.

854
00:52:47,717 --> 00:52:51,016
The crazy country bumpkin called Bang Da Mi.

855
00:52:51,017 --> 00:52:53,287
Shouldn't we put her in her place?

856
00:52:55,856 --> 00:52:57,057
Shall we...

857
00:52:58,597 --> 00:52:59,896
have some fun?

858
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:05,836
Who's that?

859
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:07,807
- Hello? - Come on out.

860
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:09,137
Are you all right?

861
00:53:11,137 --> 00:53:13,645
Hey, Deokseon Country.

862
00:53:13,646 --> 00:53:14,776
Hi.

863
00:53:17,517 --> 00:53:18,617
What was that?

864
00:53:18,776 --> 00:53:19,947
Did you just ignore me?

865
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:21,186
Hey.

866
00:53:21,617 --> 00:53:22,646
Hey.

867
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:25,355
Did your old school pay students...

868
00:53:25,356 --> 00:53:27,256
who ratted out the cheaters?

869
00:53:27,327 --> 00:53:30,657
Is it okay to threaten and hit others so you can cheat?

870
00:53:31,697 --> 00:53:33,827
You really are from a backward country.

871
00:53:36,736 --> 00:53:37,866
Let's play a game.

872
00:53:37,867 --> 00:53:40,205
- Hold her. - Don't! Leave me alone!

873
00:53:40,206 --> 00:53:42,036
- Keep still. - What are you doing?

874
00:53:42,037 --> 00:53:44,136
This is a Myeongju tradition.

875
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,346
We prepared a simple welcome ceremony.

876
00:53:47,347 --> 00:53:49,146
- Here I come! - Come on in!

877
00:53:51,276 --> 00:53:53,447
Okay, nice move.

878
00:53:55,546 --> 00:53:57,287
Do you think you scare me?

879
00:53:57,387 --> 00:53:59,416
Hey, hold her real tight.

880
00:53:59,856 --> 00:54:01,626
- Let go! - Keep still.

881
00:54:01,686 --> 00:54:03,557
I'll scar her face for good.

882
00:54:03,697 --> 00:54:05,827
- You should... - What do you think you're doing?

883
00:54:07,296 --> 00:54:08,697
Stop that right now.

884
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:10,697
Should I get the teacher?

885
00:54:11,037 --> 00:54:13,407
You got really lucky.

886
00:54:13,506 --> 00:54:14,705
If hadn't been for Mone,

887
00:54:14,706 --> 00:54:16,907
I'd have used this on you already.

888
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:19,336
Let's go.

889
00:54:23,316 --> 00:54:24,376
Are you okay?

890
00:54:28,686 --> 00:54:29,856
You must be so cold.

891
00:54:31,217 --> 00:54:33,017
- Here. - Thank you.

892
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:36,796
Are they the school bullies?

893
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:40,396
I don't know.

894
00:54:40,626 --> 00:54:42,326
I don't care about violence.

895
00:54:42,327 --> 00:54:44,836
What if they harass you for helping me?

896
00:54:46,467 --> 00:54:48,106
They can't touch me.

897
00:54:48,206 --> 00:54:50,907
I'll buy their silence with some rare accessories.

898
00:54:52,436 --> 00:54:53,847
We're in the same class.

899
00:54:53,977 --> 00:54:55,347
- My name's... - Han Mone.

900
00:54:56,006 --> 00:54:57,847
I saw you in a magazine.

901
00:55:05,586 --> 00:55:07,057
You're Bang Da Mi, right?

902
00:55:10,026 --> 00:55:11,296
Shall we be friends?

903
00:55:12,097 --> 00:55:13,227
You and me?

904
00:55:13,896 --> 00:55:14,997
Why?

905
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:24,637
(Deokseon Hair Salon)

906
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,787
Run away. Quickly.

907
00:55:37,186 --> 00:55:39,086
Hurry. Run away.

908
00:55:40,657 --> 00:55:42,255
Go, Do Hyuk.

909
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,356
Run away!

910
00:55:43,456 --> 00:55:44,996
Get out of here now!

911
00:55:44,997 --> 00:55:46,026
Run!

912
00:55:46,197 --> 00:55:47,597
- Ma'am, will you... - You can't go.

913
00:55:48,827 --> 00:55:50,197
- He's my boy. - There he is!

914
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:51,997
Leave my son alone!

915
00:55:53,506 --> 00:55:54,835
I'm innocent!

916
00:55:54,836 --> 00:55:55,935
I'm innocent!

917
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,076
Detective!

918
00:55:57,077 --> 00:55:59,577
- You're after the wrong person. - Let me go!

919
00:55:59,677 --> 00:56:01,876
Get out of here, Do Hyuk!

920
00:56:04,276 --> 00:56:06,247
- Min Do Hyuk! Stop! - Stop!

921
00:56:07,686 --> 00:56:09,617
- Min Do Hyuk! - Stop right there!

922
00:56:11,887 --> 00:56:12,887
Min Do Hyuk!

923
00:56:15,086 --> 00:56:16,125
Do Hyuk.

924
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:17,296
Get in here, quick!

925
00:56:23,796 --> 00:56:25,296
- He's gone. - Why are you...

926
00:56:25,436 --> 00:56:27,807
I'll lure them. Go the other way.

927
00:56:28,106 --> 00:56:30,236
I'm so sorry. How come...

928
00:56:30,407 --> 00:56:31,577
Get a grip.

929
00:56:31,836 --> 00:56:33,606
Do you want Mom to see you get arrested?

930
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,376
Don't get caught.

931
00:56:35,506 --> 00:56:37,117
Survive somehow and come see Mom.

932
00:56:41,717 --> 00:56:43,046
Wait, I...

933
00:56:44,517 --> 00:56:45,617
He's over there!

934
00:56:54,697 --> 00:56:55,896
Yang Jin Mo.

935
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:59,097
I swear I'll kill you.

936
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:11,046
Shall we leave?

937
00:57:18,816 --> 00:57:20,827
Mone, teach me how to dance.

938
00:57:20,956 --> 00:57:22,686
I want to dance for my grandpa.

939
00:57:24,026 --> 00:57:25,157
Watch, Grandpa.

940
00:57:28,267 --> 00:57:29,896
You're a great dancer.

941
00:57:30,137 --> 00:57:32,066
- Aren't I? - You are.

942
00:57:37,307 --> 00:57:38,637
Aren't I great?

943
00:57:39,907 --> 00:57:41,946
Yes, you're the best.

944
00:57:41,947 --> 00:57:43,517
Will you dance with me?

945
00:57:45,077 --> 00:57:46,177
Da Mi.

946
00:58:38,796 --> 00:58:39,867
Mone.

947
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:49,276
I swear I'll pass that audition.

948
00:58:50,717 --> 00:58:52,646
It's a drama about idol performers.

949
00:58:53,316 --> 00:58:54,815
They say if you debut in that,

950
00:58:54,816 --> 00:58:56,146
you'll be a star in no time.

951
00:58:56,646 --> 00:58:57,956
When is the audition?

952
00:58:59,117 --> 00:59:00,387
This Saturday.

953
00:59:00,856 --> 00:59:01,956
I feel so nervous.

954
00:59:02,856 --> 00:59:04,427
I'm sure you'll pass.

955
00:59:04,756 --> 00:59:06,827
Don't worry. I can vouch for you.

956
00:59:09,626 --> 00:59:10,767
Let's go outside.

957
00:59:10,867 --> 00:59:12,196
I want to take you somewhere.

958
00:59:12,197 --> 00:59:13,867
What? Where?

959
00:59:16,537 --> 00:59:17,677
Hurry up.

960
00:59:19,907 --> 00:59:20,977
Why are we here?

961
00:59:21,077 --> 00:59:22,907
Isn't everything here real expensive?

962
00:59:23,077 --> 00:59:24,447
How expensive could it be?

963
00:59:24,847 --> 00:59:28,247
- Why don't we shop and relax? - Yes.

964
00:59:32,456 --> 00:59:33,657
This is so cute.

965
00:59:39,526 --> 00:59:40,767
Can I try this on?

966
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:42,697
Yes, you can.

967
00:59:46,436 --> 00:59:48,267
- Here you go. - Thank you.

968
00:59:50,436 --> 00:59:51,736
Da Mi, try it on.

969
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:53,177
Me?

970
00:59:59,617 --> 01:00:01,186
It suits you so well.

971
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:05,316
This is why everything has its owner.

972
01:00:07,086 --> 01:00:08,586
Can I buy this for you?

973
01:00:09,787 --> 01:00:11,157
It's too expensive.

974
01:00:11,356 --> 01:00:13,157
No, thanks.

975
01:00:15,427 --> 01:00:17,165
I want to thank you...

976
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:19,066
for being a great friend to me.

977
01:00:25,006 --> 01:00:27,847
I'll get really upset if you don't accept it.

978
01:00:32,517 --> 01:00:35,787
I've never worn something from a luxury brand.

979
01:00:41,256 --> 01:00:43,657
Since it's a luxury item, you can wear it for a long time.

980
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:47,396
Promise you'll wear it every day.

981
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:49,497
I will. Thanks.

982
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,336
I won't lose it ever.

983
01:01:07,717 --> 01:01:09,247
(Bang Da Mi)

984
01:01:24,296 --> 01:01:25,537
The VIP suite.

985
01:01:26,236 --> 01:01:27,506
Here's the room key.

986
01:01:32,506 --> 01:01:33,605
Hello.

987
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:35,506
Which suite did the gentleman take?

988
01:01:35,577 --> 01:01:37,316
He left his phone in my cab.

989
01:01:37,376 --> 01:01:38,916
He's in suite 3803.

990
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:47,755
Let's take care of it somehow.

991
01:01:47,756 --> 01:01:48,986
There's still time.

992
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:55,197
Will you stop crying?

993
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:57,137
You're just as messed up.

994
01:01:58,296 --> 01:01:59,467
Room service.

995
01:02:00,336 --> 01:02:01,637
Did someone order something?

996
01:02:06,736 --> 01:02:08,046
Jin Mo, it's your day to die.

997
01:02:08,077 --> 01:02:09,247
Min Do Hyuk...

998
01:02:17,256 --> 01:02:18,456
Darn you.

999
01:02:18,816 --> 01:02:20,117
How have you been?

1000
01:02:22,057 --> 01:02:23,356
Have you been well?

1001
01:02:24,026 --> 01:02:25,197
What just happened?

1002
01:02:25,327 --> 01:02:26,597
Come here, you.

1003
01:02:39,876 --> 01:02:41,006
Let go!

1004
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:44,816
Hey!

1005
01:02:56,887 --> 01:02:58,327
Hurry up.

1006
01:03:27,227 --> 01:03:28,886
"Myeongju Girls' High School, Bang Da Mi."

1007
01:03:28,887 --> 01:03:29,986
(Bang Da Mi)

1008
01:03:30,526 --> 01:03:32,125
(Jo Su Ji)

1009
01:03:32,126 --> 01:03:33,796
(Filmed in Hawaii)

1010
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:38,566
(Power of Love)

1011
01:03:49,177 --> 01:03:50,177
Yes.

1012
01:03:51,017 --> 01:03:53,276
Tomorrow, at 6pm,

1013
01:03:53,816 --> 01:03:56,517
we'll have dinner with Da Mi.

1014
01:03:57,787 --> 01:03:58,856
Yes, Mr. Bang.

1015
01:03:59,356 --> 01:04:02,787
Let's finish up the investment plan.

1016
01:04:03,186 --> 01:04:04,256
Thank you.

1017
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:07,166
Thank you so much.

1018
01:04:08,327 --> 01:04:10,836
I'll have it ready.

1019
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:28,986
Ms. Oh.

1020
01:04:29,517 --> 01:04:30,617
Yes, Ms. Geum.

1021
01:04:31,217 --> 01:04:34,426
It's done. We'll have the funds soon.

1022
01:04:34,427 --> 01:04:36,356
Draft a contract and get Jo Su Ji.

1023
01:04:36,827 --> 01:04:38,896
Tell her we'll meet all her conditions.

1024
01:04:39,796 --> 01:04:41,066
Really?

1025
01:04:41,296 --> 01:04:43,466
Go ahead with Hawaii as the filming location as planned.

1026
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:44,697
Yes, Ms. Geum.

1027
01:04:46,736 --> 01:04:47,807
Yes!

1028
01:04:51,307 --> 01:04:53,105
I'm home.

1029
01:04:53,106 --> 01:04:55,506
Hey, you're home.

1030
01:04:57,146 --> 01:04:59,677
You're free tomorrow evening, aren't you?

1031
01:05:00,816 --> 01:05:04,286
I was thinking about going to Deokseon after school.

1032
01:05:04,287 --> 01:05:05,616
It's been a while since I've been there.

1033
01:05:05,617 --> 01:05:07,185
Your grandfather is coming over.

1034
01:05:07,186 --> 01:05:09,686
You have to be home before 6pm, no matter what.

1035
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:12,126
You can't be late.

1036
01:05:15,967 --> 01:05:17,537
Where did you get that hat?

1037
01:05:18,037 --> 01:05:20,706
A friend gave it to me.

1038
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:22,367
It suits you.

1039
01:05:41,356 --> 01:05:44,657
Ms. Ko, my mom bought this for you in America.

1040
01:05:48,727 --> 01:05:49,997
It's a bracelet.

1041
01:05:50,867 --> 01:05:52,436
It's their newest color.

1042
01:05:57,137 --> 01:06:00,376
But I can't take this. I'll get in trouble.

1043
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:03,307
Of course.

1044
01:06:10,247 --> 01:06:12,287
You never took it.

1045
01:06:12,657 --> 01:06:14,256
I'll throw the box away.

1046
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:17,396
Goodness. Look at you.

1047
01:06:18,396 --> 01:06:21,566
You cute little thing.

1048
01:06:23,427 --> 01:06:25,867
Diamonds suit you so well.

1049
01:06:28,006 --> 01:06:29,967
I almost forgot.

1050
01:06:31,276 --> 01:06:33,236
You're going to keep my secret, right?

1051
01:06:33,736 --> 01:06:34,776
Your secret?

1052
01:06:37,816 --> 01:06:40,416
Oh, your age?

1053
01:06:41,617 --> 01:06:43,387
That's not a big deal.

1054
01:06:43,847 --> 01:06:44,887
All right.

1055
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:03,166
Gosh, it's so pretty.

1056
01:07:04,876 --> 01:07:06,407
Da Mi!

1057
01:07:07,307 --> 01:07:08,706
Where are you, Da Mi?

1058
01:07:10,717 --> 01:07:13,176
- Da Mi. - Who are you, mister?

1059
01:07:13,177 --> 01:07:15,315
- Are you Bang Da Mi? - Do I look like I'm that outcast?

1060
01:07:15,316 --> 01:07:16,415
Get out of my way, then.

1061
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:17,916
Come out, Bang Da Mi!

1062
01:07:18,557 --> 01:07:19,686
Why are you looking for me?

1063
01:07:19,956 --> 01:07:21,327
I'm Bang Da Mi.

1064
01:07:21,956 --> 01:07:23,756
Did Bang Da Mi do something wrong?

1065
01:07:24,256 --> 01:07:25,956
- You stay out of this, lady. - Goodness.

1066
01:07:27,427 --> 01:07:28,697
Da Mi, don't you know who I am?

1067
01:07:28,867 --> 01:07:30,697
You pushed me and ran away at the hotel yesterday.

1068
01:07:31,537 --> 01:07:33,536
Hotel? Bang Da Mi was at a hotel?

1069
01:07:33,537 --> 01:07:36,537
Hey, you... Goodness, you're on a whole other level.

1070
01:07:36,736 --> 01:07:39,036
Me? I've never seen you before.

1071
01:07:39,037 --> 01:07:40,846
This is my first time seeing your face, too,

1072
01:07:40,847 --> 01:07:42,506
since you kept covering your face.

1073
01:07:43,546 --> 01:07:44,976
Right. This bobble hat.

1074
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,246
You had this over your head yesterday when you ran away.

1075
01:07:47,247 --> 01:07:48,247
Where's Yang Jin Mo?

1076
01:07:48,248 --> 01:07:50,085
I don't even know who that is!

1077
01:07:50,086 --> 01:07:51,186
Gosh, I...

1078
01:07:51,316 --> 01:07:53,855
Da Mi, I had my expectations before I came here.

1079
01:07:53,856 --> 01:07:55,956
But you seem much more wicked than I thought you'd be.

1080
01:07:56,086 --> 01:07:57,497
You leave me with no choice.

1081
01:07:58,296 --> 01:07:59,326
What is this?

1082
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:00,826
Look at this, everyone. What is it?

1083
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:01,896
(Bang Da Mi)

1084
01:08:02,267 --> 01:08:03,795
- What? - What's going on?

1085
01:08:03,796 --> 01:08:05,866
It says Myeongju Girls' High School, Bang Da Mi.

1086
01:08:05,867 --> 01:08:07,536
Isn't this yours?

1087
01:08:07,537 --> 01:08:10,137
Or are you saying there's someone else with the same name?

1088
01:08:10,236 --> 01:08:13,807
You dropped this at the Maple Hotel yesterday.

1089
01:08:14,376 --> 01:08:16,505
Hey, Bobble. Hey, Miss Bobble.

1090
01:08:16,506 --> 01:08:17,815
- "Bobble." - "Bobble."

1091
01:08:17,816 --> 01:08:19,445
What are you talking about?

1092
01:08:19,446 --> 01:08:22,415
I'm talking about calling your boyfriend whom you were with...

1093
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:24,186
at the hotel yesterday.

1094
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:25,256
Oh, my gosh.

1095
01:08:25,956 --> 01:08:28,356
What's going on? This is a school.

1096
01:08:28,357 --> 01:08:29,655
Please stop making a scene and leave.

1097
01:08:29,656 --> 01:08:31,356
Who is this? Are you a teacher?

1098
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,096
Yes. Don't do this here and get out.

1099
01:08:33,097 --> 01:08:35,296
- Come on... Hey! - Don't...

1100
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:38,796
Where do you think you're touching, you pervert?

1101
01:08:39,397 --> 01:08:41,607
Girls, call the police at once.

1102
01:08:41,706 --> 01:08:43,165
Catch him so he can't run away.

1103
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:45,137
- Hey, mister. - You pervert.

1104
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:52,946
Hello?

1105
01:08:53,246 --> 01:08:55,147
I'd like to report a wanted criminal.

1106
01:08:59,586 --> 01:09:02,326
(Bang Da Mi)

1107
01:09:03,187 --> 01:09:04,196
Hey, Mone.

1108
01:09:04,696 --> 01:09:06,357
Were you in Apgujeong last night?

1109
01:09:06,857 --> 01:09:07,926
What?

1110
01:09:07,927 --> 01:09:09,967
Well, I saw you in a sports car with a man.

1111
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,567
Are you dating him?

1112
01:09:12,967 --> 01:09:15,005
Hey, are you insane?

1113
01:09:15,006 --> 01:09:17,036
Why would she be in a car with a man?

1114
01:09:17,267 --> 01:09:20,307
You know how strict she is about maintaining her image.

1115
01:09:20,637 --> 01:09:23,545
I recognized you by your bobble hat.

1116
01:09:23,546 --> 01:09:25,115
Well, bobble hats are so common.

1117
01:09:25,116 --> 01:09:27,075
- Hey, you... - Watch your mouth.

1118
01:09:27,076 --> 01:09:28,316
Even I own a bobble hat.

1119
01:09:28,317 --> 01:09:30,146
- Hit her. I'll hold her. - I must have made a mistake.

1120
01:09:30,147 --> 01:09:32,717
- Gosh. - Watch what you say.

1121
01:09:33,887 --> 01:09:36,387
- Who's that? - Come on out.

1122
01:09:37,057 --> 01:09:38,125
Come on out.

1123
01:09:38,126 --> 01:09:39,326
Shall we be friends?

1124
01:09:39,857 --> 01:09:40,927
You and me?

1125
01:09:41,696 --> 01:09:42,727
Why?

1126
01:09:43,427 --> 01:09:46,336
You and I are similar in height and body type.

1127
01:09:47,506 --> 01:09:49,467
Okay, I choose you.

1128
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:51,706
(Bang Da Mi)

1129
01:09:55,177 --> 01:09:57,677
Promise you'll wear it every day.

1130
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:07,186
- Hey, Da Mi. - What?

1131
01:10:07,187 --> 01:10:09,526
Please tell your boyfriend...

1132
01:10:09,527 --> 01:10:11,396
that I'm going to kill him at all costs.

1133
01:10:11,397 --> 01:10:13,926
- Hurry up. - I can walk on my own.

1134
01:10:13,927 --> 01:10:15,865
Let go of me. Make sure you tell him.

1135
01:10:15,866 --> 01:10:18,165
- You pervert. - I said I could walk on my own.

1136
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:20,966
- Hurry up and get out of here. - Bye, pervert.

1137
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:23,107
- Goodness. - What's going on?

1138
01:10:23,206 --> 01:10:24,477
- See you later, pervert. - This is crazy.

1139
01:10:24,977 --> 01:10:26,277
Hey.

1140
01:10:27,036 --> 01:10:28,677
Who was that man who got arrested earlier?

1141
01:10:29,046 --> 01:10:31,847
Is he your sugar daddy?

1142
01:10:34,387 --> 01:10:37,116
That's insane.

1143
01:10:37,786 --> 01:10:41,527
How did a delinquent like you transfer to our school?

1144
01:10:41,956 --> 01:10:44,357
It was you, wasn't it? You guys set me up, didn't you?

1145
01:10:44,897 --> 01:10:46,356
Is this revenge?

1146
01:10:46,357 --> 01:10:48,067
- Me? - Me?

1147
01:10:48,496 --> 01:10:50,066
- Gosh. - I almost peed myself.

1148
01:10:50,067 --> 01:10:51,137
Hey, Bang Da Mi.

1149
01:10:52,036 --> 01:10:53,666
Ms. Ko wants to see you in the teachers' office.

1150
01:10:54,097 --> 01:10:55,406
I guess this proves it.

1151
01:10:57,706 --> 01:10:59,405
She said everyone needed to wait in class.

1152
01:10:59,406 --> 01:11:01,807
Dismissal time is postponed because of Bang Da Mi.

1153
01:11:04,647 --> 01:11:06,115
- This is so annoying. - What?

1154
01:11:06,116 --> 01:11:08,616
- I want to smack her. - It's not fair.

1155
01:11:12,616 --> 01:11:13,616
Yes, Mr. Yang.

1156
01:11:14,387 --> 01:11:16,656
I took care of the man.

1157
01:11:17,256 --> 01:11:18,397
You don't have to worry.

1158
01:11:58,866 --> 01:11:59,897
Is this the house?

1159
01:12:20,687 --> 01:12:21,727
Hello.

1160
01:12:24,156 --> 01:12:25,556
Welcome, Mr. Bang.

1161
01:12:25,557 --> 01:12:26,927
Yes.

1162
01:12:30,196 --> 01:12:31,397
Well...

1163
01:12:32,567 --> 01:12:34,406
Let's see here.

1164
01:12:40,307 --> 01:12:41,376
Watch your step.

1165
01:12:42,076 --> 01:12:43,107
Where's Da Mi?

1166
01:12:43,977 --> 01:12:46,545
Her classes must be ending a bit late.

1167
01:12:46,546 --> 01:12:48,017
She won't be late for dinner.

1168
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:53,887
This house is too big for two people.

1169
01:12:54,156 --> 01:12:56,387
It wasn't me. You have to believe me.

1170
01:12:56,487 --> 01:12:59,155
I've never been to a hotel, and I've never met that man before.

1171
01:12:59,156 --> 01:13:00,856
I'm telling the truth.

1172
01:13:00,857 --> 01:13:03,166
I can't help you if you keep lying.

1173
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,067
You have to tell the truth so I can at least try to fend for you.

1174
01:13:06,767 --> 01:13:07,836
Tell me.

1175
01:13:08,637 --> 01:13:12,076
Do you really have a sugar daddy these days?

1176
01:13:12,607 --> 01:13:14,777
You don't even want to believe me in the first place, do you?

1177
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:18,177
You're worried I might spill your secret.

1178
01:13:20,046 --> 01:13:21,086
Are you scared?

1179
01:13:23,647 --> 01:13:25,285
You insolent brat.

1180
01:13:25,286 --> 01:13:28,786
I heard you rode around in a sports car with a man.

1181
01:13:29,057 --> 01:13:30,625
A lot of girls saw you.

1182
01:13:30,626 --> 01:13:32,597
Who said that?

1183
01:13:35,626 --> 01:13:36,666
(Mother)

1184
01:13:38,897 --> 01:13:41,206
Answer me first. Now!

1185
01:13:57,116 --> 01:13:58,187
Not now.

1186
01:13:59,116 --> 01:14:00,616
The audition's tomorrow.

1187
01:14:03,586 --> 01:14:06,097
Just one more day.

1188
01:14:31,357 --> 01:14:33,416
(Art Room)

1189
01:15:19,496 --> 01:15:23,666
The investment you mentioned. Did you make your decision?

1190
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:26,035
While we wait,

1191
01:15:26,036 --> 01:15:28,977
may I give you a more detailed explanation, Mr. Bang?

1192
01:15:34,177 --> 01:15:35,246
Just a moment, please.

1193
01:15:41,756 --> 01:15:43,387
(Mother)

1194
01:16:42,517 --> 01:16:43,546
Well...

1195
01:17:13,317 --> 01:17:14,687
Oh, my gosh.

1196
01:17:17,147 --> 01:17:18,357
Mone.

1197
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:21,156
Da Mi.

1198
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,057
Da Mi.

1199
01:17:24,527 --> 01:17:25,796
Save me.

1200
01:17:30,866 --> 01:17:32,237
You're the only one...

1201
01:17:33,937 --> 01:17:35,267
who can help me right now.

1202
01:17:52,217 --> 01:17:54,217
- Goodness. - Dear me.

1203
01:17:59,196 --> 01:18:00,296
Mr. Bang.

1204
01:18:00,756 --> 01:18:03,326
- Are you okay? Are you hurt? - Mr. Bang.

1205
01:18:04,666 --> 01:18:05,795
Darn it.

1206
01:18:05,796 --> 01:18:06,896
Honey.

1207
01:18:06,897 --> 01:18:09,506
Slow down. You'll get wet in the rain.

1208
01:18:10,406 --> 01:18:11,506
Mr. Bang!

1209
01:18:11,977 --> 01:18:13,536
- Mr. Bang, wait! - No.

1210
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:15,177
Please wait just a little longer.

1211
01:18:15,307 --> 01:18:16,647
Da Mi will be here soon.

1212
01:18:16,746 --> 01:18:18,647
Just ten more minutes. No, five.

1213
01:18:18,977 --> 01:18:20,115
Please.

1214
01:18:20,116 --> 01:18:23,017
- Hey. Get out of my way. - Mr. Bang.

1215
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:24,416
I don't want to hear it.

1216
01:18:25,286 --> 01:18:27,987
This is nothing.

1217
01:18:31,996 --> 01:18:34,597
Mr. Bang...

1218
01:18:34,927 --> 01:18:36,466
Mr. Bang...

1219
01:18:36,467 --> 01:18:38,937
What's wrong with you? Move.

1220
01:18:40,567 --> 01:18:42,436
Mr. Bang. Please.

1221
01:18:42,437 --> 01:18:44,267
Mr. Bang...

1222
01:18:44,336 --> 01:18:46,437
Mr. Bang, please wait.

1223
01:18:49,277 --> 01:18:50,375
Mr. Bang, wait.

1224
01:18:50,376 --> 01:18:52,147
Mr. Bang!

1225
01:18:52,977 --> 01:18:54,177
Mr. Bang!

1226
01:19:03,456 --> 01:19:04,927
Bang Da Mi.

1227
01:19:07,456 --> 01:19:08,866
Bang Da Mi.

1228
01:19:12,366 --> 01:19:14,097
How dare you do this to me?

1229
01:19:22,147 --> 01:19:23,376
What happened?

1230
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,817
Did you give birth to this baby?

1231
01:19:25,876 --> 01:19:27,277
I didn't know...

1232
01:19:27,446 --> 01:19:28,817
I was pregnant.

1233
01:19:29,647 --> 01:19:30,916
I tried to get an abortion,

1234
01:19:31,387 --> 01:19:32,557
but they told me it was too late.

1235
01:19:33,317 --> 01:19:34,487
What am I going to do?

1236
01:19:35,427 --> 01:19:36,727
What should I do?

1237
01:19:37,256 --> 01:19:38,427
Let's go to the hospital.

1238
01:19:38,826 --> 01:19:40,125
We have to go to the hospital.

1239
01:19:40,126 --> 01:19:41,256
I can't.

1240
01:19:42,267 --> 01:19:43,927
If this gets out, I'll be doomed.

1241
01:19:44,737 --> 01:19:46,637
You know my audition is tomorrow.

1242
01:19:47,296 --> 01:19:50,736
You know how hard I pushed myself for this.

1243
01:19:50,737 --> 01:19:52,776
You can't do the audition in this state.

1244
01:19:52,777 --> 01:19:53,937
Yes, I can.

1245
01:19:54,277 --> 01:19:56,046
I'm going to do it even if it kills me.

1246
01:19:57,006 --> 01:19:59,746
Nobody can know I had a baby.

1247
01:20:00,576 --> 01:20:01,616
Da Mi.

1248
01:20:01,817 --> 01:20:03,647
I'll be fine as long as you keep quiet. Please?

1249
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:07,656
What if something bad happens to both you and the baby?

1250
01:20:08,527 --> 01:20:10,857
I'll go and bring the school nurse.

1251
01:20:12,256 --> 01:20:13,496
I'll kill myself.

1252
01:20:15,496 --> 01:20:16,796
If you tell anyone,

1253
01:20:16,996 --> 01:20:19,036
I'll just die here with the baby.

1254
01:20:19,336 --> 01:20:20,666
Do you want me to die?

1255
01:20:20,866 --> 01:20:21,967
Is that it?

1256
01:20:25,206 --> 01:20:26,476
Choose.

1257
01:20:26,477 --> 01:20:28,177
Whether I live or die...

1258
01:20:29,746 --> 01:20:31,277
is up to you right now.

1259
01:20:36,786 --> 01:20:37,946
What...

1260
01:20:39,187 --> 01:20:40,656
What do I have to do?

1261
01:20:43,427 --> 01:20:44,926
Hurry up.

1262
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:46,026
I don't want to clean up.

1263
01:20:46,027 --> 01:20:47,695
- You're going to do it right? - We can make them do it for us.

1264
01:20:47,696 --> 01:20:48,996
What do you want to eat after?

1265
01:20:52,536 --> 01:20:54,366
Meet me at the park behind the school.

1266
01:20:55,006 --> 01:20:56,866
You can't get caught by anyone.

1267
01:20:57,237 --> 01:20:58,376
Go. Quickly.

1268
01:20:59,876 --> 01:21:01,477
Hurry up. Go.

1269
01:21:21,567 --> 01:21:23,927
I can't get caught.

1270
01:21:29,906 --> 01:21:31,436
- Come on. - Let's hurry up.

1271
01:21:31,437 --> 01:21:32,576
- Come on. - Gosh.

1272
01:21:33,376 --> 01:21:35,876
Why did she let us out so late? I'm so tired.

1273
01:21:37,076 --> 01:21:38,415
Hey, we don't have to do a thorough job.

1274
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:40,517
Ms. Ko won't even check.

1275
01:21:42,717 --> 01:21:43,887
- Hey. - Goodness.

1276
01:21:44,187 --> 01:21:45,455
What is that smell?

1277
01:21:45,456 --> 01:21:47,416
Right. Doesn't it smell like blood?

1278
01:21:47,687 --> 01:21:49,285
Hey, hurry up and open the windows.

1279
01:21:49,286 --> 01:21:51,187
- Quickly. - Hurry.

1280
01:21:56,767 --> 01:21:58,097
When did you get here, Mone?

1281
01:21:58,196 --> 01:21:59,637
I didn't see you earlier during dismissal time.

1282
01:21:59,767 --> 01:22:00,796
What?

1283
01:22:01,807 --> 01:22:04,266
I was in the dance room, practicing for my audition.

1284
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:06,637
Hey, it smells weird in here, doesn't it? Gosh.

1285
01:22:08,036 --> 01:22:09,147
I'm not sure.

1286
01:22:09,677 --> 01:22:12,076
Hey, look. Blood.

1287
01:22:12,977 --> 01:22:14,046
What is that?

1288
01:22:16,746 --> 01:22:17,786
Wait.

1289
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:19,687
On our way over here,

1290
01:22:20,156 --> 01:22:22,256
- didn't you hear something strange? - Yes.

1291
01:22:22,887 --> 01:22:23,987
Hey.

1292
01:22:24,527 --> 01:22:25,557
Maybe...

1293
01:22:26,156 --> 01:22:27,696
there was a murder.

1294
01:22:27,796 --> 01:22:29,526
- Stop. - What are we going to do?

1295
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:30,826
No.

1296
01:22:30,967 --> 01:22:32,536
I definitely heard a baby crying.

1297
01:22:35,866 --> 01:22:38,737
Someone had a baby here.

1298
01:22:51,187 --> 01:22:52,256
Hey.

1299
01:22:52,656 --> 01:22:53,686
Look over there.

1300
01:22:53,687 --> 01:22:55,727
- What? - What is it?

1301
01:22:56,527 --> 01:22:58,256
- What? - Who's that?

1302
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:01,255
That's a long skirt. Isn't that Bobble?

1303
01:23:01,256 --> 01:23:03,126
It is. It's Bang Da Mi.

1304
01:23:03,996 --> 01:23:05,666
Where is she running off to in this rain?

1305
01:23:05,866 --> 01:23:08,505
We were dismissed because of her, and she's playing hooky.

1306
01:23:08,506 --> 01:23:09,836
Should we go after her?

1307
01:23:09,866 --> 01:23:12,177
What's that in her arms, though?

1308
01:23:13,607 --> 01:23:14,737
What?

1309
01:23:15,906 --> 01:23:17,046
This bobble hat.

1310
01:23:17,506 --> 01:23:18,746
It belongs to Bang Da Mi, right?

1311
01:23:19,277 --> 01:23:21,317
Bang Da Mi was in the art room?

1312
01:23:21,687 --> 01:23:22,987
Hey, this is hers, right? It's her hat.

1313
01:23:23,616 --> 01:23:25,656
Did Bang Da Mi...

1314
01:23:25,786 --> 01:23:27,816
- No way. - I think she did.

1315
01:23:27,817 --> 01:23:28,857
Hey!

1316
01:23:44,267 --> 01:23:46,107
- What am I going to do? - Your grandfather is coming over.

1317
01:23:46,137 --> 01:23:48,506
You have to be home before 6pm, no matter what.

1318
01:23:48,977 --> 01:23:50,307
You can't be late.

1319
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:53,847
Oh, my gosh. What should I do?

1320
01:23:56,317 --> 01:23:57,446
Da Mi!

1321
01:23:57,887 --> 01:23:59,057
Mone.

1322
01:23:59,116 --> 01:24:01,187
Mone, what should I do? The baby isn't crying.

1323
01:24:01,387 --> 01:24:04,357
I think it's breathing, but it won't cry.

1324
01:24:04,756 --> 01:24:06,557
- What? - Oh, my gosh.

1325
01:24:08,196 --> 01:24:09,625
It's not too late to go to the hospital.

1326
01:24:09,626 --> 01:24:11,796
What if the baby dies?

1327
01:24:12,137 --> 01:24:13,536
Nobody's going to die.

1328
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:16,506
Don't worry about it and go.

1329
01:24:17,336 --> 01:24:19,376
- What am I supposed to do? - Stay out of it!

1330
01:24:20,937 --> 01:24:22,006
You...

1331
01:24:22,777 --> 01:24:24,807
better not say a word about what happened today.

1332
01:24:25,347 --> 01:24:26,977
You didn't see anything.

1333
01:24:27,517 --> 01:24:29,647
For the rest of your life, don't act like you know about this,

1334
01:24:29,746 --> 01:24:31,416
don't even be curious about it,

1335
01:24:31,517 --> 01:24:32,687
and don't even ask questions.

1336
01:24:33,387 --> 01:24:34,557
Got it?

1337
01:24:35,187 --> 01:24:36,256
Mone.

1338
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:40,256
Mone.

1339
01:24:40,857 --> 01:24:42,166
Mone!

1340
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:52,607
(Mother)

1341
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,536
Oh, no.

1342
01:25:15,927 --> 01:25:17,097
Mom.

1343
01:25:28,237 --> 01:25:29,376
Mom.

1344
01:25:32,616 --> 01:25:34,246
Once could be a mistake.

1345
01:25:35,086 --> 01:25:36,785
But I won't allow a second one.

1346
01:25:36,786 --> 01:25:37,987
That's my rule.

1347
01:25:42,156 --> 01:25:43,557
Mom.

1348
01:25:44,387 --> 01:25:46,626
Why are you being like this?

1349
01:25:48,567 --> 01:25:50,897
Why? Do you want to tell on me to your parents?

1350
01:25:51,296 --> 01:25:52,496
Do you want to go back to them?

1351
01:25:53,567 --> 01:25:54,836
Then go.

1352
01:25:57,307 --> 01:25:59,437
But do you think they'll just be glad to have you back?

1353
01:25:59,677 --> 01:26:01,746
When you're sick? With all the money you cost them?

1354
01:26:02,477 --> 01:26:04,176
Think about the money they've spent because of you all this time.

1355
01:26:04,177 --> 01:26:05,646
The money they'll have to spend even more from now on.

1356
01:26:05,647 --> 01:26:06,875
How much poorer will they become...

1357
01:26:06,876 --> 01:26:08,416
for a kid they didn't even give birth to?

1358
01:26:08,987 --> 01:26:10,187
Don't you think they'll be afraid?

1359
01:26:10,647 --> 01:26:13,256
Later on, they'll hate you, resent you,

1360
01:26:13,357 --> 01:26:15,557
and painfully regret ever bringing you home.

1361
01:26:16,586 --> 01:26:18,956
You said you wanted to repay your parents.

1362
01:26:18,996 --> 01:26:20,755
You said you wanted to make them happy.

1363
01:26:20,756 --> 01:26:22,365
You said that was your dream.

1364
01:26:22,366 --> 01:26:24,696
Then you should have followed my rule.

1365
01:26:35,147 --> 01:26:36,277
What...

1366
01:26:37,107 --> 01:26:39,746
What do I have to do?

1367
01:26:45,456 --> 01:26:47,487
Run to your grandfather right now.

1368
01:26:48,656 --> 01:26:50,527
Beg him or implore him.

1369
01:26:51,086 --> 01:26:52,527
Make your grandfather change his mind.

1370
01:26:56,166 --> 01:26:57,967
Until you do, don't even think about coming home.

1371
01:26:58,996 --> 01:27:00,137
Go.

1372
01:27:00,937 --> 01:27:02,107
Now!

1373
01:27:07,977 --> 01:27:10,107
Mom...

1374
01:27:51,217 --> 01:27:54,116
(The Escape of the Seven)

1375
01:27:54,387 --> 01:27:56,486
Is it true that you abandoned Da Mi, and you didn't lose her?

1376
01:27:56,487 --> 01:27:58,155
So? Did she die?

1377
01:27:58,156 --> 01:27:59,295
She's alive and well.

1378
01:27:59,296 --> 01:28:01,526
Why don't I paint a nice picture? It's been a while.

1379
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:03,695
- Bang Da Mi? - Yes, Bang Da Mi.

1380
01:28:03,696 --> 01:28:06,696
It's gone viral.

1381
01:28:07,597 --> 01:28:08,807
It wasn't her?

1382
01:28:09,006 --> 01:28:12,177
I'm going to do whatever it takes to be the most famous star in Korea.

1383
01:28:12,206 --> 01:28:13,306
Do you want to work with me?

1384
01:28:13,307 --> 01:28:14,375
This is unfair.

1385
01:28:14,376 --> 01:28:15,906
I just made one mistake.

1386
01:28:16,046 --> 01:28:18,347
The truth is what the world believes.

1387
01:28:18,406 --> 01:28:20,017
Then just die.
