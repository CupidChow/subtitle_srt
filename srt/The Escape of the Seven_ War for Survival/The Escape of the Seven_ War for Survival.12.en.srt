Kang Ki Tak...

14
00:01:23,468 --> 00:01:24,598
Why are you...

15
00:01:25,428 --> 00:01:26,598
How did you come here?

16
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:30,238
Do Hyuk.

17
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:34,537
Are you awake?

18
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:36,137
Can you recognize me?

19
00:01:39,477 --> 00:01:40,518
Min Do Hyuk?

20
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:44,488
K did this, didn't he?

21
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:46,218
Ki Tak...

22
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:49,387
Wait just a little longer. The ambulance will be here soon.

23
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:50,887
I'll save you.

24
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:52,586
Going in! Where is the patient?

25
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:53,857
- Let's go. - This way. Over here.

26
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:54,928
This way.

27
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:57,797
- What happened? - He was stabbed by a weapon.

28
00:01:57,798 --> 00:01:59,026
I applied first aid,

29
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:00,867
but the bleeding won't stop, and he's not in good shape.

30
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:09,178
All right. This way.

31
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:13,377
K did this?

32
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:15,948
You should come along too.

33
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:23,117
Let's get going.

34
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:31,467
(Highest Hospital, Emergency Room)

35
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:43,478
What happened? Where is Do Hyuk?

36
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,847
He's in surgery.

37
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:47,817
K called me on Do Hyuk's phone.

38
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:49,447
He said I should come to Sungchan Group's storage unit...

39
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:50,518
if I wanted to save him.

40
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:53,147
That crazy jerk...

41
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:05,198
Why are you here?

42
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,267
She was in K's hideout, so I brought her here.

43
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:10,768
Why didn't you mention that?

44
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:13,367
Why did you go there?

45
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:14,776
Did K call you there?

46
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,806
Or did you go there to beg for your life from him?

47
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:19,246
Did you watch Min Do Hyuk get tortured and enjoy it? Did you?

48
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:20,347
No.

49
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:23,376
I didn't see anything.

50
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:25,017
You wouldn't have gone there without any reason!

51
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:26,087
K...

52
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:28,657
I went there to find K.

53
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:30,828
I wanted to see with my own eyes...

54
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:33,828
and report back to you.

55
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,396
Don't lie.

56
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:37,496
You were trying to help K and kill Do Hyuk, weren't you?

57
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:39,627
You were already in league with K!

58
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:43,298
Calm down.

59
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:45,867
We will find out the truth when Do Hyuk wakes up.

60
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,537
Don't try to defend her.

61
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:49,437
Do Hyuk might die!

62
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:07,858
Have you still not come to your senses?

63
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:10,197
Tomorrow is the first shoot. Why do you look like that?

64
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:12,097
You seem so laid back.

65
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:15,238
You're having so much fun with this darned doll party, aren't you?

66
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,208
It's all in the script.

67
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,807
Everything that I did to Da Mi. All of it!

68
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:21,677
We already discussed this.

69
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,478
This nightmare will only end once I die.

70
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:27,648
Fine. Then I'll just die.

71
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,246
What are you doing?

72
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,488
Don't mind me. I'll just scratch up my face.

73
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:35,918
Then I wouldn't have to shoot the movie.

74
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:38,928
Fine. Go ahead if you want to. I won't stop you.

75
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:47,496
Stop acting like a child.

76
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,338
Just don't get caught that you're seeing K.

77
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:53,478
Did you tail me again?

78
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:57,907
Making someone sick and tired of you is quite a skill too, you know.

79
00:04:57,908 --> 00:04:59,478
What did you talk about with K?

80
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,848
Did you ask him to kill Min Do Hyuk?

81
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:05,447
What do you mean, Min Do Hyuk?

82
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,887
Min Do Hyuk was attacked by K today.

83
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:10,117
At the hideout where you met K.

84
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:13,728
It wasn't me.

85
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:15,997
So, did he die?

86
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:18,266
K isn't human.

87
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,067
He doesn't have any mercy or compassion.

88
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:23,136
Abandon any hope that K will help you survive.

89
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:25,338
Then who will help me?

90
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,237
Until the movie shoot ends,

91
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:28,506
Matthew can't kill us, at least.

92
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:29,806
For TIKITAKA too.

93
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:32,608
Do you think Matthew even cares about TIKITAKA?

94
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,278
He's crazy about revenge.

95
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:37,348
If circumstances change, so do people.

96
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:40,088
Matthew is different from Lee Hwi So.

97
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:44,158
TIKITAKA's assets are a whopping 20 billion dollars.

98
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,928
He has become a rich man who has the financial world in his hands.

99
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:49,027
Would he really give up all the luck he can have for life...

100
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:51,098
over some mere revenge?

101
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:56,838
Gosh.

102
00:05:57,437 --> 00:06:00,678
Our CEO sure has all the confidence in the world.

103
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:06,946
Don't ever lose Matthew's trust.

104
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:09,047
In order to do that, you will have to act with all you've got.

105
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:10,718
That is the goal...

106
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:14,288
we must achieve in this war.

107
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:24,267
You'll protect me, right?

108
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,598
Answer me.

109
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:29,937
If you abandon me too, I will really die.

110
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,267
I will have to die at the hands of Lee Hwi So.

111
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:34,978
Then...

112
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:38,207
die.

113
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:41,918
Do you know what makes me feel sick the most?

114
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,348
Being clingy by bringing up the past.

115
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:48,288
Can't you be a bit more nonchalant now?

116
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:52,627
Everything about you is awful, but that's the most awful.

117
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,398
Go and beg for your life somewhere else.

118
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:04,807
That piece of trash.

119
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:20,988
Do Hyuk.

120
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:25,528
Are you okay?

121
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:27,228
Are you fully awake?

122
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:32,528
Why did you go to Sungchan on your own? That was a rash move.

123
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:35,567
K paid condolence money with a forged 100,000-dollar check.

124
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,238
How could he sit still while knowing that?

125
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:42,206
Thank goodness he missed your vital organs.

126
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:43,608
We almost lost to K once again.

127
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:46,446
If we lose Do Hyuk too, what good is our plan?

128
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:48,117
It'll all be for nothing.

129
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:51,088
I'm still alive.

130
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:53,048
I'm fine.

131
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:57,788
I wanted to see it clearly with my own eyes.

132
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:00,997
That devil...

133
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,298
put me in this state.

134
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:09,668
I can still remember it clearly.

135
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:12,567
K's chilling voice.

136
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:16,108
What did K say?

137
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:19,978
That his father was on his side.

138
00:08:21,678 --> 00:08:22,817
Promise me first.

139
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:25,148
That you won't do anything rash.

140
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:27,057
You can only take revenge if you are alive.

141
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:30,158
You really don't have to worry.

142
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:33,187
I swore to you.

143
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:36,857
That I will join you...

144
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:39,368
until K and Sungchan Group go down.

145
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:44,307
I don't want to lose any more precious people.

146
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:46,037
Let's go to my place right now.

147
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:47,836
He has to stay at the hospital for the time being.

148
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:49,237
He needs to receive further treatment.

149
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:51,107
It's dangerous here.

150
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,707
His discharge is being processed.

151
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:54,217
Don't be stubborn about this.

152
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:56,147
I can stay with him.

153
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:59,018
And if K comes back, will you take responsibility?

154
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:20,138
I've been waiting for you, sir.

155
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:22,677
He's my personal doctor.

156
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:25,477
He'll help you with treatment and rehabilitation 24-7.

157
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:28,446
And you can stay in my room for the time being.

158
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:29,717
I'll stay in the guest room.

159
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:31,047
You don't have to do this.

160
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,787
I feel like such an imposition.

161
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,257
Had I known, I would've just stayed at the hospital.

162
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:36,788
Please listen to your older brother.

163
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:39,388
"Older brother?"

164
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:46,566
Gosh. That's a nice thing to hear.

165
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:48,237
I was once an older brother myself.

166
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:51,736
Hey, I'll listen to you well from now on.

167
00:09:51,737 --> 00:09:54,577
Can't you lighten up a little?

168
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:59,408
Please. Okay?

169
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:06,148
Hey, look at me. Try smiling prettily like me.

170
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:07,487
Like this.

171
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:12,888
Okay. Relax here like this is your own place.

172
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:15,827
Do Hyuk.

173
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:18,697

was in an adulterous relationship with a high school student...

183
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:52,528
Do you expect me to believe that nonsense?

184
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:54,868
It's all absolutely true.

185
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:56,337
You remember...

186
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:59,107
the Bobble case that turned the whole country upside down...

187
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,508
five years ago, don't you?

188
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:03,878
The people in that case are Sim Jun Seok and Han Mone.

189
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:05,977
And Sim Jun Seok's alias is...

190
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:07,518
K.

191
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:09,548
"K?"

192
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:14,288
What is it that you want?

193
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:15,457
The truth.

194
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,288
I want to reveal to the whole world...

195
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:20,797
that Han Mone and Sim Jun Seok are...

196
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:22,327
fooling everyone with their lies.

197
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:25,128
What are you doing...

198
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:27,898
Where is your son?

199
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:29,898
Bring Sim Jun Seok here now.

200
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:31,268
Who are you?

201
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:33,467
Why did you kill my family?

202
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,607
K...

203
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,607
Bring me your son.

204
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:47,148
Did you ask to see me, sir?

205
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:54,557
You knew about Jun Seok's antics, didn't you?

206
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:57,268
The fact that Jun Seok is K!

207
00:11:57,998 --> 00:11:59,227
I had no idea.

208
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:02,737
I just thought they were rumours made up by TIKITAKA.

209
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:04,107
But when I looked into it,

210
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,937
the young man who went on a rampage earlier...

211
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:08,577
was also Chairman Lee's right hand man.

212
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,138
Why on earth would he do such a thing?

213
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:14,248
TIKITAKA challenged Sungchan Group from the beginning.

214
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,517
They suddenly jumped into the instant messenger business...

215
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:19,186
and took Sungchan's user base away.

216
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:20,757
And now, they even branched out into movies...

217
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:22,288
and are threatening Sungchan.

218
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:25,827
It is certain that Chairman Lee is targeting Sungchan.

219
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:31,567
Matthew Lee.

220
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,668
Who on earth is he?

221
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:37,807
Did you find out what his henchman's name is?

222
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:39,837
Min Do Hyuk.

223
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:41,538
That's his name.

224
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:45,648
Min Do Hyuk.

225
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:32,158
Matthew!

226
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:35,557
Matthew.

227
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:36,798
Matthew!

228
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,898
Do Hyuk, what's wrong?

229
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,368
What's going on?

230
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,368
K appeared.

231
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:48,237
K?

232
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:51,007
No one can sneak in here.

233
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:52,306
No, I saw him.

234
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:53,946
I really saw him.

235
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:55,118
What's wrong?

236
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:56,477
Dr. Heo.

237
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:58,148
Was there perhaps an intruder?

238
00:13:58,288 --> 00:13:59,388
No, not at all.

239
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:02,957
I thought he was deeply asleep, so I went to grab some medicine.

240
00:14:03,118 --> 00:14:04,927
I think the strong pain medication must have given him...

241
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,827
delirious symptoms.

242
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:09,028
There was a man with a mask on his face...

243
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,028
Just think about your health right now.

244
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,727
Let's go over there and sit.

245
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:18,638
It's best not to move today in case of infections.

246
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:20,207
There.

247
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:24,207
Matthew.

248
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:27,878
I feel like K is toying with me.

249
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:31,317
Just like how he appeared at my mom's funeral five years ago.

250
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,717
He avoided stabbing me in the vital organs on purpose today.

251
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:35,757
He could've killed me if he wanted to.

252
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:36,888
But he didn't kill me.

253
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:39,928
I'm so confused too.

254
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,158
I feel like I'm being ridiculed.

255
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:45,567
I'm not even sure who's on my side and who's my enemy anymore.

256
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:47,398
I can't trust anyone.

257
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:49,467
Matthew, what's wrong?

258
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:51,707
There's something I don't know, isn't there?

259
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:55,537
No, it's nothing. Let's go back to bed.

260
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:56,837
Hang on.

261
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:58,547
Why are you acting like this?

262
00:14:58,548 --> 00:14:59,976
You said you'd share everything with me.

263
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:02,477
Then you should keep any secrets from me.

264
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:09,357
He's wavering.

265
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:11,528
CEO Kang.

266
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:13,356
Who is making Ki Tak waver?

267
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:15,597
Geum La Hui went to K's hideout last time.

268
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:18,167
But still, CEO Kang didn't even ask her any questions.

269
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,226
Those two...

270
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:20,597
have known each other for over 20 years.

271
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:23,897
I'm afraid that CEO Kang will end up being used.

272
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:26,436
Matthew, no, this isn't right. I trust Ki Tak.

273
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,378
He would never let us down.

274
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:30,847
Don't you get why I pushed forward with getting engaged to Geum La Hui?

275
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:32,907
In case CEO Kang has any other ideas.

276
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:34,817
No, this is a misunderstanding.

277
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:37,517
Those two were finished a long time ago.

278
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:39,647
Geum La Hui was the reason why CEO Kang left his gang...

279
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:40,918
and set foot in the entertainment industry.

280
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,357
He wanted to be of help to that woman in any way.

281
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:44,957
Luka.

282
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:46,557
Yes, sir.

283
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:48,398
Show me Kang Ki Tak.

284
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,138
That's...

285
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:01,937
I couldn't help but plant...

286
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:03,638
a tracking device on him.

287
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:06,577
No one knows who Chairman Sim Yong...

288
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:07,977
extended his hand to.

289
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:10,778
Do you mean...

290
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:13,716
Sungchan and Ki Tak...

291
00:16:13,717 --> 00:16:14,888
have joined hands?

292
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:17,018
To be frank,

293
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:19,888
CEO Kang has nothing to do with Da Mi.

294
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:22,557
And yet, he has Mr. Bang's entire fortune in his hands.

295
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:25,096
Don't trust anyone right now, not even me.

296
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:26,428
Suspect everyone again and again.

297
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:28,268
The only thing we can trust now...

298
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,538
is what we can see.

299
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:39,947
(Dual Sonic)

300
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:43,918
Is it true that Min Do Hyuk was attacked?

301
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:45,518
How is he now?

302
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:47,857
That thug, Min Do Hyuk was attacked?

303
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:50,057
By who? It wasn't K, was it?

304
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,687
K is right at our doorstep.

305
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:55,258
There's no time to dawdle.

306
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,827
Starting with the movie's crank-in today,

307
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:00,227
our plan will start in earnest too.

308
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,038
You have an interview this evening.

309
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:09,338
Memorize that thoroughly...

310
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,108
and answer the reporters exactly as it says on there.

311
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:15,217
Yang Jin Mo.

312
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,848
When this becomes a hot issue online after the interview,

313
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:20,517
make a bigger issue out of it by posting comments.

314
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:23,517
We must make Sungchan look like scumbags in a short amount of time.

315
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:26,526
Manipulating public opinions is Yang Jin Mo's specialty.

316
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,527
This is practically like donating your talent.

317
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,867
Ms. Go, you should find out all the titles of the artwork...

318
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,638
in Sungchan Gallery's VIP Room.

319
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,178
Your mission is to film it in a video.

320
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:42,236
But...

321
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:44,547
Why is my mission the hardest of all?

322
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:46,776
Not even the gallery director's closest friends have seen...

323
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:48,147
the VIP Room.

324
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:50,776
How can a newbie like me get in there?

325
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:53,887
The director lives with the key in her hand all the time.

326
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:55,857
Why do you have so much to say?

327
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:57,687
What's so hard about stealing a single key?

328
00:17:58,027 --> 00:17:59,257
What should I do?

329
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,428
Should I date Chairman Sim or something?

330
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:08,898
Chairman Sim is cold-hearted and logical to a fault.

331
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:10,537
He has a heart condition,

332
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:12,236
so he has relied on herbal medicine that suppresses his emotions...

333
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:13,308
for a long time.

334
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:15,077
You have to make that man...

335
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:16,678
get as excited as possible.

336
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:19,977
Switch out his medicine or something. Just find a way.

337
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:21,318
But...

338
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:24,888
I don't know anything about herbal tonics. How can I pull that off?

339
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:26,647
There are so many people watching in that house.

340
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,686
They have dozens of security cameras too.

341
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:30,957
If it was an easy task, I wouldn't even ask you to do it.

342
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:32,986
And you, Nam Chul Woo.

343
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,627
Continue to provoke Chairman Sim.

344
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:35,957
Pull him into this fight.

345
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:37,457
As soon as possible.

346
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:39,497
You have 32 hours.

347
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:42,368
Every mission should be completed by 6pm tomorrow.

348
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,568
This is...

349
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:45,967
This is not fair.

350
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:47,337
Some of us...

351
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:49,437
are physically fighting and putting our lives on the line.

352
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:52,148
But all these three have to do is act gracious and eat at the table...

353
00:18:52,277 --> 00:18:54,317
that others have set for them.

354
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:56,418
Is anyone here in greater danger than I am?

355
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,088
You guys are just regular people,

356
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,058
but I'm a famous actress.

357
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,817
I have to risk my face and career in front of the public.

358
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:04,927
So,

359
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:07,088
who told you to live like that when you're a famous actress?

360
00:19:07,588 --> 00:19:09,627
If Mone's past is revealed, Ms. Geum and I will be ruined...

361
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:11,726
for helping cover things up too.

362
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,168
This is a ridiculous mission.

363
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:16,168
I've already hit rock bottom. It can't get any worse.

364
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:18,568
My Erica can't even go to kindergarten these days.

365
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:21,036
Do you know how sorry I feel for that little girl?

366
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:23,506
Why must I understand all that?

367
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:25,108
Who asked you to understand?

368
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:26,578
- All of you! - I mean...

369
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:31,088
You must still feel pretty decent,

370
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,818
seeing how you're whining so pathetically.

371
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:37,727
It's exactly 32 hours from now on.

372
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:40,388
Be sure to remember my words.

373
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:42,727
If anyone fails,

374
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:46,828
you will experience...

375
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:48,967
a freaky death...

376
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,037
that has never existed in this world before.

377
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,547
Current time, 10am.

378
00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:02,017
It starts now.

379
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,088
Oh, no!

380
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:20,367
Push it in slowly.

381
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:22,736
Put that over here. Right here.

382
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:24,098
Coming through.

383
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:25,337
Hello.

384
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:27,736
- Hello. - Hello.

385
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:28,776
- Hello. - Hello.

386
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:30,077
- Hey. - Hi.

387
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:31,546
Hello, I'm Han Mone.

388
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:33,546
- Hello. - Hello.

389
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:34,848
Hello, Director.

390
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,047
I hope we work well together.

391
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,216
- Hello. - Thank you.

392
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:40,686
- Look after Mone, please. - Hey!

393
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:42,257
You're hard at work, I see.

394
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:44,017
Hello.

395
00:20:49,027 --> 00:20:50,558
How is Mone feeling today?

396
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:56,436
She feels great and so enthusiastic.

397
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:58,936
That's good to hear. I have high expectations.

398
00:20:58,937 --> 00:21:00,467
I hope we do well together.

399
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:02,007
So do I.

400
00:21:20,957 --> 00:21:22,697
Two hours have gone already?

401
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:26,027
He plans to kill me first.

402
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:30,167
Five centimetres up.

403
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:31,767
Five centimetres up.

404
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:35,476
Three centimetres up for this one.

405
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:38,447
I must get that key at all cost.

406
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:43,776
Three hours have passed.

407
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:45,618
(Matthew Lee)

408
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:54,598
(Missed Call, Number Withheld)

409
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:19,588
- Hello? - You rent Unit 303, right?

410
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:21,456
It's the security guard.

411
00:22:21,457 --> 00:22:22,918
I got a noise complaint.

412
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:27,087
Neighbours say they hear smashing coming from your unit.

413
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:28,727
Are you redoing the interior?

414
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,868
(Handong Apartment)

415
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:32,487
(Number Withheld)

416
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,598
Was it you, K?

417
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,297
Thanks for acknowledging my work.

418
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,638
I knew we had a connection.

419
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:46,437
Don't you want to know...

420
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:50,706
why I burned your family to death?

421
00:23:50,707 --> 00:23:53,648
The truth is, your family was the target.

422
00:23:53,977 --> 00:23:55,178
Not Da Mi's home.

423
00:23:55,777 --> 00:23:58,217
You could've just killed me. Why...

424
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:01,717
Why did you kill my family?

425
00:24:01,818 --> 00:24:04,928
Because I wanted to make you feel so darn miserable.

426
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:08,997
So, why didn't I kill you?

427
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:11,897
Shall I tell you or not?

428
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:13,367
Tell or not?

429
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,037
Tell or not? Yes or no?

430
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:19,908
Someone else will kill you.

431
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:21,706
What do you mean?

432
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,408
Being the real thing isn't that special.

433
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:26,446
It's worse than being a fake.

434
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:28,847
And still, they make a scene,

435
00:24:28,848 --> 00:24:30,818
acting like they love each other.

436
00:24:30,977 --> 00:24:33,287
How stupid is that?

437
00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:34,618
Isn't that hilarious?

438
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:44,328
Hello?

439
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:09,588
Where are you? Show yourself!

440
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:11,516
Min Deul Re and Bang Gyeo Ul meet for the first time.

441
00:26:11,517 --> 00:26:12,517
Take one.

442
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:13,588
(Art class)

443
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:17,717
Ready. Action!

444
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:21,628
Hey, country girl.

445
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:26,027
What? Did you ignore us?

446
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,598
I don't believe this.

447
00:26:28,868 --> 00:26:30,668
Hey, you!

448
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:34,307
Where you're from, did they give out rewards...

449
00:26:34,308 --> 00:26:36,436
for reporting a friend? Did they?

450
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:39,547
Are you proud of blackmailing a friend into painting for you?

451
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:42,246
Is that an honourable way to get a degree and a job?

452
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:45,016
You've lost your mind in a creative way.

453
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:46,318
Hold her tight.

454
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:47,648
Here goes.

455
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:51,726
- Let go! - My gosh.

456
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:54,256
I'll scar her face for good.

457
00:26:54,257 --> 00:26:55,796
What do you think you're doing?

458
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:57,527
Stop that right now.

459
00:26:57,997 --> 00:26:59,226
Should I get the teacher?

460
00:26:59,227 --> 00:27:03,037
If hadn't been for Mone, I'd have used this on you already.

461
00:27:04,037 --> 00:27:05,267
Let's go.

462
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:08,838
Your hair's wet.

463
00:27:09,237 --> 00:27:10,436
You must be so cold.

464
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:12,908
What if they harass you for helping me?

465
00:27:13,808 --> 00:27:15,378
They can't touch me.

466
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,878
I'll buy their silence with some rare accessories.

467
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,658
Shall we be friends?

468
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:30,398
Cut!

469
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:33,697
Is this a joke?

470
00:27:33,828 --> 00:27:35,537
Don't try to look pretty.

471
00:27:35,898 --> 00:27:38,338
You're slyly lying to her face!

472
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:42,337
Don't fake an expression. Act like you normally do.

473
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:44,078
Do what you do best!

474
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:50,648
Sorry. I'll try again.

475
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:51,987
Let's go again.

476
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,647
Take two.

477
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:54,717
(Art class, Take 2)

478
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:58,088
Ready. Action!

479
00:28:00,358 --> 00:28:01,428
You must be so cold.

480
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:04,358
Thank you.

481
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:12,267
- Shall we be friends? - Cut!

482
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:16,276
This is a true story!

483
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,277
It wasn't made up!

484
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:20,476
If you want to play a princess,

485
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:22,547
cough up your pay and quit!

486
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:24,477
Darn it.

487
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:28,118
Get out.

488
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:33,828
That was us, wasn't it?

489
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,796
I thought that was me.

490
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,767
Her face and lines were the exact same.

491
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:39,997
We're ready.

492
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:42,568
Take three.

493
00:28:42,898 --> 00:28:45,868
Where's Mone? Han Mone!

494
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:53,047
Mone, the director's asking for you.

495
00:28:54,178 --> 00:28:55,277
Wipe your face quick.

496
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:04,888
Was it you?

497
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:07,957
Did you tell the director what you said?

498
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:11,668
Only we know what happened.

499
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:13,167
No way.

500
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,297
You didn't show us the script.

501
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,196
Was that really us?

502
00:29:18,197 --> 00:29:19,766
Does everyone know?

503
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:21,467
Answer the question.

504
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:24,236
How could she have written that scene if you didn't tell her?

505
00:29:24,237 --> 00:29:26,177
I might not be smart,

506
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:29,177
but I'm not crazy enough to talk about my past.

507
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:30,217
Han Mone.

508
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:32,987
You should answer first.

509
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:35,287
You gave birth at school, didn't you?

510
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:37,887
Then you put the blame on Da Mi,

511
00:29:37,888 --> 00:29:38,888
didn't you?

512
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:46,168
Don't talk nonsense. I never did that.

513
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:49,197
This is just a movie. It's fiction.

514
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:52,036
Mone, you can tell us the truth.

515
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,867
Only then can we help you.

516
00:29:53,868 --> 00:29:56,808
Hey, who do you want to help?

517
00:29:57,678 --> 00:29:59,308
Why would I help a murderer?

518
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:03,217
What? A murderer?

519
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:09,987
How proud are you about what you did?

520
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:11,857
You bullied Da Mi, got her wet,

521
00:30:11,858 --> 00:30:13,358
and harassed her at school.

522
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:16,027
If I'm a murderer, you're an accomplice.

523
00:30:17,058 --> 00:30:18,727
Are you sure you can take me on?

524
00:30:19,128 --> 00:30:21,128
Shall I show you what real fear is?

525
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:24,098
Shall I take every luxury you enjoyed at my expense?

526
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:26,067
Your house, your car,

527
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:27,608
even your hair, everything!

528
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:30,437
If I say no, that's what it is!

529
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:35,648
Keep your mouths shut unless you want to be a nobody again.

530
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:48,457
Mr. Jo.

531
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:49,956
Yes?

532
00:30:49,957 --> 00:30:50,997
Is this the famous...

533
00:31:00,537 --> 00:31:01,878
The painting.

534
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:04,378
My exhibition!

535
00:31:04,678 --> 00:31:06,547
I'm so sorry.

536
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,206
Get a rag right away.

537
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:09,546
No, tissue.

538
00:31:09,547 --> 00:31:10,847
Oh, no.

539
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,046
A towel!

540
00:31:12,047 --> 00:31:13,348
A towel, okay.

541
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:17,187
Hey, you're spreading the mess!

542
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:22,598
This is dreadful. The exhibition starts tomorrow.

543
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:27,428
And this is the painting you put on the brochure cover.

544
00:31:28,168 --> 00:31:29,697
I can't believe it's ruined.

545
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,668
Are you pouring oil onto a fire?

546
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:33,607
I'm done for.

547
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:34,967
This is the painting everyone wants to see.

548
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,578
I'm not sure if I should say this right now but...

549
00:31:43,678 --> 00:31:44,977
You needn't worry.

550
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:47,546
I can paint a replica.

551
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:49,358
What kind of nonsense is that?

552
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,357
Do you know whose work this is?

553
00:31:51,358 --> 00:31:54,527
It's a piece by the founder of the ultra-modern Fish Style!

554
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,996
An amateur like you...

555
00:31:56,997 --> 00:31:58,598
can stay out of it!

556
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,027
Let go of me!

557
00:32:01,697 --> 00:32:03,737
You know I'm an artist too.

558
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,908
I exhibited regularly,

559
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:08,267
and I can say for sure...

560
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,138
I'm the best art forger in the world.

561
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:13,747
Before tomorrow's grand opening,

562
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:16,078
I'll bring you...

563
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,378
an identical painting.

564
00:32:53,547 --> 00:32:55,687
(7 hours have passed)

565
00:32:57,987 --> 00:32:59,158
Hello.

566
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,787
Give us a fishcake and...

567
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:06,128
some tteokbokki and some blood sausage.

568
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:19,908
Ma'am.

569
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:24,216
Behind you, a truck! Watch out!

570
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:25,287
Behind you!

571
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:28,118
A truck's coming!

572
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:37,358
Has it been five years?

573
00:33:37,697 --> 00:33:40,527
I'm so honoured to speak with you again.

574
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,536
You were a rising star back then.

575
00:33:43,537 --> 00:33:45,168
Now you're the biggest star ever.

576
00:33:45,338 --> 00:33:47,207
I owe it to the love of my fans.

577
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:49,577
Do you remember what you said...

578
00:33:49,578 --> 00:33:52,148
about Bang Da Mi, your classmate at the time?

579
00:33:53,277 --> 00:33:54,277
Mone,

580
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:56,147
you go to Myeongju Girls' High School, right?

581
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:57,947
Everyone's talking about Bobble.

582
00:33:58,447 --> 00:34:00,888
What did the other students think about her?

583
00:34:02,358 --> 00:34:03,918
I don't know her well.

584
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:07,328
Why did you agree to do this movie if you didn't know her?

585
00:34:07,888 --> 00:34:10,858
I realized much later that the truth had been covered up,

586
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:13,197
and thought people should know.

587
00:34:14,228 --> 00:34:15,337
Ms. Geum.

588
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:19,507
You made a scathing remark about the Bobble incident.

589
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:22,377
Why are you producing a movie about this issue?

590
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:25,107
It's a truly shocking issue.

591
00:34:25,348 --> 00:34:28,078
People find each other too easily through phone apps,

592
00:34:28,147 --> 00:34:30,417
and become parents before they're ready.

593
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:33,586
I'm so concerned that families and society as a whole...

594
00:34:33,587 --> 00:34:35,257
is crumbling at a disastrous rate.

595
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:38,987
At the time,

596
00:34:39,757 --> 00:34:41,857
my comment was almost flippant.

597
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:44,598
Does that mean you've changed your mind since?

598
00:34:44,857 --> 00:34:45,928
That's right.

599
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:47,928
The public...

600
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:50,737
takes what the media says as a fact.

601
00:34:51,397 --> 00:34:53,837
Whether it's the truth or not,

602
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:55,308
they don't try to find out.

603
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:58,007
The more sensational the story, the quicker it spreads.

604
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:00,777
Then it becomes part of an algorithm,

605
00:35:00,908 --> 00:35:03,678
and lies rule out the truth.

606
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:06,248
Just like Bang Da Mi's incident.

607
00:35:11,357 --> 00:35:15,397
There's talk that Sungchan Group was involved in that incident.

608
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:18,098
Do you believe so?

609
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:25,638
- Yes. - Yes.

610
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:26,908
- We're sure of it. - We're sure of it.

611
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:30,578
As the producer, what would you say to Sungchan Group?

612
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:34,107
Memorize that thoroughly...

613
00:35:34,377 --> 00:35:37,678
and answer the reporters exactly as it says on there.

614
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,118
As a representative of the mothers of the world,

615
00:35:46,558 --> 00:35:48,087
I dare ask you this.

616
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:53,167
Who killed...

617
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:56,737
Bang Da Mi?

618
00:35:56,897 --> 00:35:59,808
(9 hours have passed)

619
00:36:01,837 --> 00:36:03,678
(Geum asks S Group who killed Bang Da Mi)

620
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:07,308
What's taking so long?

621
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:09,917
Use the macro program and leave as many comments as possible!

622
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:12,018
I'll pay triple the usual rate.

623
00:36:12,717 --> 00:36:14,248
The person who leaves the most comments...

624
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:15,817
gets paid ten times more, okay?

625
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:23,997
Just now, Geum La Hui, CEO of TIKITAKA Studio...

626
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:26,268
outright attacked Sungchan Group.

627
00:36:26,368 --> 00:36:29,397
Sungchan's Chairman Sim Yong, it's time to answer.

628
00:36:29,737 --> 00:36:32,837
Who killed Bang Da Mi?

629
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:34,736
(How can Sungchan go down like this?)

630
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:35,737
(It went too far...)

631
00:36:35,738 --> 00:36:36,837
(Two legends fight. Truth or lie!)

632
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:38,478
(She attacked Sungchan. Incredible.)

633
00:36:40,107 --> 00:36:41,248
He's here!

634
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,217
We want an answer!

635
00:36:44,277 --> 00:36:46,087
It's time to talk.

636
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:48,118
Who killed Bang Da Mi?

637
00:36:48,147 --> 00:36:51,256
Is it true your company was involved in her death?

638
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:53,127
Where's Sim Jun Seok right now?

639
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,927
Answer!

640
00:36:54,928 --> 00:36:56,498
Who killed Bang Da Mi?

641
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:57,598
Push through!

642
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:01,328
- Chairman! - We want an answer!

643
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,296
- Sir! - What do you say?

644
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:04,768
Call Monk Nam immediately.

645
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:06,337
Right now!

646
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:07,638
Yes, sir.

647
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:42,107
Paeng Hee.

648
00:37:42,377 --> 00:37:43,537
Where's No Paeng Hee?

649
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:44,737
Where is she hiding?

650
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:46,777
I don't know.

651
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:49,978
She told me to give you this if you came by.

652
00:37:50,317 --> 00:37:52,547
She wants you to pretend she's dead.

653
00:37:56,217 --> 00:37:57,658
Thanks for everything.

654
00:37:58,688 --> 00:38:02,158
You gave me Han Na, and for that, I forgive you.

655
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:06,598
The evil witch.

656
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:17,607
(Number Withheld)

657
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:19,877
Hello?

658
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:24,217
Hello?

659
00:38:24,848 --> 00:38:26,447
Who's this?

660
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:27,647
Do you have a death wish?

661
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:29,957
You chose the wrong time to prank...

662
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:30,987
It's me.

663
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:35,828
Paeng Hee.

664
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:40,828
(Sojung Hospital)

665
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:51,377
(Emergency Medical Center)

666
00:38:51,737 --> 00:38:53,848
Why you... No Paeng Hee!

667
00:38:59,317 --> 00:39:00,647
There was no one else...

668
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:03,587
I could call.

669
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:27,208
You did the right thing.

670
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,208
You seem to be greatly troubled.

671
00:39:57,237 --> 00:39:59,307
Did I not tell you...

672
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:01,748
dark clouds would swallow Sungchan?

673
00:40:03,217 --> 00:40:06,147
Even stronger winds and rain will come.

674
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:09,357
Some wind and rain can't topple Sungchan.

675
00:40:09,788 --> 00:40:11,018
The wind and rain...

676
00:40:11,587 --> 00:40:13,427
will turn to blood.

677
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:14,728
That's nonsense.

678
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:17,356
Would Korea's greatest company...

679
00:40:17,357 --> 00:40:20,297
crumble because of the likes of TIKITAKA?

680
00:40:20,397 --> 00:40:22,337
Then why did you ask to see me?

681
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:25,567
You were concerned.

682
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:28,538
Because Sungchan is everything to you.

683
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:35,507
What do I have to do?

684
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:38,518
You don't have to do anything.

685
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:42,357
The result is already decided.

686
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:46,527
This is a fight you cannot win.

687
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:50,026
It's all because of that flea.

688
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:51,027
Flea?

689
00:40:51,558 --> 00:40:53,268
What are you talking about?

690
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:55,868
You know who I'm talking about.

691
00:40:57,697 --> 00:41:00,507
The person you loved and trusted the most...

692
00:41:00,638 --> 00:41:02,737
that ended up betraying you.

693
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:07,808
The culprit who killed your wife.

694
00:41:08,147 --> 00:41:10,447
You quack!

695
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:13,587
Do you really think...

696
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:16,888
a flea like that can take down Sungchan?

697
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:20,387
I've never lost in a fight.

698
00:41:20,388 --> 00:41:22,357
That's Sungchan.

699
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:26,097
A human cannot go against the workings of the universe.

700
00:41:26,098 --> 00:41:27,167
Shut it!

701
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:30,397
Mr. Gu!

702
00:41:32,237 --> 00:41:33,336
Yes, Chairman Sim.

703
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:34,908
We're going to war with TIKITAKA.

704
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,537
I'm going to show them...

705
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:40,877
what happens when they provoke Sungchan!

706
00:41:46,618 --> 00:41:48,217
Keep provoking Chairman Sim...

707
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:50,917
and get him to join this fight as soon as possible.

708
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:52,458
Mission clear.

709
00:41:52,688 --> 00:41:55,187
See, Lee Hwi So. Your wish has come true.

710
00:41:55,188 --> 00:41:57,228
Chairman Sim is jumping up and down with rage.

711
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:01,627
Here.

712
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:13,408
It's good.

713
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:18,817
You should get some sleep.

714
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:20,688
It's getting late.

715
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:24,788
Right.

716
00:42:30,228 --> 00:42:31,927
I'm glad you're fine.

717
00:42:31,928 --> 00:42:33,667
I got too worked up earlier, didn't I?

718
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:36,336
She wasn't waking up.

719
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:38,138
It made me lose my mind.

720
00:42:40,038 --> 00:42:43,408
She saved me.

721
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,478
Mom. Look.

722
00:42:46,877 --> 00:42:49,717
Mom. Sweet potato.

723
00:42:50,078 --> 00:42:53,987
Hospital. And grandma.

724
00:42:54,717 --> 00:42:56,158
Right, Grandma?

725
00:42:57,018 --> 00:42:59,256
Good job. You get 100 points.

726
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:00,428
I get 100 points?

727
00:43:02,158 --> 00:43:04,498
Mom. Grandma said I got 100 points.

728
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:06,998
Good job.

729
00:43:11,897 --> 00:43:13,506
Are you really going to leave without seeing her?

730
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,567
I'll come back tomorrow.

731
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:16,208
Don't come anymore.

732
00:43:16,837 --> 00:43:18,408
Her CT scan was fine as well.

733
00:43:19,947 --> 00:43:23,217
Do you want to stay abroad with Han Na for a while?

734
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:27,518
I saw the news.

735
00:43:28,587 --> 00:43:30,158
Things are going on with Han Na's real dad.

736
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:33,027
I'll look into where you could go...

737
00:43:33,587 --> 00:43:35,428
while Han Na's passport is being prepared.

738
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:38,498
You should go back. She must be waiting for you.

739
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:42,067
Bye.

740
00:43:57,917 --> 00:44:00,118
What? Toto.

741
00:44:10,897 --> 00:44:12,158
Thank you.

742
00:44:15,228 --> 00:44:16,638
(Sojung Hospital)

743
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:20,507
Your nails are pretty.

744
00:44:20,737 --> 00:44:23,377
- Han Na. - Oh, it's Mom.

745
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:27,907
Why are you alone?

746
00:44:27,908 --> 00:44:29,917
Me? I wanted to see you.

747
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,716
What did that man say to you?

748
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:34,547
He didn't say anything.

749
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:40,727
But he had very ugly fingernails.

750
00:44:40,728 --> 00:44:44,098
They looked so rough and painful.

751
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,868
So I told him they were pretty.

752
00:44:59,507 --> 00:45:03,377
(17 hours have passed)

753
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:23,038
(18 hours have passed)

754
00:45:26,368 --> 00:45:29,408
Han Mone. Yang Jin Mo. Nam Chul Woo.

755
00:45:29,737 --> 00:45:30,876
Mission clear.

756
00:45:30,877 --> 00:45:31,877
(Go Myoung Ji, Geum La Hui, and 6 others)

757
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,887
Have you thought about what I said?

758
00:45:43,888 --> 00:45:45,856
(Kang Ki Tak)

759
00:45:45,857 --> 00:45:47,357
Reply once you've made up your mind.

760
00:45:56,397 --> 00:45:57,397
Matthew.

761
00:45:59,737 --> 00:46:01,368
How is Ki Tak doing?

762
00:46:13,817 --> 00:46:15,416
I haven't been able to look into it.

763
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:16,688
I don't think I could handle it.

764
00:46:18,757 --> 00:46:20,957
If you want to check, you can open it yourself.

765
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:23,658
No. I don't want to do so at all.

766
00:46:24,158 --> 00:46:27,026
Ki Tak is the person who saved me from K, Matthew.

767
00:46:27,027 --> 00:46:29,797
How could a person like that side with K?

768
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:32,938
You're right.

769
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:36,007
It must be true if you say so.

770
00:46:36,578 --> 00:46:37,607
Let's forget...

771
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:40,208
about it, then.

772
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:42,578
I was being too rash.

773
00:46:43,647 --> 00:46:44,647
Sorry.

774
00:46:48,487 --> 00:46:49,518
Matthew.

775
00:46:57,228 --> 00:46:58,297
What is this?

776
00:46:58,728 --> 00:47:01,268
I scratched off...

777
00:47:01,797 --> 00:47:03,768
a part of K's shoes that day.

778
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:06,567
I must've subconsciously put it in my pocket.

779
00:47:07,837 --> 00:47:08,837
This is...

780
00:47:09,638 --> 00:47:11,478
top quality crocodile leather.

781
00:47:11,908 --> 00:47:13,547
Could this be a clue?

782
00:47:14,007 --> 00:47:16,478
It's a handmade product that can't be found in Korea.

783
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,217
Do not lose this.

784
00:47:19,518 --> 00:47:21,987
It could be key evidence to find the culprit,

785
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:25,658
whether that is K or a traitor who sold out to K.

786
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:30,997
Right. I was making some coffee.

787
00:47:30,998 --> 00:47:31,998
Hold on.

788
00:48:27,248 --> 00:48:30,018
Here. Have some.

789
00:48:32,688 --> 00:48:33,728
What's wrong?

790
00:48:34,428 --> 00:48:36,357
I'm just a bit tired.

791
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:57,678
(Preparing for a successful tomorrow)

792
00:49:05,788 --> 00:49:09,287
SBC CEO, YTV CEO, J newspaper CEO, S newspaper CEO,

793
00:49:09,288 --> 00:49:10,856
Korean Film Council chairman,

794
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:12,967
the majority party leader, and even the chief secretary...

795
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:14,728
have all gathered.

796
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:16,167
Gosh.

797
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:19,938
What was that?

798
00:49:28,377 --> 00:49:29,478
I have asked you all to meet...

799
00:49:30,147 --> 00:49:32,916
as I can no longer stay quiet on the disgraceful events...

800
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:34,417
that have happened recently.

801
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:38,158
Since when has Sungchan Group become such a pushover?

802
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:41,986
Our company is suffering because of some baseless rumours...

803
00:49:41,987 --> 00:49:44,027
with no evidence.

804
00:49:44,158 --> 00:49:45,998
Does this country have no reason?

805
00:49:49,328 --> 00:49:53,107
But public opinion is raging like a storm.

806
00:49:54,138 --> 00:49:55,938
Petitions from citizens are flooding in.

807
00:49:56,138 --> 00:49:57,836
Things are blowing up in an organized manner,

808
00:49:57,837 --> 00:49:59,506
as if someone is controlling it all.

809
00:49:59,507 --> 00:50:01,377
- We have no way to stop... - Yes.

810
00:50:02,308 --> 00:50:03,978
I'll keep it short.

811
00:50:04,447 --> 00:50:06,078
Starting today, Sungchan Group...

812
00:50:06,248 --> 00:50:09,787
will pull all advertisements from public, cable, comprehensive...

813
00:50:09,788 --> 00:50:11,217
programming channels, and all newspapers.

814
00:50:15,527 --> 00:50:18,228
Chief Secretary Gu. Please set up a meeting...

815
00:50:18,428 --> 00:50:21,428
with the president as soon as possible.

816
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,768
I have something I must tell him.

817
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:25,938
Yes, sir.

818
00:50:38,777 --> 00:50:41,188
I was wondering why your skin was so nice,

819
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:43,018
but I guess this is your secret.

820
00:50:43,288 --> 00:50:45,458
I have to take care of myself. I'm a professional.

821
00:50:46,328 --> 00:50:49,127
You need to work on your acting to be a real professional.

822
00:50:49,897 --> 00:50:52,058
But at least you're taking care of yourself in some way.

823
00:50:52,728 --> 00:50:55,127
Makes sense. You need to work for your pay.

824
00:50:55,268 --> 00:50:57,067
You get paid 200,000 dollars an episode.

825
00:50:57,098 --> 00:50:58,397
Could you leave?

826
00:50:58,797 --> 00:51:00,808
I didn't get any sleep, so I'm tired.

827
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:03,607
It makes sense that you can't sleep well at a time like this.

828
00:51:04,638 --> 00:51:06,708
I guess you have a conscience after all.

829
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:12,777
Who are you?

830
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:19,158
Why are you acting like this?

831
00:51:19,217 --> 00:51:20,328
I'm not sure.

832
00:51:21,127 --> 00:51:22,428
Who do you think I am?

833
00:51:23,228 --> 00:51:25,627
Are you trying to fight me for power?

834
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:27,928
With me, Han Mone?

835
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:32,167
You must think you're great because you won a couple of awards.

836
00:51:34,368 --> 00:51:36,007
But in my eyes, you're still a baby.

837
00:51:36,478 --> 00:51:39,237
If I say I want you fired, you'll be ousted immediately.

838
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:41,447
So?

839
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:43,248
Should I turn things around?

840
00:51:43,348 --> 00:51:44,618
Be my guest.

841
00:51:45,717 --> 00:51:48,788
There are plenty of actors who are nicer and better than you.

842
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,916
You always say you want to change directors and the script.

843
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:53,828
You even interfere with the casting of other actors.

844
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,356
Being late two hours while the staff waits for you...

845
00:51:56,357 --> 00:51:57,927
in negative 20 degrees is a given.

846
00:51:57,928 --> 00:51:59,526
You say you don't want to film for over five scenes a day,

847
00:51:59,527 --> 00:52:01,166
and you tell them to take out your first and last scenes.

848
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:02,967
You're famous for your abuse of power.

849
00:52:03,897 --> 00:52:05,938
That won't work with me.

850
00:52:06,538 --> 00:52:08,467
If you can't act, I won't work with you.

851
00:52:08,638 --> 00:52:10,736
So don't waste your energy on stupid things...

852
00:52:10,737 --> 00:52:12,478
and focus on practicing your lines!

853
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:15,007
What kind of nonsense is that?

854
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:18,617
If I was Da Mi,

855
00:52:18,618 --> 00:52:20,147
I would've killed you like this.

856
00:52:20,317 --> 00:52:21,788
I'm doing this for Da Mi!

857
00:52:22,217 --> 00:52:23,417
You...

858
00:52:23,658 --> 00:52:24,756
You...

859
00:52:24,757 --> 00:52:25,817
Let go of me!

860
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:31,757
Don't feel like this is unfair.

861
00:52:32,058 --> 00:52:33,967
I always give back what I receive.

862
00:52:39,538 --> 00:52:40,808
Why aren't you doing anything?

863
00:52:41,507 --> 00:52:42,708
Hit me.

864
00:52:42,737 --> 00:52:43,908
I said, hit me!

865
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:49,877
Excuse me.

866
00:52:50,147 --> 00:52:51,147
Excuse me!

867
00:52:51,248 --> 00:52:52,848
Hey! Have you lost your mind?

868
00:52:53,388 --> 00:52:54,417
Are you crazy?

869
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:56,288
Director Michell! Are you okay?

870
00:52:56,658 --> 00:52:58,356
Look at your face!

871
00:52:58,357 --> 00:52:59,658
Apologize to her.

872
00:52:59,987 --> 00:53:01,087
Are you okay?

873
00:53:01,627 --> 00:53:03,796
I'm sorry. You can't photograph this.

874
00:53:03,797 --> 00:53:06,158
How can you punch the director in the face?

875
00:53:06,897 --> 00:53:08,667
Hurry up and bring some ice.

876
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,837
Mone. I love your acting.

877
00:53:14,138 --> 00:53:16,107
You just need to keep this emotion.

878
00:53:16,678 --> 00:53:18,708
I'm excited for the shoot today.

879
00:53:19,478 --> 00:53:21,047
Give Mone plenty of support,

880
00:53:21,107 --> 00:53:22,348
Ms. Wang Yu Jin.

881
00:53:23,118 --> 00:53:24,217
Ms. Kim So Yeon.

882
00:53:24,777 --> 00:53:26,377
Thank you for your hard work.

883
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:29,288
What was that? Were you acting?

884
00:53:29,518 --> 00:53:31,658
I thought my heart was going to burst.

885
00:53:32,317 --> 00:53:33,586
By the way,

886
00:53:33,587 --> 00:53:35,428
how does she know our names?

887
00:53:35,788 --> 00:53:37,257
I never introduced myself.

888
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,067
- Please don't take photos! - Please leave!

889
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:44,138
- Please don't take photos! - Please leave!

890
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:45,737
Please leave. You can't be here.

891
00:53:45,768 --> 00:53:47,708
- Don't take photos! - Leave!

892
00:53:56,777 --> 00:53:58,517
- What's up with her? - Seriously.

893
00:53:58,518 --> 00:53:59,787
- She's a problem. - I know.

894
00:53:59,788 --> 00:54:02,848
(Sungchan)

895
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:09,257
Hello, ma'am. You came.

896
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:17,138
This piece you're seeing is the artist's best piece.

897
00:54:19,237 --> 00:54:20,638
You can see each scale!

898
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:22,236
In order to make it look realistic,

899
00:54:22,237 --> 00:54:23,836
she drew everything from the mouth to the tail...

900
00:54:23,837 --> 00:54:25,537
with immense detail!

901
00:54:25,538 --> 00:54:27,547
- Hold on. - It's amazing.

902
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:30,118
Myoung Ji, you saved me!

903
00:54:30,978 --> 00:54:33,316
Where did such a treasure like you...

904
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:35,547
come from?

905
00:54:35,748 --> 00:54:37,417
It was nothing.

906
00:54:37,688 --> 00:54:40,087
I'm so glad I was of help.

907
00:54:40,158 --> 00:54:41,957
What do you mean it was nothing?

908
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:43,928
You don't need to be so humble.

909
00:54:44,127 --> 00:54:47,228
You will forever be my lifesaver.

910
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:48,998
If you want anything, tell me.

911
00:54:49,228 --> 00:54:51,697
A bag? Shoes? Cash? Or...

912
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:54,637
a permanent job? Wait, no...

913
00:54:54,638 --> 00:54:56,978
I'm going to Dubai on a business trip next week.

914
00:54:57,138 --> 00:54:58,578
Do you want to join me?

915
00:54:59,777 --> 00:55:01,307
I'm grateful for the offer,

916
00:55:01,308 --> 00:55:04,417
but I don't think I can go because of my twins.

917
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:06,017
In return...

918
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:07,447
In return?

919
00:55:10,188 --> 00:55:12,316
I told you that you can ask me for anything!

920
00:55:12,317 --> 00:55:14,687
I'm the youngest daughter of a wealthy family.

921
00:55:14,688 --> 00:55:16,458
I can give you anything!

922
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:19,828
I want to see the VIP room of Sungchan Gallery.

923
00:55:20,828 --> 00:55:22,296
What did you just say?

924
00:55:22,297 --> 00:55:23,697
The VIP room?

925
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:27,308
I heard it's secret and under strict control.

926
00:55:27,538 --> 00:55:29,506
But I would love a chance...

927
00:55:29,507 --> 00:55:31,208
to see it in person, just once.

928
00:55:31,638 --> 00:55:34,647
It's a long-time dream I've had as an artist.

929
00:55:35,107 --> 00:55:38,147
I won't tell anyone about what I see there.

930
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:41,087
This is driving me crazy.

931
00:55:41,317 --> 00:55:44,558
I would love more than anything to make that happen,

932
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:46,927
but nobody can go into...

933
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:48,428
the VIP room.

934
00:55:49,027 --> 00:55:50,697
Only Chairman Sim Yong can go in.

935
00:55:50,797 --> 00:55:51,857
What?

936
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:54,696
The chairman is the only one who has the OTP card...

937
00:55:54,697 --> 00:55:56,228
to get in.

938
00:55:56,938 --> 00:55:59,567
What are you saying?

939
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:01,737
Then what about this key?

940
00:56:03,877 --> 00:56:06,138
This is the key to my personal bathroom.

941
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:08,147
Make a decision soon.

942
00:56:14,248 --> 00:56:17,357
(Go Myoung Ji, Mission Failed)

943
00:56:21,228 --> 00:56:22,728
I'm going to quit soon.

944
00:56:23,558 --> 00:56:24,658
Why?

945
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,967
I got a better offer.

946
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:29,027
They're offering double what they're paying here.

947
00:56:29,127 --> 00:56:30,736
I heard the camera team, equipment team, and lighting team...

948
00:56:30,737 --> 00:56:32,098
have all been hired already.

949
00:56:32,938 --> 00:56:34,037
Look here!

950
00:56:34,038 --> 00:56:35,308
Who's in charge?

951
00:56:35,538 --> 00:56:37,538
I am. What's wrong?

952
00:56:37,938 --> 00:56:40,478
Take out all the equipment and clear out right now.

953
00:56:40,808 --> 00:56:42,677
How can you do this so suddenly in the middle of the shoot?

954
00:56:42,678 --> 00:56:44,146
We paid you already to rent the space.

955
00:56:44,147 --> 00:56:45,647
I'll pay the penalty!

956
00:56:45,877 --> 00:56:47,117
Hurry up and clear out!

957
00:56:47,118 --> 00:56:48,688
Why are you pushing me?

958
00:56:49,717 --> 00:56:51,256
Why are you doing this?

959
00:56:51,257 --> 00:56:52,388
You don't know?

960
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:55,788
I have no intention of turning Sungchan Group against me!

961
00:56:59,027 --> 00:57:01,428
Sungchan Group applied for an injunction to prohibit the shoot.

962
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,296
Our sponsors and advertisers informed us...

963
00:57:03,297 --> 00:57:04,868
that they want to end their contract.

964
00:57:05,197 --> 00:57:07,268
We can't film until the courts decide.

965
00:57:07,368 --> 00:57:09,407
Isn't it your job to make the impossible...

966
00:57:09,408 --> 00:57:11,038
possible?

967
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:14,348
We won't stop filming regardless of the reason.

968
00:57:14,408 --> 00:57:15,747
We will move forward with the shoot.

969
00:57:15,748 --> 00:57:17,547
The actors and staff are leaving too.

970
00:57:17,678 --> 00:57:19,017
We're up against Sungchan.

971
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,288
If they act, nobody in Korea can last.

972
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:24,058
Report this situation to Matthew right away.

973
00:57:24,118 --> 00:57:25,487
The actors and staff?

974
00:57:25,658 --> 00:57:26,957
We can hire new people.

975
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:28,658
Matthew thinks the same too.

976
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,327
- Hey, go in! - What is this?

977
00:57:31,328 --> 00:57:32,597
- Clear it out! - What...

978
00:57:32,598 --> 00:57:33,796
- What are you doing? - Get out!

979
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:35,368
- You can't do this! - Stop!

980
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:37,868
Why are you doing this?

981
00:57:38,797 --> 00:57:40,208
- Get out! - Wait!

982
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:42,308
I said, clear it all out!

983
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:44,678
What is going on here?

984
00:57:45,478 --> 00:57:47,277
Michell, first...

985
00:57:48,348 --> 00:57:49,506
I'll...

986
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,678
Michell...

987
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:53,117
Why are you doing this?

988
00:57:53,118 --> 00:57:54,688
- Get out! - Wait...

989
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:58,816
You have five hours left, Ms. Geum.

990
00:57:58,817 --> 00:58:01,087
If you can't get the shoot to start in that time,

991
00:58:01,388 --> 00:58:02,856
you're out for good.

992
00:58:02,857 --> 00:58:04,027
Take everything down!

993
00:58:05,228 --> 00:58:06,397
- Come on! - Move!

994
00:58:06,697 --> 00:58:08,067
- Hurry up. - What?

995
00:58:08,098 --> 00:58:09,666
Let's talk outside!

996
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:11,397
Move!

997
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:16,137
- Let go of me! - Clear it out!

998
00:58:16,138 --> 00:58:17,138
You can't do this!

999
00:58:17,139 --> 00:58:19,478
- You can't do this! - Get out!

1000
00:58:26,277 --> 00:58:28,087
It's me. I've decided.

1001
00:58:30,487 --> 00:58:31,817
I'll do as you say.

1002
00:58:32,618 --> 00:58:33,958
You made the right decision.

1003
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:36,328
Keep your promise.

1004
00:58:37,228 --> 00:58:39,558
(Cherry Entertainment)

1005
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:02,217
What are you doing?

1006
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,857
Oh, my! What am I going to do?

1007
00:59:06,288 --> 00:59:07,857
Did you get hurt, Ms. Han?

1008
00:59:10,058 --> 00:59:11,998
Oh, my. I must be crazy.

1009
00:59:12,058 --> 00:59:13,467
That jerk...

1010
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:21,966
Oh, my. You dropped all of the chairman's medication.

1011
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:23,808
He'll be mad if it's late.

1012
00:59:24,638 --> 00:59:25,876
Ms. Han.

1013
00:59:25,877 --> 00:59:27,248
You should get treated first.

1014
00:59:28,348 --> 00:59:29,447
Can you do it?

1015
00:59:30,248 --> 00:59:32,518
Of course. I'll bring it up to him.

1016
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:52,967
Did you stomp all over them?

1017
00:59:56,908 --> 00:59:58,078
Good job.

1018
00:59:58,578 --> 01:00:00,578
Our PR team will contact you tomorrow.

1019
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,717
Let's set up a meeting soon.

1020
01:00:09,018 --> 01:00:10,087
What about Ms. Han?

1021
01:00:10,188 --> 01:00:13,018
She hurt her finger, so I brought it up today.

1022
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:23,938
This...

1023
01:00:24,138 --> 01:00:25,467
smells different.

1024
01:00:25,697 --> 01:00:26,937
There's no way.

1025
01:00:26,938 --> 01:00:28,808
This is the same thing you take every day.

1026
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:40,747
You should have some persimmons...

1027
01:00:40,748 --> 01:00:41,788
Hold on.

1028
01:00:42,317 --> 01:00:43,348
What is this?

1029
01:00:45,487 --> 01:00:47,487
What did you put in my medicine?

1030
01:00:48,328 --> 01:00:50,356
It's not that, sir. You're mistaken.

1031
01:00:50,357 --> 01:00:52,827
I know you have insomnia, so I added some vitamins...

1032
01:00:52,828 --> 01:00:55,127
with melatonin to your medicine.

1033
01:00:55,268 --> 01:00:56,427
Get rid of this woman!

1034
01:00:56,428 --> 01:00:59,237
It's true! You're mistaken.

1035
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:00,966
- It's vitamins. - Let's go.

1036
01:01:00,967 --> 01:01:02,908
It's just vitamins!

1037
01:01:03,607 --> 01:01:06,876
It's not that! He's mistaken!

1038
01:01:06,877 --> 01:01:08,777
It's not that! Hold on!

1039
01:01:09,078 --> 01:01:10,716
Ms. Han!

1040
01:01:10,717 --> 01:01:12,618
What on earth did you do?

1041
01:01:12,748 --> 01:01:15,347
Prepare to get investigated by the police!

1042
01:01:15,348 --> 01:01:18,158
It's not that! I can't get kicked out like this!

1043
01:01:18,288 --> 01:01:20,057
Hold on! Wait a second!

1044
01:01:20,058 --> 01:01:21,827
It's not that!

1045
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:23,928
No! Ms. Han!

1046
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:28,598
Chairman Sim! It's not like that!

1047
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,467
Please believe in me!

1048
01:01:39,708 --> 01:01:40,777
Who are you?

1049
01:01:42,007 --> 01:01:43,917
Did Matthew send you?

1050
01:01:45,478 --> 01:01:47,788
Is he really going to kill me?

1051
01:01:48,888 --> 01:01:49,917
Take her.

1052
01:01:50,317 --> 01:01:51,586
Wait...

1053
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:54,288
No! I...

1054
01:01:54,428 --> 01:01:56,157
I won't leave like this! I can't!

1055
01:01:56,158 --> 01:01:57,727
Let go of me!!

1056
01:01:57,728 --> 01:01:59,997
I did everything he asked!

1057
01:01:59,998 --> 01:02:02,597
Cha Ju Ran failed the mission. Thirty-two hours have passed.

1058
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:04,138
(Cha Ju Ran, Mission Failed, 32 hours have passed)

1059
01:02:11,438 --> 01:02:12,538
As I told you already,

1060
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:15,647
I will begin the punishment of the three who failed their missions.

1061
01:02:16,377 --> 01:02:18,748
Watch and see what happens to those who fail.

1062
01:02:20,788 --> 01:02:21,986
No!

1063
01:02:21,987 --> 01:02:24,716
Please let me live. I can't die like this.

1064
01:02:24,717 --> 01:02:27,256
Please let us go, Chairman Lee.

1065
01:02:27,257 --> 01:02:29,587
I don't want to die like this.

1066
01:02:29,888 --> 01:02:32,597
Please. Give us one more day.

1067
01:02:32,598 --> 01:02:35,268
Please for the sake of my twins. Please?

1068
01:02:36,397 --> 01:02:38,768
Why must I die?

1069
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:41,836
Doing this is so cruel!

1070
01:02:41,837 --> 01:02:44,478
Let us live. Please let us live.

1071
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:47,046
Get rid of these failures yourself.

1072
01:02:47,047 --> 01:02:48,107
What?

1073
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:58,257
- Push those drums in. - Me?

1074
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,157
- No! - Wait...

1075
01:03:00,158 --> 01:03:01,927
Like that? No!

1076
01:03:01,928 --> 01:03:03,127
- Please let us live! - Wait...

1077
01:03:03,257 --> 01:03:05,227
Do you have to go this far?

1078
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:06,957
- No! - What are you waiting for?

1079
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:08,328
No!

1080
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:11,967
Follow me if you don't want to die with them.

1081
01:03:12,967 --> 01:03:14,507
- Don't! - Yang Jin Mo!

1082
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:26,477
No!

1083
01:03:26,478 --> 01:03:27,888
No!

1084
01:03:30,518 --> 01:03:32,288
No! Please let us live.

1085
01:04:01,417 --> 01:04:03,856
Please let us live! Please!

1086
01:04:03,857 --> 01:04:05,457
- No! - Please...

1087
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:07,387
No!

1088
01:04:07,388 --> 01:04:09,026
- Hurry up! - No!

1089
01:04:09,027 --> 01:04:10,127
I can't do it!

1090
01:04:10,257 --> 01:04:11,597
- Please let them live. - Let us live!

1091
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:12,828
- Do you want to die with them? - No!

1092
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:14,367
- Please let us live! - Why aren't you pushing?

1093
01:04:14,368 --> 01:04:16,327
- What? - No!

1094
01:04:16,328 --> 01:04:17,467
Hurry up!

1095
01:04:18,837 --> 01:04:20,737
- I'm sorry! - No!

1096
01:04:21,138 --> 01:04:23,638
Don't push it in!

1097
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,138
Don't do it!

1098
01:04:25,377 --> 01:04:27,506
- I'm sorry, Honey! - No!

1099
01:04:27,507 --> 01:04:28,578
No!

1100
01:04:30,348 --> 01:04:31,447
Push!

1101
01:04:39,857 --> 01:04:40,857
No!

1102
01:04:41,527 --> 01:04:43,086
Let us live! No!

1103
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:44,557
- No! - Don't push it!

1104
01:04:44,558 --> 01:04:46,228
No!

1105
01:04:47,598 --> 01:04:49,728
- No! - No!

1106
01:04:52,368 --> 01:04:53,638
I'm sorry, Honey!

1107
01:05:36,078 --> 01:05:37,376
What is this? What's going on?

1108
01:05:37,377 --> 01:05:38,978
Why are you getting mad at me?

1109
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:43,487
Now's our chance!

1110
01:05:46,257 --> 01:05:47,958
- Where do you think you're going? - Oh, my!

1111
01:05:48,388 --> 01:05:49,458
Hurry!

1112
01:05:58,768 --> 01:05:59,768
Where are you going?

1113
01:06:00,908 --> 01:06:01,908
Let go!

1114
01:06:03,467 --> 01:06:04,478
Hurry.

1115
01:06:06,678 --> 01:06:08,908
Hey! Hurry up and tie him up!

1116
01:06:09,107 --> 01:06:10,146
- In here! - Let go of me!

1117
01:06:10,147 --> 01:06:11,647
- Hurry up! - Let go of me!

1118
01:06:12,578 --> 01:06:14,587
- Hurry up! - Let go of me!

1119
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:17,288
No!

1120
01:06:22,857 --> 01:06:23,928
Min Do Hyuk.

1121
01:06:24,757 --> 01:06:26,627
Don't do anything from this point forward.

1122
01:06:26,757 --> 01:06:29,667
Shoot me, you traitor. Shoot me!

1123
01:06:30,498 --> 01:06:31,667
If something happens to Matthew,

1124
01:06:32,498 --> 01:06:33,697
I'll kill you myself.

1125
01:06:35,368 --> 01:06:36,438
Let go!

1126
01:06:40,078 --> 01:06:41,848
You're evil! Die!

1127
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:47,647
Run! Hurry!

1128
01:06:50,857 --> 01:06:51,888
Go!

1129
01:08:37,127 --> 01:08:38,358
Who are you?

1130
01:08:55,207 --> 01:08:56,348
I said, who are you?

1131
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:18,497
Me?

1132
01:09:57,678 --> 01:10:01,648
(The Escape of the Seven)

1133
01:10:01,907 --> 01:10:04,006
How long has it been me?

1134
01:10:04,007 --> 01:10:05,778
Someone was watching Han Na.

1135
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:08,217
You're Han Na's mom. Focus on protecting her.

1136
01:10:08,948 --> 01:10:10,018
Matthew's alive!

1137
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,117
You dared to set up a plan to kill me?

1138
01:10:13,217 --> 01:10:15,227
I put everything I have on the line for this!

1139
01:10:15,228 --> 01:10:16,687
Because you're Da Mi's mom.

1140
01:10:16,688 --> 01:10:19,928
I made this movie as a mom.

1141
01:10:20,028 --> 01:10:21,826
What do you think you can do?

1142
01:10:21,827 --> 01:10:22,897
I'm going to kill everyone.

1143
01:10:22,898 --> 01:10:25,738
In the most cruel and painful way.
