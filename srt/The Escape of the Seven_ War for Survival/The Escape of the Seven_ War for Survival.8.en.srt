(in this drama are fictitious.)

(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

12
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:02,905
(Episode 8)

13
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:04,015
- What is it? - The blood samples...

14
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:05,146
of the surviving seven...

15
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:06,986
of the mass casualty case on Osan Island...

16
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:08,246
seems to have been swapped.

17
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:09,446
On what grounds?

18
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:13,385
I just confirmed that they all belong to the same person.

19
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:16,055
We already announced the results of the investigation.

20
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:18,957
Sir, you were directly involved in this case.

21
00:01:19,157 --> 00:01:22,767
I know you were one of the 33 winners to attend the event.

22
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:26,466
We'll restart the investigation from the very beginning.

23
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:28,067
Your response isn't necessary.

24
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,206
(Prosecutor General Um Ji Man)

25
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:37,017
(Prosecutor General Um Ji Man)

26
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,466
How did it go?

27
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,535
You couldn't take care of that kid yourself?

28
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:34,207
Look at you all flustered.

29
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:38,637
Don't worry. It's been handled.

30
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,917
By the way,

31
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,686
the deserted island incident is very interesting.

32
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:48,186
He's a force to be reckoned with.

33
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:51,616
It was as if I had fallen into a pit of fire.

34
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:58,526
There's no doubt it's connected to Bang Da Mi.

35
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:01,767
I know I shouldn't ask this,

36
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:04,065
but who gave you the orders...

37
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:06,667
to make Lee Hwi So the killer?

38
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,536
You don't need to know.

39
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:14,147
Cha Ju Ran is one of the survivors, right?

40
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:15,507
Yes.

41
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:19,876
Take a look for yourself.

42
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:26,257
Through a press conference, Mr. Bang intended to...

43
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:28,056
fully expose the wrongdoings of...

44
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:31,055
her granddaughter's adoptive father, Lee Hwi So.

45
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:33,125
She was Bang Chil Sung's lover?

46
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,326
You better get your head on straight.

47
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:37,897
This could end badly for all of us.

48
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:40,107
- Yes, sir. - Sentence...

49
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,336
him to the death penalty.

50
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:46,276
I dare implore the president.

51
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:52,315
Last night, on a road in Saekdal-dong,

52
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,016
Lieutenant Kang Won Sik of the Seogwipo Police Station...

53
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:57,115
passed away from a car accident.

54
00:03:57,116 --> 00:03:59,115
The police announced that, due to a sudden power outage,

55
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:01,227
traffic signals and communication were paralysed.

56
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,426
- Possibilities of a hit-and-run... - The last person to meet...

57
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,227
Detective Kang last night was Nam Chul Woo.

58
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:05,696
I think he found out that the blood samples...

59
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:07,667
of the Jeju incident survivors were falsified...

60
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:10,136
and suspected Nam Chul Woo.

61
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,336
Detective Kang must have provoked Nam Chul Woo.

62
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,007
And that's why he was killed.

63
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,607
Did you get anything on Um Ji Man?

64
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:20,747
I confirmed that he went to Jeju yesterday.

65
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:25,247
This makes it more likely that Um Ji Man was behind it.

66
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:30,117
No, Um Ji Man is just a puppet.

67
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:32,586
Someone else must be pulling his strings.

68
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:35,687
We're going to get him...

69
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:37,526
using the Seven, no matter what.

70
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:55,247
What's going on?

71
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:56,646
Did you get in trouble again?

72
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:59,276
You're the one in trouble.

73
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:02,017
Is it true you're not resigning with Ms. Geum?

74
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:03,756
Who said you could throw away our meal ticket?

75
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:06,086
No one else could treat us better than Ms. Geum.

76
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:08,785
You're so full of yourself.

77
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:10,956
What happened to loyalty?

78
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:12,757
Mone, I approve.

79
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:15,766
I heard someone offered you a ten-million-dollar signing fee.

80
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:16,965
Ten million dollars?

81
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,235
Why haven't you signed with them yet?

82
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:19,936
Make the switch immediately.

83
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:21,335
Loyalty? Give me a break.

84
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:23,105
You have to send us a million dollars, okay?

85
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:24,506
Stop with all that nonsense.

86
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,636
Unless you hear news of my death,

87
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,507
don't even think about stepping foot in Korea.

88
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:32,546
She's so rude.

89
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:43,226
(Who will be the lucky agency to sign with Mone?)

90
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:46,926
(Will LH Media give up on resigning Mone?)

91
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,936
Why are you here already?

92
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,207
My schedule starts in the afternoon.

93
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:00,706
Your schedule has all been cancelled.

94
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:01,775
What?

95
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:04,676
Ms. Geum told us to help you pack and get you out of this house.

96
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,345
What are we going to do now?

97
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:08,415
We're here because we trusted you.

98
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,546
We're all doomed.

99
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:15,355
I still have eight months left on the instalment plan for this bag.

100
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:16,855
Oh, be quiet.

101
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:19,127
You're worried about your bag right now? How selfish.

102
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:24,137
She said you'd be fired from the show too.

103
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:27,937
What on earth did you do wrong for Ms. Geum to be that angry?

104
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:30,206
You have to beg her for forgiveness.

105
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,836
Bring out the waterworks, got it?

106
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:36,406
Why are you crying? It's distracting.

107
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:39,345
Stop the tears! Stop sniffling!

108
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:42,915
Give me a second. What do you want me to do?

109
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,757
Hold it in.

110
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:49,526
Mone, you have to get it together.

111
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:52,096
Do whatever it takes to change Ms. Geum's mind.

112
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:54,225
Whether you give her what she wants...

113
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:55,526
or you blackmail her,

114
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:57,897
pretend you're insane and go at her.

115
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:03,405
It was because I liked...

116
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:05,806
how you did whatever you could to get what you wanted,

117
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:07,207
even if that meant cheating.

118
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:10,077
Your brazen and daring nature reminded me of me.

119
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:13,475
I briefly forgot...

120
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,817
who I was.

121
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:22,957
Yes, Prosecutor General Um.

122
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:39,276
Ms. Geum, is that true?

123
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:46,517
(CEO Geum La Hui)

124
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:56,086
Hey.

125
00:08:02,526 --> 00:08:05,497
- What are you doing in my chair? - What? We're family.

126
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:07,506
Did you hear from TIKITAKA?

127
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:09,665
If their nominee resigned, they should be calling you by now.

128
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,535
Being the CEO of TIKITAKA is not important right now.

129
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,436
People are dying.

130
00:08:13,437 --> 00:08:15,206
I can't trust you anymore.

131
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:17,646
I'm not going to work with you. Take Mone and get out.

132
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:20,146
I explained everything. It wasn't a big deal.

133
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:22,986
Mone kept asking me, so I just played around a little.

134
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,285
I didn't know things would end up like that.

135
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:27,457
Played around?

136
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:30,456
Someone died.

137
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:32,225
She was only 18 years old!

138
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:34,925
Darn it. So what do you want me to do about it?

139
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:36,997
Is Bang Da Mi your daughter or something?

140
00:08:46,337 --> 00:08:48,406
That's not important right now.

141
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:51,376
The people who died on the deserted island...

142
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:53,416
were all members of Scarlet Letter.

143
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,147
What?

144
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:58,455
You're the one who managed the list of participants.

145
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:00,786
They must have hacked it or something.

146
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:03,227
Darn it. We messed with the wrong person.

147
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,357
They're looking through us.

148
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:08,996
What do we do now?

149
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:10,795
Keep your head clear...

150
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:12,867
and stop picking fights over petty feelings.

151
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,107
From now on, only use this burner phone to contact me.

152
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:32,916
If something goes wrong,

153
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:36,186
we'll all end up like Joo Yong Ju.

154
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,237
(Mone)

155
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:49,967
Why do you keep calling me? I have nothing to say to you.

156
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,837
You were still my mom at one point.

157
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,206
I want to say goodbye to you as your daughter.

158
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:59,246
Meet me at the Lemon Bistro in Cheongdam-dong at 7pm.

159
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:01,346
I'm not going. Don't bother waiting.

160
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:02,946
I'll be waiting until you show up.

161
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:09,886
- Ms. Go Myoung Ji? - Yes.

162
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:10,955
Express delivery.

163
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:12,257
(Recipient: Go Myoung Ji)

164
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:26,036
In case of an emergency, use this phone.

165
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:36,816
Mom.

166
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:38,887
When can I eat?

167
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:40,456
I'm hungry.

168
00:10:41,186 --> 00:10:42,555
Eat your soup first.

169
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,555
I'll make you pork cutlets.

170
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:46,325
Yes, Mommy.

171
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:47,997
I'm not going to eat dinner.

172
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:55,107
Why? Is something wrong, Erica?

173
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:57,237
Is Han Na bullying you again?

174
00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:58,576
Why...

175
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:01,647
did you give birth to me?

176
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:10,087
- Erica, Phillip. - Hi, gang.

177
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,055
How was your day today?

178
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:13,786
- Did you have fun? - Yes.

179
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,586
What are we having for snacks today?

180
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:20,025
Homemade cookies and peach iced tea.

181
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:23,066
Gosh. Erica, we're having cookies today.

182
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:25,796
Auntie made cookies.

183
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:34,876
Goodness, my princess.

184
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:37,246
You're here.

185
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:41,147
I came to pick you up today instead of your mom.

186
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,017
Nice to see you, Mr. Yang.

187
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:48,127
I heard some strange news.

188
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:51,055
My Han Na is being forced to transfer?

189
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:52,626
Gosh, no.

190
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:54,867
No way will that ever happen.

191
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,326
Right.

192
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:59,096
I'm counting on you.

193
00:11:59,097 --> 00:12:02,866
Oh, and these are tickets for a Cherry Entertainment concert.

194
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,436
Take the other teachers with you.

195
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:06,305
- You can go now. - These were all sold out.

196
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:08,877
- Han Na! - Thank you so much!

197
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:14,185
Erica, why are you crying?

198
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:15,647
You're breaking my heart.

199
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:18,216
Do you want me to call the principal again...

200
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:20,156
and ask for Han Na to be kicked out at once?

201
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:21,826
You can't.

202
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:24,296
Do you know who Han Na's father is?

203
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:28,627
He's Yang Jin Mo, the CEO of Cherry Entertainment.

204
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:29,825
What?

205
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:32,997
He's the CEO of the agency I want to be signed with the most.

206
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,467
Yang Jin Mo?

207
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:38,107
Why don't I have a dad like that?

208
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:42,147
Why don't I have a dad?

209
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:48,816
What do you mean? He's in America.

210
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:50,416
Do you want to talk to your dad on the phone?

211
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:52,516
You're a liar.

212
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:54,727
Do you think I'm stupid like Phillip?

213
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:57,426
I don't have a dad.

214
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:03,426
My love...

215
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:07,367
says everything with her eyes.

216
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:11,076
She has a pair of fiery eyes.

217
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:12,706
My honey.

218
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:14,406
Are you talking about me?

219
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,747
Whenever I look at you,

220
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:19,076
my heart feels as if it's about to burst.

221
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:21,647
(Couples that Mess Around)

222
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,727
Erica.

223
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:30,387
How long have you known?

224
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,227
I knew from the beginning.

225
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:37,566
That man is a re-enactment actor who appears frequently...

226
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:39,337
in "True Story Theatre."

227
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:47,507
So why didn't you say anything?

228
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,306
You knew.

229
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:51,546
I didn't want to you be sad,

230
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:54,387
so I pretended not to know.

231
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:59,316
You lied for me too.

232
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:02,686
I hate it when you're sad.

233
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:07,566
I'm sorry, Erica.

234
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,767
I didn't know.

235
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:13,566
I'm so sorry.

236
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:15,306
I wish...

237
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:19,276
I had a dad like Han Na's.

238
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:22,276
A dad who really loves me...

239
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,977
and can make me a star.

240
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:30,546
I'll get one for you.

241
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:34,656
No matter what, I'll get you and Phillip...

242
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:37,026
the best dad ever.

243
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:40,196
I promise, my daughter.

244
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,416
I knew you'd come.

245
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:03,987
What do you think you're doing?

246
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:09,857
The two of us never got to have any quality time.

247
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:18,536
I ordered your favourite champagne and steak.

248
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:37,956
Instead of chatting away with me,

249
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:39,686
you should look for a new agency.

250
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,556
Which one are you thinking of selling me to?

251
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:43,186
Whichever.

252
00:15:43,387 --> 00:15:45,326
As long as they're offering to buy, I'm good.

253
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:48,026
What about TIKITAKA?

254
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:49,996
If Matthew...

255
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:51,897
wants to sign an exclusive contract with me.

256
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:56,906
Did you...

257
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:59,036
decided to get into comedy?

258
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:00,877
You have talent.

259
00:16:01,347 --> 00:16:04,046
Do you know what TIKITAKA considers to be the most important?

260
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:06,816
Morality, character, and personality.

261
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:08,946
Ask yourself...

262
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:10,786
if you're qualified.

263
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:13,357
Nobody is perfect.

264
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:15,356
We all pretend...

265
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:16,756
to be moral...

266
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:18,256
and to have good character.

267
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:21,296
That only applies when people don't know who you really are.

268
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:23,267
Will...

269
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:25,796
Matthew still welcome you when he knows about your past?

270
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:28,536
He'd probably pull you out of ads...

271
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:30,406
with a massive penalty for breach of contract.

272
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:32,706
I'll be fine as long as you keep my secret.

273
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:34,036
Why should I?

274
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:37,546
Protecting you won't do me any good.

275
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:40,676
Have faith in the choice you made five years ago.

276
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:46,316
The faith you had when you chose me over your biological daughter.

277
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:56,597
What are you talking about?

278
00:16:58,566 --> 00:16:59,936
I don't have a daughter.

279
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:03,436
I know...

280
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:06,637
that Bang Da Mi was your biological daughter.

281
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:09,906
I found out this morning...

282
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:11,916
that Da Mi once lived in the room...

283
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:13,946
I wake up and go to sleep in every day.

284
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,087
I want to see K.

285
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:20,456
I know you and K are over.

286
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:23,286
If K finds out you and I met,

287
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:24,696
he could get angry at me.

288
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:28,827
Be honest with me.

289
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:31,336
Bang Da Mi's incident.

290
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:32,766
I'm not the only one involved.

291
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:37,906
You, K, and I are all involved.

292
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,377
Are we not?

293
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,906
You shouldn't say that.

294
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:43,577
Tell K...

295
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:47,216
I won't go down alone.

296
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,456
If you brush off my words,

297
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:56,287
what you and K did...

298
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:58,556
won't be kept a secret anymore.

299
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:00,925
Han Mone, don't cross the line.

300
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:02,097
One more thing.

301
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:05,067
Please look into Geum La Hui, the CEO of LH Media,

302
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:07,666
and how she's connected to Bang Da Mi.

303
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:13,436
Don't even think about blackmailing me with that.

304
00:18:14,107 --> 00:18:16,647
It's a fact that the main instigator of this incident is you,

305
00:18:17,206 --> 00:18:20,176
and you're still keeping countless secrets from me.

306
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:21,516
Secrets?

307
00:18:21,746 --> 00:18:22,986
I don't have any.

308
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:24,787
You left the house last night.

309
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:26,416
Who did you meet?

310
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:29,387
Oh, you saw me?

311
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:32,426
You could have asked me if you had been curious.

312
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:36,027
I met Prosecutor General Um Ji Man.

313
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,066
Um Ji Man?

314
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,796
He's the one who helped me...

315
00:18:39,797 --> 00:18:41,466
learn about your relationship with Bang Da Mi.

316
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:44,067
So it must be correct.

317
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:51,246
I wanted to know about K too,

318
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,946
so I thought I might as well meet him.

319
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:57,416
Prosecutor General Um is very close with K.

320
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,557
K?

321
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:02,686
We call him K.

322
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,027
How is Um Ji Man connected to K?

323
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:07,226
I can't tell you that.

324
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:09,327
You shouldn't try to know more.

325
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,847
I don't intend to fight you.

326
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:26,716
I'm actually relieved that you're Da Mi's biological mother.

327
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:32,287
Now we're really in this together.

328
00:19:34,486 --> 00:19:36,986
I'll never tell anyone...

329
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:40,897
as long as you don't abandon me.

330
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:42,496
Do you not understand what's going on?

331
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,597
K or Um Ji Man. What's the point?

332
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:47,836
Someone worse than them is out to get us.

333
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:50,266
That's why we have to get K to help us.

334
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:54,236
Prosecutor General Um will be in touch.

335
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:59,676
You want to become the CEO of TIKITAKA Studio, right?

336
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:04,246
I can put you in that position.

337
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:07,515
I can't listen to your arrogance any longer.

338
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:08,756
I'm late.

339
00:20:10,387 --> 00:20:12,127
I'm sorry. My meeting ran longer than expected.

340
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:13,857
How have you been?

341
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:15,297
It must have been exhausting to get here.

342
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:17,567
Lucky for me, there was no traffic at all.

343
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:20,765
I ordered as I wanted from the menu. That's okay, right?

344
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:23,537
Today, you get to do whatever you want.

345
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:31,377
- Say hi. Ms. Geum is here. - Oh.

346
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:35,986
We meet again.

347
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:38,056
I thought we wouldn't be seeing each other again.

348
00:20:38,057 --> 00:20:39,416
To tell you the truth,

349
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:42,726
I offered Mone a contract renewal for the ads.

350
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:44,527
Since she's the symbol of TIKITAKA,

351
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:47,456
I offered the highest signing bonus and director-level treatment.

352
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:48,725
But then,

353
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:51,567
she added a difficult condition.

354
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:53,367
She asked me...

355
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:56,466
to recruit you as the CEO of TIKITAKA Studio.

356
00:20:58,577 --> 00:21:00,936
And you said you'd have an answer for me today.

357
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:02,547
So?

358
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:07,646
We want you...

359
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:09,446
to be a part of TIKITAKA Studio.

360
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:12,287
The board of directors just approved it.

361
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:14,627
That's great.

362
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,256
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

363
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:18,195
Ms. Geum,

364
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:19,357
congratulations.

365
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:22,127
Let's go to TIKITAKA together.

366
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:23,966
I also have a condition.

367
00:21:26,097 --> 00:21:27,266
I expect a proper apology...

368
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:30,137
for what happened last time.

369
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:34,206
Gladly.

370
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:46,317
Mr. Lee, you're much sweeter than you seem.

371
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:47,926
Right, Ms. Geum?

372
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:50,587
What do I seem like?

373
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,897
Didn't you know?

374
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,597
Like you're cold as ice.

375
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,396
We should see each other more often.

376
00:21:57,397 --> 00:21:58,996
There's more to me you haven't seen yet.

377
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:00,837
All right.

378
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,337
Cheers?

379
00:22:13,117 --> 00:22:14,516
Han Mone.

380
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:16,016
She's definitely extraordinary.

381
00:22:16,986 --> 00:22:18,617
I lost this time.

382
00:22:18,956 --> 00:22:20,857
The weapon you have in your hands.

383
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:22,426
I want it.

384
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:25,327
You're the one who taught me...

385
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:27,926
how lions survive falling from a cliff.

386
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,367
It's your turn, now.

387
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:32,265
You better get on your feet...

388
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:33,466
to save me.

389
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:40,505
The most famous celebrity meets with a prosecutor general.

390
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:41,706
Goodness.

391
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:44,077
What a sight.

392
00:22:46,117 --> 00:22:47,246
What?

393
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:48,386
When did these two meet up?

394
00:22:48,387 --> 00:22:51,655
Hold up. You asked when they met, not why they met.

395
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:56,127
That means you already knew about their relationship.

396
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,956
Was Um Ji Man Han Mone's boyfriend?

397
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,226
If Han Mone...

398
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:05,597
had Prosecutor General Um's baby five years ago,

399
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:07,836
it would be an interesting story.

400
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:10,037
It would be the scandal of the century.

401
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:12,077
Stop joking around, you jerk.

402
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:14,236
Don't be curious about it, either.

403
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:16,675
You won't be able to handle digging into this.

404
00:23:16,676 --> 00:23:19,176
Just tell me. It's not that serious.

405
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:22,985
I have to know at least something if you want me to dig around.

406
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,516
Just do what I tell you to do and make your money.

407
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:27,357
If you know too much,

408
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:29,956
you'll die.

409
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:31,996
One thing's for sure.

410
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:34,256
If Um Ji Man showed up,

411
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:37,936
it means we're not at a disadvantage.

412
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:39,966
If we play our cards right,

413
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,706
we'll be able to bury what happened in Jeju for good.

414
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:44,637
For good.

415
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:51,876
(Final winner: Song Ji A)

416
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,847
- Is that Song Ji A? - Hey.

417
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:55,646
What is this video?

418
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:57,116
What? What is she doing there?

419
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:58,686
What is she doing here?

420
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:01,185
What is this?

421
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:02,726
What is she...

422
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:06,127
I need you to do something.

423
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:07,966
It's for...

424
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:09,696
Mone.

425
00:24:09,797 --> 00:24:12,097
I'll do anything for Mone.

426
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,296
That Song Ji A?

427
00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:15,235
I swear on my life that I'll take charge and...

428
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:16,766
send her to the abyss.

429
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:18,077
Do you want us to start today?

430
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:19,277
Just give us the word.

431
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:22,107
Burying her will be easy.

432
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:26,777
- Let us begin. - Let's go.

433
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,116
While working as her manager, Song Ji A...

434
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:32,116
stole Mone's clothes, copied her hairstyle,

435
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:34,117
and was full of hatred and envy toward Mone.

436
00:24:34,256 --> 00:24:36,627
I saw her acting like Mone at a club.

437
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:39,126
She's a thief who even stole Mone's song.

438
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:40,455
Right, what a thief.

439
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:41,596
Is that a bruise?

440
00:24:41,597 --> 00:24:42,765
Nice.

441
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:44,597
- Ouch. - Let's make it worse.

442
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:46,137
- Okay. - Okay.

443
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:49,366
Gosh. Look at all these comments.

444
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,067
I knew it.

445
00:24:51,107 --> 00:24:53,205
Hey, it's definitely over for her.

446
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:54,306
(Song Ji A is an immature bully. What a creep.)

447
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:55,405
(Is this for real? Who does she think she is?)

448
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:56,676
(You're not even a celebrity. Mone, are you all right?)

449
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:01,176
Song Ji A!

450
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:03,516
Come to the broadcasting station, immediately.

451
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:05,357
Is it true?

452
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:07,456
Did you steal Mone's song?

453
00:25:07,557 --> 00:25:08,986
Mone is lying.

454
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:10,426
I wrote the song.

455
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:12,597
I can show you the notebook I write songs in.

456
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:15,067
Here.

457
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:16,897
Then what about how you were a bully?

458
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:19,896
People are sending tip-offs...

459
00:25:19,897 --> 00:25:21,637
about how you beat them up and stole money from them.

460
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:23,706
How are you going to explain that?

461
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,076
You must have been the worst.

462
00:25:26,077 --> 00:25:27,736
Even your teacher gave an interview about it!

463
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:30,847
My teacher?

464
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:34,216
(Past teacher tells the story. Tell the truth, Song Ji A!)

465
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:36,986
Ji A was famous in school for being a bully.

466
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:39,915
She used violence against her classmates...

467
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,256
and took their things.

468
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:44,287
Even your homeroom teacher is saying so.

469
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:47,256
Do you still deny it? Do you?

470
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:55,807
Have you talked with Dad?

471
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:01,377
You blocked all of his emails and calls.

472
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:03,946
Did you know...

473
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:07,716
that Dad got remarried?

474
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:11,817
No. I had no idea.

475
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:16,087
You're the only thing I have, Mom.

476
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:21,127
She's so good.

477
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,666
That was great.

478
00:26:26,496 --> 00:26:28,337
- Is it taken care of? - Yes.

479
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:32,406
Good job with the interview.

480
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:35,475
My face was blurred out, but everyone still saw me.

481
00:26:35,476 --> 00:26:38,277
It wasn't easy for me as a teacher to make the decision to do that.

482
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:39,817
I'm thankful for that.

483
00:26:40,577 --> 00:26:43,847
Erica will be in the drama that Mone is in.

484
00:26:44,547 --> 00:26:46,015
She got good responses from her audition.

485
00:26:46,016 --> 00:26:47,256
(Drama actor agreement)

486
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:50,186
She's called Little Mone for a reason.

487
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:52,527
Does this character have quite a bit of screen time?

488
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:54,195
It's an important character, right?

489
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:57,765
That's up to the writer and director to decide.

490
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:58,965
Tell them...

491
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:01,067
to put her in at least three scenes every episode.

492
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:06,006
Also, I want Erica to start at Cherry Entertainment.

493
00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:09,806
You can pull some strings with Mr. Yang, right?

494
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:11,446
Why don't you ask him in person?

495
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:13,246
It's not as if you don't know each other.

496
00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:17,686
Then you ask for me, Mone.

497
00:27:17,946 --> 00:27:20,986
Mr. Yang wouldn't turn you down.

498
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:25,097
I'll get you a chance to meet him.

499
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:26,897
Please do it as soon as possible.

500
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,137
(Name: Erica, Guardian: Go Myoung Ji)

501
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,777
You are now gone

502
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:43,277
I can never see you again

503
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,916
I loved you more than I loved myself

504
00:27:48,617 --> 00:27:53,287
I hate myself for that

505
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:57,656
You should leave this drama.

506
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,925
People are saying they will boycott this drama if you are in it.

507
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:01,926
Do you know that?

508
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:06,936
Who is it?

509
00:28:11,637 --> 00:28:12,777
Hey. You thief.

510
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:17,807
What's with you guys? Why are you here?

511
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:20,516
Everyone.

512
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:23,916
This is Song Ji A, the girl who wanted to be a celebrity,

513
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:26,087
even though she used to be a bully in school.

514
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:29,386
Until recently, she was Han Mone's stylist.

515
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:32,627
She was also the one who stole the song Mone wrote...

516
00:28:33,597 --> 00:28:34,656
and used it for an audition.

517
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:37,066
She's such an ungrateful brat...

518
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:39,837
who repays her debts by betraying people.

519
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:43,735
That is my song.

520
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:45,336
Han Mone is the thief!

521
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:47,077
You must be out of your mind!

522
00:28:47,406 --> 00:28:48,807
Oh, my.

523
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:50,646
- No. - Look at this guitar.

524
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,476
No. Don't touch that!

525
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:54,016
- Oh, my. - She's so scary.

526
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:55,215
- Don't. - Should I smash it?

527
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:56,786
- Smash it! - Smash it!

528
00:28:56,787 --> 00:28:57,916
I'll smash it.

529
00:28:59,357 --> 00:29:00,387
No!

530
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:02,587
No!

531
00:29:03,756 --> 00:29:06,056
No...

532
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:07,097
That's mine.

533
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:08,466
No!

534
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:11,266
Come here.

535
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:14,897
Look at her.

536
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:18,206
Let me go.

537
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:20,877
You said you wanted to be a celebrity.

538
00:29:21,277 --> 00:29:23,107
Okay. I'll let you. Let's see your face.

539
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:25,176
- You need to become prettier. - Yes.

540
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,777
- Your skin is glowing. - You're prettier already.

541
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,107
- What? - Is this it?

542
00:29:58,617 --> 00:30:00,246
Hey. Is this the best you can do?

543
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:04,547
I only get ten dollars a week for allowance.

544
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,056
From now on,

545
00:30:06,057 --> 00:30:07,655
have your mom give you an allowance once a month...

546
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:09,027
instead of each week. Got it?

547
00:30:09,986 --> 00:30:12,627
Are you Messi or Ronaldo?

548
00:30:12,996 --> 00:30:14,926
Why are you getting paid weekly?

549
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:17,797
Get lost. Hurry up.

550
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,505
- Chief. - Chief.

551
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:26,935
I think we need to pick a new spot starting tomorrow.

552
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:29,307
Word must have gotten out that we take people's money here.

553
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:31,976
We've only gathered this much.

554
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:41,117
See you at school tomorrow.

555
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:43,685
- Okay. - Thank you.

556
00:30:43,686 --> 00:30:44,956
Take it easy.

557
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:51,266
Do you need money?

558
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:55,266
It'll take a while to live well by taking so little money at a time.

559
00:30:55,706 --> 00:30:56,966
Come work for me.

560
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,107
I'll help you make much more.

561
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:00,537
That crazy girl.

562
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:04,377
Juvenile offender, Song Ji A.

563
00:31:06,377 --> 00:31:09,287
People would be very surprised to find out you're a murderer.

564
00:31:09,547 --> 00:31:12,186
A murderer that killed your own father.

565
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:15,126
You didn't go to prison because you were a minor,

566
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:17,156
but your crime is pretty terrible.

567
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:20,196
What are you talking about?

568
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:25,696
I know much more about you than you think.

569
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:28,166
What do you want to do?

570
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:30,766
Will you do as I say,

571
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:33,307
or do you want to transfer schools again and live in hiding?

572
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:35,607
What do you want?

573
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:39,847
It's simple.

574
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:43,387
Serve me as your chief and make sure I get good grades.

575
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:04,436
(Han Mone)

576
00:32:11,006 --> 00:32:12,077
Han Mone.

577
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:15,416
Did you have to go this far?

578
00:32:17,547 --> 00:32:19,317
How does it feel to lose a bet?

579
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:21,387
I've only paid you back for what you did to me.

580
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:24,685
I really don't like being indebted to people.

581
00:32:24,686 --> 00:32:26,955
I won't let you get away with this.

582
00:32:26,956 --> 00:32:29,966
What are you going to do? You're just a bully.

583
00:32:30,797 --> 00:32:33,637
Stop acting up and beg for my forgiveness.

584
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:36,566
I'm willing to take you back since we have history.

585
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:40,006
Just be honest and say you need my talent!

586
00:32:40,337 --> 00:32:43,777
Your talent is only useful when I'm paying you for it.

587
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,416
Who would hire a bully?

588
00:32:47,016 --> 00:32:49,616
Even Mozart wouldn't be able to overcome a bullying scandal.

589
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:51,415
Why do you think I became a bully?

590
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:52,787
Whose fault was it?

591
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:56,255
I won't let you get away with this.

592
00:32:56,256 --> 00:32:58,056
I'm going to tell the world that you were the one...

593
00:32:58,057 --> 00:32:59,626
from Myeongju Girls' High School who had a baby!

594
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:01,256
Go ahead if you're confident.

595
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:04,196
I still have a card I can play.

596
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:09,666
You're a criminal who killed her own dad.

597
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:16,946
Murderer, Song Ji A.

598
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:24,185
Where did you hide the money?

599
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:26,955
I know you received money.

600
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:28,016
Hey.

601
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:30,886
Where did you put it?

602
00:33:30,887 --> 00:33:32,196
It's in the vase!

603
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:34,827
No. Don't tell him.

604
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:53,817
No.

605
00:33:54,347 --> 00:33:56,587
You can't take that.

606
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:57,787
Hey!

607
00:33:58,117 --> 00:34:01,586
No.

608
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:02,656
Gosh.

609
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:05,756
- Stop it! - Hey!

610
00:34:06,597 --> 00:34:10,027
I wish you would just disappear!

611
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:13,666
Look at these ungrateful brats.

612
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:17,737
Come here.

613
00:34:18,877 --> 00:34:21,306
Hey.

614
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:31,647
I told you not to hit Ji A, you monster.

615
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:38,186
Do you admit you killed your father with a weapon?

616
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:39,726
(Defendant)

617
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:43,595
- Yes. - As you are 14 years old,

618
00:34:43,596 --> 00:34:45,297
you are considered a minor.

619
00:34:46,797 --> 00:34:48,907
If there is something you'd like to say, please go ahead.

620
00:34:49,136 --> 00:34:51,467
(Song Ji Sun)

621
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:54,576
I'm the one who killed Dad. You didn't do anything wrong.

622
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:57,647
You have to study abroad.

623
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:59,777
Are you going to give up that great opportunity?

624
00:35:00,277 --> 00:35:02,915
We promised not to live a poor life like Dad.

625
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,345
No. I killed him!

626
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:06,286
Don't say anything!

627
00:35:10,556 --> 00:35:12,857
I won't let your life be ruined.

628
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:19,567
I'm sorry.

629
00:35:21,596 --> 00:35:23,306
I am very sorry.

630
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:26,706
I will make my ruling.

631
00:35:27,337 --> 00:35:30,475
The accused appears to have...

632
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:32,615
acted out of self-defence...

633
00:35:32,616 --> 00:35:34,576
against her father's continuous abuse.

634
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:37,745
As such, I sentence the accused...

635
00:35:37,746 --> 00:35:40,757
to short-term protective probation.

636
00:35:40,886 --> 00:35:43,157
(Judge)

637
00:35:56,907 --> 00:36:00,136
Next is case number 2013-9-321.

638
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:03,006
We will begin the trial for plaintiff Han Kyung Soo.

639
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:04,206
Han Mone.

640
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:06,316
You promised not to talk about that.

641
00:36:06,317 --> 00:36:08,047
So keep your mouth shut.

642
00:36:08,547 --> 00:36:09,686
Don't act up.

643
00:36:09,987 --> 00:36:12,586
Unless you want everyone to find out about your family.

644
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,415
You were the real bully.

645
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:17,527
I had to do it because you threatened me!

646
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:19,197
Do you have evidence?

647
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:21,526
Please know your place.

648
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:23,725
Stop trying to take what isn't yours.

649
00:36:23,726 --> 00:36:26,397
Do you know what bullying victims want the most?

650
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:28,837
Not seeing their bullies on TV.

651
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:32,206
Not having to see their bullies.

652
00:36:32,677 --> 00:36:35,007
So stay quiet for the rest of your life.

653
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:37,547
You know I'm scary when I lose it, right?

654
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:58,737
School bully, Song Ji A.

655
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:02,036
I'm sorry...

656
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:04,467
for disappointing you.

657
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,846
You should apologize to the victims, not me.

658
00:37:09,976 --> 00:37:11,547
I'm a bad kid.

659
00:37:12,616 --> 00:37:15,076
It was all me. I deserve this.

660
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:18,646
But I swear...

661
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:20,556
that I didn't steal the song.

662
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:23,257
I believe that.

663
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:25,186
Do you really believe me?

664
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:28,055
Your music is special.

665
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:29,496
That's how I know.

666
00:37:30,366 --> 00:37:34,197
Will a piece of trash like me be able to do music again?

667
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:38,166
Only you know the answer.

668
00:37:39,136 --> 00:37:42,277
I'll still wait for you as your number one fan.

669
00:37:57,657 --> 00:37:58,757
Hello.

670
00:37:58,996 --> 00:38:00,456
- Hello. - Hello, Director.

671
00:38:07,596 --> 00:38:08,596
Mr. Kang.

672
00:38:11,507 --> 00:38:13,277
You're Mr. Kang Ki Tak, aren't you?

673
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:17,107
How have you been?

674
00:38:19,317 --> 00:38:21,016
You did a good job going into hiding.

675
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:22,886
It took some work finding you.

676
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:25,345
Where's Madam No?

677
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,987
I haven't heard from her.

678
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:28,786
Not in a while.

679
00:38:32,996 --> 00:38:34,297
Give me a whisky.

680
00:38:55,217 --> 00:38:57,686
(1,000 dollars)

681
00:38:58,246 --> 00:38:59,456
Madam No.

682
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,726
Call me if you hear from her.

683
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:21,136
I didn't tell.

684
00:39:24,277 --> 00:39:25,507
Good.

685
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:27,516
Why won't you let me tell?

686
00:39:28,016 --> 00:39:29,716
You didn't betray him.

687
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:31,616
You were forced to lie to save us.

688
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:33,116
To keep us alive.

689
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:36,357
Quit that nonsense.

690
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:40,397
Keep saying you don't know where I am.

691
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:43,397
You can even say I'm dead.

692
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:14,857
Welcome.

693
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,096
Why did you ask to see me?

694
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:21,337
To apologize properly.

695
00:40:29,107 --> 00:40:30,377
I apologize...

696
00:40:30,947 --> 00:40:32,047
about last time.

697
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:36,746
Ms. Geum.

698
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:40,717
Thank you for coming to lead TIKITAKA Studio.

699
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:46,127
I wonder why you suddenly changed your mind.

700
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:50,797
Was it Mone?

701
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:53,967
Of course not.

702
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:57,636
Her request served as a good excuse.

703
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:01,737
To be honest,

704
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:04,706
it's me.

705
00:41:05,306 --> 00:41:07,176
I couldn't control the feelings...

706
00:41:07,177 --> 00:41:08,647
I had for you.

707
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:10,846
That's why I pushed you away.

708
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:17,556
And now?

709
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:21,897
Between love and work,

710
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:24,527
which is it?

711
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:29,766
It's both.

712
00:42:37,036 --> 00:42:39,306
Prosecutor General Um wants to meet you.

713
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:47,616
Will you...

714
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:49,487
let me down again?

715
00:43:01,556 --> 00:43:02,927
That's it for tonight.

716
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:25,587
(Ran Women's Hospital)

717
00:43:40,136 --> 00:43:41,197
What's this?

718
00:44:11,866 --> 00:44:13,036
Cha Ju Ran.

719
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:15,067
What is your true identity?

720
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:16,967
Why are you doing this?

721
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:18,806
Who are you?

722
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:22,136
Why didn't you say you were Chairman Bang's woman?

723
00:44:23,277 --> 00:44:26,016
Are you out to avenge your lover's granddaughter?

724
00:44:27,476 --> 00:44:28,576
You...

725
00:44:29,386 --> 00:44:31,786
You're Nam Chul Woo, aren't you?

726
00:44:32,317 --> 00:44:33,386
Why you...

727
00:44:33,556 --> 00:44:35,317
Where are you? I'll kill you.

728
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:36,487
Hey.

729
00:44:36,488 --> 00:44:38,185
You're Nam Chul Woo, aren't you?

730
00:44:38,186 --> 00:44:39,325
Darn it.

731
00:44:39,326 --> 00:44:40,596
Untie me.

732
00:44:44,127 --> 00:44:46,237
You said we shared the same fate...

733
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:48,467
and got us to the deserted island!

734
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:55,136
Why did you send this to me?

735
00:44:55,677 --> 00:44:58,845
What do you have against me that you'd do this?

736
00:44:58,846 --> 00:45:00,177
What's in there?

737
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,746
Can't you tell?

738
00:45:04,087 --> 00:45:05,147
It's drugs.

739
00:45:05,817 --> 00:45:06,886
Drugs?

740
00:45:08,016 --> 00:45:09,116
My gosh.

741
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:10,757
You're using drugs now too?

742
00:45:11,257 --> 00:45:13,726
Look at you. Your pupils are dilated.

743
00:45:15,927 --> 00:45:17,365
Don't feign ignorance.

744
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:18,826
I know everything.

745
00:45:21,297 --> 00:45:22,396
That envelope.

746
00:45:22,397 --> 00:45:25,136
I got something exactly like that.

747
00:45:25,266 --> 00:45:28,277
It's in my bag. See for yourself.

748
00:45:30,806 --> 00:45:32,047
Look inside!

749
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:50,927
You killed Bang Chil Sung?

750
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:54,766
You must know now you're after the wrong person.

751
00:45:59,976 --> 00:46:02,075
If you do, untie me.

752
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:03,746
You druggie fool.

753
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:38,806
I'd like to satisfy a personal curiosity.

754
00:46:40,116 --> 00:46:41,317
She was your biological daughter.

755
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,686
Why did you keep quiet when you knew...

756
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:46,616
she wasn't pregnant?

757
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:48,786
Do I have to...

758
00:46:50,286 --> 00:46:51,527
answer that?

759
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:52,696
You don't.

760
00:46:52,697 --> 00:46:53,927
I can guess the answer.

761
00:46:56,726 --> 00:46:57,826
Help me.

762
00:46:57,996 --> 00:47:00,067
I don't know how much you know about me,

763
00:47:00,897 --> 00:47:04,266
but help me find the person who's blackmailing me.

764
00:47:04,337 --> 00:47:05,436
You want me...

765
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:08,107
to join you in the mud?

766
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:11,607
Isn't that why you asked to meet me?

767
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:15,317
You're not entirely clean yourself.

768
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:18,717
Aren't you the person who's manipulating...

769
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:20,587
Detective Nam?

770
00:47:21,987 --> 00:47:24,826
You knew from the start that Lee Hwi So was innocent,

771
00:47:25,757 --> 00:47:27,427
so why did you make him guilty?

772
00:47:28,527 --> 00:47:29,666
Did K...

773
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:33,036
tell you to do so?

774
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:34,496
Geum La Hui.

775
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,366
Do you have more than one life?

776
00:47:54,317 --> 00:47:55,416
I am...

777
00:47:56,226 --> 00:47:57,487
pretty fearless.

778
00:47:58,286 --> 00:48:00,056
Now that you got involved,

779
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:01,326
see to it that...

780
00:48:02,427 --> 00:48:05,226
no one can come after Mone or me.

781
00:48:10,136 --> 00:48:11,607
I like your guts.

782
00:48:12,907 --> 00:48:15,406
Since you decided to be so frank,

783
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:17,346
I might as well tell you something amusing.

784
00:48:22,447 --> 00:48:23,817
Bang Chil Sung.

785
00:48:26,616 --> 00:48:28,317
He's still alive.

786
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:30,186
What?

787
00:48:31,456 --> 00:48:33,397
Does that count as help?

788
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:34,897
Where is he right now?

789
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:42,907
Where do you think is the safest place to hide?

790
00:48:44,907 --> 00:48:45,967
How about...

791
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:48,177
you show me what you can do?

792
00:49:05,257 --> 00:49:07,527
It's an emergency. We must meet up.

793
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:33,317
Chairman Bang.

794
00:50:40,587 --> 00:50:42,186
There are no listening devices.

795
00:50:42,516 --> 00:50:43,627
Okay.

796
00:50:44,326 --> 00:50:46,556
The person knows our darkest secrets.

797
00:50:47,027 --> 00:50:48,927
They're really scary.

798
00:50:49,427 --> 00:50:50,967
That's why we all got together.

799
00:50:51,697 --> 00:50:54,567
Let's share what was in our envelopes.

800
00:50:54,697 --> 00:50:55,836
I don't mind.

801
00:50:55,837 --> 00:50:56,967
- No! - No!

802
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:02,677
We're not that close.

803
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,647
Fine. As you wish.

804
00:51:06,206 --> 00:51:07,546
Where are we anyway?

805
00:51:07,547 --> 00:51:10,116
This building belongs to Cha Ju Ran.

806
00:51:10,886 --> 00:51:13,857
Bang Da Mi's grandfather built it himself.

807
00:51:14,456 --> 00:51:15,886
He left it to Ms. Cha.

808
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:17,956
Why would he leave it to you?

809
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:22,026
- He was my boyfriend. - What?

810
00:51:22,027 --> 00:51:24,026
- "Boyfriend?" - "Boyfriend?"

811
00:51:24,027 --> 00:51:25,865
- "Boyfriend?" - Gosh.

812
00:51:25,866 --> 00:51:29,266
Anyway, we're completely safe here.

813
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,407
Goodness.

814
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,305
Do you think you're so innocent?

815
00:51:34,306 --> 00:51:35,476
Shall I speak for you?

816
00:51:39,107 --> 00:51:41,547
Ms. Geum, explain what the emergency is.

817
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:46,916
I know who we're up against.

818
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,386
Bang Chil Sung is alive.

819
00:51:52,996 --> 00:51:54,996
Da Mi's grandfather?

820
00:51:56,056 --> 00:51:57,427
I knew it.

821
00:51:57,627 --> 00:51:59,197
There's no way...

822
00:51:59,837 --> 00:52:02,296
the sly old man would just die, leaving all his money.

823
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:03,967
If Chairman Bang is alive,

824
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:06,705
is Lee Hwi So not a murderer?

825
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,877
Why was he put away for life?

826
00:52:09,746 --> 00:52:11,007
What's important...

827
00:52:11,277 --> 00:52:13,516
is where Bang Chil Sung is hiding.

828
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:17,416
How could he be in hiding and not leave a trace for five years?

829
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,217
Do you think he's immobile?

830
00:52:21,386 --> 00:52:22,885
That's why we never saw him.

831
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:25,686
He could be working with Lee Hwi So already.

832
00:52:27,027 --> 00:52:28,127
Lee Hwi So?

833
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:31,496
Why is his face covered?

834
00:52:31,697 --> 00:52:33,996
He suffered serious burns five years ago.

835
00:52:34,837 --> 00:52:36,136
Hold onto him tightly.

836
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,076
No way.

837
00:52:44,076 --> 00:52:46,746
A safe place where no one can find him.

838
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:57,786
A place where no one can find him...

839
00:52:59,127 --> 00:53:00,656
- A prison? - A prison.

840
00:53:00,657 --> 00:53:02,996
- A prison. - Yes! A prison.

841
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:08,036
Chairman Bang and Lee Hwi So swapped places.

842
00:53:12,436 --> 00:53:14,805
If Bang Chil Sung is in prison,

843
00:53:14,806 --> 00:53:18,007
Lee Hwi So has to be behind all this.

844
00:53:19,346 --> 00:53:20,947
It has been five years, sir.

845
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:23,217
I came in person today.

846
00:53:23,616 --> 00:53:27,716
You have been through a great deal.

847
00:53:27,717 --> 00:53:29,416
It's nothing compared to your sacrifice.

848
00:53:30,927 --> 00:53:34,226
I plan to get you out tomorrow.

849
00:53:34,996 --> 00:53:37,566
I think they'll catch on soon.

850
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:40,536
I'm completely fine with that,

851
00:53:42,036 --> 00:53:43,736
but we can't let them...

852
00:53:43,737 --> 00:53:46,366
find out who you are.

853
00:53:46,536 --> 00:53:49,036
I'm organizing everything myself.

854
00:53:49,436 --> 00:53:50,947
Five years ago,

855
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:56,147
I should have gotten to know you better.

856
00:53:57,346 --> 00:54:00,616
If I had, you wouldn't have had to...

857
00:54:01,257 --> 00:54:04,726
suffer so much and so undeservedly.

858
00:54:05,186 --> 00:54:06,797
We can grow closer now.

859
00:54:07,427 --> 00:54:09,866
We have all the time we need.

860
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:11,527
Seeing you...

861
00:54:14,337 --> 00:54:15,697
makes me miss...

862
00:54:18,536 --> 00:54:20,976
my granddaughter Da Mi even more.

863
00:54:25,107 --> 00:54:26,176
Other than Lee Hwi So,

864
00:54:26,177 --> 00:54:28,845
he must have powerful allies inside and outside the prison.

865
00:54:28,846 --> 00:54:30,817
This isn't the work of just a few people.

866
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:34,357
You were Chairman Bang's lover. Can you think of anyone?

867
00:54:34,456 --> 00:54:37,527
I'm sure of one person. Executive Director Hwang Dong Hyuk.

868
00:54:38,056 --> 00:54:39,555
He'd willingly die...

869
00:54:39,556 --> 00:54:41,725
if the chairman asked him to.

870
00:54:41,726 --> 00:54:44,095
We must use that executive director.

871
00:54:44,096 --> 00:54:45,726
I have a good idea.

872
00:54:46,266 --> 00:54:47,666
Chairman Bang, Lee Hwi So,

873
00:54:48,397 --> 00:54:50,035
and their allies.

874
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,337
I know how we can take them down at once.

875
00:54:56,706 --> 00:54:57,907
Food.

876
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:01,277
Water.

877
00:55:04,886 --> 00:55:07,016
Food!

878
00:55:27,936 --> 00:55:29,507
What? Why?

879
00:55:30,507 --> 00:55:31,677
Why?

880
00:55:33,346 --> 00:55:34,447
What?

881
00:55:35,317 --> 00:55:38,986
Guard!

882
00:55:38,987 --> 00:55:40,316
Over there!

883
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:43,256
- Hurry! - Puke!

884
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,826
Puke!

885
00:55:46,596 --> 00:55:49,127
Inmate 501! Stay awake.

886
00:55:51,127 --> 00:55:52,926
- Call an ambulance. - Okay.

887
00:55:52,927 --> 00:55:54,265
Be quick!

888
00:55:54,266 --> 00:55:55,337
Hold him up.

889
00:55:58,337 --> 00:56:01,035
We'll drug Chairman Bang.

890
00:56:01,036 --> 00:56:02,736
If his life were in danger,

891
00:56:02,737 --> 00:56:04,776
Executive Director Hwang would show up.

892
00:56:04,777 --> 00:56:06,876
And Lee Hwi So will be notified.

893
00:56:06,877 --> 00:56:08,616
What if he dies before then?

894
00:56:09,047 --> 00:56:10,916
We can't kill more people.

895
00:56:10,987 --> 00:56:12,286
Ms. Go is right.

896
00:56:12,886 --> 00:56:14,415
We need the chairman alive...

897
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:17,725
if we're to get to Lee Hwi So and all the people involved.

898
00:56:17,726 --> 00:56:19,686
I'll drug him just enough.

899
00:56:19,897 --> 00:56:23,396
Let's start with getting him out of his cell.

900
00:56:23,397 --> 00:56:25,666
- And if we fail? - Then...

901
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,297
we must really kill him.

902
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:32,866
- Open the gate! - Come on.

903
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:35,906
Hurry! Move it!

904
00:56:35,907 --> 00:56:36,975
(Paramedics)

905
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,076
Get him in the ambulance!

906
00:56:40,377 --> 00:56:41,377
Careful.

907
00:56:44,116 --> 00:56:45,217
Go!

908
00:56:58,527 --> 00:57:00,436
Mr. Hwang, I have bad news.

909
00:57:00,766 --> 00:57:03,337
Mr. Bang was just taken to the ER.

910
00:57:04,107 --> 00:57:06,677
I think someone drugged his food.

911
00:57:07,136 --> 00:57:09,677
- What? - Meow.

912
00:57:11,976 --> 00:57:13,107
Meow.

913
00:57:21,686 --> 00:57:23,657
I caught a rat.

Where's Min Do Hyuk?

916
00:57:36,766 --> 00:57:39,737
He has another job to do, so he'll join us later.

917
00:57:39,936 --> 00:57:41,406
No one was to go off alone.

918
00:57:41,407 --> 00:57:44,006
Bang Chil Sung will be brought in soon.

919
00:57:44,007 --> 00:57:46,076
Then Lee Hwi So will show himself.

920
00:57:46,206 --> 00:57:47,716
You two, get Lee Hwi So.

921
00:57:47,717 --> 00:57:49,146
We'll follow the chairman.

922
00:57:49,147 --> 00:57:50,686
This is what he looks like.

Hello.

927
00:58:25,717 --> 00:58:27,087
It's Bang Chil Sung.

928
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:29,317
He was alive.

929
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:31,286
I recognized him right away.

930
00:58:31,587 --> 00:58:33,326
Now we only have to get Lee Hwi So.

931
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:36,096
Can you give me just five minutes?

932
00:58:36,697 --> 00:58:38,466
I want to speak with him in private.

933
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:39,826
In this situation?

934
00:58:41,036 --> 00:58:43,095
Did you actually love the old man?

935
00:58:43,096 --> 00:58:44,805
I'll never see him again.

936
00:58:44,806 --> 00:58:46,337
I want to know...

937
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,076
where he hid all his money.

938
00:58:50,107 --> 00:58:53,276
We could lose everything to Lee Hwi So.

939
00:58:53,277 --> 00:58:55,916
He had hundreds of millions of dollars.

940
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:58,346
Watch out. He's no pushover.

941
00:58:59,317 --> 00:59:00,817
Let our guard down, and he'll get us.

942
00:59:11,797 --> 00:59:14,567
What a life

943
00:59:16,737 --> 00:59:20,877
- Drop our worries and together... - Cha, cha, cha.

944
00:59:24,306 --> 00:59:26,976
Are you ready to talk now?

945
00:59:29,576 --> 00:59:32,116
So, where's Lee Hwi So?

946
00:59:32,947 --> 00:59:35,816
Lee Hwi So should be in prison.

947
00:59:35,817 --> 00:59:39,886
My gosh. Your loyalty is so touching.

948
00:59:40,397 --> 00:59:41,456
Darn you.

949
00:59:46,326 --> 00:59:48,166
Who else is working with you?

950
00:59:48,496 --> 00:59:50,567
I don't know. I really don't.

951
00:59:50,806 --> 00:59:52,306
I just took some money...

952
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:54,376
to make some calls.

953
00:59:54,377 --> 00:59:56,947
Do you take us for fools?

954
01:00:04,346 --> 01:00:05,846
Open your mouth.

955
01:00:06,147 --> 01:00:07,455
I like the one in the middle.

956
01:00:07,456 --> 01:00:09,056
- The centrepiece? - Yes.

957
01:00:10,786 --> 01:00:11,857

960
01:00:18,326 --> 01:00:19,496
Get them!

01:01:16,857 --> 01:01:18,357
They caught on.

967
01:01:18,657 --> 01:01:20,526
The tables have turned!

will become a hub for new technology and research...

986

After you died,

992
01:03:16,206 --> 01:03:18,407
I had nightmares for a long time.

993
01:03:19,206 --> 01:03:21,677
At first, I believed it was out of guilt.

994
01:03:22,476 --> 01:03:24,686
But now I see the real reason.

995
01:03:25,686 --> 01:03:27,416
It was your curse.

A trap to distract us.

1046
01:07:02,337 --> 01:07:04,336
This is a trap. Where's Chairman Bang?

1048
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:07,136
- What? - He escaped?

1049
01:07:07,737 --> 01:07:09,107
Then he didn't die?

1054
01:08:04,326 --> 01:08:07,127
seem to suspect that Mr. Bang is still alive.

If that's the case,

1056
01:08:10,036 --> 01:08:12,337
they could go back to the prison to check.

1057
01:08:12,737 --> 01:08:13,936
Before that,

1058
01:08:14,306 --> 01:08:16,076
we should go get him.

do I have to do?

Okay. Leave it to me.

Good job.

1068
01:08:39,596 --> 01:08:41,135
You could hand over Mr. Bang to us...

1069
01:08:41,136 --> 01:08:43,136
and join them before they get suspicious.

1070
01:08:43,197 --> 01:08:45,367

01:09:09,527 --> 01:09:11,766
I thought I was always alone...

1076
01:09:13,397 --> 01:09:15,197
because I was adopted.

1077
01:09:16,836 --> 01:09:17,936
But...

1078
01:09:18,907 --> 01:09:21,506
I found out after my mom and brother died.

1079
01:09:22,476 --> 01:09:23,675
What?

1080
01:09:23,676 --> 01:09:25,346

Lee Hwi So.

1084
01:10:08,516 --> 01:10:10,157

as to why your mom and brother died?

1094
01:11:15,117 --> 01:11:16,617
Did you hear about Min Do Hyuk?

1095
01:11:16,987 --> 01:11:19,385
I'm sure he's living like a loser getting drunk...

1096
01:11:19,386 --> 01:11:20,626
and getting into fights.

01:11:20,857 --> 01:11:23,096
I bet Do Hyuk has no idea...

1098
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:25,126
that we burnt his family to death.

1099
01:11:25,796 --> 01:11:27,596
This is a secret between the three of us.

1100
01:11:27,697 --> 01:11:29,567
It's a secret we must take to the grave.

1101
01:11:33,006 --> 01:11:35,006
I'm going to kill all of them.

1102
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,107
Yang Jin Mo.

1103
01:11:39,376 --> 01:11:40,577
Joo Yong Ju.

1104
01:11:41,917 --> 01:11:43,117
Hong Man Doo.

1105
01:11:43,876 --> 01:11:45,086
All of them.

1106
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:47,086
No.

1107
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:49,917
There's someone who's behind them.

1108
01:11:55,296 --> 01:11:57,667
Someone bigger than we can ever imagine.

1109
01:11:58,497 --> 01:11:59,697
A mastermind.

1110
01:12:35,936 --> 01:12:37,537
I still have no idea...

1111
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:41,037
why they had to kill...

1112
01:12:41,676 --> 01:12:43,037
my mom and brother.

1113
01:12:52,647 --> 01:12:55,117
(Gagok District to Transform Into a Cutting-Edge City)

1114
01:12:56,957 --> 01:12:58,056
You came for this, right?

1115
01:13:01,027 --> 01:13:02,926
This is your reward for your good work.

1116
01:13:03,697 --> 01:13:05,096
Buy some land there so we can hold it.

1117
01:13:06,527 --> 01:13:07,666
Near the well.

1118
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:08,867
(Abandoned well, abandoned structure, to be demolished)

1119
01:13:08,997 --> 01:13:10,136
I heard the news.

1120
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:13,136
Your granddaughter died.

1121
01:13:13,537 --> 01:13:14,636
She's still...

1122
01:13:15,506 --> 01:13:17,647
considered missing.

1123
01:13:18,247 --> 01:13:19,506
Don't worry.

1124
01:13:20,147 --> 01:13:22,077
I'll make sure you see her again.

1125
01:13:23,476 --> 01:13:24,987
Be it dead...

1126
01:13:26,086 --> 01:13:27,287
or alive.

1127
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:30,556
Hey, you.

1128
01:13:31,256 --> 01:13:32,626
Turn the car around!

1129
01:13:32,726 --> 01:13:34,125
Sir, we don't have the time for that.

1130
01:13:34,126 --> 01:13:35,295
We need to get you to the hideout.

1131
01:13:35,296 --> 01:13:37,596
No! I need to go!

1132
01:13:37,766 --> 01:13:41,367
I need to go and check for myself!

1133
01:13:41,497 --> 01:13:42,497
Hurry!

1134
01:13:42,498 --> 01:13:43,936
Hurry up!

1135
01:13:46,136 --> 01:13:48,006
Where do you want to go?

1136
01:13:48,207 --> 01:13:49,436
Gagok District.

1137
01:13:55,117 --> 01:13:57,886
We were totally fooled by Bang Chil Sung.

1138
01:13:58,346 --> 01:14:00,787
He knew our plan from the beginning.

1139
01:14:01,216 --> 01:14:04,426
There's a spy among us, so I'm sure it was easy.

1140
01:14:17,266 --> 01:14:20,006
Are you saying that I'm the spy?

1141
01:14:20,636 --> 01:14:23,136
You let Bang Chil Sung go, didn't you? You're his helper.

1142
01:14:23,336 --> 01:14:24,606
I had the feeling...

1143
01:14:24,607 --> 01:14:27,045
right when I heard you were his girlfriend.

1144
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:30,117
You're suspecting the person who got pepper sprayed?

1145
01:14:30,476 --> 01:14:32,686
How are you a detective with your terrible instincts?

1146
01:14:33,417 --> 01:14:35,716
How can we get anything done if we fight whenever we meet?

1147
01:14:37,016 --> 01:14:38,787
It's already out of our hands.

1148
01:14:38,987 --> 01:14:40,356
We need to tell the police...

1149
01:14:40,357 --> 01:14:42,125
that Lee Hwi So and Chairman Bang switched places.

1150
01:14:42,126 --> 01:14:43,625
The police can't catch them.

1151
01:14:43,626 --> 01:14:44,827
Nobody but I can do it.

1152
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:47,796
What are you talking about?

1153
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,935
I put a GPS tracker...

1154
01:14:49,936 --> 01:14:52,506
in Chairman Bang's body just in case.

1155
01:15:01,346 --> 01:15:02,446
Oh, my gosh.

1156
01:15:02,447 --> 01:15:04,917
You must be a genius!

1157
01:15:05,817 --> 01:15:07,957
Ms. Geum. The more I get to know you,

1158
01:15:08,216 --> 01:15:10,086
the more I want to offer you a job with the police.

1159
01:15:11,926 --> 01:15:13,125
Bang Chil Sung...

1160
01:15:13,126 --> 01:15:15,226
will lead us to Lee Hwi So.

1161
01:15:15,497 --> 01:15:16,697
When he does,

1162
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:18,497
we can get rid of both of them.

1163
01:15:18,596 --> 01:15:20,466
Hurry up and go,

1164
01:15:20,527 --> 01:15:21,636
Chairman Bang.

1165
01:15:22,136 --> 01:15:23,697
Go to Lee Hwi So.

1166
01:15:24,836 --> 01:15:26,237
But...

1167
01:15:27,537 --> 01:15:29,607
what's taking Min Do Hyuk so long?

1168
01:15:31,006 --> 01:15:32,907
Is he really someone we can trust?

1169
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:39,987
Their destination changed to Gagok District.

1170
01:15:41,117 --> 01:15:43,117
Mr. Bang insisted on going there.

1171
01:15:43,256 --> 01:15:45,327
Gagok District? Why there?

1172
01:15:45,787 --> 01:15:47,027
We'll know when we get there.

1173
01:15:47,357 --> 01:15:48,457
Turn the car around.

1174
01:16:16,817 --> 01:16:17,956
Hello?

1175
01:16:17,957 --> 01:16:19,327
Where are you?

1176
01:16:19,686 --> 01:16:20,956
Hurry up and join us.

1177
01:16:20,957 --> 01:16:22,255
Chairman Bang got away.

1178
01:16:22,256 --> 01:16:24,196
If you don't get here right now, you'll be at a disadvantage.

1179
01:16:24,197 --> 01:16:25,326
Okay. I'll be right there.

1180
01:16:25,327 --> 01:16:26,466
Where should I go?

1181
01:16:27,027 --> 01:16:28,197
All right.

1182
01:16:30,067 --> 01:16:34,506
Right. You should hurry up and go.

1183
01:16:39,046 --> 01:16:42,216
Matthew and Ki Tak will be here soon.

1184
01:16:42,817 --> 01:16:44,345
You have to stay here until then.

1185
01:16:44,346 --> 01:16:46,346
You can't go anywhere else. Okay?

1186
01:16:47,417 --> 01:16:51,157
Do everything you can to stay alive.

1187
01:16:52,426 --> 01:16:55,697
I'll find your granddaughter.

1188
01:16:55,997 --> 01:16:57,997
Thank you.

1189
01:16:59,126 --> 01:17:00,296
You should go.

1190
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:27,317
Who... Who did this?

1191
01:18:31,256 --> 01:18:33,686
Da Mi...

1192
01:18:36,197 --> 01:18:37,327
My dear Da Mi...

1193
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:44,907
(Bang Da Mi)

1194
01:18:45,506 --> 01:18:47,766
What are you doing here?

1195
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:09,326
You got here a lot faster than we expected.

1196
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,595
Where are you coming from?

1197
01:19:10,596 --> 01:19:13,026
I had something to handle over here.

1198
01:19:13,027 --> 01:19:15,666
- I see. - Why did you want to meet here?

1199
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:16,935
Chairman Bang is near here.

1200
01:19:16,936 --> 01:19:18,765
He's 5km away, and he's not moving.

1201
01:19:18,766 --> 01:19:20,567
We don't have time. Let's go.

1202
01:19:21,836 --> 01:19:22,976
Let's go!

1203
01:19:25,107 --> 01:19:28,117
Wait. Let's take my car.

1204
01:19:38,126 --> 01:19:39,755
They found out Mr. Bang's location.

1205
01:19:39,756 --> 01:19:42,056
- What are you doing? Get in. - Okay.

1206
01:19:46,167 --> 01:19:49,367
(Gagok District Development Location)

1207
01:19:49,897 --> 01:19:52,067
(They found out Mr. Bang's location.)

1208
01:19:52,306 --> 01:19:53,505
We're in trouble.

1209
01:19:53,506 --> 01:19:54,976
Mr. Bang's location has been exposed.

1210
01:19:55,336 --> 01:19:56,407
How?

1211
01:19:56,777 --> 01:19:58,407
How long will it take us to get to Gagok District?

1212
01:19:59,506 --> 01:20:00,806
We have to go another ten minutes.

1213
01:20:02,147 --> 01:20:03,546
Let's hurry.

1214
01:20:03,777 --> 01:20:05,787
We need to get to Mr. Bang before they do.

1215
01:20:26,567 --> 01:20:27,567
Da Mi...

1216
01:20:35,947 --> 01:20:38,947
What... You...

1217
01:20:43,117 --> 01:20:45,657
Grandfather, you're here.

1218
01:20:51,157 --> 01:20:54,426
Da Mi. I'm sorry.

1219
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,306
I found you too late.

1220
01:21:02,876 --> 01:21:04,077
Da Mi...

1221
01:21:05,046 --> 01:21:06,147
You...

1222
01:21:06,907 --> 01:21:09,376
must have been so cold and lonely.

1223
01:21:10,777 --> 01:21:11,917
No.

1224
01:21:12,686 --> 01:21:15,256
I knew you'd find me.

1225
01:21:20,327 --> 01:21:21,426
Da Mi...

1226
01:21:21,657 --> 01:21:25,897
I'm the one who made you like this.

1227
01:21:27,226 --> 01:21:30,096
What's so great about money?

1228
01:21:35,176 --> 01:21:38,476
Da Mi. Don't ever forgive...

1229
01:21:38,707 --> 01:21:42,046
your rotten grandfather.

1230
01:21:42,546 --> 01:21:43,617
Da Mi.

1231
01:21:44,987 --> 01:21:47,787
I'm so sorry.

1232
01:21:52,626 --> 01:21:54,686
I was wrong.

1233
01:22:18,846 --> 01:22:19,886
What is it?

1234
01:22:24,716 --> 01:22:25,857
That's Chairman Bang.

1235
01:22:26,827 --> 01:22:28,726
Why would he come to this empty field?

1236
01:22:28,997 --> 01:22:31,827
Did that old man hide his money here?

1237
01:22:31,966 --> 01:22:33,466
He's holding something.

1238
01:22:37,867 --> 01:22:39,367
Isn't that a skeleton?

1239
01:22:40,567 --> 01:22:42,175
Darn it! What are we doing?

1240
01:22:42,176 --> 01:22:43,376
Let's go kill him right now.

1241
01:22:43,777 --> 01:22:44,777
We can't.

1242
01:22:44,907 --> 01:22:47,876
If Bang Chil Sung dies, Lee Hwi So will never show up.

1243
01:22:49,846 --> 01:22:53,346
By the way, what is that thing inside the well?

1244
01:22:53,617 --> 01:22:56,117
- What? - Over there.

1245
01:22:57,216 --> 01:22:58,527
There are numbers on it.

1246
01:22:59,657 --> 01:23:00,926
No way.

1247
01:23:01,626 --> 01:23:02,926
Is that a time bomb?

1248
01:23:03,957 --> 01:23:04,966
- What? - What?

1249
01:23:05,497 --> 01:23:06,567
That...

1250
01:23:12,966 --> 01:23:13,966
You can't come here.

1251
01:23:14,207 --> 01:23:15,607
There's a bomb here.

1252
01:23:18,607 --> 01:23:21,046
- Stop the car. - We're almost there.

1253
01:23:22,176 --> 01:23:23,376
Stop the car!

1254
01:23:26,487 --> 01:23:27,817
We're turning back.

1255
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:30,856
What do you mean? Mr. Bang is right over there.

1256
01:23:30,857 --> 01:23:32,457
The Seven are waiting there.

1257
01:23:32,827 --> 01:23:34,256
That's why we need to go.

1258
01:23:34,586 --> 01:23:36,396
Are you going to give Mr. Bang up to them?

1259
01:23:36,397 --> 01:23:37,556
I can't do that.

1260
01:23:38,796 --> 01:23:40,067
What about Da Mi's revenge?

1261
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:42,367
Don't you know what he really wants?

1262
01:23:43,436 --> 01:23:44,537
Right now,

1263
01:23:45,867 --> 01:23:47,006
I only want to focus on him.

1264
01:23:48,277 --> 01:23:49,407
Stop.

1265
01:23:50,976 --> 01:23:52,107
There's a bomb there.

1266
01:23:52,247 --> 01:23:53,607
He's after you.

1267
01:23:54,006 --> 01:23:55,375
So what?

1268
01:23:55,376 --> 01:23:56,676
If you want to go back, go back alone.

1269
01:23:56,846 --> 01:23:58,586
I'm going to be with him until the end.

1270
01:24:00,787 --> 01:24:01,917
Darn it.

1271
01:24:20,737 --> 01:24:21,777
Mr. Bang...

1272
01:24:23,207 --> 01:24:24,277
Don't come!

1273
01:24:24,607 --> 01:24:25,907
You can't come here!

1274
01:24:26,247 --> 01:24:28,247
- Don't come here! - Mr. Bang...

1275
01:24:29,117 --> 01:24:30,317
Please...

1276
01:24:30,947 --> 01:24:32,947
Please don't come!

1277
01:24:33,117 --> 01:24:35,657
- Mr. Bang... No! - Don't come here!

1278
01:24:36,117 --> 01:24:37,157
There's...

1279
01:24:37,886 --> 01:24:41,357
There's a bomb here.

1280
01:24:42,697 --> 01:24:44,926
- Mr. Bang. - You can't come here!

1281
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:48,026
Don't come here!

1282
01:24:48,027 --> 01:24:49,136
What?

1283
01:24:49,796 --> 01:24:51,737
What is he saying?

1284
01:24:54,707 --> 01:24:56,976
- Don't come here, please! - I have to go to him!

1285
01:24:57,577 --> 01:24:59,476
- Don't come here. - Grandfather.

1286
01:25:00,806 --> 01:25:02,117
Please hurry up and go.

1287
01:25:02,346 --> 01:25:03,777
There's not much time left.

1288
01:25:08,716 --> 01:25:10,586
No, Da Mi.

1289
01:25:11,386 --> 01:25:15,327
I have to die here...

1290
01:25:15,726 --> 01:25:17,827
as Lee Hwi So,

1291
01:25:18,867 --> 01:25:22,037
so your father can move forward.

1292
01:25:22,697 --> 01:25:23,966
Da Mi.

1293
01:25:24,897 --> 01:25:26,107
I...

1294
01:25:27,636 --> 01:25:31,676
won't leave you alone ever again.

1295
01:25:32,907 --> 01:25:36,046
I love you, my dear granddaughter.

1296
01:25:37,546 --> 01:25:39,586
My dear Da Mi.

1297
01:25:42,117 --> 01:25:44,716
No! Mr. Bang!

1298
01:25:44,917 --> 01:25:45,926
Let go of me!

1299
01:25:46,186 --> 01:25:48,357
Let go! Mr. Bang!

1300
01:26:04,607 --> 01:26:06,647
Mr. Bang!

1301
01:26:26,567 --> 01:26:27,596
Mr. Bang!

1302
01:26:27,966 --> 01:26:30,296
No!

1303
01:26:30,796 --> 01:26:32,737
Let go of me! Mr. Bang!

1304
01:26:46,247 --> 01:26:48,787
I verified that Chairman Bang died just now.

1305
01:26:49,487 --> 01:26:50,487
Congratulations.

1306
01:26:51,016 --> 01:26:53,787
Everything is going according to your plan, K.

1307
01:26:59,226 --> 01:27:01,367
That old man lived too long.

1308
01:27:02,197 --> 01:27:03,336
It hurt my pride.

1309
01:27:23,457 --> 01:27:29,056
(Welcome, Lee Hwi So)

1310
01:27:33,796 --> 01:27:36,536
(Welcome, Lee Hwi So)

1311
01:27:36,537 --> 01:27:40,206
(Welcome, Lee Hwi So)

1312
01:27:40,207 --> 01:27:45,747
(Welcome, Lee Hwi So)

1313
01:28:16,777 --> 01:28:20,845
(The Escape of the Seven)

1314
01:28:20,846 --> 01:28:23,816
Who blew it up?

1315
01:28:23,817 --> 01:28:25,746
I'm positive there's a traitor among us.

1316
01:28:25,747 --> 01:28:27,585
If Min Do Hyuk is a double spy...

1317
01:28:27,586 --> 01:28:29,215
Why did Mr. Bang suddenly go there?

1318
01:28:29,216 --> 01:28:31,826
I want to let you know that I have something too.

1319
01:28:31,827 --> 01:28:33,826
I'd like to have a small party to celebrate.

1320
01:28:33,827 --> 01:28:35,796
The true culprit who killed Bang Da Mi...

1321
01:28:36,027 --> 01:28:37,556
Tell me right now!

1322
01:28:37,697 --> 01:28:39,696
Worst case scenario, all of us could die.

1323
01:28:39,697 --> 01:28:42,066
Ms. Geum and I will always work together.

1324
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:44,037
Is K in Korea right now?

1325
01:28:44,266 --> 01:28:45,966
All the pieces of the puzzle are coming together.
