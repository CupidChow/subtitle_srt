I won't forgive you even if you're my father.

14

20

K shot me.

21

Whether or not he's Chairman Sim's biological son,

Matthew is now the owner of TIKITAKA.

31
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,690
And he will soon take over Sungchan Group as well.

32
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,488
I don't care about people's backgrounds.

33

35
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,160
So?

36
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,400
Do you plan to threaten Matthew and get some money out of him?

37
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,370
Are you crazy? I can't go up against a madman.

38
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,000
All I want is the money.

39
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:26,739
As soon as I find Chairman Bang's money, I'll go abroad.

40
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,739
We should hurry...

41
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,449
before Matthew gets his hands on it.

42
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:32,579
How would we get the money that's buried under a playground?

43
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,590
You're saying you know where Chairman Bang's money is?

44
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,729
Let's split the money evenly when we find that money.

45
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:45,359
One more thing.

46
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,829
I think your Sungchan shares are also half mine.

47
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,268
I certainly contributed...

48
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:53,970
to you taking over Sungchan Group.

49
00:03:58,069 --> 00:03:59,910
If what Geum La Hui is saying is true,

50
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,509
the money is at a playground.

51
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,280
It's at 34 Deokseong-dong.

52
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,479
That's where my mom's house is.

53
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,919
The place where Bang Da Mi used to live.

54
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,160
I knew you'd come back. I've been waiting for you.

55

56
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,669
Did you know who I was?

57
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,879
I heard about you from Mr. Kang Ki Tak.

58
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,780
You were the last person who took care of Chairman Bang until the end.

59
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,260
No matter what it takes,

60
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,720
just stay alive.

61
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,559
I will make sure...

62
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,489
to find your granddaughter.

63
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,999
Thank you.

64
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,369
Get going.

65
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,140
Have you perhaps been in touch with Ki Tak lately?

66
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,010
I haven't heard from him since he said...

67
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,410
he'd test Lee Hwi So.

68
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:13,748
That man isn't Lee Hwi So.

69
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:15,049
Matthew was Sim Jun Seok.

70
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:22,460
Listen to me carefully.

71
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:24,358
Matthew killed Chairman Bang.

72
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,559
And now, he's after Chairman Bang's money too.

73
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,160
I will never let him take that.

74
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,320
As you said, Cha Ju Ran has come to steal the money.

75
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,950
Just act according to plan.

76
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:55,159
How dare you make us come and go when we're so busy?

77
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,459
We could have you arrested for not following orders.

78
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,559

Hey!

87
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,879
After them!

88
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,629
Geum La Hui, you snake.

89
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,400
You tricked me again?

90
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:38,970
Gosh, seriously.

91
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,419
Great work.

92
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,720
Now, K and Geum La Hui will start...

93
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,090
a dirty fight over this money.

Is it true that Ms. Geum La Hui joined hands with the murderer...

112

who killed her daughter?

113
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:57,309

123
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,850
Please explain this video.

124

126
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,619
By Chairman Bang, do you mean the late Bang Da Mi's grandfather?

127
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,859
Were you two fighting over Chairman Bang's money?

128

I don't even know who that is.

131

Yes.

You think...

I am Sim Jun Seok?

134
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,139
How could you think that I am that crazy psychopath?

135
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,939
I may be a crazy mother,

136
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,868
but how could I join hands with the murderer who killed my child?

137
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:01,409
This was all Sim Jun Seok's doing.

138
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:03,748
Sim Jun Seok heard that I was producing a movie about him,

139
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:05,008
so he's trying to take revenge.

140
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:07,820
You must not fall for the fake video created by Sim Jun Seok.

141
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,619
This is...

142
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,148
exactly what he was after.

144
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:16,190
and what you two are wearing now are an exact match.

145
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,129
Sim Jun Seok's DeepFake technology is world-class.

146
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,898
It's so meticulous that it's hard to tell truth and fiction apart.

147
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,329
You must never fall for it.

149
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:30,638
Then, the video of what happened at Chairman Sim Yong's house...

150
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,340
of the shooting could also be a DeepFake video.

151
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,509

152
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,879
Well, that...

I will schedule another press conference...

154
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,518

- Chairman Lee! - Come back!

157

- Chairman Lee! - Follow him!

158
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,999
I'm sure this is Chairman Sim's doing since he used Sungchan's app.

159
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,399
Min Do Hyuk could never come up with something like this on his own.

160

No way.

Chairman Lee is Sim Jun Seok?

00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,600
If that's true,

170
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:30,060

won't our movie also have to stop production?

really be stopped?

00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,229
Then will my Erica not get to star in the movie?

184
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,170
Do you want to have Erica star in this movie so badly?

185
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,138
Even when you are an assailant in the Bang Da Mi case?

186
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,409
Ms. Go Myoung Ji.

187
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,909
What are you talking about, Director?

188
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,278
You knew that Mone was the one...

189
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,550
who had a baby at school.

190
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,450
You're not just a bystander.

191
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:27,190
You're a murderer who drove her student over the edge.

192
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:30,629
I haven't revealed this until now...

193
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,960
because of one reason.

194
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:36,300
Mone promised me that she would reveal everything herself.

195
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,170
The truth will come out soon.

196
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,300
About Bang Da Mi's death...

197
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,869
and my sister, Song Ji A's death.

198
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,479
Song Ji A...

199
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,749
Song Ji A is her sister?

200
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,989
(Sungchan Hospital)

201
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,869
Darn it!

202
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,008
- Who did this? - It was Min Do Hyuk.

203
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,639
You fool!

204
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:23,909
You couldn't handle Min Do Hyuk?

205
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:35,420
My biggest regret is that...

206
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:40,190
I couldn't punish you when your mom died.

207
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,659
Now,

208
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,029
it's time for both you and me to pay the price for that.

209
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:01,619
Min Do Hyuk took Chairman Sim.

210
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,319
Chairman Sim just announced...

211
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,519
that he will hold an emergency press conference.

212
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,719
A press conference? Where is it being held?

213
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,090
It's in the lobby of Sungchan Group.

214
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,859
Take the guys and stop it this instant.

215
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:16,399
You can even kill them.

216
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,930
Both Min Do Hyuk...

217
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,898
and Chairman Sim.

218
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,040
Yes, sir.

219
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:26,869
Chairman Sim.

220
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,840
You can never stop me.

221
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,790
Han Na, is it tasty?

222
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,729
Is this time for a meal?

223
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,139
Come with me right now.

224
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,170
That hurts. Let me go!

225
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,138
What are you doing?

226
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,739
I'm going to reveal everything to the press.

227
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,080
About who this child is.

228
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,180
Seriously, you...

229
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,049
Han Na.

230
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,290
Stay here and eat by yourself for a bit, okay?

231
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,820
Follow me.

232
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,859
Are you that clueless about what's going on?

233
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
This is our chance.

234
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,898
People have started suspecting Matthew,

235
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,368
and if we reveal that she is Matthew's child,

236
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:29,439
everything will be over.

237
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,108
I can't have Han Na live her whole life as a madman's child.

238
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:33,238
Stop being a fool.

239
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,309
Does that matter right now?

240
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,879
You're the one who's foolish.

241
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,679
Even if you reveal that Han Na is Matthew's child,

242
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,878
that doesn't prove that Matthew is K.

243
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,749
That's why I'm saying I'll step up.

244
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,220
I was K's girlfriend,

245
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,019
and I had his child. I'll reveal all of it.

246
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,389
I'm taking Han Na.

247
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,859
Hey, Han Mone. Stop right there!

248
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,600
Han Money. Stop.

249
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,600
Where did No Han Na go?

250
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,769
No Han Na!

251
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,170
Darn it!

252
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,269
Han Na!

253
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,550
Han Na!

254
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,749
No Han Na!

255
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,269
(010-0287-5738, Grandma)

256
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,269
(010-0287-5738, Grandma)

257
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,810
What's this?

258
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,379
Is this your phone number?

259
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,409
Yes.

260
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,879
Be sure to call me when you get better.

261
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,019
I'd only feel at ease if I saw your face.

262
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:52,489
You want me to call you?

263
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,720
Okay, Grandma.

264
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,019
Be healthy.

265
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm sorry, but could I please borrow your cell phone?

266
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,340
How cute.

267
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,810
Let her use yours.

268
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,180
Thank you.

269
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,560
Grandma.

270
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,430
Are you okay?

271
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:35,399
Can you see me?

272
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:38,528
This won't do. Sir.

273
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,029
Please head to the hospital first.

274
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,169
He's in very bad condition.

275
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,340
No.

276
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,609
If not now,

277
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,940
there might not be another chance.

278
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,009
You might die at this rate.

279
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:52,479
It doesn't matter.

280
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,350
Is this what they call "You reap what you sow?"

281
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,119
The fact that I'll die at the hands of the monster I created...

282
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,070
If...

283
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,399
I die before I can reveal the truth about you...

284
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,070
If you die,

285
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,270
I will never forgive you.

286
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,040
Got it?

287
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,189
(Sungchan Group)

288
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:12,530
We're too late.

289
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:30,108
Please tell us who Sim Jun Seok is.

290
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,280
Is it Chairman Matthew Lee or Min Do Hyuk?

291
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,050
Which video is real?

292
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:36,520
Who is your real son?

293
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,949
Today,

294
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,790
I have come here...

295
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:45,689
to end the dispute about what's real and what's fake.

296
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:50,659
I will be sure to pay the price...

297
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,399
for only revealing the truth now.

298
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,540
My son is...

299
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,179
Min Do Hyuk.

300
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,649
- What? - Min Do Hyuk?

301
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,149
If Min Do Hyuk is his son...

302
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,350
Do you mean Min Do Hyuk is Sim Jun Seok?

303
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,050
Then, was Chairman Lee wrongfully accused?

304
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,689
No.

305
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,889
It is true that Min Do Hyuk is my biological son,

306
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,199
but Sim Jun Seok, the serial killer,

307
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,369
is Matthew Lee, the chairman of TIKITAKA.

308
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,169
- Sir! - Chairman Lee?

309
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,399
- Please explain! - What does that mean?

310
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,570
- Please tell us more! - How did this happen?

311
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,310
Sorry, sir.

312
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:35,080
We couldn't stop the press conference.

313
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:38,010
Good going, you idiot!

314
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:39,949
Luka, turn on the news.

315
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:44,449
Truthfully, Jun Seok is not my own flesh and blood.

316
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,790
The year Jun Seok turned 16, he fell off a horse.

317
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,889
Only then did my wife and I...

318
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:56,060
find out...

319
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,070
that Jun Seok was not our biological child.

320
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,299
Luka.

321
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,600
Delete all files on Lee Hwi So.

322
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,469
Yes, Chairman.

323
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,909
(File Delete Complete)

324
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,579
That man is a crazy murderer...

325
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,379
who even killed the mother who raised him.

326
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,820
The reason why I couldn't punish him at the time...

327
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:19,619
was because...

328
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,889
of my late wife's dying wish.

329
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,859
Honey!

330
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,300
Honey!

331
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,199
Jun Seok...

332
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,730
No matter what anyone says,

333
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,570
he's our son.

334
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,909
You have to protect him.

335
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,879
Honey!

336
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,049
Jun Seok...

337
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,419
It wasn't enough that he killed the mom who raised him.

338
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,689
In order to cover up the immoral affair that he had,

339
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,030
he brutally murdered Bang Da Mi's family...

340
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:04,330
and Min Do Hyuk's family as well.

341
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,899
and killed Song Ji A...

342
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:11,000
and made it look like she'd killed herself.

343
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,679
Song Ji A came to see me to reveal the truth.

344
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,179
But I didn't believe her.

345
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:25,919
I have a question.

346
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,188
How can we prove that Chairman Lee...

347
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:30,459
is Sim Jun Seok?

348
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,260
Can you give us some believable proof?

349
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,959
Gu Gang Jae.

350
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,500
My secretary Mr. Gu...

351
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:40,399
is Jun Seok's biological father.

352
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,039
- What? - No way.

353
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,168
- That's insane. - What?

354
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,369
- How... - But...

355
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,138
He's the one who switched his son with mine...

356
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:49,879
thirty years ago.

357
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:54,109
You can test their DNA right now if you want.

358
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,990
My secretary Gu Gang Jae...

359
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,990
is helping his son with his crazy antics even now.

360
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:05,429
He must be arrested first.

361
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,459
Darn it.

362
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,230
There's other proof...

363
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:12,199
that Matthew Lee is Sim Jun Seok.

364
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,500
It's Whitlow.

365
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:20,270
Jun Seok showed symptoms shortly after birth,

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,090
If he goes down, so do we.

551
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:33,388
Side with me if you want to live.

552
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:35,219
I found a boat to smuggle us out.

553
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:37,658
A boat?

554
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,159
I can do anything.

555
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:40,490
I'll be of use to you.

556
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,259
What do you say?

557
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,358
Will you die a bloody death at Matthew's hand...

558
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:47,530
or will you live happily in a world without him?

559
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:59,148
Even if Matthew beats me to death,

560
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:00,279
I won't side with you.

561
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,409
Let's go.

562
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,179
- Move. - Move it.

563
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:04,619
Get out of my way.

564
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:18,060
I saw the news.

565
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:20,429
Chairman Sim is dead.

566
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,138
The only thought in my head is...

567
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:27,939
that I want to catch Sim Jun Seok.

568
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:31,080
Where is he?

569
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,949
He went into hiding.

570
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:35,879
Not even the police can find him.

571
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:47,689
Han Mone.

572
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,529
I have nothing to say to you.

573
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,629
Put Do Hyuk on.

574
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,530
Put Min Do Hyuk on!

575
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:02,609
It's Mone. Will you talk to her?

576
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:07,480
What is it?

577
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,619
Now?

578
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,790
(Sim Yong tells press Matthew Lee is Sim Jun Seok and dies)

579
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,679
(Police say they will focus on catching Sim Jun Seok)

580
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,489
Darn it!

581
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:54,029
All this is down to you, the incompetent fool!

582
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:56,329
If we had killed Sim Yong sooner,

583
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,000
my plan would've been perfect!

584
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,029
The old man messed with me before dying!

585
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:02,940
I apologize.

586
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,310
I will...

587
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,009
attend Chairman Sim's funeral.

588
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:10,810
- A final goodbye... - What if I get caught?

589
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,610
Are you trying to end my life?

590
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,449
If you have time for that,

591
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,719
go and kill Lee Hwi So tomorrow!

592
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:20,750
And...

593
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,790
yourself too.

594
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:26,560
Your existence...

595
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,299
is a fatal weakness of mine.

596
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,730
I hope...

597
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:34,869
no one...

598
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,770
can prove you're my father forever.

599
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,009
What?

600
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:48,619
You can't...

601
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,020
do that much for your son?

602
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,020
I will...

603
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,429
carry out my last duty.

604
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:08,939
Han Mone contacted us.

605
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,069
I'll escort you.

606
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:11,369
No.

607
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,069
I'll handle her on my own.

608
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,380
No one should follow me.

609
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,869
Min Do Hyuk.

610
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,940
Is this where you've been hiding?

611
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,409
You're all dead.

612
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:57,509
Drop this and talk instead, scumbag.

613
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:11,119
You're done for now.

614
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,230
Han Mone, did you trap me?

615
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,069
Why did you kill them?

616
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:26,210
My mom and brother.

617
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,310
Min Do Hyuk.

618
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,580
They're ganging up on me.

619
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,759
Don't feel bad.

620
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,528
I'll punish you in return...

621
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:55,799
for all the innocent people you have killed.

622
00:38:57,299 --> 00:38:58,699
My only regret is...

623
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:01,409
that it took too long.

624
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,449
Don't ever come back,

625
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:09,850
even as a dog or a pig.

626
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:12,489
Do you think you can shoot me?

627
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:19,059
Why did you kill No Paeng Hee,

628
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,360
you piece of garbage?

629
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,670
Shoot me...

630
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,770
and she dies too.

631
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,369
Shoot!

632
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:35,270
Don't mind me and shoot!

633
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,080
Do Hyuk, shoot him.

634
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,540
We won't have a second chance!

635
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,449
Shoot him now!

636
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:41,980
Come on, shoot!

637
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:44,619
Shoot!

638
00:39:58,299 --> 00:39:59,469
Sorry, sir.

639
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:00,929
Mr. Gu told me to follow you.

640
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:02,469
You slowpokes.

641
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,540
It's great to see you.

642
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,619
What lovely weather.

643
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:22,888
Do you think...

644
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:25,589
it's safe for us to sit around and have coffee?

645
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:28,489
What if people see us?

646
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,199
Do you want to sit in a dark room, then?

647
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,769
Let's get some sun until we find a boat to take.

648
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,069
We people...

649
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,009
need to stand in the sun to shine.

650
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:42,508
Who knows? By tomorrow,

651
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,408
we might be at a Southeast Asian resort...

652
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,650
slicing a steak topped with lots of cilantro.

653
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,080
I should call my kids.

654
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:50,349
Don't!

655
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,489
What if they trace your phone?

656
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,719
Darling!

657
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,929
How did it go? Did you hire a boat?

658
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,159
No. Police are everywhere.

659
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,068
They can't smuggle anyone out.

660
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:07,798
After all that bragging,

661
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,569
it turns out you can't do anything.

662
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,100
Darn it.

663
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:15,540
Hey.

664
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:19,980
Who's that?

665
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,979
See?

666
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,790
I told you it would be tough.

667
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,919
What's going on?

668
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,159
How did she know where we were?

669
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,690
How else?

670
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,229
I called her.

671
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,259
What?

672
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:36,000
Darling.

673
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,329
You don't trust me?

674
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,170
How could I? Look at how things are going now.

675
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:42,129
Anyway,

676
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,099
La Hui is good at all the bad stuff,

677
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,339
so let's leave it to her.

678
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,239
Our boat will set sail tonight...

679
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,670
at 11pm.

680
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,040
At 11pm?

681
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:51,880
That's hours away.

682
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,409
Hey.

683
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,349
We're not celebrating anything.

684
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,049
Why are you dressed so flashy?

685
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,489
I tried to look as ordinary as possible...

686
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:00,889
like a tourist.

687
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:08,830
Since we're already here, shall we do some sightseeing?

688
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,758
- Should we? - Let's.

689
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:13,500
- Sounds good. - Yes!

690
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,298
Go!

691
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,270
Let's go.

692
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,909
It's so beautiful.

693
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:31,179
I wish Erica and Phillip were here with me.

694
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:33,420
That would've been so nice.

695
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,130
What are you up to?

696
00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:43,830
For our love.

697
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,029
You were making a wish, I see.

698
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,400
We haven't been on a proper date since we started seeing each other.

699
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:52,199
I'm sorry. And...

700
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:59,009
I'm hungry. Aren't you?

701
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,049
Geum La Hui.

702
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,380
Aren't you hungry?

703
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:06,690
Wait for me.

704
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,060
- Don't laugh, okay? - Okay.

705
00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:19,130
I'm a little happy right now.

706
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:22,639
We may be on the run now,

707
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:24,299
but I believe...

708
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,940
the day will come when we can shine like that sun.

709
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,279
Yes.

710
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,179
- By the way... - What?

711
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,650
That cloud is bothering me for some weird reason.

712
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,420
- The shape? - Yes.

713
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,889
I feel like I've seen it before.

714
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,580
Lee Hwi So. K has sent someone here.

715
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:13,448
That means he's going to blow this place up.

716
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:14,589
Come out now!

717
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,860
I can't. Just leave me behind.

718
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:23,429
Please save yourself!

719
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:25,299
If you don't, you could get caught!

720
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,509
It's open.

721
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,480
Did you arrive safely?

722
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:26,449
How is Lee Hwi So doing?

723
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,759
I have confirmed that he was working.

724
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:31,460
Are you ready?

725
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,130
Yes.

726
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,630
There's something I want to tell you before I go.

727
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:39,770
Go ahead.

728
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,179
I love you,

729
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,060
son.

730
00:48:11,759 --> 00:48:14,060
- Nice! - Yes!

731
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,859
We won't be able to eat this once we leave the country,

732
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,560
- so eat up. - Okay.

733
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:20,329
It feels like we're on a honeymoon.

734
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,999
What? Stop it.

735
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,468
In a little bit, we're going to get on a ship...

736
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:24,940
- that will smuggle us out, right? - Yes.

737
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:29,138
That leaves just the right amount of time...

738
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,338
for one more bottle of soju.

739
00:48:30,339 --> 00:48:31,809
- Nice. - Sounds good.

740
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,949
- Let's go. - Oh, right.

741
00:48:34,909 --> 00:48:36,750
I should've taken medicine for seasickness.

742
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:40,949
I get seasick just by looking at the water...

743
00:48:41,949 --> 00:48:43,489
while washing my face.

744
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,520
Ta-Da.

745
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,690
I brought some for everyone. Here. Drink up.

746
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,298
- Go ahead. - You are so prepared.

747
00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:54,429
I picked such a good leader, didn't I?

748
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,860
It feels like my eardrums are being ripped apart.

749
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:26,198
He is snoring so much. Gosh.

750
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:28,630
I thought there was an earthquake.

751
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,839
Wait. Why does my head hurt so much?

752
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:37,710
Hey. What's going on?

753
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,678
- I think we're tied up. - Oh, my!

754
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:41,150
Oh, my! Me too!

755
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,778
Oh, my! Have we been kidnapped?

756
00:49:43,779 --> 00:49:46,119
Honey. Wake up.

757
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,318
- Hey! Wake up! - Wake up!

758
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,460
What's going on?

759
00:49:50,759 --> 00:49:53,259
Where are we? I slept so well.

760
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:57,359
- Oh, no. - What? Why are we tied up?

761
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,928
I think we've been kidnapped.

762
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:01,000
Kidnapped...

763
00:50:01,429 --> 00:50:03,868
How dare someone kidnap me?

764
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:05,068
Who did this?

765
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:06,908
Hey! Stop the car! Now!

766
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:08,069
Who are you?

767
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,979
Where are we going?

768
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,339
Who are you?

769
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,610
Stop the car!

770
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,750
What?

771
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:19,750
What?

772
00:50:21,549 --> 00:50:22,619
Oh, my.

773
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,589
Geum La Hui?

774
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,060
What are you doing?

775
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:30,799
For Matthew to truly become Matthew,

776
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,069
you three need to be gone.

777
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:34,730
What are you talking about?

778
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,568
Is this the reason...

779
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:39,069
why you approached us?

780
00:50:39,509 --> 00:50:42,440
- You rotten... - Hey. Untie me.

781
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,579
- How dare you? - How could you?

782
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,008
Stick with me if you want to live.

783
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,079
I even got a ship to smuggle us out. Let's run away together.

784
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,279
I wouldn't work with you, even if Matthew were to beat me to death.

785
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,988
- Wait... - Move.

786
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:54,948
- Get away from me. - Get out of my way.

787
00:50:54,949 --> 00:50:55,949
We can't trust her.

788
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:08,770
It's me, Geum La Hui.

789
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,400
Let's negotiate.

790
00:51:13,409 --> 00:51:17,339
Do I have any reason to trust you again?

791
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,909
I have an incredible idea.

792
00:51:22,509 --> 00:51:24,218
Before that,

793
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:27,718
we'll have to get rid of those troublesome people ...

794
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:29,319
who know about your secret.

795
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,420
For good.

796
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:55,610
Where is this place?

797
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,849
Are we going to die?

798
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,380
Stop saying such negative things.

799
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,290
It's the perfect weather to die.

800
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,790
What are you doing? Take them.

801
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:09,860
Hurry up and move!

802
00:52:10,529 --> 00:52:11,829
Hey. Take them.

803
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:13,329
Where?

804
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,130
Where are you taking us?

805
00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:17,299
Where are you taking us?

806
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,839
Where are... Oh, my!

807
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,119
Matthew!

808
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:39,290
Let us out of here right now! Right now!

809
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,329
How could you treat me like those people?

810
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,860
How?

811
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:47,670
Did you forget our promise?

812
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:50,039
I was always on your side, Matthew!

813
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,968
How could you do this to me?

814
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:54,710
- Her plan was to backstab him, - Sim Jun Seok!

815
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,610
but she got backstabbed instead.

816
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,778
- Let me out right now, you jerk! - She has so much energy.

817
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,819
How can she still be at it?

818
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,619
That spiteful wench has a lot of energy too.

819
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,519
We must be getting punished for being bad people.

820
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,658
But why are we being punished by a crazy psycho?

821
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:13,588
This is too unfair.

822
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:16,259
The person who should be punished first is that jerk, K!

823
00:53:17,259 --> 00:53:19,360
I'm surprised Geum La Hui was brought here too.

824
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,629
Geum La Hui is just another person...

825
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,199
who knows who he is.

826
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,270
Do you think he plans to kill us all?

827
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:28,869
Probably.

828
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:41,690
He's coming!

829
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,589
Why?

830
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,960
(Younglim Home and Living Gangnam)

831
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,409
We're going to start playing a game of hide and seek.

832
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,839
Ten, nine, eight,

833
00:54:06,339 --> 00:54:08,079
- seven, six, - Let's run away.

834
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,610
- Run! - five...

835
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:15,089
Shall we start the hunt?

836
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:49,690
Hey!

837
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:04,799
Hey! Honey, run away!

838
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,199
Honey!

839
00:55:06,509 --> 00:55:07,509
Die!

840
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:09,409
Honey!

841
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:16,719
Why are you so cool? Darn it!

842
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:18,580
I can't live a day without you.

843
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,489
Let's survive this today. This way.

844
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:39,500
Don't shoot me.

845
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:43,310
Darn it!

846
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:27,290
What floor are you headed to?

847
00:56:51,779 --> 00:56:55,049
No matter how hard you guys fight, this place is your grave!

848
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,368
For the sake of Erica and Phillip,

849
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:15,630
I refuse to die like this!

850
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,569
(We'll help you over here.)

851
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:26,849
(See Younglim's diverse designs.)

852
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:27,850
Oh, my.

853
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:29,880
Run!

854
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,290
Run! Oh, my gosh.

855
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,428
Isn't it weird?

856
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:43,698
They're not coming after us.

857
00:57:43,699 --> 00:57:45,099
Those jerks.

858
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,500
They didn't aim directly at us as they shot.

859
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,170
It's like they were herding us to the second floor.

860
00:58:58,869 --> 00:58:59,869
This place...

861
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:04,810
is that deserted island in Jeju.

862
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:10,920
You're right.

863
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,319
There's the aurora over there!

864
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,190
Goodness.

865
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:20,929
That cave...

866
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:23,659
That's where we buried Joo Yong Ju's body.

867
00:59:23,799 --> 00:59:25,529
- What? - Right.

868
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,929
We did.

869
00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:45,679
Wild boars!

870
00:59:47,819 --> 00:59:49,549
Wild boars... Those are wild boars!

871
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,360
- They're wild boars! - Run!

872
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:03,270
- Hurry up! - Come on!

873
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:22,719
Where should we go now?

874
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,420
Over there. Let's go over there.

875
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,830
I'm dizzy.

876
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,940
I'm so thirsty.

877
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:42,540
What?

878
01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:56,250
- Let's go to the roof! - Hold on!

879
01:00:56,989 --> 01:00:59,059
Go! Hurry up! Run!

880
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,290
- Hurry up and run! - Go!

881
01:01:01,889 --> 01:01:03,159
Hurry!

882
01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:25,179
There's a helicopter over there.

883
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,159
You went through so much trouble getting here, Do Hyuk.

884
01:01:37,299 --> 01:01:38,330
Why?

885
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,100
I guess you didn't want to get dragged to the afterworld!

886
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,810
You guys only have one choice.

887
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,650
You can die here with Min Do Hyuk,

888
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,519
or come to me...

889
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,420
and become my loyal dog.

890
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,448
Stop with your nonsense!

891
01:02:01,449 --> 01:02:03,088
There's nothing worse than you.

892
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:05,389
I refuse to join you and do your dirty work again!

893
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,929
How could I trust you?

894
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,400
You betrayed me and tried to kill me, you jerk!

895
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,630
Why does that lady talk so much?

896
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:19,040
The choice is yours.

897
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,610
I'm not forcing you to do anything!

898
01:02:22,509 --> 01:02:25,980
Oh, right. I forgot to tell you something.

899
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:28,949
I set up...

900
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:33,048
time bombs all over this place.

901
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:34,049
What?

902
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:35,889
Honey!

903
01:02:37,089 --> 01:02:38,889
This place will blow up soon...

904
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,489
and disappear in moments.

905
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,560
They won't even be able to find your bodies.

906
01:02:45,699 --> 01:02:46,730
You have...

907
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:50,000
(Explosive materials)

908
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,339
exactly three minutes!

909
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,440
Three minutes?

910
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:56,409
- What? - No.

911
01:02:58,610 --> 01:02:59,639
No.

912
01:03:04,279 --> 01:03:07,690
Only those who join me on that helicopter will live.

913
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:10,519
You'll also have the luck...

914
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,719
of gaining incredible wealth and honour.

915
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,790
If you don't, what will happen?

916
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:24,170
If I join you,

917
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,040
will I be able to see my twins?

918
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:30,069
Can I...

919
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,880
live with my twins?

920
01:03:34,179 --> 01:03:35,380
Of course!

921
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,679
I can make your daughter the best actress there is too!

922
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:48,330
Then I'll join you.

923
01:03:52,299 --> 01:03:54,299
If I can live with my twins,

924
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:56,400
who cares if I'm a cowardly wench?

925
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:59,699
Criticize me if you want!

926
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:07,279
Nice to meet you.

927
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,509
My name is Go Myoung Ji.

928
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:11,749
As of today, I'm your assistant homeroom teacher,

929
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:14,419
so if you have any worries or concerns,

930
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,290
feel free to come see me.

931
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,659
I'll do my best to help you.

932
01:04:27,929 --> 01:04:29,528
I'm going to be with you no matter what.

933
01:04:29,529 --> 01:04:30,770
I'll do whatever you say.

934
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:32,739
If you want to die, I'll die with you.

935
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,639
If you want to be K's pawn, I'll do that too.

936
01:04:43,509 --> 01:04:46,049
Since when was I a good person?

937
01:04:46,779 --> 01:04:47,819
I...

938
01:04:48,589 --> 01:04:50,589
framed a young girl and said she gave birth.

939
01:04:51,489 --> 01:04:54,060
I even killed the old man I was sleeping with.

940
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:58,759
I could join hands with the devil in order to live.

941
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,029
Because evil always wins.

942
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:08,469
Okay.

943
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,650
Who bargains with life?

944
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,479
I refuse to give up.

945
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,650
Come to your senses. Let's all buck up.

946
01:05:19,779 --> 01:05:20,920
Just endure this a little more.

947
01:05:25,659 --> 01:05:27,959
As of today, I have been appointed to Seogang Police Station.

948
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,059
My name is Nam Chul Woo!

949
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,529
I will be the best police officer ever!

950
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:34,069
Salute!

951
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:38,500
Don't go! Don't go, you guys!

952
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,710
I don't plan to die,

953
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:43,539
nor do I plan to join you!

954
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,540
Do you think you're a deity, you jerk?

955
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:47,509
Darn it...

956
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:51,880
I... I don't know what to do.

957
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:55,089
Han Mone!

958
01:05:55,449 --> 01:05:57,388
If Min Do Hyuk dies,

959
01:05:57,389 --> 01:05:59,860
you'll escape the nightmare of Sim Jun Seok!

960
01:06:00,219 --> 01:06:01,589
Then you...

961
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:04,299
can become Han Mone, the top star, again!

962
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,929
Do you want to end your beauty...

963
01:06:07,469 --> 01:06:09,569
here, with Min Do Hyuk?

964
01:06:14,839 --> 01:06:15,909
Jin Mo!

965
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:19,109
I'll forgive you for everything...

966
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,080
that has happened!

967
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,150
You know, don't you?

968
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:26,579
You know where Min Do Hyuk...

969
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,350
hid Bang Chil Sung's two billion dollars, right?

970
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,420
With that money,

971
01:06:31,759 --> 01:06:33,989
all of us could live happily.

972
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,230
Do you want to ruin your life...

973
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,199
because of No Paeng Hee?

974
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:42,929
You said you lived an unfair life because you were an orphan.

975
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:46,170
You said you wanted to live in wealth!

976
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,040
I...

977
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,009
will make that dream come true!

978
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:53,949
Where's that old man's money?

979
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,779
No! Don't do it!

980
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:25,739
Darn it!

981
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,049
Gosh!

982
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,659
Tell me where that money is!

983
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,369
I'll tell you!

984
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,369
It's a place where they do natural burials!

985
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:01,610
(Han Hui Su)

986
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,860
Where Bang Da Mi and Bang Chil Sung were buried!

987
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:41,650
From now on, the seven of us are one team!

988
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:45,620
He's right. We share a fate.

989
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,759
Any traitors will be punished by death.

990
01:08:51,429 --> 01:08:53,969
There's one minute left.

991
01:08:54,999 --> 01:08:56,400
Get on the helicopter, everyone.

992
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,799
Run!

993
01:09:12,379 --> 01:09:14,620
Min Do Hyuk, I'm sorry.

994
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:19,259
My feelings for you were real.

995
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:21,860
Goodbye.

996
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:38,139
No!

997
01:09:42,509 --> 01:09:44,079
Hurry up!

998
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:24,219

999

(Younglim)

1000
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:09,469
Do Hyuk! Wake up!

1001
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,940
So you're Min Do Hyuk.

1002
01:11:13,299 --> 01:11:16,539
Thank you so much for protecting Da Mi until the end.

1003
01:11:17,379 --> 01:11:20,410
Also, I'm indebted to your mother and brother.

1004
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:21,709
We don't have time.

1005
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,179
We have to hurry.

1006
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,819
We need to get out of this building.

1007
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:28,588
Ki Tak, this flash drive has all the information on Luka.

1008
01:11:28,589 --> 01:11:30,690
- What are you doing? - You have to get out of here!

1009
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,759
You have to escape! Hurry!

1010
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,169
Do Hyuk!
