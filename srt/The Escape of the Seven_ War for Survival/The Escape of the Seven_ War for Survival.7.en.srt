13
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,700
Han Mone.

14
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,801
Da Mi.

15
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,471
Are you ready to reveal the truth?

16
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,471
When I become a top star, I'll repay you for everything.

17
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:20,441
So don't do a live stream.

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,281
So you don't want to lose anything, do you?

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,480
You don't have any more chances left.

20
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,820
Stop.

21
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,400
Mone!

22
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,971
What's wrong?

23
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:55,040
I killed...

24
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:56,480
Bang Da Mi.

25
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,709
What are you saying?

26
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,921
I killed Bang Da Mi!

27
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:03,520
I hit her with a rock!

28
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,891
No!

29
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,191
You didn't kill her.

30
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:11,431
Wake up, Han Mone. It was a dream.

31
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:12,961
You didn't kill her!

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,860
Ms. Geum.

33
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,901
You still can't get over her?

34
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,031
Are you going to stay trapped in there?

35
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,140
Follow me! Come on!

36
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,480
Do you still not know why I chose you?

37
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,949
It was because I liked...

38
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,319
how you did whatever you could to make sure you got what you wanted,

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,651
even if that meant cheating.

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,721
Your brazen and daring nature reminded me of me.

41
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,390
Was I wrong about you?

42
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,521
There was a message in the hotel room.

43
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,191
Someone knew about my past.

44
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,729
That I had a baby...

45
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,830
Hey!

46
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:52,901
Didn't I tell you?

47
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:55,001
You never had a baby!

48
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,440
Everyone keeps saying...

49
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:57,941
that this is Da Mi's curse!

50
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,880
It was an unavoidable incident caused by hallucinations.

51
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,550
It wasn't your fault!

52
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:06,380
Are you going to let all your blood, sweat, and tears...

53
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,681
end up a waste?

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,820
Do you want to go back to being at rock bottom?

55
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,491
What if...

56
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,621
Da Mi didn't die and is still alive?

57
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,990
There's no way.

58
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,531
Five years have passed already.

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,599
Da Mi and Joo Yong Ju are both dead!

60
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,771
Her adoptive father is still alive.

61
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,001
What if he shows up?

62
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,540
What will we do then?

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,070
How can someone sentenced to death show up?

64
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,610
Why don't you just give up now and retire?

65
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,380
I'll even set up a press conference tomorrow for you.

66
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,751
Your relationship with me is over!

67
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:47,290
Here. Tell your mom...

68
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,890
that you want to go back to being poor.

69
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:06,640
My daughter. Why is it so hard to get in contact with you?

70
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:07,911
Mom...

71
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,580
Why are you in the rain?

72
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,390
Things must be so hard.

73
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,821
I'm sorry that I'm not next to you.

74
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,961
I'm fine. Nothing's wrong.

75
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,701
How are you? Are you well?

76
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,930
How are Kyung Soo and Cheong Soo?

77
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,901
Did Han Kyung Soo get into trouble again?

78
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,480
Did he take money from Ms. Geum again?

79
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,911
How will he live without me?

80
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,680
Tell him to go die!

81
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,661
Bang Da Mi.

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,131
I don't care if this is a curse from you or not.

83
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,430
The people who survive are the winners.

84
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,670
I refuse to give up now!

85
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,881
You didn't kill her.

86
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,321
I know you.

87
00:05:43,471 --> 00:05:45,370
Luka, show me the Seven.

88
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,740
Yes, Chairman Lee.

89
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,050
Geum La Hui.

90
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:55,221
(Geum La Hui)

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,620
Han Mone.

92
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:04,761
Yang Jin Mo.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,131
Go Myoung Ji.

94
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,100
Nam Chul Woo.

95
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:18,810
Cha Ju Ran.

96
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,651
Luka. Coffee.

97
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:28,680
Yes, sir. I'll get you some coffee.

98
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:42,131
(LH CEO Geum La Hui)

99
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,581
Make her skin two shades darker.

100
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:00,919
Add more contour to her cheekbones.

101
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,081
Yes, ma'am.

102
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,221
Let's skip the blush and lipstick.

103
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:09,091
Make her look as hallowed and sad as possible.

104
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:13,900
As for her hair, make it look a little messy...

105
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,960
as though she didn't do it. You know?

106
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:17,670
Of course, ma'am. Don't worry.

107
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,100
Get going as soon as she's done.

108
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,040
Stay alert.

109
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,870
At this rate, you and I will both go down.

110
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,141
I don't have the luxury to watch you be weak.

111
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,289
- That was suffocating. - I was so scared.

112
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,790
Hey. When is she coming?

113
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,689
I'm dying of thirst right now.

114
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,961
Ji A went out to buy something.

115
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:50,131
Why is she so slow?

116
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:51,430
Hey, call her.

117
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,439
Hey, Slowpoke. Hurry up and get over here!

118
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,840
- Hurry up. - Why are you so slow?

119
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,141
Did you wait long?

120
00:07:58,271 --> 00:07:59,711
The line was really long.

121
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:01,640
What do you want to drink? I bought a variety.

122
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:02,810
Did you get a vanilla latte?

123
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,050
I didn't get that one.

124
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:06,411
I got a strawberry milkshake, though.

125
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:08,220
Don't you know I only drink vanilla lattes...

126
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,781
when I'm really stressed out?

127
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,620
How could you forget that?

128
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,320
You get paid double what other managers get!

129
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:15,961
You should earn your keep!

130
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,330
Do you want me to go and get it?

131
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,531
Forget it.

132
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,141
We still have some time. Right?

133
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,381
I have to talk to Ji A. Can you guys step out for a second?

134
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,410
You always leave us out.

135
00:08:37,411 --> 00:08:39,310
What kind of secret conversation are you having?

136
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,580
Can you include us too?

137
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,549
- No. You can't be included. - Darn it.

138
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,890
- Why would you be included? - Hey!

139
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,760
- That hurts. - Know your place!

140
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,891
- Hurry up and go! - Why are you doing this?

141
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,161
Is this a new song you're working on?

142
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:55,930
I really liked it.

143
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:57,531
Why are you going through my bag?

144
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,271
Aren't you going to give me this song anyway?

145
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,570
(Dear D)

146
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:10,310
Especially this song.

147
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:12,511
"Dear D."

148
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,121
The lyrics are really good too.

149
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,950
Were you busy these days because you were writing this?

150
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,420
I want to stop giving you my songs.

151
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:22,021
We're lying to people.

152
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,661
I'm scared we're going to get caught.

153
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,560
I don't want to lie anymore either.

154
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:28,329
Why?

155
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,631
Is the money I pay you not enough?

156
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:33,669
I calculate the royalties and pay you more than enough.

157
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,070
It's not about money.

158
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,469
If you're being respected as a talented singer-songwriter,

159
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,710
you should make your own songs.

160
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
I did what I could to give you three albums.

161
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,310
I made over ten hit songs.

162
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,521
Hey.

163
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,391
Hey!

164
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:58,231
You must be seriously mistaken.

165
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,731
They didn't become hits because your songs were good.

166
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:05,470
They were successful because the best arranger worked on it,

167
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,241
and I,

168
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:10,371
Han Mone, sang it.

169
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,840
In any case,

170
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:14,111
I want to stop now.

171
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,281
I can't give this song to you.

172
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,911
No, I won't.

173
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,481
Fine.

174
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:22,851
I'll pay you more from now on.

175
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:27,319
At this rate, you'll become rich by doing nothing.

176
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,090
Do you think I want to become rich?

177
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:31,589
Don't you feel bad for me?

178
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,590
Why should I feel bad for you?

179
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,231
Did I get your songs for free?

180
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,601
I gave you plenty of money,

181
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,141
and you even bought a studio apartment, thanks to me.

182
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:44,271
Shouldn't you be the one to thank me?

183
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,680
But...

184
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,049
(Shadow of Betrayal)

185
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,481

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,030
No, it's fine. You're not wrong.

367
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,091
Both of you...

368
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,131
are going to buy my pieces. Right?

369
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:32,429
- Yes, of course. - Yes, of course.

370
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,301
I'll send three pieces to each of your homes.

371
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,541
The price of my work has increased a lot since last year.

372
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,411
The cost of paint has gone up, so I had no choice.

373
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,150
Why is he refusing visitors?

374
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:52,919
He's not meeting anyone right now.

375
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,291
Come again some other time.

376
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,420
Hold on.

377
00:19:57,591 --> 00:19:59,591
Let me see the warden.

378
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,530
Tell him it's Yang Jin Mo from Cherry Entertainment.

379
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,749
Why is his face covered?

380
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,121
He suffered serious burns five years ago.

381
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,960
His oesophagus got burned too, so he can't talk.

382
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,460
Hold onto him tightly. Don't let go.

383
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,861
I just need some of his hair.

384
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,470
Darn it. I can't believe I'm doing this.

385
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
No!

386
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,841
Get him!

387
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,351
That crazy idiot!

388
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,591
What a rotten smell!

389
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,891
Are you sure he hasn't lost his mind too?

390
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,459
I think it'd be best for you to go.

391
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,989
What can someone like him do?

392
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,229
How annoying!

393
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,230
That lunatic.

394
00:21:31,621 --> 00:21:33,520
Someone named Yang Jin Mo came.

395
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,959
He said he knew the warden,

396
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,321
and he came into the prison.

397
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:41,331
Okay. Take care of Mr. Bang.

398
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,709
Did you meet with Lee Hwi So?

399
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,851
What about the DNA test?

400
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:01,080
We don't need to do one.

401
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:02,280
He's barely even human.

402
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,621
His entire body reeks, and he has lost his mind.

403
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:07,651
It's not what you're thinking. I'm positive.

404
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,820
- You're positive? - I'm telling you that I am!

405
00:22:10,821 --> 00:22:13,190
If you don't believe me, go see him yourself.

406
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,331
Darn it. Lee Hwi So, that lunatic.

407
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,240
My beautiful nose...

408
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,411
Oh, my gosh!

409
00:22:29,841 --> 00:22:31,209
It's been a while, Mr. Yang.

410
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,411
Kang Ki Tak.

411
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,321
What's this?

412
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,321
What are you doing in a room without the owner?

413
00:22:40,051 --> 00:22:41,520
Why are you scared?

414
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:47,490
You know I can't stand being in debt.

415
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:52,770
Even still, I won't kill you today.

416
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,811
Hey.

417
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,509
What do you think you can do?

418
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,239
Are you going to get revenge or something?

419
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,510
You're completely broke.

420
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,720
Hey. If you want to make a comeback, you should be born again.

421
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,351
Have some blood sausage soup while you're here.

422
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,990
Here.

423
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,290
Tiger.

424
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,030
Did you call for me, sir?

425
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,430
Gosh.

426
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:30,371
I have many things I want to ask you.

427
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,541
Min Do Hyuk and No Paeng Hee.

428
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:34,979
Where are they right now?

429
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,341
Why are you asking me that?

430
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:40,851
They're your people.

431
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,321
Or are they not anymore?

432
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:47,220
They really betrayed you, didn't they?

433
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,561
I will return...

434
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,000
to take back Taebaek.

435
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,440
Watch it for me until then.

436
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:12,381
Let's go, boys.

437
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:14,411
I won't show you to the door.

438
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,290
What is this?

439
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,561
How did he...

440
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:32,000
I have big hopes.

441
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,500
I find my dinner under the snow.

442
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,600
Hey.

443
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,270
You know what will happen...

444
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,280
if you tell Mom what happened at kindergarten, right?

445
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,851
Are you talking about when you hit Han Na's head?

446
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:48,651
Or are you talking about when you ripped Ms. Mi Ju's dress?

447
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,190
Don't talk to me like that.

448
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,361
Anyway, don't say a word.

449
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,919
Erica. Phillip.

450
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,260
It's time for dinner.

451
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,861
Yes, Mommy.

452
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,429
We can't thank you enough...

453
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,700
for always preparing delicious meals, Emma.

454
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:10,500
You're like my mother.

455
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:12,740
How sweet of you to say so.

456
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,780
I will go home.

457
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,180
Take some of the flowers in the living room.

458
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,280
Some of my students' parents gave them to me.

459
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:22,020
They're very expensive flowers.

460
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:24,891
So pretty. Thanks.

461
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:33,331
They're all wilting. Why is she telling me to take them?

462
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,960
Does she think I'm a beggar or something?

463
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,000
Gosh. She annoys me so much.

464
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,670
Erica.

465
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:41,601
Did you get in a fight at kindergarten today?

466
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,841
Your teacher called.

467
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,680
Actually,

468
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,611
Han Na pinched me when no one was watching,

469
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,920
but the teacher wouldn't believe me.

470
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:01,250
Really?

471
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,831
Phillip. Did Han Na really hit Erica?

472
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:12,101
- Yes. - Gosh.

473
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,601
What's wrong with Han Na?

474
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,341
Such a violent girl should be forced to transfer to another school.

475
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,170
- What does that mean? - Well...

476
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,141
It means to kick her out of the kindergarten.

477
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,381
Don't cry, honey.

478
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,980
You have such a soft heart, Erica. I'm worried.

479
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,381
I'll make sure Han Na is punished,

480
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,920
so don't cry and eat.

481
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,131
It's Dad!

482
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,401
- Dad! - Dad!

483
00:26:43,631 --> 00:26:46,130
Erica. Phillip. It's Dad.

484
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:47,370
How are you guys doing?

485
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:49,440
Let me see him too.

486
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,239
Honey.

487
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,410
Honey.

488
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:57,141
I miss you so much.

489
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,509
I miss you.

490
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,210
How is the weather in California?

491
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,850
It's really hot, right?

492
00:27:01,851 --> 00:27:04,250
The east side isn't hot at all. I'm fine.

493
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,051
You've already gotten tan.

494
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,560
Thankfully, Mr. Bang seems to have dodged the bullet...

495
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:13,990
by thinking on his feet.

496
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,000
We must get him out as soon as possible.

497
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,170
I'm so worried that something might happen to him...

498
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:20,801
before I finish things up.

499
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,301
But if we act too quickly, we might mess things up.

500
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:24,911
We must be careful.

501
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,911
I am aware.

502
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:29,380
Now that we have put them through a storm,

503
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,780
we should let them dry.

504
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,749
(Geum La Hui, Min Do Hyuk, Han Mone, Yang Jin Mo)

505
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,220
(Go Myoung Ji, Cha Ju Ran, Nam Chul Woo)

506
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:41,121
Focus on Nam Chul Woo.

507
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,489
There are rumours going around...

508
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,161
that he will be promoted to Seoul Police Commissioner.

509
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:50,661
The director of the Digital Crime Center.

510
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,871
The taxi driver who drove me to the Seoul Culture Forest.

511
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:55,199
Attorney Kim Soon Pyung.

512
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,000
They are all related to Da Mi's death.

513
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,439
The director and the lawyer fled overseas five years ago.

514
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,710
Their whereabouts are unknown.

515
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,780
With the taxi driver, we don't even know who he is.

516
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,750
They used deep fake, human image composition technology,

517
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,051
to make a video of Da Mi being shot.

518
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,291
That could be a clue.

519
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,391
This is a commercial...

520
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,730
by Sungchan Group made using deep fake technology.

521
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:23,331
As you can see, it doesn't look like a real person.

522
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:28,131
But the fake video of Da Mi that they made...

523
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:30,301
looked no different from the real thing.

524
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,210
Enough to fool the whole country.

525
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:36,940
Dad. Please don't do this.

526
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,250
Dad.

527
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,831
The technology is so advanced.

528
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,361
They can easily hide themselves using this technology.

529
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,200
Wherever they're hiding,

530
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:03,101
I am going to find them.

531
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,440
As promised, here are some of my shares in TIKITAKA.

532
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:12,779
It's your reward for taking care of the Jeju project.

533
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,010
Reward?

534
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:16,381
This is my project.

535
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,351
This is about my daughter!

536
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,220
I know.

537
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,631
That was my mistake.

538
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,290
(Used to be rivals, Chairman Bang's money)

539
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,690
(High Risk of Complications in Adolescent Pregnancy...)

540
00:29:57,091 --> 00:29:59,561
But no matter what anyone says, TIKITAKA is yours.

541
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:02,301
You thought of everything,

542
00:30:03,361 --> 00:30:04,561
and Mr. Bang provided the money.

543
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,470
I'm just helping out temporarily.

544
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:10,000
What I want...

545
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:16,010
is to find that monster who is hiding somewhere...

546
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,051
and putting on this show.

547
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,621
Who are you?

548
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,460
It is now time...

549
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:42,871
to tell Lee Hwi So about K.

550
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,641
To face K head on,

551
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,010
we need more power.

552
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,080
I am worried we might fail...

553
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:53,010
before we even start our revenge.

554
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,581
But...

555
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,220
I'm glad I have you.

556
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:04,990
Even if...

557
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,930
something happens to me,

558
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,301
please back up...

559
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,571
Lee Hwi So...

560
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,611
until the end, Mr. Hwang.

561
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,841
Please don't say such a thing.

562
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,151
I will stay with you until the end, Chairman Bang.

563
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,161
I knew we were lying to each other

564
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:40,260
But I loved you anyway

565
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:44,260
I was hopelessly drawn to you

566
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:48,071
The love I'd chosen

567
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,700
It was you

568
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,239
That was great!

569
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,911
- I love it! - That was awesome!

570
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:56,509
Gosh. That was great.

571
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,341
- This is going to be a hit. - Really?

572
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,411
You need to make it sound nice for me.

573
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:02,121
When did you write this song?

574
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,520
I had no idea.

575
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:04,949
Surprise.

576
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,820
Mone can write lyrics and compose, and her singing is perfect.

577
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:09,291
Aren't you too good to be true?

578
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,791
Do you like it too, Ms. Geum?

579
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,161
This is your best song yet.

580
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,560
Let's get ready to release an album right away.

581
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:16,530
Let's make this song, "Dear D," the title song.

582
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,371
- Mone! - Mone!

583
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,239
(I love you, Han Mone.)

584
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,610
- Mone! - I love you!

585
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:30,841
- Mone! - Mone!

586
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:36,480
- What is this? - What is all of this?

587
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:37,850
- Oh, my. - Gosh. Look at this.

588
00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:39,321
- Goodness. - This is amazing.

589
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:41,920
Hey. Look at this.

590
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,560
Mone. Why are you so pretty today?

591
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,729
You're like a princess.

592
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,999
Not long ago, Mone was a brilliant newbie.

593
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,870
Now she's a judge for an audition.

594
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:53,870
I'm so excited.

595
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,199
- Mone was a brilliant newbie. - Right.

596
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,140
You know she completely dominated her audition five years ago, right?

597
00:32:58,141 --> 00:32:59,239
She destroyed everyone.

598
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,640
Who was that girl again? Hong...

599
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:02,641
- Hong... - Hong Sa Ra!

600
00:33:02,642 --> 00:33:03,939
- Right. - You remember her, right?

601
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,750
That was so hilarious!

602
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:08,651
Right. Ji A.

603
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,280
Go to Cheongdam-dong and pick up my outfit.

604
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:13,351
Right now?

605
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,690
I'm going to get that tomorrow.

606
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,259
I need to pick up your jewellery anyway.

607
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,831
It's easier to make one trip.

608
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:20,631
I'm curious about the fit.

609
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:22,530
I need to try it on before to shoot to make sure.

610
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:24,259
- Right. - If Mone says so, that's right.

611
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,330
Ms. Mone.

612
00:33:25,331 --> 00:33:26,530
Are you ready?

613
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,000
- Yes. - Then we will start the shoot.

614
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,301
Okay.

615
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,969
- I'm nervous for her. - I'm nervous too.

616
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,341
- Listen to my heart beating. - Mone.

617
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,410
- You can do it! - Good luck!

618
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:37,610
How pretty.

619
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:38,750
Gosh.

620
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:44,450
You'll do it, right? Thank you.

621
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,690
(Open audition for actors)

622
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,841
Today is the audition, right?

623
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,611
Good luck.

624
00:34:08,141 --> 00:34:09,411
I don't think I'll be able to join.

625
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,340
I had something urgent come up.

626
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,811
What about your dream?

627
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,320
When will you stop letting people walk over you?

628
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,090
If you don't do anything, you'll never get a shot.

629
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,160
- Excuse me. - Yes?

630
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:31,230
Don't lots of celebs from OK Entertainment come here?

631
00:34:31,231 --> 00:34:32,771
Yes. How did you know that?

632
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,300
I know Han Sung Woo the CEO.

633
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,070
I see.

634
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:40,871
We do the hair and makeup for most of the top stars.

635
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,279
Our head director knows lots of people.

636
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,911
Is the rumour true?

637
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,210
What rumour?

638
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,950
Can you lean in closer?

639
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:54,891
That your head director is dating Mr. Han.

640
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,760
And your deputy director is their secret love child.

641
00:34:58,121 --> 00:34:59,961
That's news to me.

642
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,529
- Lady. - Hello, sir.

643
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,601
The deputy director is here.

644
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,839
I told you not to leave this...

645
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,240
in my route, didn't I?

646
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,610
I'm so sorry, sir.

647
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,569
Aren't you going to clean the floor?

648
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,580
- I will. - The customer left ages ago.

649
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,641
Okay.

650
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,609
Sweep the floor in time.

651
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,251
- What's all this? - I was sweeping up.

652
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,621
Just a moment.

653
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,989
- Lady. - Yes?

654
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,319
What did you do so wrong...

655
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,291
that you must grovel...

656
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:35,331
to a kid young enough to be yours?

657
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,831
Where's your self-esteem?

658
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,699
If you put up with this stuff at work,

659
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,739
do you know how let down your kids feel?

660
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,510
It breaks their heart to the point where it rots.

661
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,109
Hey. Who do you think you are?

662
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,581
Who are you?

663
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,720
You dirtbag jerk.

664
00:35:57,921 --> 00:36:00,121
Apologize to the lady, you crazy punk.

665
00:36:00,851 --> 00:36:01,950
What was that?

666
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,791
Hey. You!

667
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:11,960
Get the money ready.

668
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,470
I think I caught something big.

669
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,730
Are you sure?

670
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:16,941
That Han Sung Woo has an illegitimate kid?

671
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,141
I just need to confirm it.

672
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:21,541
Good job.

673
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,740
I'll wire the amount I promised.

674
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:27,710
I'm in a good mood.

675
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:29,450
How about I give you something extra?

676
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,520
Like what?

677
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:35,720
Would you like to know where Matthew Lee is right now?

678
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,831
I happen to know.

679
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Are you okay?

680
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,680
(Actress Han Mone)

681
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:08,860
- Good job. - Thank you.

682
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,490
Why are they all so boring?

683
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:14,060
We're looking for your rival, Mone.

684
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:16,129
We need someone who can sing, act,

685
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,299
and have something extra on top.

686
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,370
We'll never find someone like Mone.

687
00:37:21,371 --> 00:37:23,300
She's too talented for her own good.

688
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,969
Don't be too discouraged.

689
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,410
Who knows?

690
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,711
Someone might appear like a shooting star in the night.

691
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,750
Hello, I'm Song Ji A.

692
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:38,081
(Actress Han Mone)

693
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:40,851
Song Ji A? Don't you work for Mone?

694
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:43,791
- I do. - Were you aware of this, Mone?

695
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,831
This is awkward.

696
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,191
Will you give her full marks because she's a friend?

697
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,961
As if.

698
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
I'll excuse myself from her audition.

699
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,929
(Feel So Good Audition)

700
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,330
What'll you perform?

701
00:37:55,331 --> 00:37:57,300
I'll perform a song I wrote.

702
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,081
From the moment I saw you

703
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,150
I guess I believed in love

704
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:12,319
Just how we would end

705
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,121
I didn't know at the time

706
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:20,061
I knew we were lying to each other

707
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:25,001
But I loved you anyway

708
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:29,070
I was hopelessly drawn to you

709
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,870
- The love I'd chosen - Ji A, you're out of your mind.

710
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:35,110
It was you

711
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,010
Han Mone, you can't take anything anymore.

712
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,129
Is this a coincidence?

713
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,400
Or did you come looking for me?

714
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,141
Weren't you expecting me?

715
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:43,840
That's what I thought.

716
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:49,050
It's a first.

717
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,981
No one had tracked me down before.

718
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:55,220
It's a first for me too. I'd never missed the sea so much.

719
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:57,791
Don't worry.

720
00:39:58,461 --> 00:40:00,130
I won't mention business.

721
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:06,271
Shall we ride together?

722
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,400
Dive in.

723
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,200
You're drawn to me too.

724
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,211
I didn't go too far, did I, sir?

725
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,941
Emotions change every moment.

726
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,251
You can call me "Matthew."

727
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,161
It's cold out.

728
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,090
My vacation home is nearby.

729
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,530
Will you come?

730
00:41:44,831 --> 00:41:46,470
I was getting hungry.

731
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,530
I have no reason to refuse.

732
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:09,590
Sorry.

733
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:16,700
We're in trouble. Bang Da Mi showed up.

734
00:42:16,961 --> 00:42:18,200
Come to Hongryugak fast.

735
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,270
Don't ask any questions. Just get here!

736
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,340
(Cha Ju Ran)

737
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,521
(Hongryugak)

738
00:42:53,731 --> 00:42:54,831
What's going on?

739
00:42:55,231 --> 00:42:56,570
Why are you all here?

740
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:58,100
What are you on about?

741
00:42:58,101 --> 00:43:00,069
You texted us to meet you here...

742
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,871
since you had urgent news to share.

743
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,141
I did?

744
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,440
I'm here because you texted me.

745
00:43:05,441 --> 00:43:06,650
You said Da Mi was back.

746
00:43:07,081 --> 00:43:08,311
Why would I text you about...

747
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:11,050
Da Mi is no longer with us.

748
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:14,621
What kind of nonsense is this?

749
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,391
You said to ask no questions, so I flew here from Jeju.

750
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:19,791
- Who's toying with us? - Just a moment.

751
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:21,891
Ms. Geum, how do you know Da Mi?

752
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,550
Hello?

753
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:45,280
The door's locked.

754
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:46,950
What?

755
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,260
Are you sure you didn't text us, Ms. Geum?

756
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,630
I did not. How many times must I say it?

757
00:43:57,061 --> 00:44:00,530
Then no one here texted anyone else?

758
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,371
We must get out of here fast.

759
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,470
How can we get out when the door's locked?

760
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:13,180
- My gosh. - What's going on?

761
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:23,161
What was that?

762
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,500
My goodness!

763
00:44:35,501 --> 00:44:36,501
What's that?

764
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:42,211
- What is that? - Isn't it a casket?

765
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:44,210
Who's pranking us?

766
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:45,280
Answer me!

767
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:47,650
I'm a police commissioner!

768
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:49,550
Don't fear.

769
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:51,720
Don't open it!

770
00:45:19,211 --> 00:45:21,251
Joo Yong Ju?

771
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:34,990
My name is Bang Da Mi.

772
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,101
Among these people is my murderer.

773
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,130
- Show yourself! - Show yourself!

774
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,541
Look. Isn't that us? It is, isn't it?

775
00:45:45,171 --> 00:45:47,570
It's from that day Da Mi vanished.

776
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:49,810
Who filmed us?

777
00:45:49,811 --> 00:45:51,010
Show yourself!

778
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:55,950
Turn that off!

779
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,521
You killed me right here!

780
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:03,021
What's going on?

781
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,790
Bang Da Mi was alive?

782
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:07,331
Didn't you hear anything?

783
00:46:07,461 --> 00:46:08,890
She said someone killed her.

784
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,560
A murderer is among us.

785
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:12,501
How can a dead person get angry?

786
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,001
Right. Then what was that?

787
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:17,070
Is that a ghost?

788
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,770
I'm so darn innocent, okay?

789
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:22,170
Because I was in lockup the whole day.

790
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:23,310
Look at the screen.

791
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:24,879
I'm the only one who's not there.

792
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,150
I was at the police station too. You can check.

793
00:46:28,581 --> 00:46:29,650
You.

794
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,279
What were you doing there that night?

795
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,450
What?

796
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,590
What about you?

797
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:36,790
One of my students was going to stream.

798
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,661
As her teacher, I had to be there.

799
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:41,990
I went out of concern in case there was an accident.

800
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:43,100
Me too!

801
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:45,130
I felt sorry for a kid that was branded a witch.

802
00:46:45,231 --> 00:46:47,129
I was there to support her.

803
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,700
You expect me to believe that?

804
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:51,400
Will you get your heads on straight?

805
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,941
Whichever of you killed her, it's time to confess!

806
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,080
Because of one of you,

807
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:59,380
the rest of us who are innocent got dragged into this farce.

808
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,121
Yang Jin Mo.

809
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,921
Do you really have nothing to say?

810
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:10,191
Have you lost your mind?

811
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,061
You're suspecting me?

812
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,860
Bobble is dead.

813
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:17,900
She's most definitely dead!

814
00:47:29,811 --> 00:47:31,311
Get a grip, Han Mone!

815
00:47:33,211 --> 00:47:34,711
Get out of here before someone sees.

816
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,300
You.

817
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,900
You seem bothered.

818
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,839
Why would I feel bothered?

819
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,441
Mr. Yang.

820
00:48:00,771 --> 00:48:02,941
Why don't you just come clean?

821
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:06,510
The person who got Scarlet Letter together...

822
00:48:08,851 --> 00:48:11,050
was you.

823
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:12,621
Why you...

824
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:14,050
What was that?

825
00:48:14,521 --> 00:48:17,121
You said you didn't know Joo Yong Ju ran Scarlet Letter.

826
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,319
That was...

827
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,831
It was to help Mone.

828
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:24,461
Mone came to me wailing, and I had no choice.

829
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,930
You two.

830
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,130
Did you know each other before you met me?

831
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,501
- Ms. Geum. - No wonder.

832
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,601
I thought you were too close for no reason.

833
00:48:33,771 --> 00:48:36,280
Did you get together from the start to dupe me?

834
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:41,211
Fine. Let's all come clean.

835
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:43,320
What can't I say in this situation?

836
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,380
Han Mone.

837
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,690
You're the teen mom, aren't you?

838
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,860
You came to my clinic as Bang Da Mi and asked for an abortion.

839
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,461
I remember you clearly.

840
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,231
Bang Da Mi?

841
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,630
(Ran Women's Hospital: Bang Da Mi)

842
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,570
(Bang Da Mi)

843
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:01,371
Yes, Bang Da Mi.

844
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,641
Can I have the abortion today?

845
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,711
You really did?

846
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,609
Just a moment.

847
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:17,580
Then the girl I saw at the hotel with Yang Jin Mo was you, Mone?

848
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:20,021
Hey, you duped us all, did you?

849
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,050
You're Da Mi's murderer.

850
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,521
You planned it from the start.

851
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,359
Why else would you use her name?

852
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,630
No!

853
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,731
It really wasn't me.

854
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,961
Ms. Go, you saw Da Mi give birth.

855
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,230
No.

856
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:34,871
You were in the art room too.

857
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,799
You both were in uniforms and had similar heights.

858
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,041
I mistook you for Da Mi. That was my mistake.

859
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,510
How can you change your story now?

860
00:49:41,671 --> 00:49:43,780
The maternity handbook in Da Mi's locker.

861
00:49:43,911 --> 00:49:45,041
You put it there.

862
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,150
How dare you deceive the whole school?

863
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,280
But then, I fell for your innocent face too.

864
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:53,351
You freak.

865
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,691
How did you kill Da Mi?

866
00:49:54,851 --> 00:49:56,190
Where did you bury her?

867
00:49:56,191 --> 00:49:59,390
Why must we all go through this because of you?

868
00:49:59,391 --> 00:50:00,630
Make up for it!

869
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,460
Confess now!

870
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:04,859
I can't spend another second with that corpse!

871
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,161
You killed her!

872
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,430
Leave me alone!

873
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,941
Tell the truth!

874
00:50:11,601 --> 00:50:13,510
I'm the one person who shouldn't be here!

875
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:15,010
You think so?

876
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:16,541
Are you sure?

877
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,410
If Da Mi didn't have a baby,

878
00:50:19,411 --> 00:50:21,311
her stepdad had no reason to kill her.

879
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:22,581
So what?

880
00:50:22,582 --> 00:50:26,589
You turned Lee Hwi So into a druggie and locked him up.

881
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,820
Five years ago.

882
00:50:28,121 --> 00:50:30,421
I know you were stationed at Deokseon Police Station.

883
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,930
Should I play a video of you briefing the press?

884
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:35,630
Wait.

885
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,860
That was you?

886
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:40,501
Did you have something against Lee Hwi So?

887
00:50:41,231 --> 00:50:43,800
It was a shoddy investigation, then.

888
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,871
Did you swap culprits for a bribe?

889
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,371
What are you on about?

890
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,370
The evidence was crystal clear,

891
00:50:49,371 --> 00:50:51,239
and I just reported what I'd found!

892
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,911
The stepdad got the death penalty because of you.

893
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,911
How can you be so irresponsible?

894
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,621
Who put you up to it?

895
00:50:59,081 --> 00:51:00,719
We have the answer.

896
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,949
This punk is the reason...

897
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:03,921
we went through what we did on Jeju Island.

898
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:05,490
It wasn't me.

899
00:51:07,061 --> 00:51:08,090
It wasn't?

900
00:51:10,561 --> 00:51:11,760
It really wasn't.

901
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:13,930
I was...

902
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:15,871
following orders.

903
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:17,700
Orders?

904
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:20,371
Whose orders?

905
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,570
I can't say.

906
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,679
Just kill me!

907
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,581
Fine. I'll do the honours.

908
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:41,260
I doubt Nam Chul Woo will talk.

909
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,101
Don't give up already.

910
00:51:44,161 --> 00:51:45,400
What do you mean by that?

911
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:46,970
The most pressed...

912
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,430
always moves first.

913
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:52,700
Wait.

914
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:53,871
What's important...

915
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,481
is that we're all connected to Bang Da Mi!

916
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:58,411
Fighting among ourselves won't help.

917
00:51:58,581 --> 00:51:59,610
That is...

918
00:51:59,851 --> 00:52:02,251
what this person wants.

919
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:03,780
He has a point.

920
00:52:03,981 --> 00:52:05,950
Let's get rid of the body first.

921
00:52:05,981 --> 00:52:07,121
Someone might come by.

922
00:52:07,351 --> 00:52:09,960
Right. If the real cause of death comes out,

923
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:11,589
we might all get investigated again.

924
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:13,190
What? Are you saying...

925
00:52:13,191 --> 00:52:14,891
we need to get rid of that body again?

926
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:17,231
I can't. I won't, not ever.

927
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,871
The person who doesn't help is behind this, don't you think?

928
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:24,941
I'm innocent, so I'll do anything.

929
00:52:25,001 --> 00:52:26,411
I'm innocent, too.

930
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,411
My kids are waiting at home.

931
00:52:28,441 --> 00:52:29,680
Let's do it.

932
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,510
I know of a private crematory...

933
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:33,751
that handles this stuff.

934
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:41,121
This time, all of us must stand and watch.

935
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:45,061
So that the horrible thing won't ever show itself again.

936
00:52:45,691 --> 00:52:48,130
Let's stay until it turns to ashes.

937
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:03,041
Keep your wits about you.

938
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,510
Whatever happens, don't mention K.

939
00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:07,110
Or we both die.

940
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,380
I'd rather he came to kill me.

941
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,820
So I could see his face.

942
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:22,759
Ms. Geum.

943
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,630
You're so very lucky.

944
00:53:25,461 --> 00:53:28,430
No one seems to know you're Da Mi's biological mom.

945
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,770
Keep quiet.

946
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:33,570
Who do you think set this up?

947
00:53:34,271 --> 00:53:36,740
It can never be a minion like Joo Yong Ju.

948
00:53:37,211 --> 00:53:39,141
It's someone who does things big.

949
00:53:40,411 --> 00:53:41,950
Can you think of someone?

950
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:45,880
At the Jeju hotel. Do you know what my note said?

951
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,990
"Cha Ju Ran,"

952
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:51,621
"Bang Chil Sung's murderer."

953
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:53,260
"Murderer?"

954
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,830
Only we know about that.

955
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:57,000
No.

956
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,530
One more person knows.

957
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,101
Bang Chil Sung.

958
00:54:03,671 --> 00:54:05,400
Chairman Bang is alive?

959
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,740
He keeps appearing in my dreams.

960
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:10,911
I'm always the one trying to catch him.

961
00:54:11,311 --> 00:54:12,380
The chairman...

962
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:15,649
runs off saying, "Catch me if you can."

963
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,380
- It's no time to joke... - The old man.

964
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:18,680
He's alive.

965
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,090
His money vanished five years ago.

966
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:24,621
I bet he planned ahead.

967
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,900
Even if he were alive, he wouldn't be in good shape.

968
00:54:31,661 --> 00:54:33,271
He must have someone helping him.

969
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,400
Lee Hwi So.

970
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,340
It's him.

971
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,041
How interesting.

972
00:55:15,141 --> 00:55:19,010
Human trash ends up getting tossed into a heap of trash.

973
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,811
It'll be the future of those seven.

974
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,110
Why did you abandon me?

975
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,780
I cried so much as I waited.

976
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,820
You didn't lose me on the subway.

977
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:01,521
You left me there...

978
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,561
on the bridge.

979
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,990
You should've protected me.

980
00:56:08,691 --> 00:56:10,359
Isn't it your duty...

981
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,030
as the CEO of my agency to help me in a crisis?

982
00:56:12,561 --> 00:56:16,371
I had no idea you'd gone to a doctor pretending to be Da Mi.

983
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,671
That Dr. Cha is a witch.

984
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,641
How can a doctor divulge such information?

985
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:24,280
Do you think her silence would've kept the secret secure?

986
00:56:27,481 --> 00:56:29,210
Why were you in Mr. Yang's hotel room?

987
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:30,280
Were you...

988
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:32,750
sleeping around with him too?

989
00:56:32,751 --> 00:56:33,990
No.

990
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:42,391
How many more shocking secrets...

991
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:46,771
do you have?

992
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:49,430
Why don't you come clean?

993
00:56:54,141 --> 00:56:55,671
You and Da Mi.

994
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:57,311
What's the connection?

995
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,450
I noticed the look on your face.

996
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,920
Why did you rush over, pale as a sheet,

997
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,081
when you heard Da Mi was alive?

998
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:11,060
You know Da Mi too, don't you?

999
00:57:11,061 --> 00:57:12,191
Shut your mouth!

1000
00:57:13,461 --> 00:57:14,831
That's nonsense.

1001
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,830
I got dragged into this mess...

1002
00:57:17,831 --> 00:57:19,601
just because I'm the CEO of your agency.

1003
00:57:19,831 --> 00:57:21,299
If you have time for such nonsense,

1004
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,230
why don't you reach out to that boyfriend of yours?

1005
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,799
Whether you have to ask or beg,

1006
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,940
get him to help you.

1007
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:27,839
He and I are done.

1008
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,141
I lost touch with him.

1009
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,780
Be honest for once.

1010
00:57:32,211 --> 00:57:34,610
You lied about him being the father of your child, didn't you?

1011
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:38,320
You're just a piece of trash.

1012
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,191
I should have cut off the root of all this trouble in the first place.

1013
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:09,780
No...

1014
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,360
I didn't know he'd really kill Da Mi.

1015
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,061
I didn't know!

1016
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:30,541
So? Did you look into it?

1017
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,911
The 27 people who died on the deserted island...

1018
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,810
were all first-year members of Scarlet Letter.

1019
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:38,009
- See for yourself. - Are you sure?

1020
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:40,351
I even tracked all the overseas usernames.

1021
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,879
Seeing how only his most active followers...

1022
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,550
had been chosen and killed,

1023
00:58:44,751 --> 00:58:47,120
this is definitely connected to Bang Da Mi.

1024
00:58:47,121 --> 00:58:49,149
I can't believe it.

1025
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,989
Bang Da Mi's revenge.

1026
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:53,860
I'm going to take this chance and get my revenge too.

1027
00:58:56,061 --> 00:58:58,030
My mom and my brother.

1028
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,400
I'm going to avenge them.

1029
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:07,070
All right. Let me know if you need anything.

1030
00:59:07,271 --> 00:59:08,641
I'll help.

1031
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:38,840
I'm leaving right now. See you there.

1032
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:44,541
It's been a while.

1033
01:00:46,501 --> 01:00:47,610
Let's go for a drive.

1034
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,220
(Tire pressure is low. Put air in tires.)

1035
01:01:24,441 --> 01:01:25,610
Darn it!

1036
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:33,921
You were right.

1037
01:01:34,751 --> 01:01:36,390
Han Mone finally made a move.

1038
01:01:36,391 --> 01:01:38,490
- Who did she meet with? - Um Ji Man.

1039
01:01:39,121 --> 01:01:40,461
He became the Prosecutor General today.

1040
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:45,529
- Luka, turn the TV on. - Yes, Chairman Lee.

1041
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:48,399
Today, Prosecutor General Um Ji Man got his certificate of appointment.

1042
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,800
His inauguration ceremony was held at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

1043
01:01:52,271 --> 01:01:53,811
I'll create a Korea...

1044
01:01:53,941 --> 01:01:57,240
where the people make the laws and the laws protect the people.

1045
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:58,679
I'll become a leader...

1046
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,950
who works hard and devotes myself to the people.

1047
01:02:03,751 --> 01:02:05,250
Could it be Um Ji Man?

1048
01:02:05,251 --> 01:02:06,621
The one who's behind all this.

1049
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,150
Maybe,

1050
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,090
maybe not.

1051
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:12,061
We'll see.

1052
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,331
They'll find the culprit themselves...

1053
01:02:15,891 --> 01:02:17,130
if they want to survive.

1054
01:02:17,831 --> 01:02:19,731
We should have someone follow Um Ji Man.

1055
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:24,570
- Really? - Yes.

1056
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,010
- Really? - Ms. Geum.

1057
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:29,470
Did you see today's scandalous article?

1058
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,340
- Is it about Mone again? - No.

1059
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:34,481
It's about you.

1060
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,219
The mysterious CEO of TIKITAKA, Matthew Lee,

1061
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,460
has been revealed to be the boyfriend of...

1062
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:46,320
LH Media's CEO, Geum La Hui.

1063
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:50,759
The two of them first met on their trip to Jeju with Mone.

1064
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,759
They seem to have gotten close...

1065
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,770
while overcoming the tragic incident together.

1066
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,270
Gosh, that's amazing. Ms. Geum, is this true?

1067
01:02:57,271 --> 01:02:59,540
The moment Matthew Lee saw you,

1068
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:02,239
he fell head over heels...

1069
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,239
in love with you.

1070
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,379
Ms. Geum, is Matthew Lee this good-looking in person?

1071
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,050
He has such a sexy body.

1072
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,950
What? Gosh, it's Matthew...

1073
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,320
I think we should meet.

1074
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,090
I think so too.

1075
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,691
If I'm right about the schedule of the studio...

1076
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:57,101
Don't worry.

1077
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:01,230
The schedule of TIKITAKA Studio is going according to plan.

1078
01:04:01,231 --> 01:04:03,871
He's more than I've ever imagined.

1079
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:05,641
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

1080
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:09,070
I'm sorry.

1081
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:11,110
It was an important call, so I couldn't hang up.

1082
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:13,280
It must have been exhausting to come all the way here.

1083
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:15,811
No, I came here with a happy heart.

1084
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,661
I feel awkward for no reason.

1085
01:04:26,421 --> 01:04:27,760
The reporters overreacted.

1086
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:33,001
I have a meeting soon, so I'll get straight to the point.

1087
01:04:35,001 --> 01:04:37,271
The position of the studio's CEO has become vacant.

1088
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:40,540
The nominee had a moral flaw.

1089
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:41,671
Oh, dear.

1090
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:44,210
I didn't know.

1091
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:45,311
Speaking of which,

1092
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,450
I don't want you to get your hopes high.

1093
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:56,791
In no way will you ever be the CEO of TIKITAKA Studio.

1094
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,760
What are you...

1095
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,030
I'm warning you.

1096
01:05:04,331 --> 01:05:06,560
Please don't sway my people into telling you my whereabouts,

1097
01:05:06,561 --> 01:05:08,271
or show up accompanied by reporters to take pictures...

1098
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:11,340
anymore.

1099
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,541
That is such an amateur move.

1100
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,340
I had to fire my innocent chauffeur today.

1101
01:05:23,411 --> 01:05:24,521
Is that why...

1102
01:05:25,581 --> 01:05:27,489
you wanted me to come all the way here?

1103
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:28,750
Should I just have texted?

1104
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:31,020
I was trying to be as polite as I can.

1105
01:05:31,021 --> 01:05:32,090
This is the first time...

1106
01:05:33,391 --> 01:05:34,460
someone has ever insulted like this.

1107
01:05:34,461 --> 01:05:35,960
It will be your last...

1108
01:05:35,961 --> 01:05:37,461
since we won't be seeing each other again.

1109
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:43,500
I don't know how distinguished you are,

1110
01:05:43,501 --> 01:05:45,870
but I've made advancements in this industry because I'm competent.

1111
01:05:45,871 --> 01:05:47,440
Then compete by showing how competent you are,

1112
01:05:47,441 --> 01:05:48,911
instead of using tricks.

1113
01:05:50,941 --> 01:05:53,581
No matter how much capital you have,

1114
01:05:54,211 --> 01:05:56,080
if someone unworthy is given the position,

1115
01:05:56,081 --> 01:05:59,650
your money and hard work won't shine through in the end.

1116
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,590
I don't think that's any of your business.

1117
01:06:04,521 --> 01:06:06,061
I apologize if I overstepped.

1118
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:10,130
I hope TIKITAKA Studio is a success.

1119
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,061
I won't walk you out.

1120
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:18,740
Bring me some jasmine tea, please.

1121
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,041
One cup.

1122
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:37,921
Darn it!

1123
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:44,561
You'll end up wanting me, eventually.

1124
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,331
I'll make it happen, no matter what.

1125
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,711
Yes, Mr. Na.

1126
01:06:57,141 --> 01:06:58,780
Are you done with the arrangement already?

1127
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:00,980
Ms. Geum, you have to check out this video.

1128
01:07:00,981 --> 01:07:01,981
I'll send it to you right now.

1129
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:04,949
(Final Winner: Song Ji A)

1130
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:08,489
I knew we were lying to each other

1131
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:09,520
What is this?

1132
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:12,291
But I loved you anyway

1133
01:07:19,231 --> 01:07:20,870
Ms. Geum, I can explain everything.

1134
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:22,231
Shut your mouth.

1135
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:27,510
Is it true?

1136
01:07:27,811 --> 01:07:30,510
Do all your self-composed songs belong to Ji A?

1137
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,380
No, they belong to me.

1138
01:07:37,851 --> 01:07:39,650
I paid for them, fair and square.

1139
01:07:41,121 --> 01:07:42,191
You get out.

1140
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:55,601
I didn't want to disappoint you.

1141
01:07:55,831 --> 01:07:58,101
I did it because I wanted to succeed.

1142
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:00,941
Keep this in mind.

1143
01:08:01,671 --> 01:08:03,311
Do you know what you did wrong?

1144
01:08:03,441 --> 01:08:05,710
I don't care that you can't write songs.

1145
01:08:05,711 --> 01:08:07,680
I don't care that you bought the songs.

1146
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:11,851
What's important is that you didn't tell me.

1147
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:13,580
If I had known about this from the beginning,

1148
01:08:13,581 --> 01:08:15,719
I could have easily controlled Ji A.

1149
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,791
I'm sorry. Help me.

1150
01:08:17,891 --> 01:08:18,891
Me?

1151
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:22,030
Why should I?

1152
01:08:23,831 --> 01:08:26,761
You're not worth anything now.

1153
01:08:28,301 --> 01:08:29,631
Ms. Oh, come in.

1154
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:31,940
Ms. Oh!

1155
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:35,471
Yes, Ms. Geum.

1156
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:36,940
Tell the reporters...

1157
01:08:37,411 --> 01:08:39,040
that LH Media will no longer...

1158
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:40,950
be renewing our contract with Mone.

1159
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:43,881
You have to sell before it goes bad to get your money's worth.

1160
01:08:44,051 --> 01:08:45,149
Excuse me?

1161
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:47,450
Ms. Geum!

1162
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:49,190
Ms. Geum!

1163
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:50,921
Ms. Geum!

1164
01:08:58,030 --> 01:08:59,630
- Oh, my gosh. - What are we going to do?

1165
01:08:59,631 --> 01:09:00,770
I don't know.

1166
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:08,139
What do you think you're doing?

1167
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,440
I have no reason to be here anymore.

1168
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,150
That is my song, you crazy witch!

1169
01:09:15,911 --> 01:09:17,650
- She's so mad. - Right.

1170
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:19,480
"Dear D."

1171
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,421
Do you know who I was thinking about when I wrote that song?

1172
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,591
Da Mi.

1173
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,530
So,

1174
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:30,560
will you be able to sing that song?

1175
01:09:31,431 --> 01:09:32,431
What?

1176
01:09:32,432 --> 01:09:33,631
Five years ago,

1177
01:09:33,761 --> 01:09:35,699
it wasn't Da Mi who gave birth in the art room.

1178
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,131
It was you, Han Mone.

1179
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,540
I knew that but I looked the other way.

1180
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:41,569
And I was so sorry and regretful about it.

1181
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:42,841
That's why I wrote the song.

1182
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:45,711
You can steal all my other songs,

1183
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,450
but I'll never let you steal that one.

1184
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:50,649
Gosh, what are they saying?

1185
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:52,080
- I can't hear anything. - What if she's in trouble?

1186
01:09:52,081 --> 01:09:53,520
This is so frustrating.

1187
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:55,791
Do you think I'll let you get away with this?

1188
01:09:57,121 --> 01:09:59,221
You'll never be in my show.

1189
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:00,931
You want to début?

1190
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:02,331
Don't even dream about it.

1191
01:10:03,131 --> 01:10:05,229
I'll do anything I can to stop it.

1192
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:07,060
Do it if you can!

1193
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:11,240
I'll expose who you really are to the world first.

1194
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:14,541
"Han Mone, the celebrity, was a bully at Myeongju High."

1195
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:17,070
"She was an irreverent student..."

1196
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:20,681
"who paid for her test scores and went out with men every night."

1197
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,411
Was it you?

1198
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,081
You were the one who tipped off the director?

1199
01:10:25,181 --> 01:10:27,181
You may be a famous celebrity,

1200
01:10:27,721 --> 01:10:29,120
but you're done.

1201
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:30,251
Don't be ridiculous!

1202
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:33,190
I was a great student all three years of high school.

1203
01:10:33,661 --> 01:10:35,560
I entered university at the top of my class!

1204
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,700
Nobody knows that I was the chief.

1205
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,131
But,

1206
01:10:39,431 --> 01:10:42,371
everybody from Myeongju Girl's High School knows that you were a bully.

1207
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,530
Do you want to bet?

1208
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:46,939
Who will be the one to stay on the show?

1209
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,770
Who will be the one to lose more?

1210
01:10:49,671 --> 01:10:50,841
At the least,

1211
01:10:51,911 --> 01:10:53,440
I'll never lose to you.

1212
01:10:57,751 --> 01:10:58,881
Hey!

1213
01:11:00,251 --> 01:11:01,590
- Let go. - Goodness.

1214
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:02,620
- Hurry. - Go.

1215
01:11:02,621 --> 01:11:04,489
- Oh, my gosh. - Stop them.

1216
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,461
Mone, watch your face.

1217
01:11:06,591 --> 01:11:08,029
- Let go! - Hey.

1218
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,631
Stop. Gosh.

1219
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,400
- Bring it on! - Hey, let go of me!

1220
01:11:12,461 --> 01:11:14,431
- Come here! - No, stop!

1221
01:11:16,631 --> 01:11:17,700
Guys!

1222
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:19,840
The bunny goes...

1223
01:11:19,841 --> 01:11:21,440
- hippity-hop. - Hippity-hop.

1224
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:27,650
Hey, mister.

1225
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,251
Why did you come to our house again?

1226
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,720
Our house?

1227
01:11:34,721 --> 01:11:36,590
Hey, this is my house.

1228
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:38,059
I bought this house.

1229
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,519
Everything you eat and wear.

1230
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,591
Right,

1231
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:41,830
and things like this.

1232
01:11:41,831 --> 01:11:43,029
It's all my money.

1233
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:44,261
Didn't you know?

1234
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,631
Han Na, wash your hands and go to your room.

1235
01:11:48,831 --> 01:11:50,270
I'll make you a snack.

1236
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:55,041
I don't want you to be alone with that man.

1237
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,681
Han Na, listen to me.

1238
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:59,911
Hurry up and get out of here, mister!

1239
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:05,381
Why that little...

1240
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,150
I'm hungry. Give me some food.

1241
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:26,841
Why are you having so much trouble eating?

1242
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,210
What do you mean?

1243
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:31,540
My business is doing great and my life is going smoothly.

1244
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:32,881
Why would I have trouble eating?

1245
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,411
Something's wrong, isn't it?

1246
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,081
I'll go and give Han Na her snack.

1247
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:39,950
Sit down.

1248
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,621
I told you I hated eating alone.

1249
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:45,019
I'm not asking you to eat with me.

1250
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,560
You can't even sit down for a second?

1251
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:49,931
All right.

1252
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,471
Then you do something for me too.

1253
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:00,000
What is it? Go ahead and tell me.

1254
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,610
What? Do you need money?

1255
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,510
Name the amount.

1256
01:13:03,511 --> 01:13:05,211
When have I ever been cheap with you?

1257
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,650
Ki Tak was released from prison, right?

1258
01:13:11,581 --> 01:13:12,621
Did you meet with him?

1259
01:13:16,751 --> 01:13:18,761
I see that you still haven't come to your senses.

1260
01:13:18,921 --> 01:13:20,460
Why are you thinking about the guy you betrayed?

1261
01:13:20,461 --> 01:13:22,229
If he catches you, you'll die!

1262
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:23,931
Don't you know you're safer with me?

1263
01:13:24,761 --> 01:13:25,961
So you did meet with him.

1264
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,830
You're talking a lot.

1265
01:13:27,831 --> 01:13:29,431
You made me lose my appetite.

1266
01:13:29,631 --> 01:13:30,730
Darn it.

1267
01:13:35,871 --> 01:13:37,140
Do you have feelings for me?

1268
01:13:39,341 --> 01:13:40,581
That's too bad.

1269

Detective Kang, you can brief me tomorrow.

1276
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,961
This is urgent. It'll only take a second.

1277

What is it?

1278
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:29,529
The blood samples of the surviving seven...

1279

of the mass casualty case on Osan Island...

01:14:41,671 --> 01:14:42,940
What's going on with you, Detective Kang?

1285
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:46,780
We already announced the results of the investigation.

1286
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:49,850
Sir, you were directly involved in this case.

1287
01:14:50,081 --> 01:14:51,920
I know you didn't stop by the hotel to patrol it.

1288
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:55,721
You were one of the 33 winners to attend the event.

1289
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,090
I will ask the superiors to officially forfeit...

1290
01:14:59,091 --> 01:15:00,421
your authority in leading the investigation.

1291
01:15:01,661 --> 01:15:04,761
We'll restart the investigation from the very beginning.

1292
01:15:05,331 --> 01:15:06,501
Your response isn't necessary.

1293
