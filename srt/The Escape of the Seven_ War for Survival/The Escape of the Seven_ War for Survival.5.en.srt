What the defendant, Lee Hwi So, did to his adoptive daughter...

15
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,586
would be considered sexual grooming.

is going crazy over TIKITAKA, the messaging app.

190
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:36,206
With the advancement of secret chatrooms,

191
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:37,946
analysis shows they have targeted...

192
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:40,146
the exact needs of privacy-conscious people today.

193
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:42,775
Their advertisements with top star Han Mone...

194
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:44,745
as their model are gaining a lot of popularity as well.

195
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:45,817
(You know about tonight's party, right?)

196
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:48,256
Hey, TIKI. Prepare for a party.

197
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:51,357
With TIKITAKA, it's totally new.

198
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:53,995

199

complicated payments are made easy.

200
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:58,096
If you want your privacy,

201
00:12:58,097 --> 00:12:59,425
trust TIKITAKA.

All of our moments, TIKITAKA.

206
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:11,846
A trip to Jeju Island sponsored by TIKITAKA...

207
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:12,905
and joined by Mone.

208
00:13:12,906 --> 00:13:14,546
Let me announce the lucky winners!

209
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:18,385
Join me, Mone, on a trip to Jeju Island!

Hello, everyone!

216
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:45,847
Hi!

217
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,617
It's so nice to see you all here on Jeju Island!

218
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:53,386
Shall we have some fun today?

219
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:55,687
Let's go!

220
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:09,567
Let's go!

221
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:11,006
Oh, my!

222
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:14,607
We will now start the Mone Quiz!

223
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:17,237
Okay. Here's the first question.

224
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:22,577
Who is the person that Mone respects most in the world?

225
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:24,717
I got it! Beyoncé!

226
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:27,187
- Wrong! - I got it!

227
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,886
Ms. Geum La Hui.

228
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:33,987
- Wrong. - What?

229
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:37,196
Of course, I really love Ms. Geum,

230
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:40,795
but the person I respect most in the world is my mom.

231
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,696
- Correct! - You're a great daughter!

232
00:14:43,697 --> 00:14:45,306
- You're a great daughter! - You're a great daughter!

233
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:47,736
My mom is in the US for business,

234
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:49,477
so I try to call her often.

235
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:51,606
Oddly enough, when I hear my mom's voice,

236
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:52,947
I never make mistakes.

237
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:56,617

You're so pretty!

244

here now?

245
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:41,717
I'm being released today after serving my sentence.

246
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:45,727
This will be the last time I'll see you like this.

247
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:47,597
Has all that time...

248
00:16:48,796 --> 00:16:50,867
already passed?

249
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:54,666
Do you remember what today is?

250
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:59,467
I remember it exactly.

251
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:02,536
How could I forget?

252
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,476
Remembering this day...

253
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:11,287
is what has been keeping me alive.

254
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:16,986
There's something I didn't tell you.

255
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:20,926
To be honest, Lee Hwi So knows your plan.

256
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,736
I have no doubt that he will do a good job.

257

258

How is the elder doing?

263
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,626
He's still holding on,

264
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,136
but for nearly five years,

265
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:04,767
he's been staying in solitary without outside communication.

266
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:07,876
It's not something that can be endured by anyone weak-minded.

267
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:11,406
I'm indebted to him.

268

After breaking his spine from the fall,

275
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:59,357
he had surgery to put in 50 pins, and he overcame that.

For the past six months,

277
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:03,455

If you want to rise up higher,

350
00:24:30,587 --> 00:24:32,327

you'll die.

354
00:24:49,236 --> 00:24:50,706
I'm not asking for much.

355
00:24:51,077 --> 00:24:53,375
Just get me a meeting with Mone.

356
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:54,646
My number is still the same.

357
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:56,146
Okay, Ms. Geum?

358
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:04,827
Who is the person that was chosen to be chairman?

359
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:07,155
I'm not sure. It's being done very secretly.

360
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:08,195
Gosh.

361
00:25:08,196 --> 00:25:09,996
Why would they not choose us?

362
00:25:09,997 --> 00:25:11,526
Cherry Entertainment and LH Media...

363
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:13,497
are the top entertainment and production companies.

364

365
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,367
It is a very attractive position.

00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:20,037
Chairman of TIKITAKA Studio.

367
00:25:20,406 --> 00:25:22,136
They'll get a billion dollars in investments.

368
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:24,337
On top of that, they'll get full control of the company.

369
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:26,746
It's obvious the position will be very lucrative.

370
00:25:26,747 --> 00:25:28,146
Of course, everyone would want it.

371
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:30,916
Everyone in this field must be going for it.

372
00:25:31,347 --> 00:25:34,916
As long as Matthew shows up at the Jeju Island event,

373
00:25:35,456 --> 00:25:36,757
we'll have a chance.

374
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:38,456
I must...

375
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:41,226
get that position.

376
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:42,656
Same for me.

377
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:46,066
Whoever gets it, don't break the promise...

378
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:47,166
to help each other out.

379
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:50,997
I'm going for the global market now.

380
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:54,976
To make the best content without worrying about capital,

381
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:57,077
I need the support of a big company like TIKITAKA.

382
00:25:57,976 --> 00:25:59,007
You can be hopeful.

383
00:25:59,876 --> 00:26:02,117
I hired a very useful guy.

384
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:04,847
Who?

385
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:08,787
He's a fixer who is famous in Gangnam.

386
00:26:09,587 --> 00:26:11,956
I promised 200,000 dollars for his service,

387
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:14,587
so I'm sure he'll do anything to get Matthew here.

388
00:26:15,226 --> 00:26:17,057
He'll do anything for money.

389
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:23,236
Hey, Do Hyuk. Come in.

390
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:27,436
I confirmed Matthew Lee arrived at Jeju Airport an hour ago.

391
00:26:27,607 --> 00:26:29,277
- Look here. - What?

392
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:47,226
How can you guarantee this person is Matthew?

393
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:50,057
Nobody has seen him in person.

394
00:26:50,456 --> 00:26:52,096
You sent two invitations to Matthew, right?

395
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:53,766
The first one was in a red envelope.

396
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,136
The second was in a gold envelope.

397
00:26:58,436 --> 00:26:59,566
How did you...

398
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,906
I have a connection with Matthew's driver.

399
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:03,876
Anyway, the important thing...

400
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:07,446
is that Matthew Lee has come to Jeju Island.

401
00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:15,517
I'll pay you an additional 100,000 dollars.

402
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:18,057
Find Chairman Lee and bring him here.

403
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:20,086
I'll trust you, Do Hyuk.

404
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:21,257
Trust me.

405
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,857
I just need to make an opportunity for you to meet Chairman Lee, right?

406
00:27:32,007 --> 00:27:33,236
Mone.

407
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:34,436
Han Mone.

408
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:36,036
It's me.

409
00:27:36,037 --> 00:27:37,636
Ko Myung Ji from Myeongju Girls' High School.

410
00:27:39,577 --> 00:27:40,706
Ms. Ko!

411
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:42,975
Is that really you?

412
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,617
It's so nice to see you.

413
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:46,617
Mone!

414
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:50,356
I've been following you on the news every day.

415
00:27:50,357 --> 00:27:52,757
I knew you would become a huge star.

416
00:27:53,357 --> 00:27:55,027
Congratulations.

417
00:27:57,696 --> 00:28:00,527
I was Mone's homeroom teacher in high school.

418
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,036
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

419
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:04,837
She was such a good student.

420
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:07,506
You're right. She was so smart and pretty...

421
00:28:07,507 --> 00:28:09,175
that the boys from the schools nearby...

422
00:28:09,176 --> 00:28:11,307
waited in line at the school gate every day to see her.

423
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,017
I entered without telling you so I could surprise you,

424
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:16,716
and I somehow got chosen.

425
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:19,186
I thought maybe you had chosen me yourself.

426
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:21,347
Me?

427
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,617
Did I tell you I got married?

428
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:26,926
My husband is a professor at Stanford University.

429
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:29,626
I thought of moving to the US for the kids,

430
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:32,366
but my daughter's dream is to become an actress.

431
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,426
Do you want to see her picture?

432
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:35,867
They're twins.

433
00:28:36,037 --> 00:28:37,267
They're so cute, right?

434
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:39,567
They're so cute.

435
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:41,067
They look just like you.

436
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:42,306
Right?

437
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:44,976
Do you know what they call my daughter at acting school?

438
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:46,807
Little Mone.

439
00:28:46,906 --> 00:28:47,946
Look at this.

440
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:49,077
What do you think?

441
00:28:49,078 --> 00:28:50,676
- I'm confident! - She looks just like you, right?

442
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:52,446
Yes.

443
00:28:52,747 --> 00:28:54,586
I really want to do this.

444
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:55,856
Right.

445
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:57,287
On that note,

446
00:28:58,527 --> 00:29:01,126
you're starting a new drama, right?

447
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:04,527
Could you help my daughter out?

448
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:06,726
I heard you made all of the casting decisions...

449
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:08,466
for dramas lately.

450
00:29:10,297 --> 00:29:11,466
I'm sorry.

451
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:13,337
I don't take those kinds of requests.

452
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:16,976
- Oh, my. - She's so pretty.

453
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:21,205
Next. Please come forward, number ten.

454
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:23,047
- It's me! - Over here!

455
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:25,087
Han Mone.

456
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:26,916
You can't act that way.

457
00:29:28,587 --> 00:29:29,617
It's today, right?

458
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:33,787
The day...

459
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:35,797
Bang Da Mi disappeared.

460
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:43,267
I brought you a present.

461
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:45,206
I was going to include this in my exhibit.

462
00:29:45,307 --> 00:29:46,906
I hope you like it.

463
00:30:16,636 --> 00:30:18,267
This is crazy!

464
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:19,906
Mone.

465
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:52,466
Mone. Han Mone.

466
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:57,007
Mone.

467
00:30:58,277 --> 00:30:59,547
Han Mone.

468
00:31:10,557 --> 00:31:12,626
Yong Ju. Where are you right now?

469
00:31:12,686 --> 00:31:14,057
I think I'm a bit lost.

470
00:31:35,547 --> 00:31:36,577
Bobble.

471
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:43,586
Stop drinking so much, you punk.

472
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:44,787
I don't want you to mess up.

473
00:31:45,126 --> 00:31:46,257
I'll have some water.

474
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:49,725
Well, if it isn't Mr. Yang?

475
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:50,757
You didn't quit drinking?

476
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:53,567
You wanted to come here to drink?

477
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:58,867
Of course, I came here to see Princess Mone in person.

478
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,166
Isn't she cute?

479
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:03,676
Where were you? Why are you here?

480
00:32:04,176 --> 00:32:06,046
No, it was a dream.

481
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:07,175
What's the matter with you?

482
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,747
Why are you freaking out?

483
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:12,847
Oh, gosh. I have the chills.

484
00:32:13,017 --> 00:32:15,385
I almost wet myself with shock!

485
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:18,186
Not so loud. Did you see a ghost or something?

486
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:20,027
Yes, I did.

487
00:32:20,656 --> 00:32:21,797
Bobble's ghost.

488
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:27,027
What's even more chilling...

489
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:30,867
is that today is her death anniversary.

490
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:35,507
Why would you mention that and jinx us all?

491
00:32:37,277 --> 00:32:39,406
I must be careful. It's my samjae, three years of misfortune.

492
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:41,946
A fortune-teller told me...

493
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:44,117
to be careful around bodies of water.

494
00:32:44,176 --> 00:32:45,317
Enough!

495
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:48,916
Quit the nonsense and watch what you say.

496
00:32:51,216 --> 00:32:52,926
No, wait, Mr. Yang.

497
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:57,226
I must ask...

498
00:32:57,757 --> 00:33:00,226
because I'm so darn curious.

499
00:33:01,797 --> 00:33:05,367
Why on earth did you harass Bobble so much?

500
00:33:06,507 --> 00:33:07,567
Was it...

501
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:10,607
because of Mone?

502
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:13,347
Are you insane?

503
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:15,317
You're drunk witless already?

504
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:17,675
Mone doesn't even work for me.

505
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:19,517
It's true, she doesn't.

506
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:24,316
But now she's tight with Geum La Hui,

507
00:33:24,317 --> 00:33:25,986
whom you can't stand,

508
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:28,926
and even Mone, who is picky about who she works with,

509
00:33:29,357 --> 00:33:31,625
will only work with the guys you signed.

510
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:36,235
I find that so strange.

511
00:33:36,236 --> 00:33:37,636
Darn you.

512
00:33:40,107 --> 00:33:42,136
If you talk like that again,

513
00:33:42,807 --> 00:33:44,976
I'll break your other leg.

514
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:55,456
It was about Mone.

515
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:00,156
(Ridon, Zolpiden, Linax)

516
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:13,267
Ms. Geum.

517
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:14,966
What are all these?

518
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,077
You said you'd quit.

519
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:18,977
Did you lie?

520
00:34:19,377 --> 00:34:21,647
You know I hyperventilate.

521
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:27,786
Didn't I say you couldn't even drink water...

522
00:34:27,787 --> 00:34:28,917
without my permission?

523
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:30,985
I monitor what you eat, wear, whom you meet,

524
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,026
and even the number of times you use the toilet!

525
00:34:33,557 --> 00:34:36,497
I'm not just your agent but your guardian and mom!

526
00:34:36,926 --> 00:34:38,097
I know that.

527
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:42,097
That face.

528
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:45,196
You forgot already?

529
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:49,436
I sent your troublemaker family abroad,

530
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:52,176
and I made you the highest-paid actor in the country!

531
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:58,347
I'm always grateful for that.

532
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:02,356
I apologize. I'll quit taking pills.

533
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:21,636
I'm doing this for you.

534
00:35:22,477 --> 00:35:24,906
You can't mess up again like you did five years ago.

535
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:29,546
I am you, and you are me.

536
00:35:30,517 --> 00:35:31,517
Okay?

537
00:35:34,586 --> 00:35:35,617
Okay.

538
00:35:40,886 --> 00:35:43,696
Someone outside would like to see you.

539
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:45,796
Smile a bit and then say no.

540
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:57,605
Miss Mone, it's lovely to see you.

541
00:35:57,606 --> 00:35:59,847
I'm a huge fan.

542
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:01,946
Thank you.

543
00:36:02,216 --> 00:36:04,747
You're busy, so I'll get right to the point.

544
00:36:05,386 --> 00:36:08,616
I'd like you to model for my company.

545
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:11,016
It'll suit your image perfectly,

546
00:36:11,017 --> 00:36:12,327
making it a win-win.

547
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:15,355
I can pay you more than your market price.

548
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:16,597
Gosh.

549
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:20,696
I'm so grateful for the offer.

550
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:24,597
But my agency and I decided not to take on new commercials.

551
00:36:26,807 --> 00:36:29,307
I'm so busy with my new album.

552
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:31,836
I'll keep this in mind, though.

553
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:34,806
Don't be like that. Why don't you take another look?

554
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:36,076
Here's the contract.

555
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:38,886
can wire the full down payment today.

556
00:36:39,617 --> 00:36:40,946
I have to get changed.

557
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:46,886
Ran Women's Hospital.

558
00:36:49,296 --> 00:36:50,356
Do you remember?

559
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,097
Yes, Bang Da Mi.

560
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:55,736
Can I have the abortion today?

561
00:37:05,577 --> 00:37:08,716
I was the hospital director.

562
00:37:11,046 --> 00:37:13,386
I'll stop here, seeing it's a great day.

563
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:32,065
For part two,

564
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:34,436
you'll all get to party with Mone.

565
00:37:34,437 --> 00:37:36,235
Change into a nice swimsuit...

566
00:37:36,236 --> 00:37:38,636
and come over to the outdoor pool.

567
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,477
See you soon!

568
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,176
Thank you.

569
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:02,066
Hey, Mone!

570
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:08,006
Gosh. Did I scare you?

571
00:38:08,977 --> 00:38:12,077
You're pretty even when you're scared.

572
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:16,617
I have to go. The party starts soon.

573
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:18,247
Wait.

574
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:20,417
Let's talk.

575
00:38:23,957 --> 00:38:24,986
Gosh.

576
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:28,356
Did I do something bad?

577
00:38:28,926 --> 00:38:32,226
Come on. I'm not a scary person.

578
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,566
I just want to talk to you.

579
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:37,266
Hey.

580
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:40,707
Oh, you don't know who I am.

581
00:38:41,307 --> 00:38:42,336
Will this help?

582
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:47,045
To bring justice to the entertainment industry,

583
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:48,775
Scarlet Letter has come!

584
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:51,176
Justice!

585
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:53,787
You were Scarlet Letter?

586
00:38:59,727 --> 00:39:01,287
Did you figure that out now?

587
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:03,827
Hey.

588
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:06,667
What's your deal with Yang Jin Mo?

589
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:08,667
Don't come closer.

590
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:11,636
Don't worry.

591
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:15,506
Your secret's safe with me.

592
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:25,985
Get up, pervert.

593
00:39:25,986 --> 00:39:27,787
You're not yet cured of that bad habit?

594
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:31,985
Yong Ju, you should've broken a wrist instead of an ankle.

595
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:33,026
I'll do it for you.

596
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:37,526
We still have a score to settle.

597
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:47,105
Aren't you the original traitor?

598
00:39:47,106 --> 00:39:49,106
You got me to turn against our boss!

599
00:39:54,946 --> 00:39:55,977
Get lost.

600
00:39:57,776 --> 00:39:58,816
Darn you.

601
00:40:12,196 --> 00:40:15,795
I thank you all from the bottom of my heart...

602
00:40:15,796 --> 00:40:17,537
for attending the party with Mone.

603
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:21,466
I'm Geum La Hui, CEO of LH Media, her agency.

604
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:24,036
This event...

605
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:26,206
was sponsored by TIKITAKA...

606
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:29,816
and arranged only for Mone's greatest fans.

607
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:31,715
There is no hotel staff,

608
00:40:31,716 --> 00:40:33,046
and there are no...

609
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:34,787
security cameras.

610
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:43,026
What about food and drinks?

611
00:40:43,497 --> 00:40:45,425
It would be weird to not have that.

612
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:46,966
- Yes! - Yes!

613
00:40:47,097 --> 00:40:50,096
Eat and drink all you want and have a good time!

614
00:40:50,097 --> 00:40:51,795
- Okay! - Okay!

615
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:52,906
My dear daughter Mone.

616
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:55,537
I love you so much.

617
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:57,307
- How sweet! - That's nice.

618
00:41:00,477 --> 00:41:02,576
To our love, Mone.

619
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:04,816
- Cheers! - Cheers!

620
00:41:09,816 --> 00:41:13,025
- Han Mone! - Han Mone!

621
00:41:13,026 --> 00:41:15,425
- Han Mone! - Han Mone!

622
00:41:15,426 --> 00:41:17,956
Yes. I'll forget it all and enjoy myself.

623
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:19,366
- Han Mone! - Han Mone!

624
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:20,965
I love you all!

625
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:23,536
- We love you! - We love you!

626
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:26,236
- You're amazing! - I love you, Mone!

627
00:41:58,966 --> 00:42:00,105
It's Matthew Lee.

628
00:42:00,106 --> 00:42:01,465
I'll come to your hotel tomorrow.

629
00:42:01,466 --> 00:42:02,506
Enjoy yourself tonight.

630
00:42:06,747 --> 00:42:08,945
Thank you for giving me the opportunity.

631
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:10,146
I'll see you tomorrow.

632
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:11,377
(I'll see you tomorrow.)

633
00:42:30,796 --> 00:42:32,466
Luka, screen on.

634
00:42:33,537 --> 00:42:37,176
Out of the 33 guests invited to the event,

635
00:42:37,207 --> 00:42:39,676
twenty-nine of them are core members of Scarlet Letter.

636
00:42:40,176 --> 00:42:41,506
Enjoy it to the fullest.

637
00:42:42,417 --> 00:42:44,216
I'll give you a taste of the abyss soon.

638
00:42:45,787 --> 00:42:46,886
Joo Yong Ju.

639
00:42:48,687 --> 00:42:49,816
I'm starting with you.

640
00:42:59,426 --> 00:43:01,066
I heard from Matthew Lee.

641
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:02,736
We're meeting tomorrow.

642
00:43:02,796 --> 00:43:04,965
What did I tell you?

643
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:07,006
Great!

644
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:21,417
Oh, dear.

645
00:43:22,086 --> 00:43:23,216
It smashed.

646
00:43:23,586 --> 00:43:25,156
What are you doing? That's dangerous.

647
00:43:25,617 --> 00:43:26,626
What's he up to?

648
00:43:26,627 --> 00:43:29,796
Why are you looking at me like that?

649
00:43:30,926 --> 00:43:32,196
Darn it.

650
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:33,596
Hey, Dumpling.

651
00:43:33,597 --> 00:43:35,726
Yong Ju, you had too much to drink.

652
00:43:35,727 --> 00:43:37,167
- Don't... - What do you want?

653
00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:41,207
Hey!

654
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,436
You're fools, all of you.

655
00:43:43,437 --> 00:43:45,537
Don't you dare glare at me!

656
00:43:46,377 --> 00:43:47,506
You scumbag.

657
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,815
You'd all...

658
00:43:51,816 --> 00:43:54,687
faint if I were to tell you who I was!

659
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:55,816
Who is he?

660
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:59,926
Do you know what day it is today?

661
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:03,557
You don't, do you?

662
00:44:04,957 --> 00:44:06,526
Today is...

663
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:09,537
the anniversary of Bobble's death.

664
00:44:14,707 --> 00:44:17,136
What does that have to do with us?

665
00:44:17,377 --> 00:44:19,307
We're just here to party.

666
00:44:19,847 --> 00:44:21,446
- Yes! - That's right!

667
00:44:21,847 --> 00:44:24,377
You're drunk! Go somewhere and sober up!

668
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:25,675
Mister!

669
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:28,885
Quit acting like you're special because you're ruining the mood!

670
00:44:28,886 --> 00:44:30,057
- Yes! - He's right!

671
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:33,187
Get out of here!

672
00:44:34,457 --> 00:44:35,786
Mister!

673
00:44:35,787 --> 00:44:36,896
Who is he?

674
00:44:36,897 --> 00:44:38,127
- Hey! - What's that?

675
00:44:38,897 --> 00:44:39,997
I am...

676
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:44,597
one half of Scarlet Letter called Joo!

677
00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:47,707
You lot...

678
00:44:48,066 --> 00:44:50,037
praised and worshipped me!

679
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:54,046
I'm Scarlet Letter's leader!

680
00:44:54,207 --> 00:44:55,776
- What? - Darn it.

681
00:44:59,986 --> 00:45:01,787
- You losers. - "Scarlet Letter?"

682
00:45:02,247 --> 00:45:04,557
Look at your shocked faces.

683
00:45:05,386 --> 00:45:07,187
Now do you get it?

684
00:45:13,227 --> 00:45:15,497
Hey. Han Mone.

685
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:19,406
Watch how you treat me.

686
00:45:21,867 --> 00:45:23,176
I can...

687
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:26,006
topple you from your pedestal in a second.

688
00:45:27,347 --> 00:45:29,816
We didn't finish our conversation earlier.

689
00:45:30,776 --> 00:45:31,846
Let's go.

690
00:45:31,847 --> 00:45:32,886
Come here!

691
00:45:33,446 --> 00:45:34,517
Come with me.

692
00:45:36,986 --> 00:45:38,017
Come!

693
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:40,086
Let go!

694
00:45:40,187 --> 00:45:41,256
Let go!

695
00:45:42,557 --> 00:45:43,656
Let her go.

696
00:45:44,156 --> 00:45:45,256
Let go!

697
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,796
Let go of me!

698
00:45:48,066 --> 00:45:49,167
Come here!

699
00:45:59,707 --> 00:46:00,847
Are you okay?

700
00:46:03,747 --> 00:46:04,847
Get him!

701
00:46:04,946 --> 00:46:06,017
Dunk him!

702
00:46:14,327 --> 00:46:15,457
Who do you think you are?

703
00:46:30,437 --> 00:46:31,877
We got him.

704
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:38,077
Well done.

705
00:46:45,617 --> 00:46:46,687
Stop!

706
00:46:47,426 --> 00:46:48,486
Stop it!

707
00:46:50,156 --> 00:46:51,327
He's dead.

708
00:46:51,497 --> 00:46:52,497
What?

709
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:53,926
Flip him over.

710
00:47:00,037 --> 00:47:01,307
Yong Ju.

711
00:47:03,776 --> 00:47:04,836
He's dead?

712
00:47:16,557 --> 00:47:17,687
Darn it!

713
00:47:22,227 --> 00:47:23,256
What's up with him?

714
00:47:26,627 --> 00:47:28,425
Poor Yong Ju.

715
00:47:28,426 --> 00:47:30,736
He's dead.

716
00:47:32,966 --> 00:47:34,207
There!

717
00:47:37,136 --> 00:47:38,606
What a moron.

718
00:47:38,707 --> 00:47:40,307
A man's dead.

719
00:47:40,707 --> 00:47:42,747
Shouldn't we call the police?

720
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:43,917
We can't!

721
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:45,676
Should we all go to prison?

722
00:47:47,086 --> 00:47:48,187
Why me?

723
00:47:48,486 --> 00:47:49,516
Wait.

724
00:47:49,517 --> 00:47:52,056
He's the one who dunked him first!

725
00:47:52,057 --> 00:47:54,856
- Yes! All I did was watch! - Right.

726
00:47:55,557 --> 00:47:57,897
I don't have the strength to kill anyone.

727
00:47:58,097 --> 00:47:59,496
That goes for me too!

728
00:47:59,497 --> 00:48:00,827
I didn't do anything either!

729
00:48:00,926 --> 00:48:01,996
Who pushed him?

730
00:48:01,997 --> 00:48:03,065
You did.

731
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:04,736
You dunked him first!

732
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:06,807
What nonsense is this?

733
00:48:06,906 --> 00:48:08,806
We all dunked him together!

734
00:48:08,807 --> 00:48:10,006
Not me.

735
00:48:10,136 --> 00:48:11,276
Silence!

736
00:48:13,276 --> 00:48:15,707
Nobody here is free...

737
00:48:16,006 --> 00:48:17,877
from this death.

738
00:48:18,347 --> 00:48:20,386
This could ruin Mone's life.

739
00:48:20,446 --> 00:48:22,885
Why should I care about her life...

740
00:48:22,886 --> 00:48:24,815
when I could end up in prison?

741
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:27,227
You don't expect that from us, do you?

742
00:48:27,256 --> 00:48:29,826
Is that all an agency CEO can come up with?

743
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:30,926
We all saw...

744
00:48:31,057 --> 00:48:33,397
who pushed him into the pool, didn't we?

745
00:48:35,767 --> 00:48:37,397
I need time to think about...

746
00:48:38,267 --> 00:48:40,235
what will be best for us all.

747
00:48:40,236 --> 00:48:41,806
What's there to think about?

748
00:48:41,807 --> 00:48:43,136
Toss him into the sea.

749
00:48:43,307 --> 00:48:44,307
I'm up for that.

750
00:48:44,606 --> 00:48:47,846
We can say he went for a walk and lost his footing.

751
00:48:47,847 --> 00:48:49,077
What if he surfaces?

752
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:51,647
Won't the autopsy show how he died?

753
00:48:51,816 --> 00:48:54,517
His lungs will be filled with water from the pool.

754
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:56,085
What should we do, then?

755
00:48:56,086 --> 00:48:57,316
What else?

756
00:48:57,816 --> 00:48:59,386
Bury him somewhere on an island.

757
00:48:59,986 --> 00:49:02,226
There's a deserted one 20 minutes away by boat.

758
00:49:02,227 --> 00:49:03,456
Let's bury him there.

759
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:05,525
You want to commit murder and dispose of the body?

760
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:07,295
It was self-defence!

761
00:49:07,296 --> 00:49:08,397
How so?

762
00:49:08,627 --> 00:49:10,167
He harassed Mone.

763
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:11,836
I know the guy well.

764
00:49:12,136 --> 00:49:13,605
He has no family to look for him.

765
00:49:13,606 --> 00:49:14,807
There won't be a problem.

766
00:49:15,006 --> 00:49:16,207
You're right.

767
00:49:16,906 --> 00:49:18,376
There are no hotel staff,

768
00:49:18,377 --> 00:49:19,747
and the cameras are out too.

769
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:22,347
No one but us saw what happened.

770
00:49:24,477 --> 00:49:25,517
Can't we...

771
00:49:25,877 --> 00:49:27,347
just get rid of him?

772
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:34,426
A show of hands.

773
00:49:34,586 --> 00:49:35,957
Should we call the police...

774
00:49:36,897 --> 00:49:38,097
or deal with the body?

775
00:49:38,897 --> 00:49:41,327
Let's move fast. There's no time.

776
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:43,937
If someone were to come, we'd really be done for.

777
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,796
Who wants to call the police?

778
00:49:50,307 --> 00:49:51,377
Then...

779
00:49:53,676 --> 00:49:54,847
who wants to bury him?

780
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:26,905
Hold on tight.

781
00:50:26,906 --> 00:50:28,776
One, two, three.

782
00:50:33,316 --> 00:50:35,386
What is wrong with you?

783
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:39,016
Darn it.

784
00:50:39,017 --> 00:50:40,156
Hurry up.

785
00:50:44,097 --> 00:50:45,755
- Oh, dear. - Gosh.

786
00:50:45,756 --> 00:50:48,166
What do you think you're doing?

787
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:49,736
You, in the back, come and help.

788
00:50:49,966 --> 00:50:51,537
Pick him up. Over here.

789
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:53,006
Get him in there.

790
00:50:53,307 --> 00:50:54,836
That's it.

791
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:56,877
Leave that.

792
00:51:00,276 --> 00:51:01,377
One, two.

793
00:51:01,877 --> 00:51:02,917
We're done.

794
00:51:13,727 --> 00:51:14,756
Luka.

795
00:51:15,187 --> 00:51:16,256
Begin.

796
00:51:17,296 --> 00:51:19,156
Activating plan.

797
00:51:31,977 --> 00:51:33,746
Why do I feel so invigorated?

798
00:51:33,747 --> 00:51:35,347
I'm hungry and thirsty. Aren't you?

799
00:51:36,747 --> 00:51:37,917
Is there anything to eat?

800
00:51:38,877 --> 00:51:40,086
Let's look.

801
00:51:40,386 --> 00:51:41,446
I'm hungry.

802
00:51:41,486 --> 00:51:42,687
So am I.

803
00:51:46,057 --> 00:51:47,156
Shall we?

804
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,926
- A toast! - Cheers!

805
00:52:03,506 --> 00:52:05,336
Wasn't that so much fun?

806
00:52:07,077 --> 00:52:10,776
It was the greatest day of my life.

807
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,846
Once we get this done,

808
00:52:12,847 --> 00:52:16,816
we'll return to the hotel and party again.

809
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:18,486
As if nothing happened.

810
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:20,426
A toast.

811
00:52:22,457 --> 00:52:23,526
Cheers!

812
00:52:30,636 --> 00:52:31,696
Look at that.

813
00:52:36,676 --> 00:52:38,476
Isn't that an aurora?

814
00:52:38,477 --> 00:52:40,676
- What's that? - It's an aurora!

815
00:52:40,877 --> 00:52:42,347
- It's beautiful. - How pretty.

816
00:52:54,187 --> 00:52:57,296
Gosh. Come here.

817
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:19,986
- Goodness. - Ouch.

818
00:53:22,687 --> 00:53:24,787
- Gosh. - Look at that.

819
00:53:36,267 --> 00:53:37,397
This is paradise.

820
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:40,336
It's beautiful.

821
00:53:48,106 --> 00:53:50,316
Look at the fruit hanging from the trees.

822
00:53:52,046 --> 00:53:53,086
- Gosh. - Look at all the fruit!

823
00:54:11,066 --> 00:54:12,667
- It's so nice. - What?

824
00:54:13,906 --> 00:54:15,267
It's a unicorn.

825
00:54:16,636 --> 00:54:18,577
There's a unicorn.

826
00:54:19,276 --> 00:54:20,676
Come over here.

827
00:54:21,807 --> 00:54:22,847
A unicorn?

828
00:54:24,147 --> 00:54:25,376
It's a unicorn.

829
00:54:25,377 --> 00:54:26,446
- What? - Come on.

830
00:54:26,886 --> 00:54:28,286
- Goodness. - Come look.

831
00:54:28,287 --> 00:54:29,316
- Jin Mo. - Jin Mo.

832
00:54:29,886 --> 00:54:31,086
It's a unicorn.

833
00:54:32,086 --> 00:54:34,586
I think something good will happen to us.

834
00:54:36,187 --> 00:54:38,596
This feels like a dream.

835
00:54:38,597 --> 00:54:40,866
- It's so pretty. - Right.

836
00:54:40,867 --> 00:54:42,867
- Gosh. - Come here.

837
00:54:43,267 --> 00:54:44,536
There, there.

838
00:54:44,537 --> 00:54:45,736
Fly, unicorn.

839
00:54:46,037 --> 00:54:49,506
- Fly, unicorn. - Fly, unicorn.

840
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:51,476
- Fly, unicorn. - Fly, unicorn.

841
00:54:51,477 --> 00:54:53,577
- It's flying. - Gosh, it's flying.

842
00:54:53,807 --> 00:54:55,077
- It's flying. - It's flying.

843
00:55:04,557 --> 00:55:05,856
Be happy.

844
00:55:10,156 --> 00:55:13,767
What's going on with the boat?

845
00:55:14,827 --> 00:55:18,597
We have a problem.

846
00:55:18,867 --> 00:55:21,406
- We have a problem. - What? What is it?

847
00:55:21,836 --> 00:55:25,276
It's being washed away by the sea.

848
00:55:25,707 --> 00:55:26,847
- What? - No.

849
00:55:26,977 --> 00:55:29,175
How can a boat that big get washed away like that?

850
00:55:29,176 --> 00:55:31,446
I'm not sure. Maybe it wasn't anchored properly.

851
00:55:32,647 --> 00:55:35,085
I can't remember. I was too drunk on the aurora. What do we do?

852
00:55:35,086 --> 00:55:36,445
Are you kidding? What are you going to do?

853
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:37,916
- What are you going to do? - What do we do now?

854
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,326
Calm down. We should call for help immediately.

855
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:42,926
No. It's a secret that we came here.

856
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:44,795
Should we be trapped here forever, then?

857
00:55:44,796 --> 00:55:48,367
Wait, I took a selfie with Mone at the dock earlier.

858
00:55:48,796 --> 00:55:51,037
I'm so exhausted I could die.

859
00:55:51,437 --> 00:55:52,437
You did great.

860
00:55:52,897 --> 00:55:54,106
Yes, that's it.

861
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:55,735
(Boreumdeul Dock, Inquiries welcome)

862
00:55:55,736 --> 00:55:56,806
I found it.

863
00:55:56,807 --> 00:55:58,076
- Yes! - We're saved!

864
00:55:58,077 --> 00:55:59,977
Give me the number. I'll make the call.

865
00:56:03,347 --> 00:56:04,376
Hello?

866
00:56:04,377 --> 00:56:06,517
I'm Han Mone, the actress.

867
00:56:07,347 --> 00:56:09,045
Yes. Oh, we're...

868
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:11,586
on an island 20 minutes away from the dock.

869
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:15,256
Well... There's an aurora and pretty flowers too.

870
00:56:15,787 --> 00:56:16,855
Yes, that's right.

871
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:19,656
Could you send us a yacht here?

872
00:56:21,966 --> 00:56:22,997
Help is on the way.

873
00:56:25,066 --> 00:56:26,466
- Thank goodness! - What a relief.

874
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:28,667
Who said you could call for help?

875
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:30,506
How are you going to stop him from talking?

876
00:56:30,836 --> 00:56:32,377
Why are you all so careless?

877
00:56:33,106 --> 00:56:34,605
We should have come up with a plan...

878
00:56:34,606 --> 00:56:36,446
before calling for help.

879
00:56:36,577 --> 00:56:37,647
Move.

880
00:56:37,877 --> 00:56:39,775
Why do you keep picking fights over every little thing?

881
00:56:39,776 --> 00:56:41,617
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

882
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:44,385
You jerk. Do you know who I am?

883
00:56:44,386 --> 00:56:45,417
Who are you?

884
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:46,686
- Hey. - Gosh.

885
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:48,485
- Stop. - Don't.

886
00:56:48,486 --> 00:56:50,456
- Hey. - Stop this.

887
00:56:50,457 --> 00:56:51,925
- Calm down. - Hey.

888
00:56:51,926 --> 00:56:53,267
Stop it.

889
00:56:53,696 --> 00:56:55,196
I'll pay him to keep his mouth shut.

890
00:56:55,696 --> 00:56:57,497
He won't talk if I give him 100,000 dollars.

891
00:56:58,437 --> 00:57:00,106
Gosh, this guy is generous.

892
00:57:00,606 --> 00:57:02,906
Hey. Over there.

893
00:57:03,437 --> 00:57:04,937
There's a cave over there.

894
00:57:05,307 --> 00:57:07,946
We can bury the body in that cave.

895
00:57:08,377 --> 00:57:10,617
Isn't it the perfect hiding spot?

896
00:57:10,716 --> 00:57:12,215
- Yes. - Nice.

897
00:57:12,216 --> 00:57:14,417
We're so lucky.

898
00:57:19,086 --> 00:57:20,155
Be careful.

899
00:57:20,156 --> 00:57:22,126
- Watch out. - Hey.

900
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:23,796
Wait for me.

901
00:57:30,636 --> 00:57:32,166
Hey.

902
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:33,736
Watch your step.

903
00:57:36,336 --> 00:57:38,706
- Where are we going? - Gosh.

904
00:57:38,707 --> 00:57:40,577
Over there looks nice.

905
00:57:40,906 --> 00:57:42,546
Bring the body over here.

906
00:57:43,716 --> 00:57:45,617
- Careful. - Here.

907
00:57:46,377 --> 00:57:48,545
- Lift him up. - Be careful!

908
00:57:48,546 --> 00:57:50,485
All right. One, two, three.

909
00:57:50,486 --> 00:57:52,986
- Darn it. - Gosh.

910
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:58,656
Put rocks on top of him, one by one.

911
00:57:58,897 --> 00:58:00,025
- What? - What?

912
00:58:00,026 --> 00:58:01,227
Rocks?

913
00:58:04,097 --> 00:58:06,195
You people, we came all the way here...

914
00:58:06,196 --> 00:58:07,437
Can't we just leave it here?

915
00:58:08,037 --> 00:58:09,937
Rocks? What is he talking about?

916
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,077
What are you doing?

917
00:58:22,986 --> 00:58:25,156
Everyone has to do it. No exception.

918
00:58:25,716 --> 00:58:27,356
We're all on the same boat.

919
00:58:29,086 --> 00:58:30,425
Let's just do it.

920
00:58:30,426 --> 00:58:31,656
- All right. - Okay.

921
00:58:32,227 --> 00:58:33,367
- Come on. - Let's do it.

922
00:58:33,466 --> 00:58:34,966
Quickly.

923
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:36,496
Put rocks on top of the body.

924
00:58:36,497 --> 00:58:38,195
- Here. - Here you go.

925
00:58:38,196 --> 00:58:40,536
- Pass me a rock. - Place the rock there.

926
00:58:40,537 --> 00:58:41,566
- Gosh. - Here.

927
00:58:44,377 --> 00:58:45,477
- Here you go. - Gosh.

928
00:58:53,147 --> 00:58:54,247
By the way,

929
00:58:55,086 --> 00:58:57,187
I heard from a hotel staff earlier,

930
00:58:57,787 --> 00:58:59,086
and apparently,

931
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:01,386
there's a scary legend about this island.

932
00:59:02,327 --> 00:59:04,326
An old Japanese treasure ship...

933
00:59:04,327 --> 00:59:05,796
drifted onto this island,

934
00:59:06,227 --> 00:59:08,167
and everyone was slaughtered...

935
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:10,736
by a monster that protected the island.

936
00:59:10,867 --> 00:59:12,666
Their eyes were torn out,

937
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:14,736
and their limbs were bent.

938
00:59:14,937 --> 00:59:16,707
That's ridiculous.

939
00:59:17,207 --> 00:59:18,906
All we have to do is bury the body.

940
00:59:19,776 --> 00:59:21,807
We seem to be done here.

941
00:59:22,046 --> 00:59:23,307
So let's get back to the hotel...

942
00:59:23,517 --> 00:59:25,346
and enjoy the rest of the party. What do you say?

943
00:59:25,347 --> 00:59:26,646
- Yes. - Sounds great.

944
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:28,187
- Yes. - Yes.

945
00:59:32,356 --> 00:59:34,227
Okay, great.

946
00:59:37,696 --> 00:59:39,397
- What? - What was that?

947
00:59:40,966 --> 00:59:42,066
What?

948
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:48,966
- Bats! - Gosh.

949
00:59:56,577 --> 00:59:58,117
- Come on. - What is that?

950
01:00:10,296 --> 01:00:12,097
No, go away!

951
01:00:23,506 --> 01:00:24,636
Help me.

952
01:00:25,006 --> 01:00:26,037
- What? - Gosh.

953
01:00:26,437 --> 01:00:27,577
Please help me.

954
01:00:31,647 --> 01:00:33,347
Darn it.

955
01:00:33,787 --> 01:00:36,316
Hey, you jerk!

956
01:01:19,057 --> 01:01:20,196
Move!

957
01:01:41,017 --> 01:01:42,146
- Darn it. - Gosh.

958
01:01:42,147 --> 01:01:44,216
It's so heavy!

959
01:01:47,156 --> 01:01:48,586
Hold on.

960
01:01:48,856 --> 01:01:51,026
Keep holding.

961
01:02:03,437 --> 01:02:06,636
Everyone, let's save Mone first.

962
01:02:07,847 --> 01:02:09,506
Mone, get out.

963
01:02:10,247 --> 01:02:11,315
Really?

964
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:12,577
- Hurry up. - Quickly.

965
01:02:14,617 --> 01:02:15,916
Thank you, everyone.

966
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:18,356
My dear fans, I'll never forget about your love for me.

967
01:02:18,656 --> 01:02:19,716
Good luck, everyone.

968
01:02:20,886 --> 01:02:22,526
I'll repay you with good acting.

969
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:24,456
I'm going.

970
01:02:24,457 --> 01:02:25,726
- What? - Gosh.

971
01:02:25,727 --> 01:02:27,397
I'm almost 60 years old.

972
01:02:29,296 --> 01:02:32,037
I'm a doctor.

973
01:02:32,196 --> 01:02:33,565
Mone needs me.

974
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:34,606
You can't just leave!

975
01:02:38,377 --> 01:02:39,377
Sorry, Jin Mo.

976
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,316
What are we going to do?

977
01:02:45,946 --> 01:02:50,085
On a count of three, we'll get out at the same time.

978
01:02:50,086 --> 01:02:51,716
Okay.

979
01:02:51,957 --> 01:02:52,957
One!

980
01:02:53,356 --> 01:02:54,426
Two!

981
01:03:22,917 --> 01:03:24,187
We made it.

982
01:03:29,787 --> 01:03:32,156
Everyone, get some rest. I think we're safe here.

983
01:03:33,196 --> 01:03:34,296
Relax for now.

984
01:03:35,296 --> 01:03:36,425
What happened?

985
01:03:36,426 --> 01:03:38,196
Why did the cliff collapse all of a sudden?

986
01:03:38,296 --> 01:03:39,636
And where did those bats come from?

987
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:41,735
You're the one who suggested to come here.

988
01:03:41,736 --> 01:03:42,807
You're responsible!

989
01:03:43,437 --> 01:03:44,577
Darn it.

990
01:03:44,807 --> 01:03:45,937
What are we going to do now?

991
01:03:46,606 --> 01:03:49,076
We're all going to die now just to bury the body.

992
01:03:49,077 --> 01:03:51,347
Nobody's going to die, you jerk.

993
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:55,647
We should just call 911.

994
01:03:55,847 --> 01:03:57,716
We can ask for a rescue helicopter.

995
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,787
The man who died at the hotel died of a heart attack.

996
01:04:01,156 --> 01:04:02,656
We didn't kill him.

997
01:04:02,687 --> 01:04:03,756
No.

998
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:05,557
Five more people are already dead.

999
01:04:06,057 --> 01:04:07,696
They might pin everything on us.

1000
01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:15,406
What?

1001
01:04:16,336 --> 01:04:17,877
Why isn't my phone working?

1002
01:04:18,006 --> 01:04:19,776
What's going on?

1003
01:04:20,077 --> 01:04:22,046
- What? - Gosh.

1004
01:04:22,506 --> 01:04:23,646
- There's no signal, is there? - I've got no signal.

1005
01:04:23,647 --> 01:04:25,446
- Goodness. - Darn it.

1006
01:04:25,847 --> 01:04:27,247
I was right.

1007
01:04:28,847 --> 01:04:31,156
This island is cursed.

1008
01:04:31,917 --> 01:04:33,287
Those people earlier...

1009
01:04:33,517 --> 01:04:35,856
They died with broken necks and limbs.

1010
01:04:39,457 --> 01:04:40,526
This...

1011
01:04:40,966 --> 01:04:42,796
is Bobble's curse.

1012
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,236
Bobble's curse.

1013
01:04:47,406 --> 01:04:48,506
Hey!

1014
01:04:49,037 --> 01:04:51,136
Why did we do such a thing at the hotel?

1015
01:04:52,077 --> 01:04:54,176
We drank away as if we were possessed by something.

1016
01:04:55,077 --> 01:04:57,077
We moved a body as if it was nothing.

1017
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:00,586
We must all be insane.

1018
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:03,187
Everyone, please.

1019
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:05,116
We should only be thinking about...

1020
01:05:05,117 --> 01:05:07,057
how we're going to get out of here.

1021
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,727
Unless you want all of us to die together.

1022
01:05:08,756 --> 01:05:09,756
Right.

1023
01:05:09,986 --> 01:05:11,696
The rescue ship must be here by now.

1024
01:05:11,856 --> 01:05:13,256
Let's go to the dock.

1025
01:05:13,397 --> 01:05:15,525
Find a way to get to the sea. Quickly.

1026
01:05:15,526 --> 01:05:16,696
Move.

1027
01:05:16,897 --> 01:05:18,097
- Hurry up. - Let's go.

1028
01:05:18,196 --> 01:05:19,696
- What's that? - Come on.

1029
01:05:20,196 --> 01:05:21,336
What's...

1030
01:05:21,636 --> 01:05:22,767
What's going on with the trees?

1031
01:05:32,176 --> 01:05:33,477
There's something down there.

1032
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:40,557
What is that?

1033
01:05:43,227 --> 01:05:44,327
Wild boars!

1034
01:05:50,597 --> 01:05:51,667
- Oh, my gosh. - Run!

1035
01:05:58,836 --> 01:05:59,906
No.

1036
01:06:06,847 --> 01:06:08,486
Get away!

1037
01:06:48,156 --> 01:06:49,227
Stay back.

1038
01:07:14,086 --> 01:07:15,247
Serves you right.

1039
01:07:16,247 --> 01:07:18,517
Take that.

1040
01:07:19,017 --> 01:07:20,256
What?

1041
01:07:27,267 --> 01:07:30,097
You big fat pig.

1042
01:07:30,367 --> 01:07:31,597
You can't touch me!

1043
01:07:34,236 --> 01:07:35,506
Goodness.

1044
01:07:51,886 --> 01:07:53,617
Stay back!

1045
01:08:33,056 --> 01:08:34,327
Get out of my way!

1046
01:08:43,266 --> 01:08:45,436
Don't go.

1047
01:08:48,177 --> 01:08:49,306
Don't leave me.

1048
01:08:53,577 --> 01:08:54,686
You jerk!

1049
01:08:56,986 --> 01:08:58,457
Help me!

1050
01:08:58,587 --> 01:09:00,856
Help me, please.

1051
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:28,047
I'm exhausted.

1052
01:10:07,087 --> 01:10:08,356
What are you doing?

1053
01:10:08,556 --> 01:10:09,787
Aren't you going to share?

1054
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:11,196
Be quiet.

1055
01:10:11,327 --> 01:10:12,927
- Give me some. - Be quiet.

1056
01:10:22,707 --> 01:10:24,007
What are you doing over there?

1057
01:10:25,207 --> 01:10:27,337
Hey, be quiet.

1058
01:10:27,646 --> 01:10:28,706
Come here.

1059
01:10:28,707 --> 01:10:30,406
Guys, there's water here. Line up.

1060
01:10:30,507 --> 01:10:31,876
- Water? - Line up behind me.

1061
01:10:31,877 --> 01:10:34,446
- Darn it, that jerk. - Water...

1062
01:10:35,446 --> 01:10:36,846
- Water... - There's water.

1063
01:10:37,556 --> 01:10:38,757
- Water. - Water.

1064
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:41,957
- Line up. - Stand in line.

1065
01:10:42,457 --> 01:10:43,587
Get in line.

1066
01:10:44,927 --> 01:10:46,297
Is there enough?

1067
01:10:46,356 --> 01:10:47,497
It's just one bottle.

1068
01:10:47,927 --> 01:10:49,025
Hey.

1069
01:10:49,026 --> 01:10:50,127
- Stand in line. - Don't do it.

1070
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:51,797
Keep order. Gosh.

1071
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:55,106
- Don't drink too much. - Drink just a little.

1072
01:10:55,736 --> 01:10:57,166
- Hey. - What are you doing?

1073
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:58,336
- Hey, stop. - Hey.

1074
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:00,507
- Hey. - Let go.

1075
01:11:01,346 --> 01:11:02,507
Darn it.

1076
01:11:02,577 --> 01:11:03,646
- Gosh. - Really?

1077
01:11:05,276 --> 01:11:07,177
What do you think you're doing?

1078
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,217
Are you insane?

1079
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:11,816
There wasn't enough for us to drink more than a droplet each.

1080
01:11:12,287 --> 01:11:13,757
Why did you drink all of it by yourself?

1081
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:16,686
Throw it all up!

1082
01:11:17,056 --> 01:11:20,497
What are we going to do now?

1083
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,266
What's going on now?

1084
01:11:29,236 --> 01:11:30,806
Why? What happened?

1085
01:11:33,606 --> 01:11:34,946
Is she dead?

1086
01:11:35,047 --> 01:11:36,146
Look at her face.

1087
01:11:57,537 --> 01:11:59,467
- What is that? - It's a monster.

1088
01:12:00,096 --> 01:12:01,207
Who's there?

1089
01:12:01,766 --> 01:12:03,467
Maybe it's the monster that protects the island.

1090
01:12:03,766 --> 01:12:06,076
Be it a person or a monster, it better not show up.

1091
01:12:06,077 --> 01:12:07,336
I'll kill it if it does.

1092
01:12:07,337 --> 01:12:08,707
I think it's headed this way.

1093
01:12:09,877 --> 01:12:11,077
- What? - It's coming.

1094
01:12:11,516 --> 01:12:12,516
It's coming this way.

1095
01:12:12,517 --> 01:12:13,917
The body.

1096
01:12:13,946 --> 01:12:14,986
Hey.

1097
01:12:28,096 --> 01:12:29,627
- What? - Gosh.

1098
01:13:22,446 --> 01:13:26,587
(The Escape of the Seven)

1099
01:13:26,787 --> 01:13:29,355
Are you saying only seven people can make it out of here alive?

1100
01:13:29,356 --> 01:13:30,386
I killed him.

1101
01:13:30,387 --> 01:13:33,056
All we did was protect ourselves.

1102
01:13:33,127 --> 01:13:34,497
If we hadn't killed him, we would have been killed.

1103
01:13:34,526 --> 01:13:36,725
We have to work together and overcome this.

1104
01:13:36,726 --> 01:13:38,565
You're all connected to Bang Da Mi, right?

1105
01:13:38,566 --> 01:13:40,966
Mone, didn't you go to school with her?

1106
01:13:40,967 --> 01:13:42,406
