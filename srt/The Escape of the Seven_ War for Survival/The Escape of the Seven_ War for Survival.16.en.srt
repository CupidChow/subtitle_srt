(Episode 16)

13
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,309
This has been enough fun.

14
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,949
Han Na is my daughter.

15
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:19,479
What would a psychopath like you know?

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,449
What family is...

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,750
That must be why you're playing games with people's lives!

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,599
Where is your brat of a daughter?

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,399
Do you think I'd tell you that?

20
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:42,699
Even if you do this, that kid can't live here.

21
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,839
Things will never go the way you want them to, K.

22
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,979
How could you do that to your own flesh and blood?

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Please take good care of my child, Ms. Han Mone.

24
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:05,990
You have to do this for me.

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
What...

26
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,850
Mom!

27
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:27,819
Mom!

28
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,859
Mom!

29

Round and round.

30
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,430
You're so cute! Look here.

31
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,870
Yes. Round and round.

32
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,340
Are you out of your mind?

33
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,440
Why would you smoke in front of a baby?

34
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,479
You should be healthy.

35
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,509
You're our only breadwinner.

36
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,578
Gosh, both mom and dad are pretty and handsome,

37
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,048
so your baby is pretty too.

38
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,090
What? I'm not the dad.

39
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:42,960
Thank you. Isn't my baby so beautiful?

40
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:47,030
Our Han Na is 100 or 1,000 times prettier than me.

41
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,370
She's going to become an actress when she grows up.

42
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,530
Right?

43
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,470
You're so pretty.

44
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,479
(You have 17 missed calls.)

45
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,819
What is this?

46
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,090
(No Paeng Hee)

47
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,660
Paeng Hee, what are you doing? Answer the phone.

48
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,059

Find the chairman. Quickly!

52
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,119
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

53
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,770
Let's go.

54
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,969
As the whole nation watches on,

55
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,070
Chairman Sim Yong had an emergency paternity test done.

56
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,868
Would it be revealed that CEO Geum La Hui is right...

57
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:06,308
when she insisted that Sim Jun Seok received plastic surgery...

58
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:07,738
to look like Min Do Hyuk?

59
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:10,409
The entire nation is paying close attention right now.

60
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,609
- Here he comes! Get him! - He's here!

61
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,780
- Please give us a statement. - Please say something.

62
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,949
- Please look over here! - Tell us what you think!

63
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,688
- What were the results? - Say something!

64
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:22,618
The results of Chairman Sim Yong and Min Do Hyuk's paternity test...

65
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:23,689
have just come out.

66
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:26,959
The accuracy of the test results are over 99 percent.

67
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,428
With the police in attendance as observers,

68
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,299
the test was conducted properly.

69
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,169

The probability that Min Do Hyuk...

73
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,179
is the biological son of Chairman Sim Yong...

74
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,379
Yes?

75
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,260
Yes. I understand.

76
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,489

00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:02,429
Yes, they just came out.

What did they say?

79
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,970
Min Do Hyuk is...

80
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:10,640
your biological son.

81
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,039
There is no way.

82
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,650
My biological son is dead!

83
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,280
This has been fabricated.

84
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,489
TIKITAKA has manipulated...

85
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:32,030
What? Really?

86
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,229

Then...

90

Min Do Hyuk and K are brothers?

Baek Ik Ho.

101
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,220

103
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,429

Pull him up!

105
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,210
Pull, darn it.

106
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,939
Why can't you pull me up when there are several of you?

107
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,079
Are you okay?

108
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,418
Darn it. I almost died.

109
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,019
What were you doing that you only just found me?

110
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,059
Sorry, sir.

111
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:10,830
What happened to No Paeng Hee and her daughter?

112
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,859
No Paeng Hee fell down here.

113
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,459
There was an explosion too.

114
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,530
Her body must've been blown to bits, making it impossible to find her.

115
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:21,070
Find that darn brat, Han Na, first.

116
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:22,868
She must not have gotten far on her own.

117
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:23,939
Yes, sir.

118
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,438
Oh, what about Min Do Hyuk?

119
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,439
Yang Jin Mo took him over to Chairman Sim's home.

120
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,039
I don't think he has woken up yet.

121
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,809
Right.

122
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,720
Should I mess with that punk, Min Do Hyuk, first?

123
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,189
Oh, in order to make everything perfect to the end,

124
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,290
take care of No Han Na too.

125
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:43,659
Send her abroad to some place where she doesn't know anyone.

126
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,029

131
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:14,420
Why didn't you answer the phone?

132
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:16,259
I thought you were dead.

133
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:18,330
I'm on my way.

134
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,399
I'll be there in 20... No, just 15 minutes.

135
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:23,560
I know...

136
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,229
that you will come.

137
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:28,570
I'm glad...

138
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,739
that I get to hear your voice before I go.

139
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:38,779
Jin Mo.

140
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:41,979
Please take care...

141
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,850
of Han Na.

142
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:46,349
What are you saying?

143
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,060
Why would you leave Han Na in my care?

144
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,759
You said she was your daughter.

145
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,529
You adored her all her life and raised her.

146
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,930
So why are you leaving her now to a guy like me?

147
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,100
You're a good person.

148
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:02,899
I know.

149
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,080
When I said I never saw you as a man,

150
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,749
I was lying.

151
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,389
Why are you acting like this?

152
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,749
Why are you doing this to me?

153
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,029
Don't let Han Na...

154
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,529
live as K's daughter.

155
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,470
I'll leave her in your care.

156
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,509
Thank you for everything.

157
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,409
Paeng...

158
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,420
Paeng Hee.

159
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,950
Paeng Hee, answer me.

160
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,089
No Paeng Hee.

161
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,519
No Paeng Hee, answer me!

162
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:06,369
Stop crying! What if someone hears you?

163
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,540
If you keep crying, I'm going to leave you behind.

164
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,749
Get out of the way!

165
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:30,729
Are you okay?

166
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,409
If you're not hurt, hurry up and follow me.

167
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,190
Come on!

168
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,430
She must not have gotten far.

169
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,170
Find her!

170
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,479
Come here.

171
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,479
Come over here now!

172
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,560
Search everywhere!

173
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,220
(No movement detected)

174
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:13,999
Get up here!

175
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,229
What happened?

176
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:49,930
Where do you think you're going?

177
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:53,070
Seeing how you're being chased from all sides,

178
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:56,269
I can tell just how nasty you've been in your life.

179
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:03,540
- Help me. - You want me to help you?

180
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,080
My sister, Ji A, is dead.

181
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,850
I've been working hard until now to pull you down.

182
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,090
Now, my goal is right before me.

183
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:18,129
I'm not begging you to save my life.

184
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:20,489
The person who killed Ji A is Sim Jun Seok.

185
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,399
And that Sim Jun Seok is Matthew!

186
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,330
Do you really want to live like a groveling coward?

187
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,299
Do you think I'd believe the words slithering out of your mouth?

188
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,100
We're all being tricked by Matthew!

189
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,768
It was Matthew's intention to get people's attention with the movie...

190
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,979
and ruin Sungchan Group.

191
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,749
The work you're doing is helping him out.

192
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:39,779
If you can't believe me,

193
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:42,749
believe her.

194
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,590
That child...

195
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,060
is Sim Jun Seok's daughter who I gave birth to.

196
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:53,930
This is the first time that I'm only saying the truth.

197
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,399
Right now, Sim Jun Seok is trying to kill his daughter.

198
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,138
Right.

199
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,470
What I did to Ji A...

200
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,570
is bad enough for me to die.

201
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,409
But you helping Matthew...

202
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,609
would also make Ji A wail in the afterlife.

203
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,079
You have to help me, no matter what.

204
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,950
That's how you can take proper revenge.

205
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:19,950
What if I can't believe you?

206
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,670
I'll frame Ji A for everything.

207
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,800
That it was Ji A who had a baby,

208
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,609
and it was Ji A who killed Da Mi.

209
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,739
I can just get out of it by saying I was tricked by Ji A.

210
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,040
You piece of trash.

211
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,879
If you ever mention my sister's name again,

212
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,979
I will seriously kill you.

213
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,279
You can kill me later.

214
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,090
I'll take my punishment.

215
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:53,450
I'll burn in the inferno!

216
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,119
But not now.

217
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,659
Give me time.

218
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,389
Time to turn everything back.

219
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,659
Time to fight against K!

220
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,759
Please buy me some time...

221
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,300
so I can take that child and run away.

222
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,330
Please.

223
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,149
Paeng Hee.

224
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:26,190
Paeng Hee.

225
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:34,960
Paeng Hee.

226
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,229
I'm here.

227
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:37,670
Please wake up.

228
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,940
I'm here now.

229
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:43,769
I'm here.

230
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:48,609
Don't go.

231
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,739
Please don't do this.

232
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,969
Come with me.

233
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,320
I just saw a little girl fall down there.

234
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:29,948
Please call the police.

235
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,189
The child is in danger.

236
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,668
But...

237
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:51,839
why were you here?

238
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,040
Is that important right now?

239
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,609
We'll look for the child and call the police.

240
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:58,480
It's dangerous here. You should wait outside.

241
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,310
Escort her out.

242
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:12,230
What a nitwit.

243
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,260
She got rid of herself.

244
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:16,500
That works for us.

245
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,428
Journalists swarmed the main entrance,

246
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:45,659
so I had you brought here.

247
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:50,230
It has been exactly five years since I was last here.

248
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:57,300
He's sleeping so soundly.

249
00:18:58,169 --> 00:18:59,810
- Give him back his phone. - Okay.

250
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:09,879
(Han Mone)

251
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:13,790
Hello?

252
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:15,659
Han Na...

253
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,520
is with me.

254
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,168
(DNA says Min Do Hyuk is Sim Yong's son)

255
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:28,869
(Shocking news, Min is Sungchan Group's heir?)

256
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,080
(Min Do Hyuk)

257
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:42,149
How could this fool be my son?

258
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,820
How?

259
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:17,480
You...

260
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:22,419
Now you recognize your son, Father?

261
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,429
I've changed, haven't I?

262
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,699
I look a bit different,

263
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:31,699
but I'm really Jun Seok.

264
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,939
This place hasn't changed at all.

265
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,608
Other than that Mother sat there so quietly,

266
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,719
and her favorite painting...

267
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,649
has gone.

268
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,490
What's going on?

269
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,458
Are you really Jun Seok?

270
00:20:55,459 --> 00:20:57,059
How could you be Jun Seok?

271
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,490
You made it so I couldn't come back with the same face!

272
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,358
You exiled me on some unknown Vietnamese island...

273
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:07,369
and forced me to take meds that made me a zombie!

274
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,070
Only a timid idiot would give up...

275
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:12,740
without trying to fight back.

276
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:17,909
I'm not entirely satisfied with it,

277
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:19,480
but I had to...

278
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:22,149
come back with a new look.

279
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:26,589
There are some pros about getting plastic surgery...

280
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,990
to look a bit older.

281
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,290
No one treats me like a child.

282
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:35,859
People acknowledge I could be your match.

283
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,969
Mr. Gu!

284
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,539
What's the point of calling someone?

285
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,310
Will you tell them the real Sim Jun Seok's here?

286
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,878
If I get caught, I'll confess to everything.

287
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:55,079
Then Sungchan Group will fall,

288
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,949
and that heart of yours...

289
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,750
will shatter.

290
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:05,830
Call the police.

291
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,129
He's Jun Seok!

292
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:10,159
Report that a murderer's here.

293
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,810
What's this?

294
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,609
You're in on it together?

295
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,949
Ms. Han!

296
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:34,419
It's no use calling someone.

297
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,158
We're the only people here.

298
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,290
You ungrateful fool.

299
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,099
You dare deceive me...

300
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,399
and collude with that lunatic?

301
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,770
Don't you fear what will become of you?

302
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,439
He's innocent in all this.

303
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,270
He only helped his biological son.

304
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:54,510
"Biological son?"

305
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,480
All he did was protect his son.

306
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,949
Like how you want to protect your company.

307
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,218
My son was refused all treatment and was dying.

308
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:05,919
I had no other choice.

309
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:10,959
Did you...

310
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,959
swap out my son for yours?

311
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,030
And my son died...

312
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,540
Min Do Hyuk was my real son.

313
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,679
He was right before you, and you didn't recognize him.

314
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,448
And you have the gall to call me a fake?

315
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,589
Why did you do this?

316
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,520
Why? What for?

317
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:45,490
Was killing your mom not enough?

318
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:47,628
What did I do to you that was so wrong?

319
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:49,658
All I'm guilty of is raising you...

320
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:52,529
in the best environment to be the best!

321
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,669
No!

322
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,169
The moment you knew I was an impostor,

323
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,770
you changed completely.

324
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,649
The way you looked, talked at, and treated me.

325
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:06,750
Even the sound of your breath.

326
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,520
It all changed.

327
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,820
He's dead? Why is he dead?

328
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:15,659
Why would my only son be dead?

329
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,059
Someone else's kid is alive and well,

330
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,830
so how can mine be dead?

331
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,500
And still, you failed...

332
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,800
to recognize your real son.

333
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,178
You did a great job...

334
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:37,510
turning your son into a murderer.

335
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:40,580
Did you get a new face just to do this?

336
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,290
Was bringing my son down all you wanted to do?

337
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:50,388
You don't know me at all yet.

338
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:51,858
That penniless thug...

339
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,698
was a toy I played with for a while.

340
00:24:54,699 --> 00:24:56,830
What I really want...

341
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,469
is Sungchan Group.

342
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,600
But then...

343
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,438
it was mine from the start.

344
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,840
Nonsense!

345
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:09,779
I won't give the company to a psycho like you.

346
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,649
Don't dream of taking even a sliver of it.

347
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,678
If you're thinking of...

348
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,448
siding with him to take my company, give up!

349
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:18,350
Don't say that.

350
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,118
I will get my way soon.

351
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:25,189
I will make it so.

352
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,070
(Number Withheld)

353
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:45,409
Hello?

354
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:47,649
Who's this?

355
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,219
Is it K?

356
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,590
Do Hyuk, help me.

357
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:54,959
Ki Tak?

358
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,889
You're alive?

359
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,989
Where are you?

360
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,359
Stop it right now!

361
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,000
Do Hyuk.

362
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,669
I'm at Chairman Sim's.

363
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:13,638
Are you with the chairman?

364
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,379
The garage you're in...

365
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,980
has a door that leads into the house.

366
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,449
Come over now.

367
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,149
Ki Tak. I'll be right there.

368
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:30,619
Ki Tak!

369
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,760
Welcome, Sim Jun Seok!

370
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,000
Or should I call you K?

371
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,740
- Where's Ki Tak? - Kang Ki Tak?

372
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,969
You thought it was really him?

373
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,938
How could a dead man talk?

374
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,580
No kind of deepfake technology can do that.

375
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,589
I can copy...

376
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,019
any face and any voice.

377
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,359
You saw it too.

378
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,559
With my skill, I turned Lee Hwi So into Bang Da Mi's killer.

379
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,260
I'll kill you.

380
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,929
I'll kill you.

381
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:25,749
You can only do that when you're alive.

382
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,879
No!

383
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:29,280
Yes.

384
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:31,490
Before you die,

385
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,149
say how it feels to meet your biological dad.

386
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,119
What are you on about?

387
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,059
The Sim Yong you hate more than anyone...

388
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,188
is your birth father.

389
00:27:40,189 --> 00:27:41,899
I'm an impostor.

390
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,659
Do you still not get it?

391
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,168
The reason you're my target.

392
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:48,240
Wait!

393
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,540
If it's the company you want,

394
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,939
you can have it.

395
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,080
Take it. Take it all.

396
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,179
In return, clear him of his humiliating charges!

397
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,490
That's a real nice offer.

398
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,020
But sorry.

399
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,320
I think my scenario is much more interesting.

400
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,260
My scenario is...

401
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,760
No!

402
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:19,369
Sim Jun Seok.

403
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,169
You lunatic!

404
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,010
Why did I shoot Do Hyuk?

405
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,980
Don't you want to know?

406
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,480
Because this...

407
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,550
is being aired live nationwide.

408
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:38,749
Of course, not as is,

409
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,689
but doctored with deepfake to look the way I want.

410
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,629
You ruined my plan, Father.

411
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:52,129
How could you make me guilty?

412
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:55,939
I never imagined you'd get surgery to look like Min Do Hyuk.

413
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:58,570
Why did you disappear without telling me?

414
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:01,240
I did my best to the end to protect you.

415
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,209
And this is the result?

416
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:06,609
I covered up the fact that you killed your mother.

417
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,949
You can't do this to me.

418
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,349
Turn everything back right now!

419
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,789
(Streaming from Sim Yong's house)

420
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,189
If I get arrested,

421
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:15,959
I won't forgive you.

422
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,889
I do what I say I will.

423
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,059
Stop!

424
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,260
- No! - My gosh!

425
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:24,059
He's shot.

426
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,429
What happened?

427
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:27,099
How cruel.

428
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,868
- No way! - Goodness.

429
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:30,138
He shot him.

430
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:31,740
- Look it up. - Call it in.

431
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:34,570
I'll kill you!

432
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,009
Hello, Gangnam Police Station.

433
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,079
Gangnam Police Station, Detective Park speaking.

434
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,678
- Yes. - It's a live stream?

435
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:43,850
A gunshot?

436
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,290
Someone got shot! Let's roll!

437
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,189
How dare you?

438
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,000
(Streaming from Sim Yong's house)

439
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:02,699
It looks so good.

440
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:07,669
Now,

441
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,510
the father shot the son.

442
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:12,079
The son,

443
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,510
in a manner that befits someone who killed his mom,

444
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,719
takes a stand and fights back.

445
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,519
Between father and son,

446
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,590
who will be the one to survive?

447
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,219
Isn't it captivating?

448
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,159
This is my conclusion.

449
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,359
Min Do Hyuk. No.

450
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,060
You, Sim Jun Seok,

451
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,770
ends up getting killed at his father's hand.

452
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,899
- Do you get it? - No!

453
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,040
Stop it!

454
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:41,340
Do Hyuk.

455
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:43,580
Goodbye.

456
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,219
Get out of here, Do Hyuk.

457
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,389
I'm sick of you.

458
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,330
You won't be able to dodge this.

459
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
What on earth?

460
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,399
You must stay alive.

461
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,500
Get out of here. Go, now!

462
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,959
Let go, you pathetic old man.

463
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,389
Let go!

464
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:34,189
Shut down the video.

465
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,129
Shut it down!

466
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Min Do Hyuk...

467
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,300
No!

468
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,040
The psycho.

469
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,250
What's wrong? Why was it cut off?

470
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,279
Is he dead or alive?

471
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,320
Let's see.

472
00:31:58,619 --> 00:31:59,889
What happened?

473
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,350
Who's dead?

474
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,859
- What happened? - What's going on?

475
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:09,100
Who's inside?

476
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,138
I'll kill you.

477
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:21,240
You can't!

478
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,240
To get Do Hyuk,

479
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,040
we need him as bait.

480
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:27,780
I'll handle everything here.

481
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,449
You must get away.

482
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,689
Master.

483
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,859
I want to...

484
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,060
be alone with Mom.

485
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:19,669
All right.

486
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,009
What happened?

487
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,109
You said she'd died.

488
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,219
Did you lie?

489
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,050
Why?

490
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,189
I didn't think she'd make it.

491
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:41,350
She was born at 28 weeks and had pneumonia.

492
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,189
The doctor said she didn't stand a chance.

493
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:45,730
It was Paeng Hee...

494
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,560
who saved her life.

495
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,500
Paeng Hee was the best mom Han Na could have.

496
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,929
You psycho.

497
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:57,199
Yes.

498
00:33:57,899 --> 00:33:58,969
Hit me.

499
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,810
I deserve it, so keep going.

500
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:06,550
Paeng Hee died because of me.

501
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,179
I got greedy.

502
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,520
I thought I could...

503
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,290
use Han Na to blackmail K.

504
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,159
I used Paeng Hee.

505
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,960
You're not even human!

506
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,000
What will happen to the kid now?

507
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,400
I won't ask you to raise her.

508
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,028
I'll take her. I'll keep her alive.

509
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:29,500
How?

510
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,468
K will follow her...

511
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,569
to the end of the world if he knows she's alive.

512
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,239
Do you think you can keep her hidden?

513
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,980
It's none of your business.

514
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,710
Are you saying...

515
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,920
you want to play the mom card now?

516
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:48,150
That kid...

517
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,589
Mom.

518
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:53,989
Get up.

519
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,569
Mom.

520
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,369
K will think Han Na's dead.

521
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,480
What do you mean?

522
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,610
That's what his lackeys will tell him.

523
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:17,619
She's dead?

524
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:19,319
Yes.

525
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:21,589
Both the mom and kid were taken care of.

526
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,860
You don't need to worry.

527
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:25,290
Fate determines how long you live.

528
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,730
Good job.

529
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,929
Bring Min Do Hyuk to me,

530
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,230
and you'll get an apartment in Gangnam.

531
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,940
Thank you, sir.

532
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:38,269
Watch the hospital Chairman Sim's at.

533
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,709
The fearless fool...

534
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,440
is bound to show up there.

535
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:43,509
Now go.

536
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,330
K.

537
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,600
You've made a mistake.

538
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,400
I have nothing to fear anymore.

539
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,040
I swear, I will be the one to kill you.

540
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,639
Min Do Hyuk.

541
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,909
Where are you?

542
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,679
I desperately need you right now.

543
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,230
(Sim Yong's son had plastic surgery to become Min Do Hyuk)

544
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:39,529
(Min Do Hyuk fled scene after shooting Chairman Sim)

545
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,839
I'm Chairman Sim's son?

546
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,949
Chairman Sim is still in a coma.

547
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,860
Tonight will be critical.

548
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,989
Take care of things before he dies.

549
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,860
I've already taken care of it.

550
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,999
I'm also circulating rumors that Sungchan will be bought out...

551
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,469
by a Chinese corporation.

552
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:16,569
Good work.

553
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,838
This whole country...

554
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:21,610
will soon rise up to save Sungchan.

555
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,580
I think it is now time to get rid of Lee Hwi So.

556
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,349
Once we get Sungchan Group,

557
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,219
we no longer need Lee Hwi So.

558
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,219
Sungchan is full of talented people.

559
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,118
But we don't have nearly enough funds...

560
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:40,130
to acquire Sungchan Group.

561
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:44,659
That's why we need to find Chairman Bang's money.

562
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,069
That money would solve everything.

563
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,639
(CEO Geum La Hui)

564
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,309
Why aren't you answering your phone?

565
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,679
Are you avoiding me?

566
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,819
Be honest.

567
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:07,149
How did you find out...

568
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,020
that Min Do Hyuk was Chairman Sim's son?

569
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,630
Matthew told you, didn't he?

570
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,130
We would have to be insane to believe that Sim Jun Seok...

571
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,999
got plastic surgery to become Min Do Hyuk.

572
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,269
We know Min Do Hyuk.

573
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,009
We really got to know him in Jeju.

574
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:27,339
That means...

575
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,110
Sim Jun Seok got plastic surgery...

576
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,449
to become Matthew Lee.

577
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,979
The first person to realize that was Kang Ki Tak.

578
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,949
That's why he was the first to be eliminated.

579
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:40,818
Did you make a deal with Matthew...

580
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,290
after figuring that out?

581
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:50,459
The puzzle is finally coming together.

582
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,130
Matthew knew so much about Chairman Sim...

583
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,028
because Chairman Sim was his father.

584
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:56,939
When he killed his mom five years ago,

585
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,409
he was kicked out of the house and cut off from his family.

586
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,440
That's why he was so obsessed...

587
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,580
with getting Sungchan Group.

588
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:07,909
I did think Matthew was hiding something,

589
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,719
but this is crazy.

590
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,850
That's not a bad story.

591
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,989
But do you know what is really important now?

592
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,460
This means Sim Jun Seok, as in Matthew,

593
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,259
isn't Chairman Sim's son.

594
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:27,698
Why do you say so?

595
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,739
Chairman Sim's wife had only one child.

596
00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:34,139
She got a hysterectomy after a difficult delivery,

597
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,839
then she went to Hawaii to recover.

598
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,178
I heard this from my boss when I was a chief...

599
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,750
at a university hospital, so it's reliable information.

600
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:44,379
So are you saying Chairman Sim's only biological son...

601
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,049
is Min Do Hyuk?

602
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,190
Why? Does Matthew suddenly seem less impressive now?

603
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,989
No.

604
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,888
Regardless of whether or not he is Chairman Sim's biological son,

605
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:56,600
Matthew is the owner of TIKITAKA.

606
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:59,429
And soon, he's going to take over Sungchan Group.

607
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,568
I don't care about background.

608
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:03,839
It doesn't matter how dirty it is. Money is money.

609
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:07,809
So? Are you planning to threaten Matthew...

610
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,380
to get money from him?

611
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,178
Do you think I'm crazy?

612
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:14,249
I don't want to deal with a crazy person.

613
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,719
I just need money.

614
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,119
I'm going to go abroad as soon as I find Chairman Bang's money.

615
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,860
We need to hurry...

616
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,658
before Matthew gets his hands on it.

617
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:26,529
How are we supposed to take the buried money?

618
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:30,630
I found someone to help us. Nam Chul Woo.

619
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,368
An old eagle is still an eagle. He used to be a police officer,

620
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:34,929
so he'll be useful in many ways.

621
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:42,580
You know where Chairman Bang's money is.

622
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,040
Where might that be?

623
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,610
Once we find the money, let's split it exactly in half.

624
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,949
One more thing.

625
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,049
I think half of your shares in Sungchan should be mine.

626
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:56,519
I definitely helped...

627
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,989
in you getting Sungchan Group.

628
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,500
Your calculations are always so transparent.

629
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:08,869
Money is always definite and exact.

630
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:12,310
We are similar in that way.

631
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,909
We both distrust people...

632
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:17,009
and like money.

633
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:28,520
What are you going to do with Cha Ju Ran?

634
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,489
We need to use her until we get Chairman Bang's money.

635
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,489
If we split the money with Cha Ju Ran,

636
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:37,059
Nam Chul Woo will want his share too.

637
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,299
That will complicate things.

638
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:41,699
You should...

639
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,270
take care of Cha Ju Ran.

640
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,239
She already knows too much about you.

641
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,609
I don't like that there is someone else...

642
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:56,420
in the world that knows about your identity.

643
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,089
You really are...

644
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:07,089
one impressive woman.

645
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:11,630
Now we need to begin our hunt for Sungchan Group.

646
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:14,569
I'll do my best to help you.

647
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,600
(Electrical hazard)

648
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,218
There should be a door that connects...

649
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:06,089
to an underground tunnel somewhere around here.

650
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,650
Then we need to find a button.

651
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,529
- What? - The frame.

652
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,229
Let's move this first. Yes?

653
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,330
Oh, goodness.

654
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,409
- Be careful. - What? It's okay.

655
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
Over there...

656
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,119
It worked.

657
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,420
Wait... That door.

658
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:48,560
I knew it. This is it.

659
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:53,029
Here. Let's open this.

660
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,270
Here we go.

661
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:01,170
- It didn't work. - To the left.

662
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,339
One, two.

663
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,409
- Oh, no. - It's not working.

664
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,049
Why isn't this working?

665
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,949
- Oh, my! What is this? - Oh, my.

666
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:14,150
Zero, nine, one, five.

667
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,389
- What is that? - My birthday.

668
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:16,690
Come on.

669
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:25,699
- Wait! - What now?

670
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,368
Focus. Okay? There.

671
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:37,110
- Focus. - Focus!

672
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,730
Nice!

673
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:35,699
It's mine!

674
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:48,549
Don't faint.

675
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,650
There's at least two billion dollars in here.

676
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,888
I'll bring it to you in a truck soon.

677
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:54,119
(Message, Cha Ju Ran)

678
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,130
We got the cash.

679
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:01,988
Wait for me at the location we agreed on.

680
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:04,500
(TIKITAKA, Matthew Lee)

681
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,549
Get ready.

682
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,889
We...

683
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:31,319
- have the money! - We have the money!

684
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,659
Hey!

685
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,600
With my beloved, Ju Ran! Hey!

686
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:38,159
- I... - Yes!

687
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:41,630
- What is that? - What is that?

688
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,000
It's a breathalyzer checkpoint. Don't get scared.

689
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:45,440
Act natural.

690
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,169
Act natural.

691
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,710
Act natural.

692
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,610
- Act natural. - That's right.

693
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,279
(Checkpoint)

694
00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:00,150
You're working so late.

695
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:03,189
Are there still people who drink and drive at night?

696
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,289
I know.

697
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,759
We're looking for a wanted criminal.

698
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,489
Can you step out for a second?

699
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,900
What department are you in?

700
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,630
The commissioner of the Seoul Police Agency is my classmate.

701
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,869
I apologize. I didn't know.

702
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,000
Then you must know there are no exceptions.

703
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:20,469
Please step out.

704
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:23,940
Me too?

705
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,250
I... What are we going to do?

706
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,679
It's okay. Stay calm.

707
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:37,889
Good work, everyone.

708
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,190
Can you both step over here?

709
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,129
How dare you order us around?

710
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,529
We're busy people.

711
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,399
If you don't, we could arrest you for failure to comply.

712
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,429
Please follow me.

713
00:47:46,799 --> 00:47:47,869
Lead the way.

714
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,269
Let me check.

715
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,369
I'd like both of you to look at me.

716
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,979
- What the... - Gosh, why are you...

717
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,679
- My gosh! - My gosh.

718
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:01,710
- Goodness. - Hey!

719
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,880
What the... What are you doing?

720
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,420
What are you doing?

721
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,489
- Chul Woo! - What?

722
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:14,690
Our truck!

723
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:15,888
- What the... - Oh, my gosh!

724
00:48:15,889 --> 00:48:17,630
Why that... Hey!

725
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:18,799
Let's go!

726
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,400
How dare you steal my truck?

727
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:23,369
Hey! Hey, you punk!

728
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,738
Hold on. Chul Woo!

729
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:28,139
Over there!

730
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:29,880
Hey!

731
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:31,810
Hey!

732
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,549
Hey! They...

733
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:35,480
What the...

734
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,980
They were fake cops?

735
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,889
Call the police! Right now!

736
00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:41,690
How can we call the police?

737
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,420
Are you going to say the money we stole got stolen?

738
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,920
Darn it!

739
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,258
We were totally fooled!

740
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:50,699
- Who on earth did this? - Darn it!

741
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:00,909
Chairman Bang's money...

742
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:03,480
I will never let anyone take it.

743
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:12,750
(Sungchan Hospital)

744
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,429
Check the incinerator in the back.

745
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:26,630
Yes, sir.

746
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:38,440
Who are you?

747
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,520
This is the back entrance! Go after him!

748
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:15,850
What's going on?

749
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:19,150
We got a tip that someone suspicious was seen by the emergency stairwell.

750
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,448
Nobody came this way.

751
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:21,920
Are you sure you didn't fall for a trap?

752
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:23,659
Stay on your toes, you idiots!

753
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:25,619
- Spread out and find him! - Spread out.

754
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,139
Don't bother wasting your time.

755
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:44,110
You're just going to give me up to K and take the credit.

756
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,150
I won't fall for it twice.

757
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:49,150
I'll get rid of you first,

758
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,119
then take care of your master.

759
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,560
Paeng Hee died.

760
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,029
K killed her.

761
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,360
The reason why I joined K was to keep Paeng Hee safe.

762
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,400
But with Paeng Hee dead, things are different.

763
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:09,670
K is nothing more than my enemy now.

764
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,100
Hey, hurry up and find him!

765
00:51:21,509 --> 00:51:23,020
I need to meet Chairman Sim.

766
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,389
He's the only option I have to reveal who Matthew really is.

767
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:30,989
I found Min Do Hyuk.

768
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,159
Min Do Hyuk ran off to the first-floor emergency room.

769
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:36,960
Everyone go to the emergency room. All of you!

770
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,400
Follow me.

771
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,039
Come to the emergency room!

772
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,610
Yes, sir. Follow me!

773
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,479
You need to finish in three minutes.

774
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,819
Before they figure it out.

775
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,250
Get out of here, Do Hyuk.

776
00:53:05,779 --> 00:53:07,750
I'm going to use Sungchan's S Talk app...

777
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:10,119
to reveal who Matthew really is.

778
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,489
To do that,

779
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:15,460
I need your help.

780
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,600
J.

781
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:22,770
S.

782
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:26,469
Nine, one,

783
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:30,040
Nine, one, zero, four, one, four.

784
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:35,880
That's my password to get into...

785
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,449
the Sungchan servers.

786
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:45,489
It's the day my son, Jun Seok, was born.

787
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,460
April 14, 1991?

788
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,468
Baek Ik Ho figured it out.

789
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:56,698
Leave this place to me and go.

790
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:57,770
Hurry!

791
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,509
Hurry up.

792
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:20,388
(Dualsonic)

793
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:22,559
How dare you stab me in the back.

794
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,199
- Hey, let go. - Tell me.

795
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:25,659
Tell me the truth!

796
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:26,798
Hurry up and tell me!

797
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:28,968
Where's my money? Where is it?

798
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:31,500
What kind of nonsense is this?

799
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,939
I gave you a job, but you're pretending you got robbed...

800
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,109
so that you can take all that money for yourself?

801
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:38,209
Watch who you try to scam.

802
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,479
The only ones...

803
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,879
who knew about this plan were you, me, and Nam Chul Woo.

804
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,849
You're the only one who knew our route.

805
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,790
How dare you try to weasel your way out?

806
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:48,889
No way.

807
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,360
Was it you, Matthew?

808
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,130
If you act like this, I won't stay quiet.

809
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:57,960
I will tell the world what you did to Bang Da Mi.

810
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,799
I'll make sure you can't walk around in Korea with that face.

811
00:55:00,929 --> 00:55:03,770
Do you think I have anything to fear after losing all that money?

812
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,339
Keep your mouth shut.

813
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:09,310
I'll find that money.

814
00:55:10,779 --> 00:55:14,380
Hey. You... What are you going to do?

815
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,319
Do you think I'll give up?

816
00:55:17,549 --> 00:55:21,089
Give me my money! My money...

817
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:25,119
My money! It was my money!

818
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,690
I think Yang Jin Mo betrayed us.

819
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,899
He disappeared after he said he saw Min Do Hyuk...

820
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,230
at Chairman Sim's hospital.

821
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:35,900
He's really bold, isn't he?

822
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:40,940
Do you think he found out that No Paeng Hee is dead?

823
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,738
I doubt that he knows.

824
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:44,880
You doubt it?

825
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,350
You doubt it?

826
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:52,179
Hey.

827
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,218
If you do a half-hearted job like this,

828
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:02,190
you won't get a field of magnolias, let alone an apartment.

829
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:04,459
Go out and find Yang Jin Mo.

830
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,500
Yes, sir.

831
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:10,270
No, wait.

832
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,739
I'll find him myself.

833
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:16,779
Get a press conference ready.

834
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,238
Right now?

836

I'll also mention that it turns out...

837
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:26,049
Yang Jin Mo is his accomplice.

838
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,420
I'll even put up a huge reward for capturing them.

839
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:32,459
If I offer ten million dollars a head,

840
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,059
people will go crazy for the money...

841
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,560
and do whatever they can to find them.

842
00:56:37,029 --> 00:56:38,060

843
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:39,969
Yes, sir.

844
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,889
Geum La Hui arrived at TIKITAKA to meet K.

845
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:09,159
Okay. How are things over there?

846
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,359
Things are still going smoothly.

847
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,868
I'm quite excited to see...

848
00:57:13,869 --> 00:57:15,969
what kind of face K makes.

about Geum La Hui and Sim Jun Seok,

Hello.

859
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:46,600
- Good to see you. - What do you think this is about?

860
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:11,618
Chairman Lee, you have a flower delivery.

861
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:12,659
I brought flowers.

862
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:16,730

I wish you the best.

867
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,319
You totally got me fooled.

868
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,819
You paid me back for my kindness with betrayal?

869
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:42,690
Makes sense.

870
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,259
I was a fool for trusting a punk who killed his own father.

You're talking so much nonsense with that mouth of yours.

You must think you have a long life, Geum La Hui.

01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,440
Darn it!

919
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,279
He's here!

920
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,949
Sir! What is this message about?

921
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:27,019
Are you really Sim Jun Seok?

922
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,488
It says Ms. Geum joined hands with the man who killed her daughter.

923
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:30,659
Is this true?

924
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,290
I don't understand what you're talking about.

925
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:37,129
I know nothing about this.

927
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:40,130
No, it's not true.

928
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,730
That is all fake news.

929
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:45,039
It's a fake video created by Sim Jun Seok.

930
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,639
Can you prove that it's fake?

931
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:58,049
It's over for you,

932
01:01:59,279 --> 01:02:00,290
K.

933
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,219
No.

934
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,889
Sim Jun Seok.

(The Escape of the Seven)

937
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:55,008
K disappeared.

938
01:02:55,009 --> 01:02:56,368
We could catch K...

939
01:02:56,369 --> 01:02:59,079
I mean, Matthew, before the police and kill him first.

940
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,508
The only hope we have to reveal Matthew is fake.

941
01:03:01,509 --> 01:03:03,618
You can never stop me.

942
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:04,749
Did you get shot?

943
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,919
If you die, I won't forgive you.

944
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,718
Good job getting this far, Min Do Hyuk.

945
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:12,718
Because evil always won.

946
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:14,988
I'll punish you in return for all the innocent people...

947
01:03:14,989 --> 01:03:16,290
you have killed.
