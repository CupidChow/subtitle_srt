(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

12
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:03,053
(Episode 11)

13
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:04,083
Hey.

14
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:05,884
How long have you been working with Lee Hwi So?

15
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,123
From the beginning?

16
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:08,655
Or did you betray us in the middle?

17
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:10,524
I had no idea that Bang Da Mi's biological mother...

18
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:12,224
and her adoptive father would work together!

19
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:15,995
Lee Hwi So would never work with me.

20
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:17,764
What do you mean by that?

21
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:19,665
Lee Hwi So knows everything.

22
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:21,703
He knows that I was after Chairman Bang's money...

23
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:23,234
when I took Da Mi back as my daughter.

24
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:24,774
You're right!

25
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:25,974
That's the kind of woman I am.

26
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:28,373
I knew Da Mi wasn't pregnant,

27
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:29,644
but I turned a blind eye to it.

28
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:32,643
I was afraid people would find out I was her mom,

29
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:34,284
so I purposely joined forces with Mone.

30
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:36,114
I abandoned...

31
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:38,284
my biological daughter...

32
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:40,695
and left her to die.

33
00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:56,644
I can prove that.

34
00:01:58,105 --> 00:01:59,305
Geum La Hui...

35
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:00,945
is not working with Lee Hwi So.

36
00:02:02,614 --> 00:02:03,885
How did you...

37
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:06,715
I came to keep my promise.

38
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:09,385
Lee Hwi So, the man you were all so desperate to find...

39
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:11,185
I found him.

40
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:12,724
What? You found him?

41
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:14,124
Where is he?

42
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:15,395
He's here,

43
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:16,925
right now.

44
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:18,664
I...

45
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:20,435
am Lee Hwi So.

46
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:21,835
What?

47
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:32,145
What the...

48
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:33,305
Oh, my.

49
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:41,914
That's right.

50
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:44,324
I'm Lee Hwi So.

51
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:48,693
The dock worker you all killed on the deserted island...

52
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,294
was me too!

53
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:52,123
Okay.

54
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:53,895
Why don't you all say it to my face?

55
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:55,865
That Lee Hwi So is a crazy psycho.

56
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:58,335
That he's a lunatic...

57
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,434
who killed his own daughter,

58
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:02,235
stole all of Mr. Bang's money and locked him up in jail.

59
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:05,645
If any of you told the truth...

60
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:07,444
and acted like adults,

61
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:09,675
Da Mi wouldn't have died like that.

62
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:12,044
You all deserve to die.

63
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:17,525
Look.

64
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:20,495
These are proofs of the collateral you put up to get out of trouble.

65
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:23,395
I simply took them as promised.

66
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:25,294
All right.

67
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:27,564
I will put my career as a doctor on the line.

68
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:29,365
You know how great that is, don't you?

69
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:31,735
I might as well put my position as a police commissioner on the line.

70
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:33,335
I will put my career as a teacher on the line.

71
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:35,634
I will also put my life as a celebrity on the line.

72
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:36,974
Then, the two of you...

73
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:38,844
will put your positions as the CEO of TIKITAKA Studio...

74
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:40,914
and Cherry Entertainment on the line.

75
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:44,384
I really hope what you all said was the truth.

76
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:47,784
Hey, Kang Ki Tak!

77
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:49,754
Is what Matthew saying true?

78
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:52,025
You stole my business?

79
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:54,155
- I'm going to kill you. - What are you doing?

80
00:03:56,624 --> 00:03:58,524
You know you're no match for Ki Tak.

81
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,995
What are you going to do? Hey.

82
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:03,235
Min Do Hyuk...

83
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:10,504
You...

84
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:13,145
Were you the traitor?

85
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,614
Yes, that's right. I'm...

86
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:17,284
with Lee Hwi So.

87
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:21,613
Let's not bother trying to put up an act.

88
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:23,014
You can't anymore anyway.

89
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:24,755
Then Matthew... No, Lee Hwi So.

90
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:26,524
No, I mean...

91
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:27,695
he...

92
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:30,164
knows about everything we've done so far?

93
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:32,494
He's been playing us all this time?

94
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:34,494
What are we going to do now?

95
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:36,835
What can we do? We're ruined.

96
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:40,504
I'll take care of this punk.

97
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:41,534
Hey, get up.

98
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:43,234
I've been counting the days for this moment.

99
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:45,604
Wait, hold on. Do Hyuk, hear me out.

100
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:54,784
Why did you kill my family?

101
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:56,584
You could've just sent me to prison.

102
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:58,724
Why did you burn my poor family to death?

103
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:00,195
I had no choice.

104
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:01,424
You had no choice?

105
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:04,195
Sungchan Group made you do it. Right?

106
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,664
Tell me why you killed them.

107
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:12,804
Where is K, that jerk?

108
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:16,135
I'm going to go to the ends of the earth to kill him.

109
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:20,315
You can't tell me?

110
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:22,275
Fine. Just die.

111
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:29,514
A few moments ago,

112
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:31,755
Prosecutor General Um Ji Man died.

113
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,025
How did he die?

114
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:37,895
I would think you know best why he died.

115
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:42,434
The reason why Um Ji Man killed himself.

116
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,864
He killed himself?

117
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:46,635
There's no way.

118
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:49,875
He was under investigation for using drugs with Nam Chul Woo.

119
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:53,005
You're the one who ratted Prosecutor General Um out. Right?

120
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:54,474
It wasn't me.

121
00:05:54,544 --> 00:05:55,644
Don't accuse me!

122
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:56,775
Stop lying!

123
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:58,645
I saw it.

124
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:01,085
You put drugs in Um Ji Man's liquor.

125
00:06:04,455 --> 00:06:06,224
You... You punk...

126
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:09,624
Right. I made a deal with the prosecutor.

127
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,794
He said if I named my accomplice, I wouldn't get a felony.

128
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:13,694
I had no idea Prosecutor General Um would die.

129
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:15,835
I thought he would get off easy.

130
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:18,965
Someone incredibly powerful has his back...

131
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:24,104
No way. Did K...

132
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:26,044
Yes.

133
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,244
The person who killed Um Ji Man was K.

134
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,414
K was behind Um Ji Man's suicide.

135
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,494
K killed him?

136
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,695
Is it because I told Um Ji Man?

137
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:44,493
We have breaking news.

138
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:48,234
Prosecutor General Um Ji Man took his own life a few hours ago.

139
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:50,803
According to sources, Prosecutor General Um...

140
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:52,933
was arrested without a warrant and was under investigation...

141
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:55,034
for drug use.

142
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,673
As he was well respected by the people,

143
00:06:57,674 --> 00:06:59,375
it appears being involved with a crime...

144
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:03,215
Wasn't Um Ji Man...

145
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:05,885
close with Jun Seok?

146
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:07,184
Yes, sir.

147
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:10,215
What is Jun Seok up to these days?

148
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:12,525
He's been laying low,

149
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:14,195
just like you ordered.

150
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:16,895
All right.

151
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:20,934
What happened to that girl, Song Ji A?

152
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:22,465
You don't...

153
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:25,135
need to worry about her anymore.

154
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,335
Take good care of it, so it doesn't blow up in our faces.

155
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,005
Yes, sir.

156
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,275
Ji A and Um Ji Man...

157
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:34,344
were both killed by K.

158
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:37,184
Just like Da Mi, Mr. Bang,

159
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:38,684
and Do Hyuk's family!

160
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:41,684
K killed them all and hid the truth.

161
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:44,825
So...

162
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:46,784
what are you going to do with us?

163
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:48,554
Will you kill us?

164
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:51,163
Please...

165
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:53,265
Please return my children to me.

166
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:55,034
I'll do whatever you say.

167
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:58,205
My kids didn't do anything wrong.

168
00:07:58,335 --> 00:07:59,434
Da Mi...

169
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,734
didn't do anything wrong either!

170
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:05,145
She had no reason to die!

171
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:07,945
You know...

172
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:10,844
we didn't kill Da Mi.

173
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:13,543
How is spreading fake news...

174
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:15,054
different from murder?

175
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:17,254
All of your lies came together...

176
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:19,125
to break Da Mi's arms and legs...

177
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:20,994
which ultimately led to her death.

178
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:23,054
So?

179
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,265
Is that why you killed all the members of Scarlet Letter?

180
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,094
Is that not murder?

181
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:28,965
That was clearly a massacre too!

182
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:31,304
Scarlet Letter and its followers were all evil.

183
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:34,905
- What? - Because they created fake news,

184
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:37,803
do you know how many people died and got ruined for five years?

185
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:39,043
How did a cigarette butt get in here?

186
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:41,314
Its victims were wasting away after being falsely accused.

187
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:42,345
What is that?

188
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:45,184
But the assailants felt no remorse and created more fake news!

189
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:47,184
But nobody...

190
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:49,255
punished them.

191
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:52,225
I'm doing it because the law won't.

192
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:55,025
We can't have any more victims like Da Mi.

193
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:57,964
This is the last way for a father to seek atonement...

194
00:08:58,194 --> 00:08:59,625
for failing to protect his daughter!

195
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:05,804
Cha Ju Ran.

196
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:08,875
You even pushed Mr. Bang off of the suspension bridge.

197
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:10,405
Why?

198
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:13,375
Did Geum La Hui tell you to?

199
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:15,745
Tell us what you want.

200
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:17,713
There must be a reason...

201
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:19,443
why you didn't kill us in Jeju Island and let us live.

202
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:20,485
Tell us.

203
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:21,985
You sure are smart.

204
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:24,525
I plan to use you guys as my pawns...

205
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:26,284
to fight K.

206
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:27,625
Pawns?

207
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:29,895
What kind of power do we have to catch him?

208
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:33,194
You know about K's warning too.

209
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:35,365
People get killed just for saying his name.

210
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:37,303
But you want us to catch him?

211
00:09:37,304 --> 00:09:38,634
Do you think that's possible?

212
00:09:38,635 --> 00:09:39,865
Shut it!

213
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:42,304
I can kill you all right now.

214
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,475
No.

215
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:45,304
If you're really Lee Hwi So,

216
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:48,074
all of this will be over if we report you.

217
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:50,985
You're right.

218
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:52,783
The world remembers Lee Hwi So as the man...

219
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:55,615
who killed his adoptive daughter and Chairman Bang.

220
00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:57,683
As long as the real criminal doesn't turn himself in,

221
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,084
the sentence is still valid,

222
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:01,525
and you're still a prisoner with a life sentence.

223
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:03,693
Now that Chairman Bang is dead,

224
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:06,125
it'll be harder to prove your innocence.

225
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,735
Is there a reason why we must listen to you?

226
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,735
I guess you all forgot.

227
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:14,073
Lee Hwi So is already dead,

228
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:16,605
and as soon as he died, he disappeared from the system.

229
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:18,104
In other words,

230
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,645
there's no way to prove that Matthew is Lee Hwi So.

231
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:23,544
In return, we have collected information on all of you.

232
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:26,544
We know things you want to hide from the world.

233
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:29,015
Your innermost secrets,

234
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:30,954
corruptions, weaknesses...

235
00:10:31,184 --> 00:10:32,225
All of them.

236
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:45,834
What was the meaning behind what you said to the reporters?

237
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:48,275
That you will always be with me.

238
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:53,044
Matthew, I miss you especially a lot today.

239
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:56,615
Would you like to have a drink with me?

240
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:59,015
I'll go to where you are.

241
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:04,655
You're madly in love with him.

242
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,654
You had no idea he was the Grim Reaper coming after you.

243
00:11:07,655 --> 00:11:10,764
What? Do you want me to go over to your place?

244
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:13,094
Shut it! I ought to rip that tongue out!

245
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:15,634
Last night was just for fun.

246
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:16,694
What?

247
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:19,005
It was a happening. You know that, right?

248
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:23,635
The person to bring up last night must pay a fine of 100,000 dollars.

249
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:26,673
What is that?

250
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:28,114
- Turn it off! - What...

251
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:30,784
How could this...

252
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:32,314
Please don't be mistaken.

253
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:34,384
It was a mistake I made once when I was drunk.

254
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:36,553
I swear. It's not like that between us.

255
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:39,255
She's not my type at all.

256
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:41,953
You enjoyed it too, but what? It was a mistake?

257
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:43,654
Are you a real man?

258
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:45,765
Are you out of your mind?

259
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:49,495
Ma'am. Your painting is done.

260
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:52,265
I put a lot of effort into it this time,

261
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:54,375
so you need to pay me more.

262
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,804
I see you still like to get bribes.

263
00:11:56,975 --> 00:12:00,203
You always acted so high and mighty,

264
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:02,674
but you sell your paintings to your students' parents?

265
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:03,984
You're so dirty...

266
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:05,913
What do you expect me to do without my husband?

267
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:08,814
Do you know how hard it is to raise my twins well?

268
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:11,953
A teacher's salary is not enough!

269
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:13,184
How does this make sense?

270
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,953
TIKITAKA's claim that their secret chats are totally secret...

271
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:17,564
is a complete lie!

272
00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:20,365
How could a person's private life be exposed like this?

273
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,765
Think about what you did!

274
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:27,064
About how you ruined the lives of others.

275
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:30,374
From the beginning, all the messages you six sent...

276
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,944
received special attention.

277
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,015
There's no reason to protect your privacy.

278
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:36,615
I made TIKITAKA to look into you.

279
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:38,944
Geum La Hui is getting on my nerves.

280
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:42,083
What's this? Director Michell...

281
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:43,213
received the Silver Bear...

282
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:44,324
at the Berlin International Film Festival.

283
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:45,784
Oh, really?

284
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:48,954
We should throw her a huge welcoming party when she gets back.

285
00:12:49,554 --> 00:12:51,193
If needed, I'll get rid of her...

286
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:54,334
and take the position of CEO of TIKITAKA Studio.

287
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:59,063
Thank you so much for giving me the chance...

288
00:12:59,064 --> 00:13:00,564
to work with a star director like her, Ms. Geum.

289
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:04,574
It's a great idea.

290
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:05,844
She knows my weakness,

291
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:08,015
so I had no choice but to sign with her,

292
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:10,214
but I'm always on your side, Mr. Yang.

293
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:12,544
Was that it?

294
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:15,684
You two are conspiring to get rid of me?

295
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:18,284
Yang Jin Mo. Han Mone.

296
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,324
Was that how you felt?

297
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:22,725
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

298
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,423
I can reveal things that are worse.

299
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:28,235
Then K won't have to go through the trouble of killing you.

300
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,804
There's more to life than just breathing.

301
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:32,204
You only have one choice.

302
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:34,974
You can die in vain in K's hands,

303
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:36,333
or gain the chance to make amends,

304
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:38,044
and do something one last time.

305
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:40,543
If you do as we say,

306
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:42,414
we'll even protect you from K.

307
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,115
We need time to think.

308
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:48,615
You need to come to me with an answer tomorrow morning.

309
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:50,885
I can't give you more time.

310
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:59,265
What kind of choice do you think they'll make?

311
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:01,194
They have no choice.

312
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:02,865
The answer is already there.

313
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:04,534
They have to help us.

314
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:10,074
Do Hyuk.

315
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:12,275
Let's go. I'll drive you.

316
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:26,125
I choose Matthew.

317
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:29,025
No, I'm going to stand on Lee Hwi So's side.

318
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:30,894
At the very least, Lee Hwi So...

319
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:33,193
isn't a psychopathic serial murderer.

320
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:35,293
Why isn't he a serial murderer?

321
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:37,094
Think about what he did in Jeju Island.

322
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:38,804
He killed so many people.

323
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:41,303
It was a total nightmare.

324
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:43,674
If you think about it, Lee Hwi So didn't kill them.

325
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:45,604
We did.

326
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:47,774
That doesn't mean we could trust him.

327
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:49,474
If we put our trust in him and get abandoned again,

328
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:50,514
there's no future for us.

329
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,683
Furthermore, Min Do Hyuk and Kang Ki Tak are loose cannons.

330
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,414
K is just as much of a loose cannon as they are.

331
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:59,385
After seeing how he got rid of Um Ji Man, his right hand,

332
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,194
he's not human.

333
00:15:01,595 --> 00:15:03,854
Lee Hwi So is more humane.

334
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:05,924
He even made the promise...

335
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:08,235
to ensure our safety.

336
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:10,494
It's not like they'll be with us 24 hours a day.

337
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,235
How will he protect us?

338
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:15,475
Prosecutor General Um was killed at the Prosecutor's Office.

339
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:18,375
That means there is no safe place for us in Korea.

340
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:24,184
I'm going to stand with K.

341
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:26,944
What side do you choose, Ms. Geum?

342
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:30,254
Let's take a vote. Is it Lee Hwi So or K?

343
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:32,784
Fine. Then...

344
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:36,194
show the back of your hand for Lee Hwi So and your palm for K.

345
00:15:36,424 --> 00:15:38,894
Choose at the count of three.

346
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,063
Did you all decide?

347
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,433
Hold on.

348
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:43,365
Thinking won't change anything.

349
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:44,834
Trust your instincts.

350
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:47,365
Okay. Let's start.

351
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:50,534
One, two, three!

352
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,515
Geum La Hui! What are you doing? Hurry up and decide.

353
00:16:01,914 --> 00:16:03,083
I choose Lee Hwi So.

354
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:05,283
Because he's also Matthew.

355
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:06,553
What did you just hear?

356
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:09,293
Matthew made TIKITAKA to kill us!

357
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:10,525
Be quiet!

358
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:12,364
Based on the majority vote,

359
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:14,765
we've decided on Lee Hwi So.

360
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:16,495
Don't back out now.

361
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:20,105
As long as we've come to a decision, nobody can do anything alone.

362
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:23,073
Matthew... No, Lee Hwi So...

363
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:25,904
is keeping an eye on everything we do. Don't forget.

364
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:28,674
If we do anything rash, we can't guarantee anything.

365
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:32,115
We have no choice but to rely on Lee Hwi So's humanism.

366
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:40,324
Erica. Phillip.

367
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:49,895
They just fell asleep.

368
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:52,865
Better not to wake them up.

369
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:58,905
Thank you. You can go home now.

370
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:04,885
You should be grateful for Matthew's generosity.

371
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:09,484
Who are you?

372
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,325
You should get plenty of sleep tonight.

373
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:15,954
It'll be hard for you to sleep from now on.

374
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:33,575
Gosh. Why are you living in a place like this?

375
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:36,644
Let's look for a new place tomorrow.

376
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:39,413
Gosh, I don't need to.

377
00:17:39,414 --> 00:17:41,085
This place is better than most.

378
00:17:42,754 --> 00:17:43,754
Here you go.

379
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:51,423
I've lived in this house for about a year...

380
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:54,565
with my mom and Jae Hyuk.

381
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:57,234
My mom really loved this place.

382
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:03,305
Did I ever tell you I was adopted?

383
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:07,645
Once when you were drunk.

384
00:18:08,474 --> 00:18:11,213
I was told I was abandoned in front of a hospital like trash.

385
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:15,085
But my mom took me home and raised me.

386
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:17,483
I found out at her funeral...

387
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:20,055
when my relatives were whispering about it behind my back.

388
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:23,224
My mom never told me about it.

389
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:27,365
Why is this here?

390
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,564
I took it from her funeral while I was drunk.

391
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:33,203
I thought I would feel less lonely...

392
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:35,704
if I had that with me.

393
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:39,674
You're crazy. You just left it there for five years?

394
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,514
Yes. I didn't use a single time.

395
00:18:42,174 --> 00:18:43,814
How could I spend it?

396
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:46,684
It's the price of my mom and Jae Hyuk's life.

397
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:48,184
At least put it in the bank.

398
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,615
It doesn't look good to leave it in your house like that.

399
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:52,285
Okay.

400
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,994
Oh, right. Did you find Madam No?

401
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:02,494
I have a favor to ask regarding that.

402
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:05,204
Madam No...

403
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:08,534
is Yang Jin Mo's woman.

404
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,904
What? Do you believe that?

405
00:19:10,905 --> 00:19:11,974
Did Madam No say that?

406
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:13,504
They have a kid.

407
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:15,115
Her name is No Han Na.

408
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:19,545
She looked to be about 5 or 6 years old.

409
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:23,454
Find out if that girl is Yang Jin Mo's kid...

410
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:26,424
as well as if she's Madam No's biological daughter.

411
00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:28,325
Okay.

412
00:19:29,524 --> 00:19:30,555
I will.

413
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:36,135
Alcohol is the worst.

414
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:38,104
I should stop drinking.

415
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:40,304
What's the point when your body...

416
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,004
will just end up rotting after you die?

417
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:44,444
You said it was a mistake.

418
00:19:44,774 --> 00:19:46,204
You said I wasn't your type.

419
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:49,214
You have to admit...

420
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:52,384
that you and I are great in bed together.

421
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:54,085
I don't know when we'll die,

422
00:19:56,385 --> 00:19:59,524
but we have to live each moment to the fullest.

423
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,923
- My gosh. - My gosh.

424
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:05,424
Goodness.

425
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,135
- Promise me one thing. - What?

426
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:13,865
You and I will go together until the very end.

427
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:16,405
Be it on Lee Hwi So's side or K's side.

428
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:18,674
How many times must I tell you?

429
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:22,615
I will protect you no matter what.

430
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:35,994
Hey!

431
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:38,124
Have you really lost your mind?

432
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,963
How could you bring home someone you just met?

433
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:42,493
Two men at that!

434
00:20:42,494 --> 00:20:44,663
They're not just any men.

435
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:46,404
They're lucky charms.

436
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:49,004
- He's the younger lucky charm. - Goodness.

437
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:52,444
I'm going to make him a top star.

438
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:54,773
What are you going to do if Mone finds out?

439
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:56,413
So what if she finds out?

440
00:20:56,414 --> 00:20:59,443
How long are you going to act like Mone's personal slave?

441
00:20:59,444 --> 00:21:00,645
Don't you have ambitions?

442
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:04,655
- Kyung Soo. - Yes?

443
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:08,224
We're going to the convenience store. Do you need anything?

444
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:10,724
Parmigiano cheese,

445
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:13,124
salami, shine muscat.

446
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,424
Okay. Sounds good.

447
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:16,264
Hey. We should go grocery shopping.

448
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:17,295
Let's go.

449
00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:19,134
- Why are you pulling me? - Hurry up.

450
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:20,905
Okay. I'm coming!

451
00:21:25,004 --> 00:21:26,805
Hey. Did you see that?

452
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,345
She's totally into me.

453
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,474
So what? Are you going to stay here?

454
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:32,243
She's going to feed me and house me.

455
00:21:32,244 --> 00:21:33,545
Why would I turn it down?

456
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:34,784
I feel bad for her.

457
00:21:34,785 --> 00:21:36,514
She's being scammed by you of all people.

458
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:38,824
Are you even interested in becoming an actor?

459
00:21:38,825 --> 00:21:41,084
Why would I do such a tiring thing?

460
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:43,155
I'm just going to milk this for as long as I can.

461
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:46,664
And...

462
00:21:46,924 --> 00:21:48,964
try dating So Yeon.

463
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:54,234
(TIKITAKA)

464
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,565
Have you made a decision?

465
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,065
We have...

466
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:23,693
decided to bet on you.

467
00:22:23,694 --> 00:22:24,865
But you must...

468
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:27,663
keep your promise to ensure our safety.

469
00:22:27,664 --> 00:22:28,835
We're...

470
00:22:29,335 --> 00:22:30,875
risking our lives for this.

471
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:35,174
I'm the only one who gets to have conditions.

472
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:38,785
You're just chess pieces that move under my order.

473
00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:41,754
Don't talk about or question me.

474
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:52,865
(Matthew Lee, Message)

475
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:57,035
(Matthew Lee, Message)

476
00:22:59,535 --> 00:23:00,764
Really?

477
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:02,135
(Matthew Lee, Message)

478
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:05,375
(Matthew Lee, Assemble!)

479
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,744
Are you ready to fight Sungchan Group?

480
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:11,174
Do I...

481
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:13,115
have any other choice?

482
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:17,014
Please take care of "Unanswered Questions" first.

483
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:19,554
The writer and Director An keep calling me.

484
00:23:19,555 --> 00:23:21,825
If they broadcast it, that'll really be the end of me.

485
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,224
It's enough that my medical license was taken away.

486
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:28,464
Please have them blur me out, at least.

487
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:31,234
You need to go through everything...

488
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:33,065
until you have nothing to lose.

489
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:35,835
What do I have to do from now on?

490
00:23:36,035 --> 00:23:37,473
Tell me whatever you want me to do.

491
00:23:37,474 --> 00:23:39,845
I will do anything except die.

492
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:42,645
(Sungchan)

493
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:46,845
You will be the first piece to make a move.

494
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:50,014
Become Chairman Sim Yong's personal nurse...

495
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,484
and mess up his heart health.

496
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:54,753
Do you think that'll be possible?

497
00:23:54,754 --> 00:23:56,194
A nurse?

498
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:59,094
Do you think a strict place like Sungchan will hire me?

499
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:00,964
I don't even have a nursing license.

500
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:03,694
Getting hired by them is your first mission.

501
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:06,234
You used to be a gynecologist.

502
00:24:06,865 --> 00:24:08,434
There must've been a mistake.

503
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:10,004
We're looking...

504
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:12,503
- for a nurse. - I can also...

505
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:13,845
perform nursing duties.

506
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:17,045
It'll be hard to find someone who can spot veins better than me.

507
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:21,285
I'm also aware that Chairman Sim is suffering from severe diabetes.

508
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:25,223
I plan to care for everything regarding his health,

509
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:27,655
including a healthy diet, snack and supplement choices,

510
00:24:27,785 --> 00:24:30,454
hair loss, skincare, and check ups for illnesses.

511
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:35,193
This is my "total care plan" for Chairman Sim.

512
00:24:35,194 --> 00:24:37,095
Could I ask why your medical license...

513
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:38,964
was revoked?

514
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:43,575
I was framed for something...

515
00:24:43,905 --> 00:24:45,504
while helping a patient in need.

516
00:24:47,674 --> 00:24:49,574
I understand. You may go now.

517
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:51,174
Why? Am I...

518
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:53,014
not hired?

519
00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:55,585
We will tell you the result by text message.

520
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:57,385
Could you tell me now?

521
00:24:57,684 --> 00:25:00,184
I have a lot of places that want to hire me.

522
00:25:01,395 --> 00:25:02,724
Then you can go there.

523
00:25:03,655 --> 00:25:04,724
Next.

524
00:25:05,395 --> 00:25:06,464
It's not that.

525
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:08,464
I really want...

526
00:25:08,494 --> 00:25:10,395
to take care of Chairman Sim's health.

527
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:13,034
Sungchan Group is Korea.

528
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,035
Chairman Sim's health is the power of our country.

529
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:17,504
Please give me a chance. I'm confident I'll do a good job.

530
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:19,943
I'm good at keeping secrets.

531
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:21,674
It'll be hard to find someone with more expertise than me.

532
00:25:22,444 --> 00:25:23,944
Please hire me.

533
00:25:24,714 --> 00:25:27,244
I promise I will do a good job.

534
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:51,004
Nam Chul Woo.

535
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:53,545
Become Chairman Sim's most trusted servant...

536
00:25:53,905 --> 00:25:56,174
and completely take over his mind.

537
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:57,744
This mind?

538
00:25:58,414 --> 00:25:59,744
How am I supposed to do that?

539
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:03,014
I'm a druggie that can't even control my own mind.

540
00:26:05,254 --> 00:26:06,855
Since you were a police commissioner,

541
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:08,993
you must know about his family.

542
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:10,523
("Sungchan Group! Horrendous Crime in Chairman Sim's Wife's House!")

543
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:11,664
I know about that.

544
00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:14,964
A robber broke in and stabbed the chairman's wife to death.

545
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:17,835
Because they never found the person who did it,

546
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,564
a lot of policemen were fired.

547
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:21,004
It was such a disaster.

548
00:26:21,774 --> 00:26:24,375
Chairman Sim still hasn't recovered from that incident.

549
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:27,704
Really dig into his pain.

550
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,954
Buddha will protect you.

551
00:27:00,944 --> 00:27:02,174
Are you okay, sir?

552
00:27:02,474 --> 00:27:04,375
Yes, I'm fine.

553
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:05,984
Oh, my.

554
00:27:07,145 --> 00:27:08,355
Are you okay, sir?

555
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:09,984
Did I scare you?

556
00:27:10,414 --> 00:27:11,984
I'm fine.

557
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:13,885
You could've really hurt yourself, Monk Nam.

558
00:27:14,454 --> 00:27:16,595
I saw a crying woman in front of me,

559
00:27:16,754 --> 00:27:18,194
so I was trying to push her away.

560
00:27:18,365 --> 00:27:19,524
A woman?

561
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:22,694
There's nobody here.

562
00:27:22,994 --> 00:27:24,095
Over there.

563
00:27:25,635 --> 00:27:27,865
She's walking over there.

564
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:32,875
She has a knife stabbed into her left chest.

565
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:35,774
She's bleeding so much.

566
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:38,815
Help us, merciful Buddha.

567
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:51,454
Who is he?

568
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:53,065
That's Monk Nam.

569
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:56,534
After something tragic happened, he left everything behind.

570
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:59,835
He is now going place to place, practicing Buddhism.

571
00:28:00,335 --> 00:28:03,075
He also has the ability to look into the future.

572
00:28:06,405 --> 00:28:08,004
Monk Nam.

(Sungchan, Sungchan Gallery)

574
00:28:14,615 --> 00:28:17,014
(Sungchan Gallery)

575
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:20,785
Go Myoung Ji. You target Sungchan Gallery.

576
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:23,994
That's where Sungchan Group creates their slush fund.

577
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:26,694
Your mission is to steal that slush fund.

578
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:28,865
Did you just say "slush fund?"

579
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:33,905
I've never even kept a household ledger before.

580
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:36,733
I'm not exaggerating.

581
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:39,145
I'm terrible at math.

582
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:53,684
- Ms. Go Myoung Ji. - Yes?

583
00:28:53,754 --> 00:28:56,825
I was excited because Mr. Jo talked highly of you.

584
00:28:57,325 --> 00:28:58,924
But you look...

585
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:00,825
too normal.

586
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:02,135
Me?

587
00:29:03,264 --> 00:29:06,634
What part of me do you think is normal?

588
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:08,233
This face.

589
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:10,805
There are at least 3 or 4 in every neighborhood.

590
00:29:12,145 --> 00:29:13,974
I'll try my best to become unique.

591
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:16,644
I'll give everything I have...

592
00:29:16,645 --> 00:29:18,884
for Sungchan Gallery, Director.

593
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:20,443
What are you talking about?

594
00:29:20,444 --> 00:29:23,785
I hate people who try hard.

595
00:29:24,155 --> 00:29:25,753
- Pardon? - From now on,

596
00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:28,423
don't think at all.

597
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:31,493
I don't need your opinions or ideas.

598
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:35,135
Just follow my orders like a robot.

599
00:29:36,464 --> 00:29:37,595
I'm thirsty.

600
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:38,964
Coffee.

601
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:50,444
Oh, my.

602
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:52,714
What is going on here?

603
00:29:52,744 --> 00:29:55,253
Why? I made some coffee...

604
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:56,914
because you said you were thirsty.

605
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:58,384
Why? You made some coffee?

606
00:29:58,385 --> 00:29:59,483
Do you think we're friends?

607
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:01,424
How dare you drink coffee with me?

608
00:30:01,655 --> 00:30:03,493
Also, I only drink iced coffee,

609
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:05,625
even when it's freezing cold.

610
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:07,694
I'm sorry, Director.

611
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:09,295
I will rectify my mistake.

612
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:29,714
Here is your iced coffee.

613
00:30:36,494 --> 00:30:39,095
What is this? Why is there so much ice?

614
00:30:39,264 --> 00:30:43,364
I only drink coffee with five pieces of ice in it.

615
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:44,734
Five?

616
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:46,764
I'm sorry!

617
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:50,534
I'm sorry, ma'am.

618
00:30:50,535 --> 00:30:54,045
I'll make sure to train the new employee very thoroughly.

619
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:56,744
There are exactly five pieces.

620
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:05,724
Yes. This is it. I like it.

621
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:13,664
Focus on the key that Director Sim always carries.

622
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:15,395
You need that key...

623
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:17,835
to get into Sungchan Gallery's VIP room.

624
00:31:18,434 --> 00:31:20,204
Switch out all of the originals worth millions in that room...

625
00:31:20,535 --> 00:31:21,905
with fake pieces.

626
00:31:22,805 --> 00:31:23,905
In order to do so,

627
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:27,474
you'll have to gain Director Sim's trust, right?

628
00:31:33,914 --> 00:31:35,785
(World-renowned genius director, Michell, comes to Korea!)

629
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:43,395

633
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:08,514
You're both so beautiful.

634
00:32:08,655 --> 00:32:10,084
You'll get a chance...

635
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:12,284
to pose for photos at the end.

636
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:14,785
Can you two please take your seats?

637
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:22,264
Director Michell, first of all, congratulations on your new award.

638
00:32:25,635 --> 00:32:28,203
You're the youngest ever Palme d'Or Award recipient,

639
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:31,134
and you also won the Golden Lion in Venice.

640
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:33,504
May I ask how you feel about that?

641
00:32:34,105 --> 00:32:35,413
Thank you.

642
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:37,473
I haven't been back in ten years,

643
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:40,044
and I'm pleased and honored for the warm welcome.

644
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:42,814
You're a world-renowned genius director,

645
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:45,784
and you must've gotten so many other offers.

646
00:32:45,785 --> 00:32:46,953
But you chose to return...

647
00:32:46,954 --> 00:32:49,794
and work with TIKITAKA of all places.

648
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:51,595
I'd like to know why.

649
00:32:52,664 --> 00:32:54,295
It was all because of Chairman Lee.

650
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:57,864
His heartfelt convincing did the trick.

651
00:32:57,865 --> 00:33:00,434
Matthew convinced her? No way.

652
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:02,804
I'm the one who recruited her.

653
00:33:02,805 --> 00:33:04,074
Ms. Geum.

654
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:06,773
The whole world's interested.

655
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:08,544
What is the new movie about?

656
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:12,045
I'm not asking for a spoiler, but could you give us a hint?

657
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:15,115
It's our top-secret project.

658
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:17,085
I can't share any details.

659
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:20,924
To be honest, we don't know anything.

660
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:24,193
Our Director Michell kept everything under wraps...

661
00:33:24,194 --> 00:33:25,693
when she wrote the script.

662
00:33:25,694 --> 00:33:29,364
Does that mean you haven't yet read the script, Mone?

663
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:30,365
No.

664
00:33:30,664 --> 00:33:33,263
I'm such a huge Michell fan,

665
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:34,963
so when she called,

666
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:37,004
I agreed to appear, no questions asked.

667
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:38,804
If you're okay with it, Director,

668
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:41,845
I think we could give them just the title.

669
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:44,214
Director, would you mind?

670
00:33:45,115 --> 00:33:46,115
Dhall I?

(Press Conference with Director Michell)

672
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:52,285
The title of the movie is...

673
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:55,454
"Dear D."

674
00:33:58,454 --> 00:33:59,664
"Dear D."

675
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:02,694
Do you know who I was thinking about when I wrote that song?

676
00:34:03,264 --> 00:34:04,294
Da Mi.

677
00:34:04,295 --> 00:34:07,264
So, will you be able to sing that song?

678
00:34:10,704 --> 00:34:12,804
It's about a poor girl who was sacrificed...

679
00:34:12,805 --> 00:34:15,214
by a large company and fake news.

680
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:17,614
To be exact,

681
00:34:17,615 --> 00:34:20,184
it's about the Bang Da Mi incident...

682
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,115
that shocked Korea five years ago.

683
00:34:22,415 --> 00:34:25,084
You know it as the Bobble incident.

684
00:34:26,424 --> 00:34:27,685
What?

685
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:29,595
- What's she saying? - Bang Da Mi?

686
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:33,393
Director, which large company...

687
00:34:33,394 --> 00:34:35,165
are you referring to?

688
00:34:35,394 --> 00:34:36,734
I can't say.

689
00:34:37,064 --> 00:34:39,364
This could cause a huge uproar.

690
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:41,265
Did you check all the facts?

691
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:45,075
Of course I did, and I'm confident.

692
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:48,474
The director seems to be...

693
00:34:48,475 --> 00:34:51,214
very confident about the project.

694
00:34:51,314 --> 00:34:54,515
Is someone handing out some information on the movie?

695
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:58,684
All the reporters are clamoring for a copy.

696
00:34:58,685 --> 00:35:01,023
- Can I have one? - Me too.

697
00:35:01,024 --> 00:35:02,095
- Over here. - Please.

698
00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:04,954
- I want one too! - I need one.

699
00:35:04,955 --> 00:35:07,123
- Mister. - Over here too.

700
00:35:07,124 --> 00:35:08,734
- Me too! - And me.

701
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:11,134
- Oh, gosh. - What happened?

702
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:12,365
Are you okay, Ms. Geum?

703
00:35:12,665 --> 00:35:13,734
Are you okay?

704
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:17,773
Ms. Geum must've been extra stressed out...

705
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:19,304
preparing for this event.

706
00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:21,874
I can't put the love of my life through too much.

707
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:23,943
Let's wrap up the press conference.

708
00:35:23,944 --> 00:35:25,075
Just a moment, sir.

709
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:29,055
Did I just hear you say "the love of my life?"

710
00:35:29,415 --> 00:35:31,915
Has word not gotten out yet?

711
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:35,594
Ms. Geum and I are soon to be engaged.

712
00:35:35,595 --> 00:35:36,595
My word.

713
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:37,753
They're getting engaged?

714
00:35:37,754 --> 00:35:39,524
What on earth is happening?

715
00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:43,063
You made that shocking announcement here?

716
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:44,694
Why, thank you, Chairman Lee.

717
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:48,535
What on earth are you thinking?

718
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:52,274
Smile for the cameras.

719
00:35:52,604 --> 00:35:54,475
Things are about to get way more interesting.

720
00:35:54,544 --> 00:35:56,474
They whispered to each other.

721
00:35:56,475 --> 00:35:58,984
Didn't that look so sweet? Right?

722
00:36:00,015 --> 00:36:01,884
You look great together.

723
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:05,213
I planned on congratulating Michell on her awards,

724
00:36:05,214 --> 00:36:07,423
but we have someone else to congratulate.

725
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:09,353
This is great news.

726
00:36:09,354 --> 00:36:10,354
Smile.

727
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:28,674
(Press Conference with Director Michell)

728
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:32,444
What are you all up to?

729
00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:34,244
Are you torturing me to death?

730
00:36:34,245 --> 00:36:35,483
Don't say that.

731
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,114
Isn't it an easy role for you?

732
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:38,853
What you did to Da Mi.

733
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:40,423
You just have to do all that.

734
00:36:40,424 --> 00:36:42,253
They tweaked the plot a bit, though.

735
00:36:42,254 --> 00:36:44,655
Sungchan Group will be front and center.

736
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:47,995
You'll go against them head-on?

737
00:36:50,194 --> 00:36:52,604
Chairman Sim's even worse than K.

738
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:55,164
There's nothing he won't do for his son.

739
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:56,233
Really?

740
00:36:56,234 --> 00:36:58,705
What should I do, then? I'm so scared.

741
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:01,705
Did you expect that?

742
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:03,344
I'm so excited.

743
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:05,744
I can't wait to see how Chairman Sim will react.

744
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,885
Why are you doing this?

745
00:37:08,115 --> 00:37:10,515
You had nothing to do with Da Mi.

746
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,415
Don't you have a crush on me?

747
00:37:43,084 --> 00:37:44,984
I'm the center of your interest.

748
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,794
You're Lee Hwi So's minion?

749
00:37:49,455 --> 00:37:50,524
I'm disappointed.

750
00:37:54,995 --> 00:37:56,995
Weren't you interested in me?

751
00:37:59,165 --> 00:38:01,135
Too bad if it hurts you.

752
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,034
You act like a Goody Two-shoes...

753
00:38:04,035 --> 00:38:07,544
and the love of the nation when you killed your own friend.

754
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:09,444
That's you.

755
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:13,484
I think that's the worst in the world.

756
00:38:15,345 --> 00:38:16,415
Hey.

757
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:19,185
Because of you,

758
00:38:19,524 --> 00:38:22,354
I ended up giving Da Mi the humiliating nickname.

759
00:38:24,794 --> 00:38:27,524
Why did you turn me into a piece of trash?

760
00:38:45,444 --> 00:38:46,615
Mone.

761
00:38:47,245 --> 00:38:48,915
What was all that about?

762
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:51,114
Bobble's story will be turned into a movie?

763
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:53,185
We were her classmates. Will we be mentioned too?

764
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:56,054
They won't portray us as bullies, will they?

765
00:38:56,055 --> 00:38:58,624
Hey. We can't let them.

766
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:00,824
What if my honey gets disappointed?

767
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:02,164
Be quiet.

768
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:04,865
My head's about to explode without you adding to it.

769
00:39:05,564 --> 00:39:06,963
Don't be like that.

770
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:09,103
All that anger ruined your makeup,

771
00:39:09,104 --> 00:39:10,434
and I see a pimple forming.

772
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:11,504
Let me fix it.

773
00:39:12,674 --> 00:39:15,173
Didn't the comments about how my stylist...

774
00:39:15,174 --> 00:39:16,345
must hate me make you think?

775
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:19,845
Quit if you're not worth your pay.

776
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:24,455
- Move. - Okay.

777
00:39:28,924 --> 00:39:29,994
Mone.

778
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:31,824
I'd love to just...

779
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:34,924
She's always taking it out on us.

780
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:38,464
Must you do this?

781
00:39:39,865 --> 00:39:41,063
Getting engaged to La Hui...

782
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:42,405
wasn't part of the plan.

783
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:48,044
You don't still feel bad for her, do you?

784
00:39:48,674 --> 00:39:50,443
Not only did she abandon Da Mi,

785
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:52,043
but she also tried to kill Chairman Bang.

786
00:39:52,044 --> 00:39:54,043
Pity toward her is a luxury.

787
00:39:54,044 --> 00:39:55,115
I know that.

788
00:39:55,515 --> 00:39:58,185
I'm just saying what you did wasn't like you.

789
00:39:58,955 --> 00:40:00,785
Why would you get engaged...

790
00:40:00,885 --> 00:40:02,825
when you outed yourself?

791
00:40:03,394 --> 00:40:06,393
Because that announcement will make our stocks soar.

792
00:40:06,394 --> 00:40:08,063
She will make us richer.

793
00:40:08,064 --> 00:40:09,265
Is that a good enough answer?

794
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:11,464
It's just about money?

795
00:40:12,365 --> 00:40:14,234
You suddenly want more money?

796
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,304
We need money to go after Sungchan Group.

797
00:40:17,305 --> 00:40:19,805
I need money to protect those I care about!

798
00:40:22,475 --> 00:40:25,475
Are you afraid La Hui will become miserable?

799
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:32,854
You still have feelings for her, don't you?

800
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:49,305
Lee Hwi So.

801
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:52,474
That's not true.

802
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:54,345
Then don't stop me.

803
00:40:54,845 --> 00:40:57,374
I lost my wife and child. I lost everything!

804
00:40:57,515 --> 00:40:58,914
Whatever I do,

805
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,584
no one has the right to condemn me.

806
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,615
I'm barely holding back from wringing her neck!

807
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:12,595
I was out of line.

808
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:15,095
Pretend I didn't say that.

809
00:41:19,665 --> 00:41:20,734
I apologize.

810
00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:24,035
I got carried away.

811
00:41:51,365 --> 00:41:54,265
Darn you!

812
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:55,704
My gosh.

813
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:58,834
Miss. Are you here to borrow money?

814
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:01,075
- My word. - Double it.

815
00:42:01,504 --> 00:42:04,915
You took our money! Now pay it back!

816
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:07,345
You're a pretty thing.

817
00:42:11,084 --> 00:42:12,115
Come with me, La Hui.

818
00:42:13,524 --> 00:42:14,624
Stand down!

819
00:42:17,725 --> 00:42:19,794
Don't say my name, you thug.

820
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:21,765
I'm sorry, La Hui.

821
00:42:22,294 --> 00:42:23,294
I am.

822
00:42:23,295 --> 00:42:26,035
Why did you lie about having an office job?

823
00:42:27,865 --> 00:42:30,134
My mom and dad died...

824
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:31,705
because of these thugs!

825
00:42:32,305 --> 00:42:33,345
I didn't know.

826
00:42:34,144 --> 00:42:36,173
I really didn't know they were your parents.

827
00:42:36,174 --> 00:42:37,714
That's not important!

828
00:42:40,285 --> 00:42:42,814
It doesn't change that you're trash.

829
00:42:44,155 --> 00:42:45,515
Just die.

830
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:47,524
Die!

831
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:50,024
Die, you murderer!

832
00:42:50,294 --> 00:42:51,694
You should...

833
00:42:52,225 --> 00:42:53,825
just die.

834
00:43:04,435 --> 00:43:05,435
Die!

835
00:43:05,436 --> 00:43:06,905
- I'm sorry. - Die.

836
00:43:08,745 --> 00:43:09,874
I'm so sorry.

837
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:26,765
Kang Ki Tak.

838
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:29,464
You can never abandon me.

839
00:43:32,765 --> 00:43:34,464
(Press Conference with Director Michell)

840
00:43:34,705 --> 00:43:36,075
Are you sure Mone's here?

841
00:43:36,504 --> 00:43:38,334
Can't you tell from the amount of press?

842
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:42,644
She's putting on a show with a fake mom now?

843
00:43:43,544 --> 00:43:46,345
Our family may be messed up, but this isn't right.

844
00:43:46,785 --> 00:43:48,583
Should we tell the press, then?

845
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,714
Are you insane?

846
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:51,814
We can't sever our lifeline.

847
00:43:53,084 --> 00:43:56,353
We need to blackmail her into letting us use her credit card.

848
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:57,924
Will you think?

849
00:43:58,894 --> 00:44:00,893
What's taking Mom so long?

850
00:44:00,894 --> 00:44:02,364
There she is. She's coming.

851
00:44:02,365 --> 00:44:03,894
- Mom's here. - It's Mone!

852
00:44:03,964 --> 00:44:05,264
- Hello. - Mone, over here!

853
00:44:05,265 --> 00:44:06,734
- Mone. - Mone.

854
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:08,865
- Mone's here. - Hey.

855
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:10,635
- Do you have any comments? - Hey, don't.

856
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,003
- Hello. - Anything?

857
00:44:12,004 --> 00:44:14,144
- Back up. - What do you have to say?

858
00:44:14,845 --> 00:44:16,575
- Excuse us. - How did the press conference go?

859
00:44:17,415 --> 00:44:19,115
- My goodness. - Get out of the way.

860
00:44:19,745 --> 00:44:20,944
What are you doing here?

861
00:44:21,015 --> 00:44:22,284
Are you here to ruin me?

862
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,213
Lady! Get off her!

863
00:44:24,214 --> 00:44:25,254
What are you doing?

864
00:44:25,484 --> 00:44:26,784
Weren't you in the news?

865
00:44:26,785 --> 00:44:28,583
It said you're Mone's mother. Why are you here?

866
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:29,854
Do you really know her?

867
00:44:30,024 --> 00:44:31,495
Are you here to see Mone?

868
00:44:31,624 --> 00:44:33,995
Why is there a rumor that you're related? How do you know her?

869
00:44:35,124 --> 00:44:36,293
She can't speak.

870
00:44:36,294 --> 00:44:37,794
Who here knows sign language?

871
00:44:38,964 --> 00:44:41,364
- Sign language! Mone knows it. - Mone can help.

872
00:44:41,365 --> 00:44:42,603
You know sign language.

873
00:44:42,604 --> 00:44:44,805
- Will you make her look good? - Make sure she looks pretty.

874
00:44:48,245 --> 00:44:49,314
I am...

875
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:51,274
not Mone's mother.

876
00:44:53,245 --> 00:44:55,415
I'm one of the people she donates to.

877
00:44:58,555 --> 00:45:01,584
I was shameless enough to rely on her handouts at my age.

878
00:45:02,225 --> 00:45:04,794
I came to see her one last time to thank her.

879
00:45:06,394 --> 00:45:08,564
I will fend for myself from now on.

880
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:20,544
Thanks for everything so far.

881
00:45:22,774 --> 00:45:24,674
Don't worry about me.

882
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:30,214
You can cut us off now.

883
00:45:33,725 --> 00:45:34,854
Mone.

884
00:45:46,104 --> 00:45:47,504
Stop filming now.

885
00:45:47,535 --> 00:45:48,764
- That's enough. - Thank you.

886
00:45:48,765 --> 00:45:49,773
Well done.

887
00:45:49,774 --> 00:45:51,034
You did great, Mone.

888
00:45:51,035 --> 00:45:52,474
Step out of the way, please.

889
00:45:52,475 --> 00:45:53,773
- Coming through. - Excuse us.

890
00:45:53,774 --> 00:45:55,274
- We don't know anything. - We don't know her.

891
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,845
We have to go.

892
00:45:56,915 --> 00:45:57,975
Hey.

893
00:45:58,374 --> 00:46:01,143
Don't go too far. Don't push.

894
00:46:01,144 --> 00:46:03,213
- Thanks. - Stop taking photos.

895
00:46:03,214 --> 00:46:05,015
Thank you. Stop snapping now.

896
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:10,394
Mom.

897
00:46:11,424 --> 00:46:12,725
Will you stand still?

898
00:46:12,825 --> 00:46:14,064
How come you're so fast?

899
00:46:15,024 --> 00:46:16,135
My gosh.

900
00:46:16,535 --> 00:46:17,995
You darn witch!

901
00:46:19,564 --> 00:46:21,234
She's a human being?

902
00:46:21,665 --> 00:46:23,274
She pretended not to know you.

903
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:26,174
Keep still. Don't do anything.

904
00:46:26,504 --> 00:46:27,604
Let go.

905
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:30,075
She needs to be taught a lesson.

906
00:46:30,845 --> 00:46:32,044
Don't hit me!

907
00:46:32,444 --> 00:46:33,584
Stop it!

908
00:46:34,314 --> 00:46:36,614
You need to get a grip yourself.

909
00:46:36,615 --> 00:46:38,514
Who do you think you are to get in her way?

910
00:46:38,515 --> 00:46:41,385
She did more than enough for us.

911
00:46:41,984 --> 00:46:44,124
You call her a daughter and are defending her?

912
00:46:44,424 --> 00:46:45,995
She's a witch!

913
00:46:47,894 --> 00:46:50,035
What did you do as a son?

914
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:52,634
Ever since she was 15,

915
00:46:52,635 --> 00:46:55,665
Mone ran around working to pay off our creditors.

916
00:46:55,834 --> 00:46:57,935
That's why she had to miss school for two years.

917
00:46:58,205 --> 00:47:01,345
Who do you think provided you with a house and food?

918
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:03,444
What right do you have to curse her?

919
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:04,773
What about you, then?

920
00:47:04,774 --> 00:47:05,944
What right do you have?

921
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,814
You're right.

922
00:47:07,984 --> 00:47:09,285
It's all on me.

923
00:47:09,415 --> 00:47:11,814
I raised you two to be leeches,

924
00:47:12,115 --> 00:47:14,124
and I kept asking Mone for money.

925
00:47:14,325 --> 00:47:16,394
I'm the guilty one.

926
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:18,694
So I decided to be a decent person.

927
00:47:18,924 --> 00:47:20,964
I won't be a burden to her anymore.

928
00:47:21,064 --> 00:47:23,034
I'll go my own way.

929
00:47:23,035 --> 00:47:24,865
You can fend for yourselves.

930
00:47:25,394 --> 00:47:27,334
If you harass your sister again,

931
00:47:27,635 --> 00:47:29,475
that will be the day I die.

932
00:47:35,044 --> 00:47:36,173
Mom!

933
00:47:36,174 --> 00:47:37,644
Where are you going?

934
00:47:38,745 --> 00:47:39,845
Mom!

935
00:47:47,024 --> 00:47:49,024
Ms. Wang, it's me.

936
00:47:49,995 --> 00:47:51,555
Get me any role there is.

937
00:47:52,225 --> 00:47:54,423
I'll be a zombie or a wild boar, anything.

938
00:47:54,424 --> 00:47:56,464
Get me a role on Han Mone's project.

939
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:03,104
What happened here?

940
00:48:04,575 --> 00:48:05,604
What's this?

941
00:48:10,214 --> 00:48:11,745
What are you doing?

942
00:48:13,785 --> 00:48:16,115
This was my building and my office.

943
00:48:16,584 --> 00:48:19,114
Now I own Cherry Entertainment.

944
00:48:19,115 --> 00:48:20,523
(Changmyung Orphanage)

945
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:22,894
You can't spend a single cent without my approval.

946
00:48:23,055 --> 00:48:24,055
Why?

947
00:48:27,194 --> 00:48:28,523
Because I paid back...

948
00:48:28,524 --> 00:48:30,064
the 30 million dollars you wasted.

949
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:35,233
You want me to work for you?

950
00:48:35,234 --> 00:48:36,874
Quit if you don't want to.

951
00:48:36,905 --> 00:48:39,334
None of the artists want you around.

952
00:48:45,015 --> 00:48:46,115
Why you...

953
00:48:56,595 --> 00:48:58,024
Um Ji Man's death.

954
00:48:58,955 --> 00:49:00,194
You're involved, aren't you?

955
00:49:00,765 --> 00:49:02,225
What are you on about?

956
00:49:05,894 --> 00:49:08,305
When K kills off his right-hand man,

957
00:49:08,734 --> 00:49:10,435
there has to be a good reason.

958
00:49:11,774 --> 00:49:13,504
I know you met with Um Ji Man.

959
00:49:14,774 --> 00:49:16,845
What did you say to him?

960
00:49:21,285 --> 00:49:23,415
You're barking up the wrong tree.

961
00:49:27,325 --> 00:49:29,354
There's only one reason Um's dead.

962
00:49:30,424 --> 00:49:32,194
He knew K's weakness.

963
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:34,524
A weakness?

964
00:49:38,794 --> 00:49:41,234
Do you know Min Do Hyuk?

965
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:44,575
Send him to prison.

966
00:49:47,075 --> 00:49:49,745
Why? Did he do something wrong?

967
00:49:51,245 --> 00:49:53,385
I just...

968
00:49:53,745 --> 00:49:55,015
hate his guts.

969
00:49:55,944 --> 00:49:57,185
K and Min Do Hyuk.

970
00:49:57,885 --> 00:49:59,254
There's definitely something.

971
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:03,254
To him, we're flies he might swat at any moment.

972
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:07,924
Don't you think we should have some leverage on K?

973
00:50:09,365 --> 00:50:11,794
Um Ji Man's dead and gone. Who do you think will be next?

974
00:50:12,935 --> 00:50:14,305
Wouldn't that be you?

975
00:50:23,144 --> 00:50:24,745
You're actually worried about me?

976
00:50:25,144 --> 00:50:26,213
Gosh.

977
00:50:26,214 --> 00:50:28,213
I'm moved to tears.

978
00:50:28,214 --> 00:50:29,555
Because of you,

979
00:50:31,555 --> 00:50:34,655
I'm worried Madam No will end up in danger, you moron.

980
00:50:36,555 --> 00:50:37,694
Madam No.

981
00:50:39,024 --> 00:50:41,024
She's like a sister to me.

982
00:50:42,294 --> 00:50:43,935
Protect her with your life.

983
00:51:09,385 --> 00:51:10,495
Jin Mo.

984
00:51:10,624 --> 00:51:11,655
Long time no see.

985
00:51:12,225 --> 00:51:13,794
Lee Hwi So...

986
00:51:13,825 --> 00:51:16,064
has this annoying fly buzzing around.

987
00:51:16,394 --> 00:51:17,495
Kang Ki Tak.

988
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:20,504
Follow his every movement and report to me.

989
00:51:21,234 --> 00:51:22,365
Can you do that?

990
00:51:24,435 --> 00:51:26,234
Don't be too afraid.

991
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,644
We used to be pretty close.

992
00:51:28,905 --> 00:51:30,415
Oh, and also,

993
00:51:30,845 --> 00:51:33,745
try not to find out about me.

994
00:51:34,444 --> 00:51:35,745
If you do,

995
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:37,455
I might have to do to you...

996
00:51:37,854 --> 00:51:39,555
what I did to Um Ji Man.

997
00:51:40,124 --> 00:51:41,124
What...

998
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,353
Let's try to get on better.

999
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:43,725
- Why... - See you around.

1000
00:52:10,515 --> 00:52:11,814
What do you want to eat?

1001
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:15,325
I like anything you cook.

1002
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:20,265
Hey.

1003
00:52:20,524 --> 00:52:21,894
Wait outside, Han Na.

1004
00:52:22,124 --> 00:52:23,193
No.

1005
00:52:23,194 --> 00:52:25,894
Do as you're told and go outside!

1006
00:52:28,135 --> 00:52:29,234
Han Na.

1007
00:52:29,365 --> 00:52:30,874
Go to Yu Ri's for ten minutes.

1008
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:32,574
I'll come for you soon.

1009
00:52:32,575 --> 00:52:33,644
Okay?

1010
00:52:35,144 --> 00:52:37,674
If you bother my mom, I will...

1011
00:52:38,515 --> 00:52:39,685
bite you, mister.

1012
00:52:43,854 --> 00:52:45,015
What's going on?

1013
00:52:49,424 --> 00:52:50,725
I'll ask you one last time.

1014
00:52:54,064 --> 00:52:55,794
Will you really not be able to say goodbye to Han Na?

1015
00:52:56,435 --> 00:52:58,264
Can you handle whatever might happen from now on?

1016
00:52:58,265 --> 00:52:59,705
Are you confident you can do that?

1017
00:53:02,464 --> 00:53:03,535
Of course.

1018
00:53:04,135 --> 00:53:05,405
I'm Han Na's mom.

1019
00:53:06,874 --> 00:53:08,104
Then I'll say it.

1020
00:53:09,915 --> 00:53:10,915
Han Na...

1021
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:13,245
is Han Mone's daughter.

1022
00:53:16,555 --> 00:53:18,185
And her dad is the only son of Sungchan Group,

1023
00:53:19,854 --> 00:53:21,254
Sim Jun Seok.

1024
00:53:40,544 --> 00:53:42,405
You should be more on alert in times like these.

1025
00:53:42,774 --> 00:53:45,174
And get some facials done before the shoot begins.

1026
00:53:46,644 --> 00:53:50,484
Do you think I will be able to star in that movie?

1027
00:53:57,495 --> 00:53:59,325
I have to act as myself.

1028
00:54:00,765 --> 00:54:03,023
I have to torment Da Mi in the movie again.

1029
00:54:03,024 --> 00:54:04,234
Why can't you do it?

1030
00:54:04,765 --> 00:54:06,704
Nothing will change just because you whine about it.

1031
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:09,804
Stop making it sound so easy because it's not your job.

1032
00:54:09,805 --> 00:54:11,304
Accept the reality.

1033
00:54:11,305 --> 00:54:13,004
Do you think Matthew will go easy on you if you act this way?

1034
00:54:16,944 --> 00:54:18,015
What?

1035
00:54:19,174 --> 00:54:20,514
You're speaking as if you've really become...

1036
00:54:20,515 --> 00:54:21,814
Matthew's fiancée or something.

1037
00:54:22,714 --> 00:54:24,615
Or are you speaking as Bang Da Mi's mom?

1038
00:54:25,314 --> 00:54:27,955
It's not like you can step up with confidence.

1039
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:38,365
I must meet K.

1040
00:54:39,135 --> 00:54:41,004
I will ask him to kill Lee Hwi So.

1041
00:54:41,405 --> 00:54:43,734
Kang Ki Tak and Min Do Hyuk too!

1042
00:54:45,805 --> 00:54:48,845
Do you really not know, or are you pretending not to know?

1043
00:54:50,774 --> 00:54:53,984
K already abandoned you five years ago.

1044
00:54:55,245 --> 00:54:56,314
No...

1045
00:54:56,685 --> 00:54:58,714
No!

1046
00:55:01,155 --> 00:55:02,184
Just wait and see.

1047
00:55:02,185 --> 00:55:04,793
I will get out of this nightmare and survive until the end.

1048
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:06,824
If I can protect myself, I'll join hands with whoever it is.

1049
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:08,825
Whether it's Matthew, Kang Ki Tak,

1050
00:55:09,124 --> 00:55:10,234
or even K.

1051
00:55:45,694 --> 00:55:47,665
Don't worry about me.

1052
00:55:47,805 --> 00:55:50,075
You can cut us off now.

1053
00:55:51,004 --> 00:55:52,035
Mone.

1054
00:56:10,555 --> 00:56:11,995
Mom.

1055
00:56:23,405 --> 00:56:25,435
(Invitation)

1056
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,484
(Tonight's Invitation)

1057
00:56:48,524 --> 00:56:49,665
Madam No!

1058
00:57:23,564 --> 00:57:24,995
Madam No has disappeared.

1059
00:57:25,665 --> 00:57:26,705
What?

1060
00:57:27,064 --> 00:57:28,233
I think she left in a hurry.

1061
00:57:28,234 --> 00:57:30,434
All her furniture is still here.

1062
00:57:30,435 --> 00:57:32,075
I think she didn't take much with her.

1063
00:57:33,504 --> 00:57:35,943
But did she really live here with her kid?

1064
00:57:35,944 --> 00:57:37,444
There isn't anything here...

1065
00:57:38,115 --> 00:57:39,314
that belongs to a kid.

1066
00:57:40,115 --> 00:57:41,214
Good work.

1067
00:57:53,564 --> 00:57:54,624
No Han Na.

1068
00:57:56,665 --> 00:57:58,294
Whose daughter is she?

1069
00:58:57,455 --> 00:59:00,325
(Sungchan Group Distribution Center)

1070
00:59:05,995 --> 00:59:07,535
(Sungchan Group Distribution Center)

1071
01:00:29,214 --> 01:00:31,185
I missed you, Mone.

1072
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:33,084
You're a special person to me.

1073
01:00:33,885 --> 01:00:36,655
I am in danger.

1074
01:00:39,555 --> 01:00:40,595
I know.

1075
01:00:41,365 --> 01:00:42,665
You'll protect me, right?

1076
01:00:43,694 --> 01:00:45,035
I can trust you, can't I?

1077
01:00:45,865 --> 01:00:48,135
Did you come all this way to ask me that?

1078
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:52,434
Don't worry about anything and just have fun, even if it's only today.

1079
01:00:52,435 --> 01:00:53,674
Answer me.

1080
01:00:55,274 --> 01:00:57,415
If you abandon me too, I will really die.

1081
01:00:57,615 --> 01:00:59,415
I will have to die at the hands of Lee Hwi So.

1082
01:01:01,484 --> 01:01:02,584
I will...

1083
01:02:04,415 --> 01:02:05,814
What did you say your name was?

1084
01:02:06,075 --> 01:02:08,714
You can just call me Monk Nam.

1085
01:02:12,214 --> 01:02:13,924
Who do you think you're trying to fool?

1086
01:02:14,624 --> 01:02:16,023
You're Police Commissioner Nam Chul Woo.

1087
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:17,624
Did you think I wouldn't know?

1088
01:02:17,754 --> 01:02:20,464
That's right. I'm Seoul Police Commissioner Nam Chul Woo.

1089
01:02:21,725 --> 01:02:23,734
However, I've recently switched professions.

1090
01:02:26,064 --> 01:02:28,765
The spiritual ailment I had suffered for a long time flared up again,

1091
01:02:29,564 --> 01:02:31,234
so I retired from the police force.

1092
01:02:35,144 --> 01:02:37,144
What did you mean by what you said last time?

1093
01:02:37,845 --> 01:02:39,575
You said you saw someone.

1094
01:02:45,214 --> 01:02:46,885
You know who it is.

1095
01:02:50,694 --> 01:02:52,495
Someone who died by being stabbed with a knife.

1096
01:02:55,194 --> 01:02:56,765
It's your wife.

1097
01:02:57,964 --> 01:03:02,034
That day, you saw the culprit's face, Chairman.

1098
01:03:02,035 --> 01:03:04,274
Honey!

1099
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:07,144
Honey!

1100
01:03:07,674 --> 01:03:08,774
Honey.

1101
01:03:08,944 --> 01:03:10,004
Secretary Gu.

1102
01:03:10,274 --> 01:03:11,915
Where are you, Secretary Gu?

1103
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:14,084
Jin...

1104
01:03:15,144 --> 01:03:16,615
Jin Seo...

1105
01:03:17,285 --> 01:03:18,415
What did you say?

1106
01:03:18,455 --> 01:03:19,885
Honey!

1107
01:03:19,915 --> 01:03:21,184
Honey, open your eyes.

1108
01:03:21,185 --> 01:03:22,253
Honey.

1109
01:03:22,254 --> 01:03:23,424
Secretary Gu!

1110
01:03:24,225 --> 01:03:25,294
Secretary Gu...

1111
01:03:38,305 --> 01:03:39,674
What are you saying?

1112
01:03:40,135 --> 01:03:41,745
Why, you little fraud...

1113
01:03:42,874 --> 01:03:44,575
I don't believe in shamanism.

1114
01:03:44,915 --> 01:03:46,044
Get out this instant.

1115
01:03:46,174 --> 01:03:47,745
Didn't you hear me tell you to get out?

1116
01:03:51,655 --> 01:03:54,685
Sungchan Group will end up crumbling due to a single flea.

1117
01:03:55,555 --> 01:03:57,455
It will be best for you to be prepared.

1118
01:04:08,635 --> 01:04:11,074
Mone is the model for this product.

1119
01:04:11,075 --> 01:04:13,304
I know you are all on a diet, so you should try this out.

1120
01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:14,475
- Thank you. - Okay.

1121
01:04:23,984 --> 01:04:25,554
Director, hello!

1122
01:04:25,555 --> 01:04:27,554
- Hello. - Hello.

1123
01:04:27,555 --> 01:04:29,124
- Hello. - Hello.

1124
01:04:40,905 --> 01:04:42,434
Since today is the first table read,

1125
01:04:42,435 --> 01:04:44,774
we only had the main cast join us.

1126
01:04:45,104 --> 01:04:47,774
With a sense of duty that you are revealing the hidden truth,

1127
01:04:48,075 --> 01:04:50,205
please give it all you've got.

1128
01:04:52,915 --> 01:04:54,714
Then, why don't you each introduce your parts?

1129
01:04:55,385 --> 01:04:56,644
Should we start with you, Mone?

1130
01:05:02,655 --> 01:05:04,624
I'm Han Mone, and I play Min Deul Re.

1131
01:05:04,725 --> 01:05:05,854
Please look kindly upon me.

1132
01:05:12,734 --> 01:05:16,334
Mone has a personal connection of having gone to school with Da Mi.

1133
01:05:16,665 --> 01:05:19,334
That was why she was very willing to join this movie.

1134
01:05:20,205 --> 01:05:22,044
I'd like to thank you before everyone here.

("Director Michell's New Movie, Will It Help Solve the Bobble Case?")

1137
01:05:31,854 --> 01:05:34,083
With Director Michell's new movie being revealed,

1138
01:05:34,084 --> 01:05:37,055
the Bobble Case is garnering attention once again.

1139
01:05:37,124 --> 01:05:39,253
Director Michell has said that a huge conglomerate company...

1140
01:05:39,254 --> 01:05:42,725
is involved in the Bobble case.

1141
01:05:42,924 --> 01:05:46,135
Chairman Sim Yong of Sungchan Group, please answer.

1142
01:05:46,365 --> 01:05:48,103
Truth or lies?

1143
01:05:48,104 --> 01:05:49,304
(- Director Michell and Mone? - Bobble Case is getting boring.)

1144
01:05:49,305 --> 01:05:50,635
(- Will the answer be in the movie? - I'm so curious.)

1145

(Condolence money box)

1146
01:06:12,225 --> 01:06:13,555
At least put it in the bank.

1147
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,865
It doesn't look good to leave it in your house like that.

1148

That's right.

1154

It's him.

1155
01:07:13,415 --> 01:07:15,185
He killed my mom...

1156
01:07:16,524 --> 01:07:18,424
and appeared at the funeral.

(Eutteum Bank)

1158
01:07:26,734 --> 01:07:28,333
This is a forged check.

1159
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:30,305
We can't check which account it gets withdrawn from.

1160
01:07:30,365 --> 01:07:31,635
Where did you get this?

1161
01:07:32,205 --> 01:07:34,374
How dare you ridicule my family?

1162
01:07:37,714 --> 01:07:38,874
What business do you have here?

1163
01:07:39,115 --> 01:07:40,444
Excuse me... Hey.

1164
01:07:43,984 --> 01:07:45,015
Why, you little...

1165
01:07:52,725 --> 01:07:55,394
Min Do Hyuk has finally made his move.

1166
01:07:56,894 --> 01:07:58,834
Who are you? You can't go in. What are you...

1167
01:08:05,104 --> 01:08:06,774
Where is your son?

1168
01:08:07,234 --> 01:08:08,705
Bring Sim Jun Seok here now.

1169
01:08:09,004 --> 01:08:10,144
Who are you?

1170
01:08:10,374 --> 01:08:12,174
Why did you kill my family?

1171
01:08:13,115 --> 01:08:14,385
Why did you target me?

1172
01:08:15,115 --> 01:08:16,185
K...

1173
01:08:16,714 --> 01:08:18,354
Bring me your son.

1174
01:08:19,655 --> 01:08:21,255
Bring him to me!

1175
01:09:34,425 --> 01:09:35,624
How dare you...

1176
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:36,794
speak my name...

1177
01:09:36,795 --> 01:09:37,894
out loud?

1178
01:09:38,865 --> 01:09:40,264
A nobody like you?

1179
01:09:42,934 --> 01:09:44,705
My father is on my side.

1180
01:09:45,335 --> 01:09:47,205
Forever!

1181
01:09:48,144 --> 01:09:49,575
He's on his son's side.

1182
01:09:50,405 --> 01:09:51,444
Look at you.

1183
01:09:53,415 --> 01:09:55,144
Goodness.

1184
01:10:09,795 --> 01:10:10,894
Where should I put this?

1185
01:10:14,865 --> 01:10:15,865
Here?

1186
01:10:16,604 --> 01:10:17,634
Or...

1187
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:19,934
here?

1188
01:10:52,434 --> 01:10:53,734
Min Do Hyuk.

1189
01:10:54,844 --> 01:10:57,274
Aren't you curious about why I've come to...

1190
01:10:57,915 --> 01:10:58,915
hate you so much?

1191
01:11:00,615 --> 01:11:03,115
I will tell you about our ill-fated relationship from now on.

1192
01:11:05,054 --> 01:11:06,214
(Emergency patients only, Authorized personnel only)

1193
01:11:06,215 --> 01:11:09,955
Help! My child is sick!

1194
01:11:10,054 --> 01:11:11,693
You and I were born in the same household.

1195
01:11:11,694 --> 01:11:13,894
- He has a fever of 40°C! - But our social class...

1196
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:15,925
- Please help! - couldn't have been more different.

1197
01:11:17,024 --> 01:11:19,365
You were the son of Sungchan Group's Chairman Sim Yong.

1198
01:11:19,965 --> 01:11:22,064
I was the son of his butler.

1199
01:11:23,335 --> 01:11:24,835
My child is sick!

1200
01:11:25,974 --> 01:11:28,245
You may find my father's background laughable,

1201
01:11:28,774 --> 01:11:30,944
but he was also a pretty decent man at one time.

1202
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:35,644
Until I got sick with whitlow and was on the verge of death.

1203
01:11:37,014 --> 01:11:39,955
I kept drifting in and out of consciousness,

1204
01:11:40,115 --> 01:11:42,925
but the doctors were only focused on the chairman's son...

1205
01:11:43,755 --> 01:11:45,825
when all you had was a runny nose.

1206
01:11:46,925 --> 01:11:48,724
Of course, my father lost it.

1207
01:11:53,295 --> 01:11:55,604
Did the skies help me, the pitiful baby?

1208
01:11:56,705 --> 01:11:58,973
At the time, your mother was recovering from a difficult birth...

1209
01:11:58,974 --> 01:12:00,875
in Hawaii.

1210
01:12:03,104 --> 01:12:04,104
(Sim Jun Seok)

1211
01:12:04,105 --> 01:12:05,943
That's how your fate was switched with mine.

1212
01:12:05,944 --> 01:12:07,614
(Ku Sung Chul)

1213
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:08,844
Without anyone knowing.

1214
01:12:13,415 --> 01:12:15,354
It's just until my son gets better.

1215
01:12:17,925 --> 01:12:19,024
I'm sorry.

1216
01:12:29,134 --> 01:12:32,274
Still, I'd be upset if you thought I took your position for nothing.

1217
01:12:33,304 --> 01:12:35,104
The heir of Sungchan Group.

1218
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:38,144
As Chairman Sim Yong's only son, I had to suffer through nosebleeds,

1219
01:12:38,274 --> 01:12:41,344
take handfuls of pills, and bear the weight of the crown.

1220
01:12:55,264 --> 01:12:57,425
You're so amazing, my son.

1221
01:12:57,965 --> 01:12:59,864
To congratulate you on getting into the science high school...

1222
01:12:59,865 --> 01:13:01,064
with top grades,

1223
01:13:01,264 --> 01:13:02,705
I got you this present.

1224
01:13:03,134 --> 01:13:04,274
Try to tame it well.

1225
01:13:05,274 --> 01:13:06,875
But...

1226
01:13:07,405 --> 01:13:08,405
Really?

1227
01:13:11,814 --> 01:13:13,175
Thank you so much!

1228
01:13:13,444 --> 01:13:14,814
It's so cool.

1229
01:13:15,944 --> 01:13:16,944
Gosh.

1230
01:13:21,524 --> 01:13:23,224
Our dear Jun Seok...

1231
01:13:23,325 --> 01:13:26,255
has never once let us down.

1232
01:13:26,295 --> 01:13:27,894
- It's so nice. - My goodness.

1233
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:31,295
How did I give birth to such a perfect son?

1234
01:13:39,934 --> 01:13:40,944
Jun Seok!

1235
01:13:46,675 --> 01:13:48,844
The happiest moment of my life.

1236
01:13:49,514 --> 01:13:50,585
And...

1237
01:13:50,615 --> 01:13:52,415
- Wake up, Jun Seok. - the worst day of my life.

1238
01:13:52,455 --> 01:13:53,715
- My son! - Please stay back.

1239
01:13:53,755 --> 01:13:55,184
Jun Seok!

1240
01:13:55,384 --> 01:13:56,884
He lost a lot of blood.

1241
01:13:56,955 --> 01:13:58,755
You have to save him!

1242
01:13:58,854 --> 01:14:01,365
He's the one and only heir of Sungchan Group!

1243
01:14:01,465 --> 01:14:02,694
Prepare for a blood transfusion.

1244
01:14:03,394 --> 01:14:06,865
That day, if I hadn't gotten an emergency blood transfusion,

1245
01:14:07,094 --> 01:14:09,865
would that secret have stayed a secret forever?

1246
01:14:10,634 --> 01:14:12,675
- Attorney Song. - Yes, sir.

1247
01:14:12,974 --> 01:14:14,875
I'll have to fix my will.

1248
01:14:15,274 --> 01:14:17,575
The company shares that I gave to Jun Seok...

1249
01:14:17,915 --> 01:14:19,814
should be put back to their original state.

1250
01:14:21,844 --> 01:14:23,045
Make it quick.

1251
01:14:23,144 --> 01:14:24,455
Yes, sir.

1252
01:14:26,314 --> 01:14:28,524
Hey. What happened?

1253
01:14:28,825 --> 01:14:30,155
Did you find my real son?

1254
01:14:30,255 --> 01:14:31,354
I'm sorry.

1255
01:14:31,655 --> 01:14:34,995
I've confirmed that he passed away a long time ago.

1256
01:14:36,425 --> 01:14:39,035
He died? Why would my son die?

1257
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:41,665
Why would my one and only son die?

1258
01:14:44,064 --> 01:14:45,973
Another man's son is alive and well.

1259
01:14:45,974 --> 01:14:48,705
So how could my flesh and blood be dead?

1260
01:14:55,684 --> 01:14:57,514
I decided to become a monster.

1261
01:14:58,285 --> 01:14:59,615
I drank truckloads of alcohol,

1262
01:15:00,884 --> 01:15:02,125
dated women,

1263
01:15:03,024 --> 01:15:06,124
wielded all the power I could with your father's money,

1264
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:07,455
and taunted the world.

1265
01:15:07,894 --> 01:15:09,495
I was determined to do the very worst.

1266
01:15:14,634 --> 01:15:17,134
It was your great parents...

1267
01:15:18,035 --> 01:15:19,934
who abandoned their child because he was a fake.

1268
01:15:21,545 --> 01:15:23,405
What did you do again last night?

1269
01:15:25,474 --> 01:15:27,683
Where on earth are you going...

1270
01:15:27,684 --> 01:15:29,444
with this hideous mask on?

1271
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:32,484
Don't you know how mad your father will be when he finds out?

1272
01:15:32,884 --> 01:15:35,325
So, will you abandon me?

1273
01:15:36,585 --> 01:15:38,693
- Since I'm not your real son? - Jun Seok.

1274
01:15:38,694 --> 01:15:40,524
I'm a fake anyway.

1275
01:15:41,365 --> 01:15:43,523
Weren't you going to throw me out when you found a good reason?

1276
01:15:43,524 --> 01:15:45,165
Don't be ridiculous.

1277
01:15:45,564 --> 01:15:47,394
You're my one and only son.

1278
01:15:49,165 --> 01:15:52,134
Nothing has changed.

1279
01:15:53,205 --> 01:15:55,405
No. Everything has changed.

1280
01:15:56,075 --> 01:15:58,415
Father goes horseback riding with my cousins instead of me.

1281
01:15:59,115 --> 01:16:00,545
And you despise me.

1282
01:16:01,085 --> 01:16:03,183
That's because you keep acting out!

1283
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,014
Lies!

1284
01:16:05,554 --> 01:16:08,684
Since that day, every day, every hour, every second,

1285
01:16:08,984 --> 01:16:11,455
I was like an abandoned dog thrown out in the trash!

1286
01:16:12,094 --> 01:16:13,624
Each day feels like a fiery pit,

1287
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:15,965
and I'm about to go crazy from being so anxious!

1288
01:16:17,224 --> 01:16:20,364
But the way you smile and act like nothing is wrong...

1289
01:16:20,365 --> 01:16:22,134
makes me sick. Do you know that?

1290
01:16:25,434 --> 01:16:26,535
Jun Seok.

1291
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:30,045
Was this all you were capable of?

1292
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:33,474
If you don't even have the strength to handle this kind of hardship,

1293
01:16:34,484 --> 01:16:36,144
let's just end things here.

1294
01:16:36,615 --> 01:16:38,014
Go to America.

1295
01:16:38,314 --> 01:16:40,314
You will continue to change,

1296
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:44,554
and I'm tired of sorting out your messes too!

1297
01:16:45,455 --> 01:16:47,155
I don't even want to look at you. Leave this instant.

1298
01:16:50,165 --> 01:16:51,894
You're finally showing your true colors.

1299
01:16:53,194 --> 01:16:54,434
I embarrass you.

1300
01:16:55,934 --> 01:16:56,964
That's it, isn't it?

1301
01:16:56,965 --> 01:16:57,974
Yes.

1302
01:16:59,075 --> 01:17:00,175
You embarrass me.

1303
01:17:01,245 --> 01:17:02,405
From now on,

1304
01:17:03,304 --> 01:17:04,444
you're no longer my son.

1305
01:17:09,444 --> 01:17:12,115
You're a fake.

1306
01:17:54,194 --> 01:17:56,594
That's right. I'm a fake.

1307
01:17:57,594 --> 01:18:00,465
That makes me want to know just how great you are as the real one.

1308
01:18:02,165 --> 01:18:05,035
A fight between the real and fake ones.

1309
01:18:06,035 --> 01:18:08,344
I look forward to it, Min Do Hyuk.

1310
01:18:11,644 --> 01:18:12,644
Get him out of here.

1311
01:18:23,785 --> 01:18:26,825
(Chilbong's Food Truck)

1312
01:18:29,425 --> 01:18:32,094
You told me to let you know when a red sports car appeared.

1313
01:18:32,564 --> 01:18:33,665
It just got here.

1314
01:18:37,264 --> 01:18:38,375
Thank you.

1315
01:20:34,984 --> 01:20:39,094
(The Escape of the Seven)

1316
01:20:39,155 --> 01:20:41,124
It's exactly 32 hours from now on.

1317
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:42,795
We must make Sungchan look like scumbags in a short amount of time.

1318
01:20:42,825 --> 01:20:44,193
Didn't you get hurt, Ms. Han?

1319
01:20:44,194 --> 01:20:45,464
Why, that nasty little punk.

1320
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:46,763
If I were Da Mi,

1321
01:20:46,764 --> 01:20:48,234
I would've killed you like this.

1322
01:20:48,835 --> 01:20:50,304
Are you sure you can fight me?

1323
01:20:50,365 --> 01:20:52,505
Michell, K...

1324
01:20:52,675 --> 01:20:54,633
You were already in league with K!

1325
01:20:54,634 --> 01:20:55,803
Min Do Hyuk.

1326
01:20:55,804 --> 01:20:57,505
Don't do anything from this point on.

1327
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,045
So, did he die?

1328
01:20:59,175 --> 01:21:01,615
The only thing I can trust now is what I can see.
