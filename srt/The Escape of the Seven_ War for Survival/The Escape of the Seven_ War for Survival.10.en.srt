1
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:22,013
(Hwang Jung Eum)

2
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,112
(Lee Yu Bi)

3
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:30,083
(Lee Joon)

4
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:31,853
(Yoon Jong Hun)

5
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:35,223
(Shin Eun Kyung, Jo Yoon Hee)

6
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:36,823
(Yoon Tae Young, Jo Jae Yun)

7
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,162
(Um Ki Joon)

8
00:00:53,342 --> 00:00:56,372
(The Escape of the Seven)

9
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:57,841
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

10
00:00:57,842 --> 00:00:59,741
(in this drama are fictitious.)

11
00:00:59,742 --> 00:01:01,382
(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

12
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:03,582
Is Ji A even at home?

13
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,021
Did she already catch on and run away?

14
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:06,522
Look, her shoes are still here.

15
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:10,192
Gosh, don't fret about and just call her.

16
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:12,093
- I'll try calling her. - Okay.

17
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,462
I have a bad feeling.

18
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:18,101
- I hear it from over there. - What?

19
00:01:18,102 --> 00:01:19,733
Did she pretend like she wasn't home?

20
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:23,973
Ji A?

21
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:28,313
It's me, Geum La Hui.

22
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:48,131
She's dead, right?

23
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:49,901
Did she commit suicide?

24
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,563
Why would Ji A suddenly commit suicide?

25
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:54,703
What is that?

26
00:01:58,143 --> 00:01:59,443
(Whoever calls K recklessly will certainly die.)

27
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:03,912
"Whoever calls K recklessly..."

28
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:06,083
"will certainly die."

29
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:07,613
It's not suicide.

30
00:02:09,753 --> 00:02:12,423
Then, do you mean K really killed her?

31
00:02:13,353 --> 00:02:15,122
What does K have anything to do with her?

32
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:31,502
Mone, are you okay?

33
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:33,812
You look really pale.

34
00:02:35,013 --> 00:02:37,983
Hey, Han Mone. You know something, don't you?

35
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:43,521
Stop getting on her nerves.

36
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,453
I'll handle Ji A somehow.

37
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,962
There is no way Ji A will listen obediently.

38
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:57,263
Song Ji A knows about you, K.

39
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:58,632
You should stop her.

40
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:03,603
(Song Ji A knows about you, K. You should stop her.)

41
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:08,742
No way. Did K actually...

42
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:16,252
Is there something else...

43
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,182
I don't know about?

44
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:21,393
Ji A said...

45
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:24,722
she would meet with the chairman of Sungchan Group.

46
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:28,092
She said she'd reveal everything that K did.

47
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:31,561
Who is she to meet with the chairman?

48
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:32,602
She was up against Sungchan.

49
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:33,931
Did she have a death wish?

50
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:35,633
Still, how could they kill someone over that?

51
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:36,902
Look at that.

52
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:39,602
How could they do that to a human life without any hesitation?

53
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:41,173
Nothing is for sure yet.

54
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,553
Turn off your phone if it's not important!

55
00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:54,852
Before Chairman Lee kills us,

56
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:56,663
I might die of a heart attack!

57
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:02,163
K... It's K.

58
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:08,333
What are you doing? Hurry up and answer it.

59
00:04:13,272 --> 00:04:14,312
It's me.

60
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:16,983
K, is that you?

61
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:25,553
My father is so furious.

62
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,391
Whoever makes my father mad...

63
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:31,392
will pay the price, no matter what.

64
00:04:32,163 --> 00:04:33,192
You know that.

65
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:38,803
Did the chairman really kill Song Ji A?

66
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:41,103
But why would the chairman care about that girl who is a nobody?

67
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:52,942
Wait, K!

68
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:05,392
What did he say?

69
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:09,363
The chairman of Sungchan Group...

70
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:12,363
is very mad.

71
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:22,241
What are you doing right now?

72
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:23,613
This is a murder scene!

73
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:25,742
Why are you erasing evidence left by the culprit?

74
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:28,113
Do you still not understand?

75
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:32,081
This message is a warning left for us.

76
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,283
That's right. It's a warning.

77
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:36,352
He means we should take the fall...

78
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:38,023
for Bang Da Mi's death.

79
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:41,793
It's a warning for us not to speak K's name out loud.

80
00:05:44,463 --> 00:05:47,502
We have to get out of here this instant!

81
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:51,603
Come on!

82
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:08,353
Oh, gosh!

83
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,502
(Ji Sun)

84
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:34,613
We should just tell the police the whole truth.

85
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:37,681
If they know that Sim Jun Seok is the culprit who killed Bang Da Mi,

86
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:40,293
Lee Hwi So will also stop attacking us.

87
00:06:41,353 --> 00:06:43,052
That makes sense. The real culprit is still out there.

88
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:44,722
Why must we be the scapegoats?

89
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:47,391
Let's just say it. I can't live in a state of anxiety like this.

90
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:49,692
No. If we do, we will all die.

91
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,562
Did you forget about the warning message?

92
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:53,903
I have no intention of dying at K's hands.

93
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:56,001
If you want to die, then you guys go ahead.

94
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:57,173
Mone is right.

95
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,941
The moment we reveal who Da Mi's killer is,

96
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:02,773
we will all end up dead just like Song Ji A.

97
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:07,012
Lee Hwi So may already know that K is the real culprit.

98
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:08,612
He's still tormenting us, even when he knows that.

99
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:12,252
If not for us, Bang Da Mi wouldn't have died like that.

100
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:13,822
Then what do we do now?

101
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:17,422
Maybe not Sungchan, but K is no longer on our side.

102
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:21,233
We've all been cut loose.

103
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:23,963
Now, we must handle Lee Hwi So on our own.

104
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:28,001
Yang Jin Mo. Tell the truth.

105
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:29,802
You're K's lackey, aren't you?

106
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:31,141
What do you think you're doing?

107
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:32,302
How do you know K?

108
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:34,412
Why didn't you say that you knew him?

109
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,282
You knew that he was the culprit from the get-go.

110
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:39,913
What are you trying to play at? Tell me!

111
00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:44,652
It must be the same reason why you didn't tell on Um Ji Man.

112
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:46,853
- What? - I also want to...

113
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,891
survive this, no matter what.

114
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:50,892
Gosh, please!

115
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:54,391
Let's talk about that nonsense after we survive, okay?

116
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:56,033
This is no time for all that.

117
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:00,932
Everyone, get your head in the game.

118
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:04,002
Not only Lee Hwi So but also Sungchan is our enemy now.

119
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,673
The only hope we have left now...

120
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:08,241
is Matthew.

121
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:09,572
No matter what we do,

122
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:12,312
we have to make Matthew take our side.

123
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:32,963
It's getting late.

124
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:34,803
You should turn in for the night, sir.

125
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:41,412
The incident regarding Jun Seok...

126
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:42,913
must never be revealed to the world.

127
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:46,842
If anyone who gets in the way of Sungchan,

128
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,112
get rid of them, no matter who they are.

129
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:51,653
Yes, sir.

130
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:56,092
Song Ji A.

131
00:08:58,222 --> 00:08:59,722
Ji A is dead?

132
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:05,932
I was rooting for her.

133
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:10,071
In the end, she was a friend who stood by Da Mi's side.

134
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:11,602
Why did a girl like that...

135
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:14,312
have to die by forced suicide?

136
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:16,841
According to Han Mone, she said she'd go to Sungchan Group...

137
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:17,982
to meet with Chairman Sim.

138
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,753
It seems Sungchan Group got rid of her.

139
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,822
"Whoever calls K recklessly..."

140
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:27,023
"will certainly die."

141
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:29,393
K...

142
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:36,893
It was a message left behind by the culprit.

143
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:40,503
They mean to get rid of anyone who dares to touch K.

144
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:43,673
This has made things clear.

145
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:46,642
K has been doing evil deeds...

146
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:47,971
under the protection of Sungchan Group.

147
00:09:47,972 --> 00:09:50,711
Chairman Sim is a devil...

148
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:53,212
who'd even commit murder for his own son.

149
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:55,982
It's all because of me.

150
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:58,423
In order to keep Mone in check,

151
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:01,023
I pushed her to début in the entertainment industry.

152
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:04,322
Ji A died because of me.

153
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:08,763
Chairman Bang and now Ji A...

154
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:12,262
have been sacrificed because of my darned revenge.

155
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:14,673
How is any of this your fault?

156
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:16,701
The actual people who are at fault...

157
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:18,202
are that crazy jerk K and Sungchan Group.

158
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:20,643
Those jerks know everything about us.

159
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:23,643
You could also be on K's kill list.

160
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:26,211
But why doesn't this make me afraid at all?

161
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:29,013
I can't watch anything bad happen to you too!

162
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:30,451
Even if I die, I'll die alone!

163
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:31,822
Then let's die together!

164
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:34,923
Chairman.

165
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:39,923
On the day that my mom and brother died,

166
00:10:41,993 --> 00:10:43,293
I died too.

167
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,201
You want me to step aside now?

168
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:47,502
After you saved everyone?

169
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:48,672
Min Do Hyuk.

170
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:50,033
Swear to me right now.

171
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:52,571
I will stay with you until the very end.

172
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:53,942
K? Sungchan Group?

173
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:56,212
I will kill them all with my own two hands.

174
00:10:57,913 --> 00:10:58,942
The price...

175
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:03,352
of my family's, Chairman Bang's, Bang Da Mi's, and Song Ji A's lives.

176
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,253
I will get payback, no matter what.

177
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:46,722
Ji A wasn't the one who brought my family into this.

178
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:49,293
It was Lee Hwi So, Da Mi's stepdad’s doing.

179
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:52,701
My mom and brother aren't answering the phone.

180
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:53,803
What do I do?

181
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:56,173
Please find out where my family is, will you?

182
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,102
Are you listening to me?

183
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:02,013
Please find my family.

184
00:12:02,673 --> 00:12:04,643
You take care of your family issues on your own.

185
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:08,153
Did you ask K for a favour?

186
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,913
To take care of Ji A?

187
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:12,482
Did you ask him to kill her?

188
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:15,523
I never asked him to kill her,

189
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:17,822
though I did ask him to stop her.

190
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:21,393
That's the same thing.

191
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,663
Are you trying to blame me for Ji A's death?

192
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:28,102
Don't act so hypocritical now, as if you have a conscience.

193
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,542
You're nothing more than a cold-hearted mom...

194
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:31,803
who abandoned her own daughter too.

195
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,072
Do you think you'll be safe if Ji A is dead?

196
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,342
The police will start looking into you before anyone else.

197
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:40,342
Of course,

198
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:42,852
that's if Lee Hwi So lets you live until then.

199
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:50,253
Do you mean you're hoping that Lee Hwi So kills me?

200
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:52,923
You're supposed to be the CEO. How can you say that?

201
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:55,092
Answer me!

202
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:23,153
What are you doing?

203
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:24,422
We have to leave this place.

204
00:13:24,423 --> 00:13:26,722
Hurry up and get Han Na out of bed. Grab only what you need now.

205
00:13:27,062 --> 00:13:28,432
What's going on that you're acting like this?

206
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,493
Stop asking questions and just do as I say.

207
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:32,232
What is going on?

208
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,202
I'm going to leave Han Na with someone else.

209
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:38,572
That's that.

210
00:13:38,873 --> 00:13:40,471
You just stay hidden as if you're dead...

211
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:41,743
until I contact you.

212
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:43,472
What does that mean?

213
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:46,442
Did Han Na's birth parents show up or something?

214
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,053
Did they ask to have Han Na back?

215
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,553
No. I can never give her back.

216
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:51,952
I can't live without Han Na.

217
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:53,822
That darned Han Na!

218
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:56,152
She's not even your own child.

219
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,722
Do you even know whose daughter Han Na is?

220
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:59,023
I don't want to know.

221
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:00,862
Han Na is my daughter.

222
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:03,893
You could die because of Han Na!

223
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:05,432
It doesn't matter.

224
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,533
Don't ever say that you will take Han Na away from me again.

225
00:14:13,572 --> 00:14:14,612
Paeng Hee.

226
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,942
Let's run away.

227
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:17,883
Just you and me. The two of us, okay?

228
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:20,712
Then I will take care of you for life.

229
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,783
Do you know why I didn't kill you?

230
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:27,952
Because a mom with a child can't become a murderer.

231
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:30,192
That's why I held myself back.

232
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:32,191
I get goosebumps and shivers down my spine...

233
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:33,462
even just by looking into your eyes.

234
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:36,033
I hung in there with every ounce of my strength.

235
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,932
So don't you dare say such ridiculous things again.

236
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:42,403
I might actually kill you.

237
00:14:54,952 --> 00:14:56,852
Promise me you'll save my kid. Okay?

238
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:58,352
Please.

239
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:07,192
Would you look at this?

240
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:11,403
What a faithful woman.

241
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:14,572
Betraying that thug is no reason for you to die.

242
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,202
Is your love so pure?

243
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:20,472
Here. I brought you a present.

244
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:21,712
Raise it well.

245
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:24,682
It's a girl. Give her your last name and raise her as your own.

246
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:29,212
Don't make her an orphan like me.

247
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:41,232
Sim Jun Seok.

248
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,133
If something bad happens to that woman,

249
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:45,533
I will put my everything on the line...

250
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,503
and kill you.

251
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:54,673
Mommy will...

252
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,442
be by your side forever, Han Na.

253
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:00,013
I will never be parted from you.

254
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,413
I love you, my daughter.

255
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:14,133
Tonight, I will

256
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:19,701
Are you walking around with your eyes closed?

257
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:21,101
It hurts so much!

258
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:22,303
This is so annoying!

259
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,023
Excuse me.

260
00:16:49,393 --> 00:16:50,462
Do you...

261
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:53,903
want to grab a drink with me?

262
00:16:58,273 --> 00:17:00,842
(TIKITAKA)

263
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:04,783
His height? My type.

264
00:17:05,112 --> 00:17:06,712
His wealth? My type.

265
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:08,513
His face?

266
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:09,783
My type.

267
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:11,152
Are you perhaps...

268
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:13,222
a trainee to become a celebrity?

269
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:14,391
No, I'm not.

270
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:15,553
But why not?

271
00:17:16,023 --> 00:17:17,622
I'm not interested in celebrities.

272
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:19,792
What have you been doing with that face all this time?

273
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:21,993
You could've made your début 100 times over.

274
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:23,292
Me?

275
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,632
If you had been a celebrity,

276
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:27,303
you would've become a huge success with that face.

277
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:30,172
You're a shaman, aren't you?

278
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:32,443
Not exactly.

279
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:33,773
I'm...

280
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:35,772
in this field.

281
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:36,773
(Team Leader Wang Yu Jin)

282
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:40,513
LH Media?

283
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,112
This is Han Mone's agency.

284
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:43,213
That's right.

285
00:17:43,214 --> 00:17:44,983
It's the top star, Han Mone's agency.

286
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:47,821
There was an M and A with LH and TIKITAKA as of yesterday.

287
00:17:47,822 --> 00:17:49,023
And I am...

288
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:50,422
the big shot there.

289
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,762
If I put my mind to it,

290
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:54,632
I could make you a star.

291
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:56,763
What do you say?

292
00:17:56,862 --> 00:17:59,332
Well, it does sound like fun to play a celebrity.

293
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:01,571
"To play a celebrity?"

294
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:04,243
Well, I am curious about something.

295
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:06,503
Is this company called TIKITAKA...

296
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,672
a pretty sizeable one?

297
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:11,283
You really don't know anything with that handsome face of yours.

298
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:13,212
I bet TIKITAKA will make a clean sweep...

299
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:15,713
of the world's OTT content from now on.

300
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:18,852
So here's the deal.

301
00:18:19,783 --> 00:18:22,693
Next time, let's go somewhere nice...

302
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:24,763
and talk about...

303
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:27,963
our future in detail.

304
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:29,292
Sounds good.

305
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:30,733
But let me think about it.

306
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:32,862
I've got a busy day ahead of me.

307
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:40,003
That relaxed attitude of a man who has it all.

308
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,213
I can't believe that Ji A committed suicide.

309
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,053
Why would she do such a foolish thing?

310
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:53,483
Ji A...

311
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:00,762
We saw that you were the last person...

312
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:02,462
to speak with the deceased on the phone, Ms. Han.

313
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:03,733
What did you talk about?

314
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:06,962
Song Ji A.

315
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:09,132
You decided to come back and work for me?

316
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:10,402
As if.

317
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:13,803
I called to tell you I have something.

318
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:15,672
Your weakness.

319
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,013
Sim Jun Seok.

320
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:20,882
She said she wanted to apologize to me.

321
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:25,082
We had a small argument about a song, you see.

322
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,983
Yes, I read the article.

323
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:30,322
She said she was sorry that she stole my song.

324
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:32,092
I saw with my own eyes.

325
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,533
You drove off with him in a convertible.

326
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:38,662
She apologized while bawling, so I accepted her apology.

327
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:42,533
Dear Ji A looked up to the entertainment industry so much.

328
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:45,543
But I felt so bad for her that she was kicked out...

329
00:19:45,743 --> 00:19:47,372
because of her past history of school violence.

330
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:51,442
We're only checking this as regular protocol.

331
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:54,452
Around the estimated time of the deceased's death at 11pm,

332
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:55,753
what were you doing?

333
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:57,382
She was with me.

334
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:00,252
We were invited to Chairman Lee's house,

335
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:01,652
so several of us were gathered there.

336
00:20:01,753 --> 00:20:03,453
There are plenty of people to testify to that.

337
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:05,963
Yes. Then,

338
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:08,993
why did you call Ji A again around midnight?

339
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:11,132
Don't fret about and just call her.

340
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:13,102
- I'll try calling her. - Okay.

341
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:16,433
I was going to suggest that we work together again.

342
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:20,142
If only I had called her a little bit earlier,

343
00:20:21,142 --> 00:20:23,213
could I have stopped her from committing suicide?

344
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:32,283
Detective,

345
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:35,193
I hope Ji A's death doesn't become publicized.

346
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,523
I don't want her to be criticized even in death.

347
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:42,033
She was still my friend. Please?

348
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:45,003
Well, okay. I understand.

349
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:46,433
I hope you don't grieve for too long.

350
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:48,773
Ji A...

351
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:54,203
Ji A.

352
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:57,572
Poor Ji A.

353
00:21:00,112 --> 00:21:01,253
Ji A...

354
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:28,212
Gosh.

355
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:31,111
It's been too long, Prosecutor General Um.

356
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:33,112
Gosh, Mr. Yang.

357
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:38,253
Goodness.

358
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:43,351
You look like you've lost some weight.

359
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:44,723
You must've had some heartache.

360
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:47,422
Yes, thanks to someone.

361
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:50,962
You know that I'm being chased by Lee Hwi So these days...

362
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:54,002
and being sucked dry because of it, don't you?

363
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:55,131
Gosh.

364
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:57,101
What do I know?

365
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:58,973
Don't act dumb.

366
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:01,943
It was your talent that made Lee Hwi So out to be...

367
00:22:02,342 --> 00:22:04,443
the culprit of the Bobble incident.

368
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:09,483
And because of that, Lee Hwi So wants us dead.

369
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,183
By the way,

370
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:15,293
I'm really curious about something.

371
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:19,693
Why is K so deeply involved in the Bobble incident?

372
00:22:21,193 --> 00:22:22,332
He must find it amusing.

373
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:25,733
He likes to be amused.

374
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:30,032
Why are you staring?

375
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:31,642
I really don't know.

376
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:35,872
I'm disappointed the prosecutor general doesn't know.

377
00:22:38,912 --> 00:22:41,652
Shall I drop you a hint?

378
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:47,223
The person K is after.

379
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:49,523
It's Min Do Hyuk.

380
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:54,533
Min Do Hyuk? The underling I know?

381
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:57,592
Wait.

382
00:22:58,362 --> 00:22:59,962
How are they connected?

383
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:03,902
That's for you to look into from now on.

384
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:09,112
The truth is, five years ago,

385
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:11,483
K secretly asked me for a favour.

386
00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:14,312
Do you know Min Do Hyuk?

387
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:16,382
I know him well.

388
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:18,252
He used to work for Kang Ki Tak.

389
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:20,851
With his fist, he conquered the downtown thugs.

390
00:23:20,852 --> 00:23:23,193
I'd like for him to work for me,

391
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:24,523
but he won't budge.

392
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:27,162
Why are you asking about him?

393
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:28,562
I just...

394
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,993
hate his guts.

395
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:34,203
Okay...

396
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:37,703
Send him to prison.

397
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:42,842
Why? Did he do something wrong?

398
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:45,082
"Why?"

399
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:47,183
"Why?"

400
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:52,023
"Why?"

401
00:23:56,193 --> 00:23:58,723
Jin Mo. You're all grown up.

402
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:01,993
You dared to ask me a question.

403
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:07,162
You never even dared to look me in the eye.

404
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:10,733
Sorry.

405
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:20,582
You said you wanted to take over Taebaek Entertainment.

406
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:24,582
Do as I say and I'll make it yours.

407
00:24:25,582 --> 00:24:27,852
So do what you do best!

408
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:30,793
A murder charge sounds good.

409
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:32,821
Sort him out...

410
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:34,733
so he rots in prison forever.

411
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:38,002
After that, he asked me...

412
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:40,132
to wipe out Do Hyuk's family without a trace.

413
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:43,803
Unless he had a massive grudge,

414
00:24:44,572 --> 00:24:47,203
would K want something this big done?

415
00:24:50,473 --> 00:24:51,882
Min Do Hyuk...

416
00:24:52,412 --> 00:24:55,152
To him, we're flies he might swat at any moment.

417
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:59,683
Don't you think we should have some leverage on K?

418
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,132
How did it go?

419
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:14,233
Police ruled it a suicide.

420
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:16,871
That fast?

421
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:18,502
They're not even aware...

422
00:25:18,503 --> 00:25:20,672
Song Ji A went to Sungchan Group.

423
00:25:20,943 --> 00:25:22,572
What about the information we sent the journalists?

424
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,513
No one's writing about it.

425
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:27,812
I bet Sungchan Group stopped them.

426
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:31,082
If that's the case,

427
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:34,622
we'll change our plan.

428
00:25:34,953 --> 00:25:36,023
How so?

429
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:39,362
(Agreement)

430
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:41,892
We'll use the Seven's collateral.

431
00:25:42,892 --> 00:25:44,533
The mourning period's over.

432
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,871
Starting now, and just overnight,

433
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:55,012
I'll take everything they amassed,

434
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,272
enjoyed, and tried to protect.

435
00:25:57,273 --> 00:25:59,081
How will they crumble...

436
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:00,983
and fight Sungchan Group?

437
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:02,982
It should be fun to watch.

438
00:26:02,983 --> 00:26:05,852

and froze all our accounts.

445

446
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:30,671

449
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:37,282

00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:43,821
What do you think about my looks?

453
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:46,522
Do I have what it takes to be a star?

454
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:47,662

455
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:50,892

Yes.

(Painting seller Go Myoung Ji)

548
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:00,263
Ms. Go!

549
00:34:00,793 --> 00:34:02,392
Come to the principal's office now!

550
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:06,902
- She's here. - My gosh.

551
00:34:11,473 --> 00:34:12,842
(Flirted with a married man)

552
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:15,442
(Painting seller Go Myoung Ji!)

553
00:34:17,772 --> 00:34:18,981
Is it true...

554
00:34:18,982 --> 00:34:21,882
you forced parents to buy paintings for tens of thousands of dollars,

555
00:34:22,183 --> 00:34:23,952
and showed favours to the students...

556
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:26,322
of parents who bought your paintings?

557
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:28,592
I did host exhibitions and gift paintings,

558
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:30,791
but I never received payment.

559
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:32,623
We got a tip!

560
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:35,462
Complete with a list of parents who bribed you.

561
00:34:35,563 --> 00:34:36,833
It's a lie!

562
00:34:36,862 --> 00:34:38,933
Who would spread such a rumour?

563
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:40,632
This is a set-up.

564
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:41,762
Then...

565
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:44,902
how will you explain the paintings found in these parents' possession?

566
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:46,671
Are they not yours?

567
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:48,672
I told you. They were gifts.

568
00:34:48,842 --> 00:34:51,413
To thank them for visiting my exhibition each year.

569
00:34:55,112 --> 00:34:56,712
Tell them, ma'am.

570
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:58,553
Did I take your money?

571
00:34:58,822 --> 00:35:00,083
Well...

572
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,892
Right after the last exhibition,

573
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:04,452
their kids whose scores just aren't high enough...

574
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:06,163
got into the Ivy League class.

575
00:35:06,692 --> 00:35:08,833
Do you think that was a coincidence?

576
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:10,361
- It's not. - What?

577
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:11,632
Their scores aren't good enough?

578
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:13,401
Are you an expert?

579
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,772
She saw my kid's artistic potential!

580
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:17,571
- What? - "Potential?"

581
00:35:17,572 --> 00:35:19,842
So what if your kid does well in math and literature?

582
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:22,342
Their art is as good as a pauper's.

583
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:24,473
What? A pauper?

584
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:26,881
Is that all you can say?

585
00:35:26,882 --> 00:35:27,982
What's wrong?

586
00:35:28,183 --> 00:35:29,612
Did I prick your conscience?

587
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:31,112
Darn you!

588
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:33,422
Come at me!

589
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:35,292
- You witch. - What?

590
00:35:35,623 --> 00:35:36,822
Enough!

591
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:38,592
Will you stop it?

592
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:42,493
Ms. Go.

593
00:35:43,132 --> 00:35:45,092
We have statements already.

594
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:46,902
Including testimonies that you...

595
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,603
went to a motel with a student's father.

596
00:35:49,873 --> 00:35:50,973
- What? - My goodness.

597
00:35:51,103 --> 00:35:52,402
- What the... - Unbelievable.

598
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,072
I called you here to let you explain.

599
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:58,782
But you insist on lying to the end.

600
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,782
- No... - What teacher...

601
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,981
knows no shame?

602
00:36:01,982 --> 00:36:03,752
Sir!

603
00:36:06,283 --> 00:36:08,022
The motel thing isn't true.

604
00:36:08,152 --> 00:36:09,822
That's a complete lie.

605
00:36:10,123 --> 00:36:12,921
Why do you believe the tipster and not me?

606
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:14,021
This is unfair.

607
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:16,763
Then prove it's a lie!

608
00:36:17,263 --> 00:36:19,631
Why should I prove my innocence...

609
00:36:19,632 --> 00:36:20,862
when I'm denying it?

610
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:23,872
This was your plan from the start. Right?

611
00:36:23,873 --> 00:36:25,901
To frame me for everything!

612
00:36:25,902 --> 00:36:27,072
Do you have evidence?

613
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:28,571
Evidence that it was Mone!

614
00:36:28,572 --> 00:36:30,612
Why do I have to look for evidence?

615
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,482
I'm the victim!

616
00:36:33,783 --> 00:36:35,143
I'm the victim here.

617
00:36:36,553 --> 00:36:37,982
It can't be...

618
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,022
I will report this...

619
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:43,123
directly to the Education Office.

620
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,663
You're suspended...

621
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:48,493
until we decide what disciplinary action to take.

622
00:36:49,493 --> 00:36:51,692
Leave the school grounds now!

623
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:55,502
Hey.

624
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:58,272
I heard talk that your husband was seeing a teacher.

625
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:00,143
Is that her?

626
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:02,072
Wait.

627
00:37:04,413 --> 00:37:06,683
Were you the one who seduced my husband?

628
00:37:07,982 --> 00:37:09,053
Hey, you.

629
00:37:10,252 --> 00:37:11,353
No!

630
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:13,922
Leave me alone!

631
00:37:14,123 --> 00:37:16,292
How dare you come after my husband!

632
00:37:17,223 --> 00:37:18,723
I did not!

633
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:21,022
Let go!

634
00:37:23,732 --> 00:37:25,033
You're not pregnant.

635
00:37:25,402 --> 00:37:29,333
Can you just give me a document that says I am?

636
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,643
Are you the one who called yesterday?

637
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:36,243
Yes. We talked, didn't we?

638
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:40,842
Did you really bring 500,000 dollars?

639
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:42,813
You must know...

640
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:44,683
I can only take cash.

641
00:37:54,362 --> 00:37:55,791
How much...

642
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:57,962
are you going to take the man for?

643
00:37:58,292 --> 00:37:59,462
Five million.

644
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,672
He's a pretty famous guy.

645
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:05,272
Ten percent's not a bad deal, is it?

646
00:38:06,643 --> 00:38:08,102
How far along shall I say you are?

647
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:09,542
Four weeks? Six weeks?

648
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:12,783
You're a natural.

649
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:15,682
I can tell just how corrupt...

650
00:38:15,683 --> 00:38:17,013
you've been all your life.

651
00:38:18,723 --> 00:38:20,422
You can come in!

652
00:38:22,953 --> 00:38:24,852
Hello, we're from "Unanswered Questions."

653
00:38:24,853 --> 00:38:26,692
Who are you? Turn off the camera.

654
00:38:26,862 --> 00:38:28,291
Put that away!

655
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:31,762
We got a tip that you sell fake doctor reports.

656
00:38:31,763 --> 00:38:33,063
Who said that?

657
00:38:33,203 --> 00:38:35,032
I said put away the camera!

658
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:37,202
When did you start doing this?

659
00:38:37,203 --> 00:38:38,872
I never did such a thing!

660
00:38:38,873 --> 00:38:40,771
Today. This was the first time.

661
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:42,872
I felt so sorry for you.

662
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:45,441
You took 500,000 dollars from someone you felt sorry for?

663
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:46,913
Yes, well...

664
00:38:47,013 --> 00:38:50,651
Five years ago, you gave a teenager a fake doctor's note.

665
00:38:50,652 --> 00:38:51,752
Do you admit to that?

666
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:53,152
Five years ago?

667
00:38:54,453 --> 00:38:55,792
I found out she had...

668
00:38:55,822 --> 00:38:57,453
- given birth. - What?

669
00:38:58,553 --> 00:38:59,763
What are you saying?

670
00:39:00,022 --> 00:39:02,021
Here. I even have her chart.

672
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:04,632
Darn it!

673
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,002
You darn brat.

674
00:39:12,803 --> 00:39:14,001
- Dr. Cha. - Dr. Cha.

675
00:39:14,002 --> 00:39:15,441
- Dr. Cha. - Dr. Cha. Wait!

676
00:39:15,442 --> 00:39:16,612
- Dr. Cha. - Dr. Cha.

677
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:18,013
- Dr. Cha. - Let's talk!

678
00:39:18,313 --> 00:39:19,881
Just a moment!

679
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:22,513
- Let's sit for an interview. - Leave me alone!

680
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,651
It's not like that!

681
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:27,123
How much did you take and from how many people?

682
00:39:27,223 --> 00:39:30,692
Didn't you feel bad about lying that people were pregnant?

683
00:39:30,822 --> 00:39:32,663
When did you start doing this?

684
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:34,862
I didn't do anything like that.

685
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,833

686
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:43,973
Good job.

(Get the truth from Man of Truth)

690
00:39:58,353 --> 00:40:01,082
On today's Truth or Lie,

691
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,553
we'll discuss star actress Mone.

692
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:04,922
She extended her exclusive contract with TIKITAKA,

693
00:40:05,053 --> 00:40:08,393
and is the driving force behind their soaring stock prices.

694
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:12,933
But it turns out, she hid a crazy secret.

695
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:16,103
Of course, I really love Ms. Geum,

696
00:40:16,232 --> 00:40:18,533
but the person I respect most in the world...

697
00:40:18,672 --> 00:40:19,873
is my mom.

698
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:22,312
The mom Mone said she respects the most.

699
00:40:22,313 --> 00:40:25,583
This is what Mone had to say about her.

700
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,112
She's perfect in every way.

701
00:40:28,442 --> 00:40:31,552
She speaks fluent English, French, and Spanish,

702
00:40:31,553 --> 00:40:33,183
and takes great care of herself.

703
00:40:33,283 --> 00:40:35,082
My mom and my family...

704
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:36,652
are everything to me.

705
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:39,522
Is that a truth or a lie?

706
00:40:39,993 --> 00:40:41,162
Drum roll.

707
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:42,462
It's a lie.

708
00:40:42,592 --> 00:40:43,961
I have for you...

709
00:40:43,962 --> 00:40:47,432
a photo of Mone's actual mom.

710
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:51,202
(Truth or Lie)

711
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:52,242
(Is this why she lied?)

712
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:53,243
(Who's that mom, then?)

713
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,272
(Her life's a lie.)

714
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:06,752
Hello, chairman. Why did you call?

715
00:41:07,022 --> 00:41:10,322
A strange video about you was on TV.

716
00:41:10,652 --> 00:41:11,752
Are you aware of it?

717
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:13,462
A strange video?

718
00:41:13,592 --> 00:41:14,792
I'll send it to you now.

719
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:29,913
Mone didn't just lie about her family but her age too.

720
00:41:29,973 --> 00:41:32,782
The mom who spoke English, French, and German...

721
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:34,341
turned out to be deaf,

722
00:41:34,342 --> 00:41:38,252
and she never had a business in Silicon Valley in the US.

723
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:40,752
She duped us all.

724
00:41:40,922 --> 00:41:43,453
She deceived us completely!

725
00:41:57,873 --> 00:41:59,042
(Mone)

726
00:42:09,252 --> 00:42:10,553
You show up at last.

727
00:42:11,953 --> 00:42:13,853
Why won't she pick up?

728
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:22,563
Lee Hwi So's waiting.

729
00:42:24,192 --> 00:42:25,333
Lee Hwi So?

730
00:42:26,362 --> 00:42:27,401
What for?

731
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:28,433
Don't be afraid.

732
00:42:30,002 --> 00:42:32,203
He won't kill you today, at least.

733
00:42:34,703 --> 00:42:35,813
Drive.

734
00:42:38,112 --> 00:42:39,212
Now.

735
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:03,731
Chairman. It's not true.

736
00:43:03,732 --> 00:43:05,072
It's all a lie.

737
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:06,873
What's a lie?

738
00:43:07,203 --> 00:43:09,212
The thing about your age? Or your family?

739
00:43:09,373 --> 00:43:11,112
Tell the truth, Ms. Han.

740
00:43:11,212 --> 00:43:14,482
I was abroad for a long time and started school two years late.

741
00:43:14,743 --> 00:43:16,482
That's not a crime.

742
00:43:16,913 --> 00:43:19,123
Ms. Geum knows about it already.

743
00:43:19,252 --> 00:43:20,382
Your parents, then.

744
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:23,453
Does your mother have a business in the US?

745
00:43:24,623 --> 00:43:27,462
She does. I have no reason to lie.

746
00:43:27,993 --> 00:43:29,962
You'd better be able to explain it without a doubt.

747
00:43:33,462 --> 00:43:34,702
You bet I will.

748
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:37,002
I'll set everything straight.

749
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,272
Okay, then.

750
00:43:41,902 --> 00:43:43,643
You have exactly three hours.

751
00:43:44,072 --> 00:43:45,882
You'd better explain everything...

752
00:43:46,643 --> 00:43:47,743
by then.

753
00:44:07,502 --> 00:44:09,203
Yu Jin, where are you?

754
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:10,232
I've got news.

755
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:12,002
Mone's mom...

756
00:44:12,873 --> 00:44:14,803
Where is she?

757
00:44:17,272 --> 00:44:18,643
You crazy...

758
00:44:19,013 --> 00:44:21,712
Mone has an emergency.

759
00:44:23,013 --> 00:44:24,283
Wang Yu Jin!

760
00:44:24,553 --> 00:44:27,123
This is no time for you to relax and take a bath.

761
00:44:27,353 --> 00:44:28,952
Can't you hear me?

762
00:44:28,953 --> 00:44:30,022
Hey.

763
00:44:34,822 --> 00:44:35,933
- Oh, my! - What is this?

764
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:55,513
Here.

765
00:44:58,283 --> 00:44:59,283
Hi.

766
00:45:00,623 --> 00:45:02,053
You're Han Na, right?

767
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:05,961
I'm sorry, but could you get Erica and Phillip for me?

768
00:45:05,962 --> 00:45:09,292
Erica and Phillip left earlier.

769
00:45:09,462 --> 00:45:11,461
But it's not time for them to leave yet.

770
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:13,803
Who took them? Their nanny?

771
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:15,533
No.

772
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:18,272
What?

773
00:45:20,902 --> 00:45:24,171
Excuse me. Where is Erica and Phillip?

774
00:45:24,172 --> 00:45:26,582
Oh, a man came by...

775
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,542
and picked them up around lunchtime.

776
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:31,013
He said they were going to the broadcasting station.

777
00:45:31,382 --> 00:45:33,422
Wasn't that a manager?

778
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:35,853
What manager?

779
00:45:36,322 --> 00:45:38,493
Why would you send them off without saying anything to me?

780
00:45:38,623 --> 00:45:39,922
I'm sorry, ma'am.

781
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:44,592
Could it have been Mr. Yang?

782
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:53,502
Hello?

783
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:55,842
This is Go Myoung Ji.

784
00:45:56,143 --> 00:45:57,973
Are you with Erica right now?

785
00:45:59,643 --> 00:46:00,712
What?

786
00:46:00,882 --> 00:46:02,652
My kids are missing.

787
00:46:03,112 --> 00:46:04,152
What should I do?

788
00:46:04,652 --> 00:46:06,522
If something happens to my kids,

789
00:46:06,652 --> 00:46:08,223
I'm going to die!

790
00:46:10,322 --> 00:46:12,522
Go home for now. I'll be right there.

791
00:46:23,203 --> 00:46:24,873
So this is Lee Hwi So's hideout?

792
00:46:25,803 --> 00:46:28,803
He bought such a nice villa with Chairman Bang's money.

793
00:46:31,973 --> 00:46:33,182
I don't understand.

794
00:46:33,183 --> 00:46:34,643
Why are you helping Lee Hwi So?

795
00:46:34,913 --> 00:46:36,813
For money? If not,

796
00:46:37,652 --> 00:46:38,913
did Mr. Bang ask you to?

797
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:45,223
You shouldn't say unnecessary things.

798
00:46:46,123 --> 00:46:47,163
Save your energy.

799
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:52,132
Lee Hwi So will be here soon.

800
00:46:53,132 --> 00:46:55,002
I'll keep your phone for security purposes.

801
00:47:00,473 --> 00:47:01,703
Where are you going?

802
00:47:02,303 --> 00:47:05,013
Where are you going? Where?

803
00:47:26,002 --> 00:47:27,763
Who are you?

804
00:47:29,303 --> 00:47:30,402
Lee Hwi So...

805
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:32,502
Is that you?

806
00:48:10,072 --> 00:48:12,513
Don't come near me!

807
00:48:12,683 --> 00:48:14,412
Get away from me!

808
00:48:14,413 --> 00:48:16,212
Stay away!

809
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:59,292
I think I should call the police.

810
00:48:59,522 --> 00:49:01,192
Try calling their father first.

811
00:49:02,663 --> 00:49:04,162
It's not him.

812
00:49:04,163 --> 00:49:06,103
He doesn't even know of Erica and Phillip's existence.

813
00:49:10,732 --> 00:49:11,732
What if...

814
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:16,072
Lee Hwi So took my twins?

815
00:49:16,842 --> 00:49:18,873
Someone sent an anonymous letter to the school today.

816
00:49:19,513 --> 00:49:21,111
They revealed my corrupt acts...

817
00:49:21,112 --> 00:49:23,453
and threw me in the gutter in a snap.

818
00:49:24,183 --> 00:49:26,123
Lee Hwi So is the only person...

819
00:49:26,853 --> 00:49:28,553
that would do this to me.

820
00:49:28,683 --> 00:49:30,492
Lee Hwi So is a father who raised a daughter.

821
00:49:30,493 --> 00:49:32,321
I'm sure he won't hurt children.

822
00:49:32,322 --> 00:49:33,421
No.

823
00:49:33,422 --> 00:49:35,622
A parent who has lost their child can do anything.

824
00:49:35,623 --> 00:49:37,163
Nothing can stop them.

825
00:49:40,303 --> 00:49:42,302
It's dangerous to call the police now.

826
00:49:42,303 --> 00:49:44,873
All of our other secrets could end up getting out.

827
00:49:45,132 --> 00:49:46,972
I'll make sure to find them,

828
00:49:46,973 --> 00:49:48,542
so wait for them at home.

829
00:49:48,803 --> 00:49:50,472
How can I just wait around and do nothing?

830
00:49:50,473 --> 00:49:51,942
I can't do that!

831
00:49:53,013 --> 00:49:54,982
Erica is signed under my agency!

832
00:49:57,353 --> 00:49:58,813
Follow company orders.

833
00:50:00,152 --> 00:50:01,981
If you act rashly,

834
00:50:01,982 --> 00:50:03,553
you could ruin things for everyone.

835
00:50:17,572 --> 00:50:19,203
Oh, that hurts. Be gentle.

836
00:50:21,172 --> 00:50:23,042
Oh, that's good.

837
00:50:24,842 --> 00:50:26,013
Ms. Ryu Hong Ju.

838
00:50:27,882 --> 00:50:29,913
- What is this? - Express delivery, ma'am.

839
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,112
Express delivery? Open it.

840
00:50:34,022 --> 00:50:35,022
I'm a big fan.

841
00:50:40,623 --> 00:50:41,692
What's up with him?

842
00:50:46,603 --> 00:50:47,632
What is this?

843
00:50:50,772 --> 00:50:51,901
(Ryu Hong Ju, Dividends from proceeds earned)

844
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:55,902
(Paid amount, 25,014,180 dollars, Unpaid amount, 5,032,071.20 dollars)

845
00:50:58,413 --> 00:50:59,442
Yang Jin Mo.

846
00:51:00,842 --> 00:51:02,112
Where is that bastard?

847
00:51:04,813 --> 00:51:06,422
(Prosecution Service)

848
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:18,792
- Deputy Chief Prosecutor Jo. - Yes?

849
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,732
(To Deputy Chief Prosecutor Jo Dong Hee)

850
00:51:30,272 --> 00:51:32,243
(Han Mone)

851
00:51:33,913 --> 00:51:34,913
(I denounce Nam Chul Woo,)

852
00:51:34,914 --> 00:51:36,312
(who has been internally chosen to be Seoul Police Commissioner!)

853
00:51:36,313 --> 00:51:37,381
(Public Report Form)

854
00:51:37,382 --> 00:51:38,481
(Nam Chul Woo has habitually used and sold drugs.)

855
00:51:38,482 --> 00:51:39,583
(He has drugs in his possession! I ask for immediate investigation.)

856
00:51:40,022 --> 00:51:42,321
Hey. Catch that guy.

857
00:51:42,322 --> 00:51:43,353
- Hey! Get him! - Hey! Get him!

858
00:51:45,422 --> 00:51:46,822
- Get him! - Hey!

859
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:51,933
Get him!

860
00:52:12,053 --> 00:52:13,723
Oh, sorry, sir.

861
00:52:14,183 --> 00:52:16,692
It's okay.

862
00:52:22,663 --> 00:52:24,192
- Nice to meet you. - Hello, sir.

863
00:52:24,663 --> 00:52:25,732
I look forward to working with you.

864
00:52:27,862 --> 00:52:28,902
Commissioner Nam!

865
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:32,942
What brings you here, Dr. Cha?

866
00:52:33,103 --> 00:52:34,643
Did you come to congratulate me?

867
00:52:35,103 --> 00:52:36,571
You're not welcome here.

868
00:52:36,572 --> 00:52:37,813
Help me.

869
00:52:39,112 --> 00:52:41,442
- Please leave us for a moment. - Yes, sir.

870
00:52:42,982 --> 00:52:44,552
- Why? - I've been entrapped...

871
00:52:44,553 --> 00:52:45,813
in an investigation.

872
00:52:45,882 --> 00:52:48,623
- What? - More specifically, by a reporter.

873
00:52:48,953 --> 00:52:51,422
I made a false pregnancy certificate for someone,

874
00:52:51,692 --> 00:52:53,892
and someone at a broadcasting station found out.

875
00:52:53,893 --> 00:52:54,962
Are you crazy?

876
00:52:55,522 --> 00:52:57,732
You violated medical law on top of committing murder?

877
00:52:57,993 --> 00:52:59,802
You're a very impressive woman.

878
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:01,501
That's why I'm asking for help.

879
00:53:01,502 --> 00:53:03,771
I heard you were going to be Seoul Police Commissioner soon.

880
00:53:03,772 --> 00:53:05,332
Ms. Geum isn't answering the phone.

881
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,702
You're the only one who can save me right now.

882
00:53:07,703 --> 00:53:09,813
Who are you? Do you know me?

883
00:53:10,473 --> 00:53:11,941
I'm very busy right now.

884
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:13,142
I need to receive my certificate of appointment.

885
00:53:13,143 --> 00:53:15,042
I don't have time to waste with you.

886
00:53:15,382 --> 00:53:16,513
If you don't help me,

887
00:53:16,752 --> 00:53:18,712
I'm going to tell everyone you're a druggie.

888
00:53:19,313 --> 00:53:20,622
Be quiet.

889
00:53:20,623 --> 00:53:22,623
Keep this peddler out of here.

890
00:53:23,353 --> 00:53:26,791
Wait. Pull some strings so I don't get on the news.

891
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:29,022
Power is something you should use while you have it.

892
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:31,663
Hello. Who might you be?

893
00:53:32,092 --> 00:53:33,163
We're from the prosecutor's office.

894
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,402
Please excuse us for a moment.

895
00:53:37,203 --> 00:53:38,203
Okay.

896
00:53:39,572 --> 00:53:40,973
What are you doing?

897
00:53:41,172 --> 00:53:42,571
What do you think you're doing?

898
00:53:42,572 --> 00:53:44,211
What are you doing?

899
00:53:44,212 --> 00:53:45,272
How dare you...

900
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:46,643
- I found it. - Wait.

901
00:53:49,013 --> 00:53:50,053
That's not mine.

902
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,112
I don't know what that is.

903
00:53:53,723 --> 00:53:57,353
I told you it wasn't mine.

904
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:04,393
Sorry, sir.

905
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:11,803
Hey. Why haven't you found her yet, you...

906
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:18,873
Do whatever you can to figure out where Erica is.

907
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:21,982
Hello.

908
00:54:22,513 --> 00:54:24,853
What brings you here? We didn't have an appointment.

909
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:27,583
I wanted to see you.

910
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:32,092
It must've been so tough...

911
00:54:33,123 --> 00:54:35,862
lying to your actors...

912
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:38,263
and stealing their pay.

913
00:54:39,493 --> 00:54:40,732
Stealing?

914
00:54:43,603 --> 00:54:45,973
How much did you steal with dual contracts?

915
00:54:46,373 --> 00:54:49,202
Did you buy Taebaek's building with the money you stole from us?

916
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,243
This...

917
00:54:50,612 --> 00:54:52,243
What? Are you scared?

918
00:54:53,413 --> 00:54:55,413
All 60 actors under your agency...

919
00:54:55,612 --> 00:54:57,782
are going to hire the best lawyer from the best law firm...

920
00:54:57,783 --> 00:54:59,083
and sue you.

921
00:54:59,313 --> 00:55:00,982
We'll cancel our contracts, of course.

922
00:55:05,822 --> 00:55:07,493
All 60 of us.

923
00:55:07,623 --> 00:55:09,462
Hey. Hong Ju.

924
00:55:09,792 --> 00:55:11,131
This is a misunderstanding.

925
00:55:11,132 --> 00:55:12,132
Hey.

926
00:55:12,133 --> 00:55:13,402
Misunderstanding, my foot.

927
00:55:13,862 --> 00:55:16,703
The amount we have yet to get paid is no less than 30 million.

928
00:55:17,033 --> 00:55:18,533
My money alone is 5 million.

929
00:55:20,842 --> 00:55:22,502
Give me my money right now.

930
00:55:23,002 --> 00:55:24,212
If not,

931
00:55:25,143 --> 00:55:26,373
you're going to prison.

932
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:28,342
You'll be ruined forever.

933
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:36,652
You know I'm crazy, right?

934
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,752
I'm no longer human.

935
00:55:39,922 --> 00:55:41,021
What are you doing?

936
00:55:41,022 --> 00:55:43,232
You should get off your butt and run out to make money.

937
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:47,433
Hurry up!

938
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:51,571
Hurry up.

939
00:55:51,572 --> 00:55:53,902
Hurry up.

940
00:55:56,002 --> 00:55:57,042
Maybe...

941
00:55:57,143 --> 00:55:58,572
you should sell your vineyard.

942
00:56:01,482 --> 00:56:04,052
Hurry up.

943
00:56:04,053 --> 00:56:06,013
How did she find out about my secret contracts?

944
00:56:07,953 --> 00:56:08,982
Wait...

945
00:56:18,263 --> 00:56:19,902
Who knew about this?

946
00:56:22,862 --> 00:56:24,172
Was it really Lee Hwi So?

947
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,402
Min Do Hyuk.

948
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:33,612
Darn it!

949
00:56:33,743 --> 00:56:35,442
Hey, Do Hyuk. Where are you?

950
00:56:35,913 --> 00:56:37,352
I have something urgent to do.

951
00:56:37,353 --> 00:56:39,783
Can you find out where I can get 30 million dollars right now?

952
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:41,982
I'm about to lose everything!

953
00:56:42,652 --> 00:56:43,822
Gosh, but...

954
00:56:44,092 --> 00:56:47,022
I'm out right now meeting a client.

955
00:56:47,092 --> 00:56:49,263
I don't know why I'm so busy today.

956
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:51,131
Lee Hwi So got into my safe,

957
00:56:51,132 --> 00:56:53,333
and my actors found out I got paid extra under the table.

958
00:56:53,462 --> 00:56:55,962
Of all people, Ryu Hong Ju found out, and I'm in trouble!

959
00:56:56,132 --> 00:56:58,032
You know what kind of person she is.

960
00:56:58,033 --> 00:57:00,342
Why did you play games with her money?

961
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,312
I guess...

962
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:05,242
the first thing we need to do is shut her up.

963
00:57:05,243 --> 00:57:06,711
If news breaks about this,

964
00:57:06,712 --> 00:57:09,083
I'm positive Matthew will turn his back on us too.

965
00:57:09,382 --> 00:57:11,413
Do Hyuk. I...

966
00:57:11,513 --> 00:57:14,082
gave Matthew 40 million dollars in shares.

967
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:16,152
If I get that money, I can pay them back right away.

968
00:57:16,623 --> 00:57:19,822
I'll look into someone who can loan us that money quickly.

969
00:57:21,893 --> 00:57:23,662
Oh, you're here. Goodness.

970
00:57:23,663 --> 00:57:24,763
Welcome.

971
00:57:26,232 --> 00:57:27,433
Mone, why...

972
00:57:28,402 --> 00:57:29,563
did you want to see me?

973
00:57:30,632 --> 00:57:33,502
You said you do anything as long as you're paid. Right?

974
00:57:33,873 --> 00:57:34,973
Right.

975
00:57:35,772 --> 00:57:37,172
Can you hire someone for me?

976
00:57:37,243 --> 00:57:38,542
A woman in her 50s.

977
00:57:39,643 --> 00:57:41,382
Someone who's elegant, luxurious,

978
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,413
and fluent in English, German, and French.

979
00:57:43,953 --> 00:57:45,183
Can you do it?

980
00:57:45,313 --> 00:57:46,513
When do you need her by?

981
00:57:47,283 --> 00:57:48,752
As soon as possible.

982
00:57:49,922 --> 00:57:51,123
Hurry.

983
00:57:51,353 --> 00:57:53,263

(Prosecution Service)

985
00:58:13,172 --> 00:58:14,513
Stay alert, Nam Chul Woo.

986
00:58:14,882 --> 00:58:15,982
That's right.

987
00:58:18,353 --> 00:58:19,982
Think.

988
00:58:25,092 --> 00:58:26,252
Right.

989
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:30,933
There's only one person...

990
00:58:31,632 --> 00:58:33,163
who can cover this up.

991
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,533
Your nomination has been cancelled.

992
00:58:41,342 --> 00:58:43,313
The nominee for commissioner of Seoul Police Agency...

993
00:58:43,712 --> 00:58:45,842
is a drug addict...

994
00:58:46,683 --> 00:58:48,012
The police's position...

995
00:58:48,013 --> 00:58:49,882
is at serious risk.

996
00:58:49,913 --> 00:58:54,083
If you go after me, the prosecution will collapse first.

997
00:58:54,853 --> 00:58:55,953
Is that okay?

998
00:58:56,123 --> 00:58:57,322
What do you mean?

999
00:58:58,123 --> 00:59:00,623
The cat and the mouse are on the same team.

1000
00:59:01,362 --> 00:59:03,291
In other words, the thief and the one going after the thief...

1001
00:59:03,292 --> 00:59:04,993
are on the same team.

1002
00:59:06,033 --> 00:59:07,402
Can you step out for a second?

1003
00:59:16,643 --> 00:59:17,973
Who's the one...

1004
00:59:19,342 --> 00:59:20,513
going after the thief?

1005
00:59:22,482 --> 00:59:23,652
If I tell you,

1006
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:25,413
will you let me go?

(Suspect Interrogation Protocol)

1008
00:59:32,723 --> 00:59:34,092
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Jo Dong Hee.

1009
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:37,533
What are you trying to achieve by blowing this up?

1010
00:59:38,192 --> 00:59:40,862
I get that you want to use me as the steps on your way up,

1011
00:59:40,962 --> 00:59:42,332
but if you get too greedy,

1012
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,902
you'll end up worse off.

1013
00:59:44,072 --> 00:59:47,172
Let's see how much longer you can stand proud, Sir.

Don't lay a hand on me.

1017
00:59:54,783 --> 00:59:55,942
Listen here, Deputy Chief Prosecutor Jo.

1018
00:59:56,212 --> 00:59:57,782
Will you take responsibility for this?

1019
00:59:57,783 --> 00:59:59,083
You're making a mistake.

1020
01:00:00,482 --> 01:00:02,522
Nam Chul Woo told me everything.

1021
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:04,723
He's just the dealer,

1022
01:00:05,192 --> 01:00:07,522
and the one who buys from him...

1023
01:00:07,893 --> 01:00:08,961
is you.

1024
01:00:08,962 --> 01:00:10,861
That's a lie. I'm innocent.

1025
01:00:10,862 --> 01:00:11,961
I've never done that!

1026
01:00:11,962 --> 01:00:13,333
What are you doing? Escort him out.

1027
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:15,232
Let go. I said, let go of me!

1028
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,333
Hey! What are you doing?

1029
01:00:17,703 --> 01:00:18,833
Let go of me, you punk!

1030
01:00:19,772 --> 01:00:21,172
Let go!

1031
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:22,502
Let go of me!

1032
01:00:23,572 --> 01:00:24,913
Ji Man...

1033
01:00:25,643 --> 01:00:27,583
What year did he join the organization?

1034
01:00:41,962 --> 01:00:44,192
Hey. I need you to fix this.

1035
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:46,092
Nam Chul Woo ratted me out.

1036
01:00:46,632 --> 01:00:49,263
Oh, dear. See?

1037
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:52,572
Why did you get involved with trash like Nam Chul Woo?

1038
01:00:53,203 --> 01:00:54,772
You should watch who you make friends with.

1039
01:00:55,272 --> 01:00:57,243
I don't have time for this.

1040
01:00:57,513 --> 01:01:00,612
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Jo will see this through until the end.

1041
01:01:01,112 --> 01:01:02,981
If the Prosecutor General's office gets searched,

1042
01:01:02,982 --> 01:01:05,711
Lee Hwi So's case might come out into the open. Then...

1043
01:01:05,712 --> 01:01:07,052
you'll be in trouble too.

1044
01:01:07,053 --> 01:01:10,422
Relax.

1045
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,053
It's not like you to get so scared.

1046
01:01:13,763 --> 01:01:14,993
It's so pathetic.

1047
01:01:15,192 --> 01:01:16,322
Pathetic?

1048
01:01:18,163 --> 01:01:20,732
Don't you know what I did for you?

1049
01:01:21,033 --> 01:01:22,703
I told you not to worry.

1050
01:01:23,402 --> 01:01:25,303
Nam Chul Woo will be released soon.

1051
01:01:25,502 --> 01:01:26,632
You know...

1052
01:01:26,902 --> 01:01:28,873
It's my virtue to let the pawns live.

1053
01:01:30,112 --> 01:01:32,813
In return, I need you...

1054
01:01:33,313 --> 01:01:34,612
to take on the trouble.

1055
01:01:35,482 --> 01:01:37,252
Are you telling me to take the fall?

1056
01:01:37,413 --> 01:01:38,513
Hey.

1057
01:01:44,652 --> 01:01:46,122
I don't think...

1058
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:48,862
you should do this to me.

1059
01:01:50,732 --> 01:01:53,132
Yang Jin Mo told me something very interesting,

1060
01:01:53,663 --> 01:01:55,803
That you care a lot about Min Do Hyuk.

1061
01:01:57,002 --> 01:01:58,703
So I did some research...

1062
01:01:58,732 --> 01:02:01,902
to find out why you're so intent on killing a thug like him.

1063
01:02:04,813 --> 01:02:05,942
And?

1064
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:07,612
Did you find something out?

1065
01:02:08,313 --> 01:02:10,313
I've always known...

1066
01:02:10,913 --> 01:02:13,583
that you're not Chairman Sim's biological son.

1067
01:02:15,252 --> 01:02:16,353
But...

1068
01:02:17,592 --> 01:02:19,292
I had no idea...

1069
01:02:21,422 --> 01:02:22,862
that the chairman's son...

1070
01:02:23,632 --> 01:02:24,862
was still alive.

1071
01:02:26,862 --> 01:02:28,002
K.

1072
01:02:29,033 --> 01:02:30,873
I believe that you'll help me.

1073
01:02:31,732 --> 01:02:32,833
That way...

1074
01:02:33,643 --> 01:02:35,203
our friendship will last forever.

1075
01:02:36,272 --> 01:02:37,342
Right?

1076
01:03:07,803 --> 01:03:09,841
Gosh, my daughter is so pretty today.

1077
01:03:09,842 --> 01:03:11,012
- Cheers! - Have you been well?

1078
01:03:11,013 --> 01:03:12,013
Yes.

1079
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:14,283
I'm a huge fan.

1080
01:03:14,942 --> 01:03:16,112
Thank you.

1081
01:03:16,743 --> 01:03:18,651
I took the vitamins you sent me...

1082
01:03:18,652 --> 01:03:20,453
- and gained energy to shoot. - Really?

1083
01:03:20,482 --> 01:03:22,953
- You got even prettier. Goodness. - My gosh.

1084
01:03:34,163 --> 01:03:35,232
You're getting a call.

1085
01:03:35,533 --> 01:03:36,663
Excuse me.

1086
01:03:38,433 --> 01:03:39,672
You're so busy.

1087
01:03:39,902 --> 01:03:41,041
Hello?

1088
01:03:41,042 --> 01:03:42,172
Yes, it's me.

1089
01:03:42,873 --> 01:03:44,143
Hey, Louise.

1090
01:03:44,442 --> 01:03:45,872
How have you been? Good?

1091
01:03:45,873 --> 01:03:48,442
I was behind in my studies after living abroad for a long time.

1092
01:03:49,013 --> 01:03:51,251
I wanted my classmates to be comfortable around me,

1093
01:03:51,252 --> 01:03:52,882
so I didn't tell them how old I was.

1094
01:03:53,623 --> 01:03:55,123
But that lasted until now.

1095
01:03:55,953 --> 01:03:57,022
I'm sorry.

1096
01:03:57,152 --> 01:03:59,722
In return, let me introduce you to my mother.

1097
01:03:59,723 --> 01:04:01,421
(Her mother's so pretty. You look so happy!)

(Prosecution Office)

1099
01:04:09,002 --> 01:04:10,033
What happened?

1100
01:04:12,402 --> 01:04:13,772
This is from K.

1101
01:04:14,243 --> 01:04:15,272
Really?

1102
01:04:18,143 --> 01:04:19,212
This is...

1103
01:04:23,752 --> 01:04:26,453
He wants to get rid of me and bury everything else?

1104
01:04:27,453 --> 01:04:28,583
Who said I'd allow that?

1105
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:29,982
That won't happen.

1106
01:04:30,183 --> 01:04:32,123
K can make the impossible happen.

1107
01:04:32,292 --> 01:04:34,223
I'm going to kill K.

1108
01:04:34,362 --> 01:04:36,163
I'm going to kill everyone!

1109
01:04:44,033 --> 01:04:45,803
For the sake of your eternal friendship.

1110
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,172
Cheers.

1111
01:05:22,473 --> 01:05:24,712
It's 2.5 million each, and a total of 10 million.

1112
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:26,342
Go ahead and check.

1113
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,612
As promised, get me 20 million by tomorrow.

1114
01:05:31,212 --> 01:05:33,612
I'm taking Cherry Entertainment's business as collateral.

1115
01:05:35,353 --> 01:05:38,552
What kind of nonsense is that? Min Do Hyuk never mentioned that.

1116
01:05:38,553 --> 01:05:40,563
Why do you need collateral for three percent interest?

1117
01:05:42,692 --> 01:05:43,692
Think about it.

1118
01:05:43,693 --> 01:05:46,163
Who wouldn't take collateral on a 30 million dollar loan?

1119
01:05:48,763 --> 01:05:50,203
If you don't want that, forget it.

1120
01:05:50,933 --> 01:05:52,232
Okay.

1121
01:05:54,542 --> 01:05:56,272
Don't try to play games.

1122
01:05:57,042 --> 01:05:58,842
I'll pay you back in a month.

I'll be able to reclaim Taebaek's building soon.

Are you up?

1134
01:07:39,272 --> 01:07:40,342
What happened?

1135
01:07:41,342 --> 01:07:42,413
Where's Lee Hwi So?

1136
01:07:43,013 --> 01:07:44,112
I believe you met him.

1137
01:07:47,252 --> 01:07:49,083
Was that really Lee Hwi So?

1138
01:07:50,283 --> 01:07:52,421
Was the dock worker Lee Hwi So?

1139
01:07:52,422 --> 01:07:53,522
Answer me.

1140
01:07:54,163 --> 01:07:55,262
It's true.

1141
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,961
Someone else killed Da Mi.

1142
01:07:56,962 --> 01:07:58,132
We already know.

1143
01:07:58,933 --> 01:08:01,302
But that doesn't change the fact that you guys are assailants too.

1144
01:08:01,303 --> 01:08:02,303
I...

1145
01:08:03,563 --> 01:08:05,672
I didn't want her to die either.

1146
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:07,442
That girl...

1147
01:08:09,243 --> 01:08:10,473
was my daughter.

1148
01:08:10,842 --> 01:08:12,012
Even if I didn't raise her,

1149
01:08:12,013 --> 01:08:14,242
I was the one who gave birth to her!

1150
01:08:14,243 --> 01:08:15,982
Then tell the world...

1151
01:08:16,882 --> 01:08:18,652
who killed Da Mi.

1152
01:08:19,582 --> 01:08:20,752
I can't.

1153
01:08:21,582 --> 01:08:23,082
If I do, I'll die.

1154
01:08:23,653 --> 01:08:25,622
Is your life still more important?

1155
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:26,823
It is.

1156
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:30,733
So much so that it drives me crazy!

1157
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:32,933
It's important.

1158
01:08:36,632 --> 01:08:39,273
If I was going to die like this, I would've already died.

1159
01:08:41,002 --> 01:08:42,671
Even when living was harder than dying,

1160
01:08:42,672 --> 01:08:44,342
I gritted my teeth and endured it all.

1161
01:08:45,212 --> 01:08:46,813
In order to become rich.

1162
01:08:47,483 --> 01:08:49,443
In order to be successful for the world to see!

1163
01:08:51,683 --> 01:08:54,422
I'm allowed to be happy for once.

1164
01:08:56,523 --> 01:08:58,823
That doesn't excuse your crimes.

1165
01:09:01,422 --> 01:09:02,763
Listen to me carefully.

1166
01:09:04,332 --> 01:09:08,032
I won't fall apart like this.

1167
01:09:28,023 --> 01:09:29,223
What are you saying?

1168
01:09:29,382 --> 01:09:31,023
Then that rumour was true?

1169
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,291
There are only two people who know the truth...

1170
01:09:33,292 --> 01:09:35,091
about my private life.

1171
01:09:35,092 --> 01:09:36,622
K and Geum La Hui.

1172
01:09:37,492 --> 01:09:38,791
If it wasn't Ms. Geum,

1173
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:41,233
then there's no way information about my mom could get leaked.

1174
01:09:41,603 --> 01:09:43,233
Are you suspecting Ms. Geum?

1175
01:09:44,002 --> 01:09:45,903
I couldn't reach her all day today.

1176
01:09:46,233 --> 01:09:47,872
What do you think this means?

1177
01:09:48,103 --> 01:09:50,102
I thought it was weird that her phone was off, but...

1178
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,372
There's no way that it was her! You're so dumb.

1179
01:09:52,643 --> 01:09:55,682
What if Ms. Geum was on the same side as Lee Hwi So?

1180
01:09:55,683 --> 01:09:56,982
Does that make sense?

1181
01:09:56,983 --> 01:09:58,812
There's no reason for that.

1182
01:09:58,813 --> 01:10:00,823
Stop talking nonsense.

1183
01:10:06,422 --> 01:10:07,563
There is a reason.

1184
01:10:09,592 --> 01:10:12,632
Bang Da Mi is Ms. Geum's biological daughter.

1185
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,502
What?

1186
01:10:20,502 --> 01:10:21,702
Played around?

1187
01:10:22,242 --> 01:10:23,942
Someone died.

1188
01:10:23,943 --> 01:10:25,642
She was only 18 years old!

1189
01:10:25,643 --> 01:10:27,581
So what do you want me to do about it?

1190
01:10:27,582 --> 01:10:29,582
Is Bang Da Mi your daughter or something?

1191
01:10:32,282 --> 01:10:34,353
Is that why her face...

1192
01:10:36,653 --> 01:10:38,722
Thinking about it, the only person who knows about my secret ledger...

1193
01:10:38,723 --> 01:10:39,823
is Ms. Geum.

1194
01:10:42,792 --> 01:10:43,823
The loan documents...

1195
01:10:44,693 --> 01:10:45,763
Move.

(Loan Transaction Agreement)

1197
01:10:53,303 --> 01:10:56,303
Creditor... Kang Ki Tak?

1198
01:11:00,013 --> 01:11:03,113
I will return to take back Taebaek.

1199
01:11:04,053 --> 01:11:06,513
Watch it for me until then.

1200
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:11,922
These punks dared to go after my building?

1201
01:11:12,653 --> 01:11:14,522
Where's Geum La Hui right now?

1202
01:11:14,523 --> 01:11:15,692
What's wrong?

1203
01:11:15,693 --> 01:11:17,661
Did you get stabbed in the back too?

1204
01:11:17,662 --> 01:11:20,092
Kang Ki Tak and Geum La Hui used to be in a relationship.

1205
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,362
The two of them planned to fool us together!

1206
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:23,962
Those little punks!

1207
01:11:24,473 --> 01:11:27,172
Darn it!

1208
01:11:28,103 --> 01:11:29,443
Darn it!

1209
01:11:38,013 --> 01:11:42,223
Hey. We were waiting for you, Geum La Hui.

1210
01:11:43,952 --> 01:11:45,422
Why are you all here?

1211
01:11:45,823 --> 01:11:48,893
What about you? Where have you been all this time?

1212
01:11:52,693 --> 01:11:54,362
I was with Kang Ki Tak.

1213
01:11:54,363 --> 01:11:55,702
Are you confessing?

1214
01:11:56,032 --> 01:11:58,433
That you're on the same side as Lee Hwi So and Kang Ki Tak?

1215
01:11:58,733 --> 01:11:59,773
What do you mean?

1216
01:12:00,433 --> 01:12:02,573
I was taken by Kang Ki Tak and trapped all day.

1217
01:12:03,603 --> 01:12:04,912
I saw Lee Hwi So too.

1218
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:07,342
It was him. The dock worker.

1219
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,983
Gosh, I guess you're really flustered.

1220
01:12:11,252 --> 01:12:13,013
Why did you hide...

1221
01:12:13,752 --> 01:12:15,782
that you were Bang Da Mi's biological mother?

1222
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:19,323
It wasn't me.

1223
01:12:19,723 --> 01:12:22,492
Mr. Yang already knew when he came here.

1224
01:12:24,193 --> 01:12:26,032
You were behind all of this. Right?

1225
01:12:26,193 --> 01:12:27,602
I got fired from the school,

1226
01:12:27,603 --> 01:12:29,403
and my kids went missing.

1227
01:12:29,603 --> 01:12:31,933
I still can't reach them!

1228
01:12:32,832 --> 01:12:34,642
I was expelled from my position as commissioner.

1229
01:12:34,643 --> 01:12:36,303
You didn't do it. Right?

1230
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:38,741
I said it couldn't have been you,

1231
01:12:38,742 --> 01:12:40,613
but everyone is suspicious of you.

1232
01:12:43,412 --> 01:12:45,653
Did you know that my past was revealed today?

1233
01:12:47,053 --> 01:12:48,922
My age, my family...

1234
01:12:49,952 --> 01:12:52,052
You're the only one who knows those secrets.

1235
01:12:52,053 --> 01:12:53,422
Are you saying it's my fault?

1236
01:12:56,922 --> 01:12:59,692
Kang Ki Tak took my phone, so I had no idea.

1237
01:12:59,693 --> 01:13:01,763
I was trapped in the vacation home, and I collapsed.

1238
01:13:03,763 --> 01:13:04,832
Look.

1239
01:13:04,973 --> 01:13:06,831
Lee Hwi So did this to me.

1240
01:13:06,832 --> 01:13:08,803
Lies!

1241
01:13:09,202 --> 01:13:10,671
I was running around all day...

1242
01:13:10,672 --> 01:13:12,573
living a nightmare trying to explain,

1243
01:13:13,813 --> 01:13:15,411
but my CEO was at a vacation home...

1244
01:13:15,412 --> 01:13:17,112
with her ex-boyfriend enjoying her time.

1245
01:13:17,113 --> 01:13:18,482
All this time, I thought it was weird...

1246
01:13:18,483 --> 01:13:21,823
how Lee Hwi So knew everything about our whereabouts.

1247
01:13:22,223 --> 01:13:25,153
It was like he was keeping an eye on us in close proximity.

1248
01:13:25,292 --> 01:13:27,023
You're Lee Hwi So's accomplice. Right?

1249
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:28,863
Where are my kids?

1250
01:13:29,462 --> 01:13:30,523
It's not me.

1251
01:13:31,563 --> 01:13:33,492
Is that all you can come up with?

1252
01:13:33,733 --> 01:13:35,201
You're so pathetic.

1253
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:36,332
Tell me.

1254
01:13:36,832 --> 01:13:39,303
Why did you make me live in your dead daughter's room?

1255
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:42,842
You used to mock me every time I had a nightmare!

1256
01:13:43,542 --> 01:13:45,012
Is this your revenge for your daughter?

1257
01:13:45,013 --> 01:13:47,342
This is so frustrating.

1258
01:13:47,473 --> 01:13:49,012
Geum La Hui...

1259
01:13:49,013 --> 01:13:51,881
isn't the type to seek revenge for her daughter.

1260
01:13:51,882 --> 01:13:54,081
I'm telling you that she's the type of woman...

1261
01:13:54,082 --> 01:13:56,081
who's far off from having any type of motherly instinct.

1262
01:13:56,082 --> 01:13:57,482
Can you stay out of it?

1263
01:13:57,483 --> 01:13:59,192
We're interrogating her right now.

1264
01:13:59,193 --> 01:14:00,751
You were fired as commissioner.

1265
01:14:00,752 --> 01:14:02,522
How dare you act like a cop here.

1266
01:14:02,523 --> 01:14:03,992
Listen here, lady!

1267
01:14:05,063 --> 01:14:06,292
Lady?

1268
01:14:07,233 --> 01:14:08,303
What?

1269
01:14:10,263 --> 01:14:11,733
You're the one who chose that room.

1270
01:14:12,132 --> 01:14:14,573
You're also the one who insisted on living with me.

1271
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,171
We all lost something today.

1272
01:14:17,172 --> 01:14:18,943
No, we lost everything!

1273
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:22,382
But what did you lose today?

1274
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:26,153
Hey. How long have you been working with Lee Hwi So?

1275
01:14:26,282 --> 01:14:27,312
From the beginning?

1276
01:14:27,313 --> 01:14:29,022
Or did you betray us in the middle?

1277
01:14:29,023 --> 01:14:30,991
I had no idea that Bang Da Mi's biological mother...

1278
01:14:30,992 --> 01:14:32,492
and her adoptive father would work together!

1279
01:14:35,263 --> 01:14:37,592
Lee Hwi So would never work with me.

1280
01:14:37,962 --> 01:14:39,332
What do you mean by that?

1281
01:14:39,492 --> 01:14:41,332
Lee Hwi So knows everything.

1282
01:14:41,763 --> 01:14:43,402
He knows that I was after Chairman Bang's money...

1283
01:14:43,403 --> 01:14:44,973
when I took Da Mi back as my daughter.

1284
01:14:45,332 --> 01:14:47,433
You're right! That's the kind of woman I am.

1285
01:14:48,143 --> 01:14:51,212
I knew Da Mi wasn't pregnant, but I turned a blind eye to it.

1286
01:14:52,073 --> 01:14:53,512
I was afraid people would find out I was her mom,

1287
01:14:53,513 --> 01:14:55,212
so I purposely joined forces with Mone.

1288
01:14:55,943 --> 01:14:59,183
I abandoned my biological daughter...

1289
01:14:59,983 --> 01:15:01,553
and left her to die.

1290
01:15:04,853 --> 01:15:06,452
Do you still not believe me?

1291
01:15:20,473 --> 01:15:21,643
I can prove that.

1292
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:26,013
Geum La Hui is not working with Lee Hwi So.

1293
01:15:27,712 --> 01:15:28,912
How did you...

1294
01:15:30,342 --> 01:15:31,882
I came to keep my promise.

1295
01:15:32,712 --> 01:15:34,683
Lee Hwi So, the man you were all so desperate to find...

1296
01:15:35,252 --> 01:15:36,322
I found him.

1297
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,952
What? You found him?

1298
01:15:38,223 --> 01:15:39,353
Where is he?

1299
01:15:39,622 --> 01:15:41,863
He's here, right now.

1300
01:15:43,823 --> 01:15:45,763
I am Lee Hwi So.

1301
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:01,582
What the...

1302
01:16:39,813 --> 01:16:43,852
(The Escape of the Seven)

1303
01:16:43,853 --> 01:16:46,292
Are you ready to fight with Sungchan Group?

1304
01:16:46,553 --> 01:16:49,322
I plan to use you guys as my pawns to fight K.

1305
01:16:49,323 --> 01:16:51,762
You can just call me Monk Nam.

1306
01:16:51,763 --> 01:16:53,991
The title of this movie is "To D."

1307
01:16:53,992 --> 01:16:55,433
I need to meet K.

1308
01:16:55,702 --> 01:16:57,461
I'm going to ask him to kill Lee Hwi So.

1309
01:16:57,462 --> 01:17:00,171
If you keep acting up, I'll only do worse things.

1310
01:17:00,172 --> 01:17:02,073
Why did you kill my family?

1311
01:17:03,742 --> 01:17:04,911
How dare the likes of you...

1312
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,911
This is the last way for a father to seek atonement...

1313
01:17:06,912 --> 01:17:08,313
for failing to protect his daughter!
