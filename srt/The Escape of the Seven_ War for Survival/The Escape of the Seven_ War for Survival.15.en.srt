16

What's the point of getting into a science high school?

17

You're an idiot who can't even place in the top ten.

18
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,030
I'll study harder from now on.

19

23

I really don't want to go.

24
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,780
I want to stay here with you and Mother.

25
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,350
If I say to go, just go.

How dare you act like a baby when you're just a fake.

27
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,630
Fake.

28

If...

30
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,840
you didn't abandon me emotionally that day,

31
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,449
would my life have turned out differently,

32
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,810

33

Gosh.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,210
That punk...

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,639
is my father's real son?

39
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,639
That loser?

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,079
Hey. You're here.

41
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,389
What did you find out?

42
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,049
Why are you looking into Min Do Hyuk?

43
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,419
Just answer my question!

44
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,759
He's the best fighter in our school.

45
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,189
He beat everyone in the schools in the area,

46
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,500
and there are rumours that he got scouted by a gangster.

47
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,500
You're telling me he's nothing more than a thug?

48
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:20,470
That's true,

49
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,470
but he's pretty crazy.

50
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,370
He sells his test answers.

51
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:27,709
He sells the answers to the kid who's first in the class,

52
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,840
and he helps pay for his brother's academy with that money.

53
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,150
He sleeps all day in school,

54
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,519
but I have no idea when he studies.

55
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,350
It's unbelievable.

56
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,948
He's good at fighting, and he's good at school.

57
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:41,018
He's a true genius.

58
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:42,859
Especially when it comes to maths or physics...

59
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,190
Stop talking, you punk.

60
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,630
Get lost, you punk.

61
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,769
Bye.

62
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,280
Hello, Mr. Gu.

63
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,989
For the Physics Olympiad being held next month, get Min Do Hyuk...

64
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,060
to be my stand-in.

65
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,160
I want to find out how good he is myself.

66
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,399
- Put this on. - You're dressed lighter than me.

67
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,829
- No, put it on. - You should wear it.

68
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,030
- Goodness. - Try it on.

69
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,438
Goodness.

70
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,140
- Do you like it? - It looks good.

71
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,038
- I got your favourite on my way. - What is it?

72
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,580
Goodness, I can't believe it.

73
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:35,410
Isn't it good?

74
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,410
What else?

75
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,849
Gosh, Mom!

76
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,978

77
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,220
and eat something delicious. Okay?

78

86
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,169
I'm going to get rid of him.

87
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,010

88
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,179

00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,289

91
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,999
you wanted to meet me.

92
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,030
We're finally meeting.

93
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:09,840
Why...

94
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,739
are you attacking me, no, Sungchan Group?

95
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,479
The reason is something...

96
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,619
that you have to figure out yourself.

97
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,820
Is it related to that girl, Bang Da Mi?

98
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,359
You want revenge for that girl?

99
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,559
You're getting close.

100
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:40,128
The girl's biological father's dead, and so is her adoptive father.

101

She doesn't have much family besides them.

gotten old?

107
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,249
Have we met before?

108
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,428
I knew it. Nobody knows anything before I tell them.

109
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:07,160
But they all act so smart.

110
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,299
What are you playing at right now?

111
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,479
Let me give you a word of advice.

112
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,478
Do you know...

113
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,249
how to tell the difference between an angel and a demon?

114
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,379
You have to shoot them both.

115
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,890
Bang!

116
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,289
Bang!

117
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,989
When you get confused as to which is the angel and which is the demon,

118
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,830
there's no other method that's as certain as that.

119
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:46,129
Father! Do you remember what happened that day?

120
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,939
Were you at the Sungchan Gallery 20th anniversary party?

121
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,439
You...

122
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,210
Who on earth are you?

123
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,580
Good question.

127
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,239

We're ruined!

No.

These are my personal belongings.

144
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,399
I used my own money to purchase them in New York!

145
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,029
This is a subpoena.

146
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,269
You're under investigation too, Director Sim Mi Young.

147
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,570

148

But they'll find out once they analyse them.

157
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,129
I ran out of time, so I did a bad job on some of them.

158
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,540
Then does that mean we'll get caught for stealing the real paintings?

I'm for it. All for it.

163

00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,330
Have fun.

186
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,340
Thank you.

187
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,909
She's so annoying.

188
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,279
(Do not enter)

189
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:09,729
Min Do Hyuk. Give up now.

190
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:14,970
Let's go.

191
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,009
Min Do Hyuk! Over here!

192
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,979
What the... Hey!

193
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,489
What the...

194
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,290
Stop right there!

195
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,670
Hurry up!

196
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,039
Block the exits!

197
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,310
Hurry up!

198
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,979
What's going on?

199
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,720
Han Mone helped Min Do Hyuk?

200
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:05,450
Yes, sir.

201
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,489
Seriously?

202
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,960
I should've killed that brat with Bang Da Mi five years ago.

203
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,728
If I did, then Yang Jin Mo...

204
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:16,159
wouldn't have wasted his time and kept her daughter alive.

205
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,399
And Father?

206
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,700
Pardon?

207
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,170
Who do you mean?

208
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,080
What's gotten into you, Mr. Gu?

209
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:34,319
Just because I called you Father once,

210
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,149
do you think you're really my father?

211
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,749
No, sir.

212
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,858
Chairman Sim had a cardiac episode,

213
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:42,190
so he's recovering right now.

214
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,028
I'll look for Min Do Hyuk first.

215
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,460
No, just leave him be.

216
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,659
He's nothing more than a sitting duck right now.

217
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,570
The only person Min Do Hyuk can go to right now...

218
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,999
is me, Matthew.

219
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:00,408
Is it true that Min Do Hyuk ran away?

220
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,879
I'm 100 percent sure!

221
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,180
I heard from Chul Woo's friend in the police.

222
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:06,778
What was Min Do Hyuk thinking doing something like that?

223
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,080
It'll only make things worse for him.

224
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,779
Because he feels wrongly charged.

225
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,519
We were going to frame him for the art thief too.

226
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:16,489
No, do you think Matthew is going to punish us again?

227
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,189
Min Do Hyuk and Matthew...

228
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,959
are closer than brothers.

229
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,498
Closer than brothers?

230
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:22,830
That's not true.

231
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,899
But what about Mone?

232
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,939
Honey!

233
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,009
- What the... - Oh, my!

234
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,080
Han Mone ran away with Min Do Hyuk.

235
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,648
- What? - Is that true?

236
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,179
The police went after Min Do Hyuk,

237
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,050
but Han Mone intercepted him.

238
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,248
The police are after the two of them.

239
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:48,519
In the worst case, we'll be connected with them!

240
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,129
Oh, no.

241
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:52,529
Han Mone...

242
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,999
Does she have a death wish or something?

243
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,599
- Are you okay? - Of course not.

244
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,999
I just helped a fugitive.

245
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,470
Did Matthew ask you to help me?

246
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,108
Where's Matthew?

247
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,779
I haven't seen Matthew since the party.

248
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:12,378
You helped me on your own?

249
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,649
Why would you help me?

250
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:17,420
From this point forward, answer my questions without lying.

251
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,350
I need confidence.

252
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,930
Did you join sides with K?

253
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,229
That question doesn't deserve an answer.

254
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,729
Don't you know what that jerk did to my family?

255
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,670
Then the woman who died at the gallery. Did you kill her?

256
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,709
I know that I'm a gangster,

257
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,180
but I'm not a thug who would go around killing just anyone.

258
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,409
Then why did you leave your post?

259
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,080
Why did you go into the gallery?

260
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,778
They said the CCTV cameras only caught footage of you.

261
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,580
If you didn't help K, why is that then?

262
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,220
I can swear on my mom and brother...

263
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,859
who passed away.

264
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:03,229
I'm so jealous of people whose moms are around.

265
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
I'll believe in you.

266
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:18,009
I believe you.

267
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:20,350
I just wanted to hear it from you.

268
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Han Mone.

269
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,649
K showed up at the gallery that night.

270
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,159
I saw him with my own two eyes.

271
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,330
You saw K?

272
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,600
He was wearing the same clothes as me.

273
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,929
That's why the CCTV cameras only got footage of me.

274
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,729
He wanted to frame me for murder.

275
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,639
It was me.

276
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,540
The person K was after.

277
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:48,279
Why would K be after you?

278
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:50,378
What's your relationship with K?

279
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,450
I don't know.

280
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,180
There's one thing I'm sure of.

281
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,149
I'm positive there's something between me and K.

282
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:00,350
Something that bothers K.

283
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:06,960
What are you going to do now?

284
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,060
The police have already seen you.

285
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,530
Don't worry about me.

286
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:15,740
I'm Han Mone. Han Mone, the expert of lying.

287
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,510
I'm going to make use of my talents.

288
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,178
I had no choice but to help you...

289
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:24,648
because you threatened to kill me,

290
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:26,109
and I barely managed to escape.

291
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,820
In return,

292
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,859
you can't lose to K.

293
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,189
I won't lose.

294
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,300
Never.

295
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,100
I have a favour.

296
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,310
Get me a gun.

297
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,019
Today, the suspect, Min Do Hyuk,

298
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,520
escaped the police station.

299
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:09,489
Han Mone helped him.

300
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,590
Mone helped him?

301
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:12,759
No way.

302
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,259
It appears that while Min Do Hyuk was a fixer,

303
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,060
he was quite active in the underworld.

304
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,969
Do you think Mone commissioned him for something?

305
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,070
Not that I know of.

306
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,638
Can we go inside and take a look?

307
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,869
That man, Min Do Hyuk,

308
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,108
is under investigation as Sim Jun Seok's pawn.

309
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,780
Then that means he's connected to my daughter's case.

310
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:35,280
Do you think I would hide a person like that in my house?

311
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:39,820
How could you lose the suspect...

312
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,590
and torment the victim's family?

313
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,399
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry about this. Goodbye.

314
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,030
Let's go.

315
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,909
(Detective, Police)

316
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,149
What was Mone thinking helping Min Do Hyuk?

317
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,050
Are they dating?

318
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,289
Geum La Hui is with Lee Hwi So, and Mone is with Min Do Hyuk.

319
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,459
Everyone's flailing around, trying to survive.

320
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:21,100
Isn't it such a relief...

321
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,060
that the police didn't come because of the paintings?

322
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,730
Did you look into the playground?

323
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:29,800
Of course, we did a thorough investigation.

324
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,469
That playground was built five years ago.

325
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:34,980
After Bang Chil Sung was officially determined dead.

326
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,840
What's more interesting...

327
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,550
is there was someone who moved in around that time.

328
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,879
It appears they spent a lot of time renovating that place.

329
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:45,688
Where is it?

330
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:48,689
The house of the old man that screwed us over.

331
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:01,859
Kang Ki Tak went missing,

332
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,399
and Min Do Hyuk became a murder suspect.

333
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,039
Geum La Hui and Cha Ju Ran...

334
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,139
even came all the way here.

335
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:13,540
Chairman Bang.

336
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,909
What should I do?

337
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,850
(TIKITAKA)

338
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,608
- Do Hyuk. What happened? - Start driving.

339
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,638
There's a place I know nearby. I'll go there.

340
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:51,849
No.

341
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,149
I'll decide where we go.

342
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,949
(Elpis Motel, Parking)

343
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,628
There could be a security camera,

344
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:07,129
so I'll wear your jacket.

345
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,760
Meet me after you park.

346
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,369
That punk.

347
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,709
(Elpis Motel, Parking)

348
00:22:33,189 --> 00:22:34,250
Do Hyuk.

349
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,719
What is he doing with the lights off?

350
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:52,810
You must've been starving all day.

351
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,240
Should I order some food?

352
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:56,379
Do you think I have an appetite at a time like this?

353
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:01,750
I know you're mad.

354
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:04,118
I tried everything to get you out,

355
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,850
but I couldn't beat the pressure from Sungchan.

356
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,560
But escaping like this is too rash.

357
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:10,718
If I had stayed in there,

358
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,459
I would have been falsely charged...

359
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,389
as the culprit.

360
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:15,858
Would I let that happen?

361
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:16,959
Don't you believe me?

362
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,929
Don't be rash.

363
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,770
If you get caught by Sungchan, you could die.

364
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:24,500
Don't worry.

365
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:27,840
I'll never die before K.

366
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,909
That's why I got some insurance.

367
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,449
Insurance?

368
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:37,919
Why would a top actress like me help Min Do Hyuk?

369
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,358
He kept threatening me on the phone, saying he'd been falsely accused...

370
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,260
and that he'd kill me if I didn't help him.

371
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:48,159
What was I supposed to do?

372
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,570
Is that all he said to you?

373
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,500
Oh, right.

374
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,340
He told me to give you this.

375
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,919
I had nothing to do with Sim Jun Seok.

376
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,550
I'll prove that he was the culprit behind the gallery incident...

377
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:14,419
and be investigated honourably after that.

378
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:15,760
Min Do Hyuk.

379
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,889
Han Mone, this rotten girl.

380
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,659
So, what is your plan?

381
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,270
I need to catch K.

382
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,299
I need to do so to prove my innocence.

383
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,570
What are you going to do?

384
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,770
How could an escapee catch K?

385
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,070
I need to think a bit on that.

386
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,979
Oh, Matthew.

387
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,639
I need cash. As much as possible.

388
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,350
Here.

389
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:55,560
Lee Hwi So.

390
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,199
Why are you doing this to me?

391
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,000
I need to know.

392
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,939
Oh, it's me.

393
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:14,109
Min Do Hyuk came to see me, as expected.

394
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,980
What an idiot.

395
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,189
Call the police right away, Mr. Gu.

396
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,689
Tell them an escapee is in this motel.

397
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:26,859
Min Do Hyuk would never know...

398
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,560
that I'm K.

399
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:56,990
Mr. Kang...

400
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,458
is getting swayed.

401
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:01,128
Ki Tak is the person who saved me from K, Matthew.

402
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:02,300
No!

403
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,669
Mr. Kang is only human. He could get greedy too.

404
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,769
It seems...

405
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,310
he was used by Sungchan...

406
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:14,879
and was killed.

407
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,280
These clothes are from Chairman Lee.

408
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,840
All of this...

409
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:49,209
was K's scheme.

410
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,350
I'm sorry,

411
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,179
Ki Tak,

412
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,990
for not trusting you.

413
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:07,790
Ki Tak.

414
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:10,560
Where are you now?

415
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:17,240
I will finish...

416
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:20,270
what you started.

417
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:22,580
And after that,

418
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,280
I will find you.

419
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,750
I will...

420
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,060
shoot K...

421
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,260
with my own hands.

422
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,779
This just came in.

423
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,510
The prosecutors investigating the Sungchan Gallery murder case...

424
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:03,179
stated all 12 famous paintings that were seized...

425
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,050
from Sungchan Gallery's VIP room were all forgeries.

426
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:08,159
With the message from the culprit found at the scene of the crime...

427
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:10,918
adding weight to the speculation that Chairman Sim was aware...

428
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,189
of Mr. Sim, the culprit's crimes, the prosecution will investigate...

429
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:16,859
keeping in mind the possibility that Chairman Sim and his son...

430
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,669
were involved in the murder of his wife five years ago.

431
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,109
The prosecution stated they would investigate as fast as possible...

432
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,109
as Chairman Sim could be charged with conspiracy to commit murder...

433
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,240
aiding and abetting murder if he had been involved.

434
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:38,689
Chairman Sim. We cannot delay any longer.

435
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,790
Sungchan stock values have been halved,

436
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:43,820
and some executives have even handed in resignation letters.

437
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,959
You must make a decision.

438
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:47,689
Please tell everyone...

439
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:51,330
that Master Jun Seok was the one who murdered your wife.

440
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,869
I cannot do that.

441
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:56,868
If Jun Seok gets arrested, that will be the end of Sungchan.

442
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,609
You could get hurt too, Chairman Sim.

443
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,080
We just need a scapegoat...

444
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,649
that can take the fall for Jun Seok.

445
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:14,790
Leak to reporters that someone used Jun Seok's name...

446
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:18,389
to do crazy things and that they also killed Bang Da Mi.

447
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:21,999
Use as much money you need to hire as many people as you can...

448
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,459
to take over every web portal and online community.

449
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:25,899
If you do that,

450
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,040
the fake culprit will become the real one by the end of the day.

451
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:32,770
Who could we use to take the fall for Master Jun Seok?

452
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,869
There is one person.

453
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:41,350
I don't know how he ended up with Jun Seok's watch,

454
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:43,350
but that watch...

455
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:45,948
will be the crucial bit of evidence...

456
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:47,919
that turns Min Do Hyuk into Jun Seok.

457
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,020
You prepare the other proof they need.

458
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,129
Yes, sir.

459
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,858
Sacrificing the likes of him...

460
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:58,330
to save Sungchan Group is no big deal.

461
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:02,340
He's an orphan.

462
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,139
What better sacrifice could there be?

463
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:17,718
(Gene Comparison Report)

464
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:19,189
(Yang Jin Mo and No Han Na)

465
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,118
(Percentage: 0 percent)

466
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:26,359
(Client 1 and Client 2 are not a biological match.)

467
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:28,730
I knew they were not related.

468
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,169
So why did Jin Mo say she was his daughter?

469
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,240
Did he dupe Matthew as well?

470
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,810
What is it?

471
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,980
There's definitely more to this.

472
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:52,948
("Dear D")

473
00:30:52,949 --> 00:30:54,590
Shall we play a fun game?

474
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,219
Let's play a fun game.

475
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:04,929
What do you want?

476
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,540
I want to borrow this.

477
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:12,010
I have an important interview today.

478
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,709
The police were here last night.

479
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,179
What were you thinking?

480
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,119
I wanted to impress Matthew.

481
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:26,149
Helping Do Hyuk is helping him.

482
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,219
I should try harder, like you,

483
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:30,619
shouldn't I?

484
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,730
You're shooting the childbirth scene today?

485
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:47,438
When the movie is released,

486
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,310
people will start to wonder what happened to the dead baby.

487
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,109
The baby you had five years ago.

488
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,850
Did it really die?

489
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,250
Are you saying I hid it?

490
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,559
I handed it to Mr. Yang as soon as it was born.

491
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,659
He told me the baby had died.

492
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,959
Ask him yourself if you want to know more.

493
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,149
Hey.

494
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,090
Hello.

495
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:36,589
Hello.

496
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,159
Where are you going so early this morning?

497
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:40,959
My mom's taking me to an indoor playground.

498
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,000
- We'll eat at a restaurant too. - You're K's daughter.

499
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:46,829
Mom, can we go now?

500
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,469
Wait, Han Na. We have a visitor.

501
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,638
You can go ahead. Don't mind me.

502
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:53,709
I'll stay and have a coffee.

503
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,580
I got a car ready.

504
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,378
You didn't have to.

505
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:01,280
The chairman gave a special order.

506
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,919
We'll head out, then.

507
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:09,719
Oh, right.

508
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,459
You can't touch the mommy horse over there.

509
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,139
The chairman said it's a rule we have to keep.

510
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:25,669
Goodbye, Ms. Dimples.

511
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:29,340
Mom, we can go now.

512
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:28,670
Lee Hwi So?

513
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,270
What's he doing here?

514
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,440
Then Matthew...

515
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,850
No way.

516
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,179
My gosh!

517
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,759
Hello?

518
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,699
Where are you?

519
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:57,759
You're not yet at work.

520
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,739
I came to yours to head into work together...

521
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,508
and decided to take a coffee break.

522
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:08,409
Enjoy your coffee, then, and come to my office.

523
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,739
We must talk.

524
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:11,339
Okay.

525
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,629
Sungchan Group announced a press conference...

526
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,940
to speak to the public at 5pm today.

527
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,968
The robbery and murder...

528
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,769
at Chairman Sim's home five years ago,

529
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,138
Bang Da Mi's murder, and then the recent gallery murder.

530
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:47,850
The focus is on what Chairman Sim has to say.

531
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,019
Prosecution deems Chairman Sim...

532
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,219
and Sim Jun Seok a flight risk...

533
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,119
Did you get what I asked for?

534
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,420
Open the glove compartment.

535
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:06,969
That card can get you anywhere in the TIKITAKA building.

536
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,670
Excluding the chairman's office, of course.

537
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,739
Kang Hyun Wook. Does he manage the server?

538
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:13,969
Yes.

539
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,739
What are you going to do?

540
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,080
I'm going to tell everyone...

541
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,810
who Matthew really is.

542
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,580
Who he really is?

543
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:24,980
Who is he really?

544
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,889
Someone you know well.

545
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,460
I must expose him before 5pm.

546
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,500
Can you grab everyone's attention so I can sneak into TIKITAKA?

547
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,610
- Hello. - Hello.

548
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:00,589

549
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,818
Hello, I'm Mone.

550
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:03,959
- Hello. - Hello.

551
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,758
I want to hand these out to my fans.

552
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:07,889
I'll have my manager leave them upstairs.

553
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,499
I included my autograph.

554
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,770
Hand them out to your friends.

555
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,440
- I'm honoured. Thanks. - Thank you.

556
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,738
You're beautiful.

557
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,610
- Thank you. - My gosh. Look at these.

558
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,940
Let her in.

559
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:30,279
Do your thing, Mr. Manager.

560
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,350
Come over here.

561
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:15,600
Sungchan Group is planning a press conference.

562
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,130
So what?

563
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:18,429
You're not worried?

564
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:22,100
You should move before they do.

565
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,509
What does that mean?

566
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:28,139
This was your plan.

567
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,639
To take your father's company.

568
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:34,279
Am I wrong?

569
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:42,290
Mr. Sim Jun Seok.

570
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:48,560
Wait.

571
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:51,199
Should I call you K?

572
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,679
I like you very much, La Hui.

573
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,949
I wasn't wrong.

574
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:09,048
Anyone else...

575
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:11,549
would've gotten scared and fled.

576
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,860
You fear nothing at all.

577
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:18,290
You're right.

578
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,690
I fear nothing.

579
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,670
I prefer it much more that you aren't Lee Hwi So.

580
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,670
I like you more and more.

581
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,179
What do you think Chairman Sim will say?

582
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,409
That Min Do Hyuk is guilty?

583
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:41,509
I guess?

584
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,980
And this...

585
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:46,920
is how we'll respond.

586
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,190
(Press Release)

587
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,830
- There he is. - Where's Sim Jun Seok?

588
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,469
- Where's your son? - Where is he?

589
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,609
Where in the US is your son?

590
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,979
Sir! How much are you hiding?

591
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,750
Tell us something!

592
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,349
Just one comment!

593
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,520
Chairman!

594
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,589
Do you think this makes sense?

595
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,560
What about the backlash...

596
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:27,559
when they realize this was a lie?

597
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,860
Trust me.

598
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,270
Did I ever take action unless I was certain?

599
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:35,670
So I was thinking.

600
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,670
I need you to do this for me.

601
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,138
Me?

602
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:43,210
If Da Mi's biological mom were to speak up,

603
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,080
it would be more convincing.

604
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,650
It's not hard.

605
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,449
Just do what that says.

606
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,080
You can manage, can't you?

607
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,420
Fine.

608
00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:00,060
Leave it to me.

609
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:04,600
In return...

610
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:10,400
Give me half of your TIKITAKA shares.

611
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,110
Exactly 50 percent.

612
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:20,110
How about 30 percent?

613
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,719
I put my life on the line.

614
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:24,880
If this goes wrong, I die.

615
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,020
I want 50 percent.

616
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,299
Now that I think about it,

617
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,699
it's not that bad a deal.

618
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:46,969
Fifty-fifty. We're on.

619
00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:55,549
We'll be...

620
00:41:56,549 --> 00:41:58,250
the best partners.

621
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:01,219
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Sim Jun Seok.

622
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:04,159
I have plans.

623
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:05,619
I must leave.

624
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,029
(TIKITAKA)

625
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,310
Watch where Min Do Hyuk went to.

626
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,819
I have sharp-eyed men on the job.

627
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,020
I wonder if Han Na enjoyed the food.

628
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:36,790
If she's full, we should get to work.

629
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,589
Just say when.

630
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:41,429
I want her gone today.

631
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,000
Everything else will be perfect,

632
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:47,600
and I can't let a kid become my weakness.

633
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:50,940
I'm going to do it myself.

634
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,819
The chairman asked to bring you both.

635
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:08,619
Where at?

636
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,759
You'll find out.

637
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,440
I hope you had fun today.

638
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:31,778
What did you do, Han Na?

639
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,310
I had great fun.

640
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:34,850
Oh, right.

641
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:37,250
I got you a present.

642
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,318
She picked out a pair of gloves for you.

643
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:42,420
Gloves?

644
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,020
Why gloves?

645
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:47,690
I think your fingernails hurt.

646
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,560
What about his fingernails?

647
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,540
He's not wearing nail polish today.

648
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:59,839
He did yesterday, and it was so pretty.

649
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,540
That punk's a useless driver.

650
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:08,149
Han Na.

651
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,480
Oh, it's Mom.

652
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,790
Someone was watching Han Na.

653
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:15,520
What did he look like?

654
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:17,719
It's Sim Jun Seok.

655
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:26,699
Mom, shall I show him the gloves?

656
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:28,100
Wait, Han Na.

657
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,969
He's driving right now. Maybe later.

658
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,769
Han Na.

659
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:37,839
We played Shadow Tag at the indoor playground, didn't we?

660
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,710
Shadow Tag?

661
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:43,580
Hide and seek.

662
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,380
Oh, yes.

663
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:46,790
Shadow Tag.

664
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:49,860
Mom.

665
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,629
I think I had too much to eat.

666
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,460
I want to go to the toilet.

667
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,060
Not now. Wait.

668
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:58,829
Mom, I think I'll wet myself.

669
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,028
I can't wait.

670
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:01,270
I'm sorry, sir.

671
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:04,139
I see a public toilet over there.

672
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,810
- Pull over. We won't be long. - Mom.

673
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,068
How dare the brat run her mouth?

674
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:36,040
(Public Toilet)

675
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,449
(Restricted Area, Staff Only)

676
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:00,629
Mr. Kang.

677
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,960
I need your help with something.

678
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,469
Who are you?

679
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,100
Don't kill me.

680
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,210
I'll do anything you want.

681
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,369
Open the server room door.

682
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,338
(Server Room)

683
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:19,380
Open the door.

684
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:21,448
(Locked)

685
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:22,449
(Unlocking)

00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:28,718
(Min Do Hyuk)

687
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:29,758
(Involved in murder at Sungchan Gallery)

688
00:46:29,759 --> 00:46:30,920
(Fled during investigation, wanted man)

689
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,130
This is an emergency.

690
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:36,000
TIKITAKA intruder alert.

691
00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:40,499
What's going on?

692
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,629
(Min Do Hyuk)

693
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:42,839
(Involved in murder at Sungchan Gallery)

694
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,369
Min Do Hyuk?

695
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,339
- Han Na, can you run? - Yes.

696
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:54,779
Jin Mo, it's me.

697
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,149
Do Hyuk broke into TIKITAKA's server room.

698
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,480
Get him right now.

699
00:46:58,719 --> 00:46:59,949
Darn it.

700
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:21,040
Han Na.

701
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:23,639
Han Na.

702
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:25,540
Are you not done yet?

703
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,948
Han Na.

704
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:30,949
No Han Na.

705
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,889
Darn.

706
00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:35,589
These little rats.

707
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,000
- Han Na. - Those crazy brats.

708
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:47,330
Han Na, run.

709
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:52,839
Watch out!

710
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,310
Taxi!

711
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,279
Get in, quick.

712
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,290
(Calling Yang Jin Mo)

713
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,259
(No Paeng Hee)

714
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,799
The person you reached is unavailable.

Cherry Entertainment?

716
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,009
I need to talk to Yang Jin Mo.

717
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,279
It's urgent.

718
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,250
He just left for a shoot.

719
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,719
Where at?

720
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,179
The Yeoju set?

721
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:40,749
Okay.

722
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,920
Thank you.

723
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,060
Stand over there.

724
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:27,000
How do you post a notice?

725
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:32,670
Over there.

726
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,609
Open the server.

727
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,948
Well, the thing is...

728
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:45,080
Only Chairman Lee has the authority to post notices...

729
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:48,589
I should try. Yes.

730
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,368
I am revealing the identity of TIKITAKA's chairman.

731
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:11,210
Matthew Lee is Sim Jun Seok.

732
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,170
Min Do Hyuk is taken care of.

733
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,210
Where should I take him?

734
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,250
(Sungchan Group Chairman Sim Yong)

735
00:51:00,259 --> 00:51:02,088
- Is everything ready? - Yes, sir.

736
00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:04,399
I've created as much material as possible,

737
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,270
using Sungchan's innovative DeepFake technology.

738
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:13,940
Is that the time?

739
00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:16,509
Let's go.

(Sungchan Group's Chairman Sim Yong Emergency Press Conference)

743
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,170
After my mother passed away,

744
00:51:43,339 --> 00:51:44,739
I was under extreme stress.

745
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,069
As a result, I became suddenly ill with cardiac insufficiency.

746
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,539
Because of that, I've been recuperating at a hospital...

747
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,480
for a long time.

748
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:03,759
As you can see, my son, Jun Seok,

749
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,118
is currently recuperating at a hospital...

750
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:07,659
in a rural town in the US.

751
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:11,999
He could never be related to the Sungchan Gallery murder case.

752
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,029
Also,

753
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,568
he left for the US...

754
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:17,239
before Bang Da Mi died.

755
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,110
I will reveal his departure records from back then.

(Certificate of Entry and Departure)

757
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,209
The day that Mr. Sim Jun Seok left for the US...

758
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,849
was September 15, 2018.

759
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,219
This was confirmed by the Immigration Office.

760
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:38,118
Until now, you have been duped by an absurd fraud.

761
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:41,130
That fraud is none other than Min Do Hyuk.

(Min Do Hyuk)

763
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:50,440
This man, who has an assault record, used to be a gangster's minion.

764
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:54,409
He's the culprit who mercilessly killed my wife.

765
00:52:57,779 --> 00:53:00,580
The evidence for that is this watch.

(Ms. Hong Murder Case, Sungchan Gallery)

767
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,089
This watch was...

768
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,618
a present I gave my son.

769
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,589
It's a one-of-a-kind, handmade diamond watch.

770
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,059
It had been stolen when my wife was murdered.

771
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,198
The police recently found that Min Do Hyuk had it.

772
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:19,259
This man...

773
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,999
stole my son's watch...

774
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,499
and was pretending to be Jun Seok all this time.

(Sungchan Group's Chairman Sim Yong Emergency Press Conference)

776
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:26,869
He brutally murdered...

777
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:30,380
my wife and a poor high school girl.

778
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:33,008
Min Do Hyuk, who used my son's identity...

779
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,179
to do utterly shameless deeds,

780
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,920
should be severely punished.

781
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,559

should face serious criminal and civil charges.

785
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:55,529
I declare that I will never give them favourable arrangements.

786
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,600

787

788
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:03,179

What is Geum La Hui doing here?

791
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,658
- Let her speak. - Ms. Geum.

792
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:20,158
- What does she have to say? - Let her speak!

793
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,629
- Why are you blocking her? - Why won't you let her speak?

794
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,460
- Let her speak! - We want to hear her.

796
00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:36,638
are undoubtedly the crime of Sim Jun Seok,

797

798
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,549
Why, you crazy...

799
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:41,879
I, Geum La Hui,

800
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,178
came here today to reveal a huge scheme...

801
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:46,350
that Sungchan Group has been planning.

802
00:54:46,589 --> 00:54:48,819
What are you doing? Get this woman off the stage.

803
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:51,559
Stop that.

804
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,629
- What are you doing? - Leave her alone.

805
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,459
- Hey, what are you doing? - Let her talk!

806
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,298
- Let go of me! - We want to hear her speak.

807
00:54:58,299 --> 00:55:00,629
- Let her talk. - Leave her alone.

808
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,699
Chairman Sim.

809
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,568
If it's true that Sim Jun Seok is recuperating in the US,

810
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:08,170
why don't you video call him in real time right now?

811
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:09,810
Then, I'll believe you.

812
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,079
The scene from the hospital room in the US...

813
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,549
must be an elaborately manipulated DeepFake video.

814
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,388
Chairman Sim Yong was aware...

815
00:55:23,389 --> 00:55:25,860
of Sim Jun Seok's wrongdoings from the beginning.

816
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,060
He even witnessed...

817
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,659
his son murdering his wife in person.

818
00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:33,529
- What? - Is that true?

819
00:55:37,069 --> 00:55:39,669
However, he wasn't able to meet or find his son.

820
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,008
That was why he needed a scapegoat...

821
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:43,678
to take the blame for his son's crimes.

822
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:45,009
And that would've been Min Do Hyuk.

823
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:46,778
(Server Room)

824
00:55:46,779 --> 00:55:49,879
Chairman Sim Yong was going to frame an innocent man...

825
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,380
in order to protect himself and Sungchan Group.

826
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:56,319
But unfortunately, there's one thing that Chairman Sim has missed.

827
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,560
You were also completely duped by your son.

828
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,729
You didn't know Sim Jun Seok had plastic surgery...

829
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,259
to look like Min Do Hyuk,

830
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:07,869
did you?

831
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,330
What? Plastic surgery?

832
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,100
- So it's the same person? - Is that true?

833
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:15,269
In other words, Sim Jun Seok currently has Min Do Hyuk's face.

834
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,339
- What? - Gosh.

835
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,080
This is unbelievable.

836
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:21,749
I've called Dr. Oh Dae Heon, Sim Jun Seok's plastic surgeon.

837
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:22,810
Please come on out.

838
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:31,619
Five years ago,

839
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,360
I performed plastic surgery on Sim Jun Seok.

840
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,159
Here is the evidence.

841
00:56:41,029 --> 00:56:43,199
- He even has evidence. - Look.

842
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:44,368
What are you doing?

843
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:46,169
- Don't stop him! - Let him speak!

844
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,939
- Get out of the way. - Come on!

845
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,210
Get off the stage!

846
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:58,479
- Look at that. - Gosh.

847
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,289
- Take a picture. - Wasn't it just a rumour?

848
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:02,989
- Oh, my gosh. - We have to get this.

849
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:07,659
- My goodness. - No way.

850
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:09,960
He became Min Do Hyuk?

851
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,158
- He looks just like him! - That's Min Do Hyuk.

852
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:14,568
How can this be?

853
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:16,269
I can't believe this.

854
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,600
This is absolute nonsense!

855
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:24,580
You're the one who's speaking absolute nonsense, Chairman Sim.

856
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,480
You may be a fool who was duped by your own son,

857
00:57:28,449 --> 00:57:30,979
but you're a criminal who protected your psychopath son...

858
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,278
who killed my daughter.

859
00:57:32,279 --> 00:57:36,589
Min Do Hyuk is not my son!

860
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,759
Can you be certain that he's not your son?

861
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:45,329
Then, do a DNA test before the whole nation.

862
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,900
If I'm wrong,

863
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:50,569
I will give up my entire life's savings and go to prison.

864
00:57:50,739 --> 00:57:52,270
What are you saying?

865
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:55,239
Why would you do this to me?

866
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:57,738
Why should I do a DNA test?

867
00:57:57,739 --> 00:57:59,309
You should get ready to go to prison!

868
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,709
I will sue you!

869
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,179
Why are you doing this to me?

870
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:06,350
Tell Matthew to come here!

871
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,149
Grab everything that has Min Do Hyuk's DNA on it.

872
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,150
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

873
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:56,069
- Could you put that over there? - Okay.

874
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,440
Promise me you'll save my kid. Okay?

875
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,880
I tried to save the baby, but it died.

876
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:14,149
Whose son am I to look this good?

877
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,149
You look awesome.

878
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,690
Are you ready to chew up the whole nation?

879
00:59:17,759 --> 00:59:19,319
Chew up, my foot.

880
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,859
All he has is one line.

881
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,689
I could turn the whole entertainment industry upside down...

882
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,528
with that one line.

883
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:25,699
That's right.

884
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,599
Just keep your temper in check...

885
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,130
so you don't lose the director's favour.

886
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,799
We don't have the best relationship...

887
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,440
- with that director. - I don't care about that.

888
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:37,210
I only have one goal.

889
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,350
I'm sure you'll fall over in shock when you see me.

890
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,619
I want some coffee.

891
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,488
I must've forgotten to buy some.

892
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:50,189
- Hey, let's go get some coffee. - Wait, but...

893
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:51,289
- No. - Let's go.

894
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:52,658
Myeongju Girls' High School bullies Wang Yu Jin...

895
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:54,028
and Kim So Yeon. Get out here!

896
00:59:54,029 --> 00:59:55,928
- Mone! - Come here!

897
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,600
- Mone! - What do we do?

898
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,629
Did you get to stretch out your legs and get a good night's sleep...

899
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,900
the whole time until now?

900
01:00:02,429 --> 01:00:05,569
We're still suffering from insomnia and social phobia.

901
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:09,508
But you guys post photos you took with celebrities on social media.

902
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:11,310
You're laughing and joking around.

903
01:00:12,339 --> 01:00:14,008
Are your lives just full of joy?

904
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:15,449
I have nightmares every night.

905
01:00:15,509 --> 01:00:17,618
I couldn't even go to college, let alone med school...

906
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:18,880
and barely manage to live on pills from the psychiatrist.

907
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,190
Our lives have been ruined.

908
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,489
What right do you guys have to be happy?

909
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,988
Mone, what do you have to say about this?

910
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:27,289
Mone, what do we do?

911
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,130
Everything must've been revealed.

912
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:32,159
Hurry up and explain that you told us to do everything.

913
01:00:32,299 --> 01:00:34,730
We were just doing what you told us to.

914
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:36,699
It was you who had a baby, right?

915
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:39,600
Before Bang Da Mi died, she called you out.

916
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,368
Why did you lie?

917
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:42,739
Why did you kill Da Mi when she was innocent?

918
01:00:43,069 --> 01:00:44,909
- Why did you do it? - Why did you kill Da Mi?

919
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,379
(We have the right to know the truth.)

920
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,810
(Give me a refund for the love that I gave you.)

921
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,020
Han Mone, what on earth is all of this?

922
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:56,719
Is what they're saying true?

923
01:00:58,589 --> 01:01:00,960
Is this your doing? Did you incite these people?

924
01:01:00,989 --> 01:01:02,129
"Incite?"

925
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,259
Don't make me laugh.

926
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,199
One is said to incite something...

927
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,129
when one threatens a weaker person to fabricate one's grades...

928
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,299
and act like a school bully like you did.

929
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:13,639
No!

930
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,040
I never did that.

931
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:20,040
You do know the special clause in the contract, right?

932
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:21,880
If you ever cause...

933
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,778
the movie production harm due to a socially controversial act...

934
01:01:23,779 --> 01:01:27,190
such as school violence, drunk driving, drugs, and so on,

935
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:29,548
Han Mone will pay...

936
01:01:29,549 --> 01:01:30,989
for the entirety of the production costs!

937
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,759
- Yes! - That's right!

938
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:36,158
You deserve that!

939
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,799
Yes! Do it!

940
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,658
What are you doing?

941
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:40,799
Go!

942
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:42,330
Hey!

943
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:46,298
Hey, Han Mone!

944
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:47,440
Where are you going?

945
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:50,909
I mean, what on earth is going on?

946
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,529
It's the cell phone and gun that Min Do Hyuk had on him.

947
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:17,139
When do you think he'll be awake?

948
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,838
I've given him enough drugs...

949
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:20,639
to stay asleep until this evening.

950
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:21,838
Good work.

951
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,980
Move discreetly so you don't attract attention.

952
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,150
By the way,

953
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:34,190
No Paeng Hee and her daughter are fine, right?

954
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,290
Why?

955
01:02:40,929 --> 01:02:42,290
Should something be wrong with them?

956
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:44,500
No.

957
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,130
I'll leave them in your care.

958
01:02:54,869 --> 01:02:56,568
(Spy Call History, Select)

959
01:02:56,569 --> 01:02:58,710
(Deleting call history)

960
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:18,630
Taxi!

961
01:03:19,659 --> 01:03:20,900
You're Han Mone, right?

962
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:22,330
Where is Yang Jin Mo?

963
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,969
How would I know that?

964
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:25,369
Please!

965
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,170
Please take care of Han Na for me.

966
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,869
They're coming after me!

967
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,310
And who are you?

968
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,810
Can't you see I'm on the run too?

969
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,580
Please save my mom.

970
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,150
Let go.

971
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,250
Who are you?

972
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:46,659
Hurry up and hide!

973
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:52,699
Move your vehicle!

974
01:03:59,739 --> 01:04:02,409
Mom, you can't leave me.

975
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:05,880
I'll go with you too.

976
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,080
You know I love you so much, right?

977
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,250
Don't go, Mom!

978
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,089
Take me with you!

979
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:19,460
Mom.

980
01:04:24,759 --> 01:04:26,759
Please take good care of my child, Ms. Han Mone.

981
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:29,799
You have to do this for me.

982
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:37,810
Mom.

983
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:39,880
Mom!

984
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,279
Seriously...

985
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:52,790
Mom!

986
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,489
Darn it.

987
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,460
Hey, kid!

988
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,830
Please take good care of my child, Ms. Han Mone.

989
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:33,900
This has been enough fun.

990
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,569
But...

991
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:38,799
let's please give the ridiculous mom and daughter act a rest now.

992
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,639
She's not even your kid.

993
01:05:40,869 --> 01:05:42,469
Won't you be grateful if I get rid of her?

994
01:05:42,509 --> 01:05:43,779
Han Na is my daughter.

995
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:46,409
What would a psychopath like you know?

996
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:48,250
What family is...

997
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:51,619
That must be why you're playing games with people's lives!

998
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:54,020
You're even worse than a beast!

999
01:06:07,299 --> 01:06:08,770
Where is your brat of a daughter?

1000
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,500
Do you think I'd tell you that?

1001
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:13,440
Even if you do this,

1002
01:06:13,909 --> 01:06:15,839
that kid can't live here.

1003
01:06:16,509 --> 01:06:19,040
Things will never go the way you want them to, K.

1004
01:06:20,139 --> 01:06:22,179
How could you do that to your own flesh and blood?

1005
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,830
Please take good care of my child, Ms. Han Mone.

1006
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,960
You have to do this for me.

1007
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:54,509
Mom!

1008
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,380
Mom!

1009
01:07:01,949 --> 01:07:03,089
Mom!

1010
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:42,889
Mom!

1011
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,469
Mom!

1012
01:08:20,669 --> 01:08:24,839
(The Escape of the Seven)

1013
01:08:25,139 --> 01:08:26,338
I will go to the inferno!

1014
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:27,469
Just give me some time.

1015
01:08:27,639 --> 01:08:29,370
Time to fight against K!

1016
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:32,240
Please don't do this.

1017
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,879
I'm really Jun Seok, Father.

1018
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:37,009
Min Do Hyuk and K are brothers?

1019
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:39,520
I'm going to go abroad as soon as I find Chairman Bang's money.

1020
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:40,990
My scenario is...

1021
01:08:41,549 --> 01:08:44,219
Now, we should start the hunt for Sungchan Group in earnest.

1022
01:08:44,259 --> 01:08:45,860
Now, K is just my enemy.

1023
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,560
Let's reveal everything.

1024
01:08:47,629 --> 01:08:49,530
Geum La Hui and Sim Jun Seok.

1025
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:50,860
Who they really are.
