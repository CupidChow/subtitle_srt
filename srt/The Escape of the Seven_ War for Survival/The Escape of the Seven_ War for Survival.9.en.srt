(Episode 8)

13
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:17,097
You can't come here!

14
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:20,066
- Don't come here! - Mr. Bang...

15
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:22,365
- No! - Don't come here!

16
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:23,396
Mr. Bang!

17
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:24,836
Mr. Bang!

18
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:27,237
- Let go! - You guys...

19
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:30,306
must survive!

20
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:31,976
You must...

21
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:36,616
get revenge for Da Mi.

22
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:39,817
No. Mr. Bang...

23
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,116
Let go of me.

24
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:42,687
- Let go of me. - Don't come here.

25
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:43,957
Grandfather.

26
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,116
Please hurry up and go.

27
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,827
There's not much time left.

28
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:54,397
No, Da Mi.

29
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:57,166
I...

30
00:01:58,037 --> 00:01:59,397
have to die here...

31
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,937
as Lee Hwi So,

32
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:05,976
so your father can move forward.

33
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:08,047
Da Mi.

34
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:11,246
I won't leave you alone ever again.

35
00:02:13,387 --> 00:02:15,586
I love you, my dear granddaughter.

36
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:19,417
My dear Da Mi.

37
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:31,137
No!

38
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:33,966
Hwi So...

39
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:38,237
I trust that you can do it.

40
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:49,887
- Let's go. - Let's go!

41
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:52,257
Let's go!

42
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:54,227
Mr. Bang...

43
00:02:55,757 --> 00:02:56,857
Mr. Bang...

44
00:02:57,197 --> 00:02:59,596
No!

45
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:01,996
Let go of me! Mr. Bang...

46
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:04,596
Calm down, Hwi So.

47
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:07,406
- Calm down! - Mr. Bang!

48
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:08,835
Let me go!

49
00:03:08,836 --> 00:03:10,836
We need to at least collect his body.

50
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:13,336
If you stop me, I'll never forgive you.

51
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:18,576
This is what he wants.

52
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:20,447
He wants us to lose our minds and make a mistake.

53
00:03:20,816 --> 00:03:22,046
Mr. Bang's sacrifice,

54
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:23,387
our efforts for the past five years...

55
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:25,487
Do you want to blow that all up?

56
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:27,656
I won't allow that.

57
00:03:28,427 --> 00:03:29,586
Hurry up!

58
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:32,357
Hold on!

59
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,727
There was a bomb in the well.

60
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:35,996
Who triggered it to explode?

61
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,397
- Lee Hwi So. - No way.

62
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,666
Lee Hwi So and Chairman Bang are on the same side.

63
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,506
Lee Hwi So might've killed Chairman Bang.

64
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:44,976
With Chairman Bang dead,

65
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:46,577
all of that money becomes his.

66
00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:48,106
Find Lee Hwi So.

67
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:50,216
We have to find him. I'm sure he's around here somewhere.

68
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:56,646
Answer the phone.

69
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:58,186
Hurry up and answer.

70
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:01,986
It's me.

71
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:04,357
Hurry up and run away. They're looking for Matthew.

72
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:07,667
If you want to go,

73
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:10,536
you're going to have to go through me.

74
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:22,976
Let's go.

75
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,546
Kang Ki Tak?

76
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:33,757
Hey!

77
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:35,526
Hey!

78
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,127
Darn it!

79
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:44,036
We lost Lee Hwi So right in front of our eyes.

80
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:46,397
But I now know who's helping him.

81
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:48,466
Who is it?

82
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:51,007
Kang Ki Tak.

83
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:53,176
Kang Ki Tak?

84
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:57,577
The police is coming. We have to go.

85
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:59,216
If we get caught now, it'll complicate things.

86
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:01,187
Everyone, go back to the cars.

87
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:02,986
- Run. - Run!

88
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:10,226
How pathetic.

89
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:13,627
Did he live for five more years just to die like that?

90
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,296
What a way to die.

91
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:18,437
That's a sad life.

92
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,127
Enough!

93
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:57,937
Mr. Bang...

94
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:01,377
Why do you think he went there?

95
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:05,317
Who set up a bomb?

96
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,586
He knew Mr. Bang would go there,

97
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,586
so he set up a bomb in the well.

98
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:12,117
No.

99
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,327
He's the one who led him there.

100
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:19,296
He wanted to kill him.

101
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:20,827
How would he do that?

102
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:22,327
He has no means of contacting him.

103
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:26,296
Min Do Hyuk.

104
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,836
What if Min Do Hyuk is a double agent?

105
00:06:30,877 --> 00:06:32,176
No way.

106
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:35,346
I'm sure of it.

107
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:37,876
Rather,

108
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,416
Do Hyuk might be in trouble.

109
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:40,785
Tell me!

110
00:06:40,786 --> 00:06:42,247
What do you want me to tell you?

111
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:44,016
- Tell me! - What do you want me to say?

112
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:45,116
Who are you?

113
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:46,616
What are you doing?

114
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:47,785
You don't know?

115
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:50,025
Lee Hwi So knew our plan.

116
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,595
He used Mr. Hwang and the prison guard to distract us,

117
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:55,067
and in the meantime, he moved Chairman Bang.

118
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:57,267
All of this was part of a detailed plan.

119
00:06:57,536 --> 00:06:59,336
I'm positive there's a traitor among us.

120
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:01,236
We only use burner phones,

121
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:03,437
so there's no way our plan could get leaked.

122
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,175
Why were you late?

123
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:06,806
I told you! I had something to do!

124
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:08,646
You had something to do?

125
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:10,577
Do you expect us to believe that nonsense?

126
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:13,215
You were the one who planned Chairman Bang's escape.

127
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:14,985
You were the one who suggested...

128
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:17,116
we get Bang Chil Sung out of prison, you punk.

129
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:20,116
But the person who made the plan was late to make a few bucks?

130
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:21,725
I do anything for money.

131
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:24,626
Who would refuse when they were offering so much money?

132
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:26,057
Are you crazy about money?

133
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:28,096
I don't think you're one to talk.

134
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:30,126
I heard you went into his room alone.

135
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:31,567
Weren't you after his money?

136
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:32,937
That's not true.

137
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,535
I went in to find out where Lee Hwi So was.

138
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:37,475
It's true. When I went into the room,

139
00:07:37,476 --> 00:07:39,106
there was someone hiding in his closet.

140
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:40,776
He had a helper.

141
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:42,676
You punk.

142
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:44,746
When we got to Gagok District,

143
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:47,086
Chairman Bang was all alone. His helper wasn't there.

144
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:51,356
There was a reason why his helper had to leave.

145
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:54,827
It's because you, Min Do Hyuk,

146
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:56,957
had to meet us.

147
00:07:58,057 --> 00:07:59,925
What is this? He got a text. His phone.

148
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,266
We need to find his phone.

149
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,425
- Why are you looking for my phone? - Be quiet, you punk!

150
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:04,997
Here's his phone.

151
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:07,665
Be careful?

152
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,937
This...

153
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:11,006
Lee Hwi So sent this to you. Right?

154
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,176
Why you...

155
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:13,576
- Don't touch it! - Tell us.

156
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,606
Stay still.

157
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:17,017
How long have you been in contact with Lee Hwi So?

158
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:18,877
No.

159
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,517
Maybe it's not Lee Hwi So,

160
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:22,286
but Kang Ki Tak.

161
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:23,586
Right?

162
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:24,916
Kang Ki Tak?

163
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:28,327
Isn't he the former CEO of Taebaek Entertainment?

164
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,697
Is he helping Lee Hwi So too?

165
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,057
I've heard about him.

166
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:33,525
He was the boss of Joongang Gang,

167
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:35,525
and he went to prison for going after Cherry Entertainment.

168
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:38,535
This punk worked under Kang Ki Tak.

169
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:40,706
Then he's definitely a spy.

170
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:41,767
But...

171
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:43,837
what's Kang Ki Tak's relationship with Chairman Bang?

172
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:46,477
Kang Ki Tak used to do some dirty work for Chairman Bang.

173
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:48,747
That old man had a lot of dirty secrets,

174
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,876
so he needed a gangster to clean up after him.

175
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:52,075
You punk...

176
00:08:52,076 --> 00:08:53,945
- Here. Check. - Don't touch it!

177
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:55,316
- Don't touch it! - Stay still!

178
00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:57,556
- Don't touch it! - Hey!

179
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:01,055
- Why don't you want us to check? - Give it to me.

180
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:03,796
If you're not a traitor, you can prove it to us.

181
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:06,055
Don't worry.

182
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:07,597
Stay still. We need to check.

183
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:09,867
There's nothing on his phone to link us to him.

184
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,397
I already expected something like this...

185
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:14,035
to happen.

186
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:15,237
(Do you want to change it?)

187
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:21,007
Is there something in there? Did Lee Hwi So send it?

188
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:23,206
Be careful.

189
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:26,117
Your...

190
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:29,747
hair is in danger.

191
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:32,087
If you're worried about losing your hair. Give us a call.

192
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:34,156
Hair loss.

193
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:36,186
Is that it? Anything else?

194
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:37,656
Nothing.

195
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,026
Let go.

196
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:41,097
I said let go of me!

197
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:44,637
It's rude to point a golf club at someone's neck.

198
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,837
Stop being so suspicious! Please!

199
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,137
Lee Hwi So's wife was the murderer who killed my mom and brother.

200
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:53,237
You think I joined him?

201
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:55,377
It's better to be safe than sorry!

202
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,276
Is that so? Then let's put everything out in the open.

203
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:02,386
That the person who had me attack Cherry Entertainment...

204
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:04,286
was you, not Kang Ki Tak.

205
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:07,656
Yang Jin Mo.

206
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:12,525
Why are you bringing that up now, you punk?

207
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:14,266
That has nothing to do with this.

208
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:15,295
That's true.

209
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:17,535
Finding Lee Hwi So is more important.

210
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:18,666
More than that,

211
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:21,737
I'm curious to find out who set up that bomb.

212
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:25,337
The fact that they openly went after Lee Hwi So and Chairman Bang...

213
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:27,176
means they're not your average person.

214
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:34,587
Sungchan?

215
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:36,846
That's right. I'm positive now.

216
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:39,517
The person who knows Lee Hwi So and Kang Ki Tak's plan...

217
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:41,955
The person powerful enough to kill Chairman Bang...

218
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:44,126
The person wealthy enough to own land in Gagok District...

219
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:46,956
It can only be him. Sungchan Group's Sim Jun Seok.

220
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,696
My hunch was right.

221
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:52,497
The person who set up the bomb and killed Da Mi...

222
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:54,166
was Sim Jun Seok.

223
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:04,376
Find Kang Ki Tak.

224
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:06,747
Once we find him, it'll be easy to find Lee Hwi So.

225
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:10,017
You never know.

226
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:12,656
Kang Ki Tak might remember his old feelings for Geum La Hui...

227
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:13,987
and betray Lee Hwi So.

228
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:15,285
That's nonsense.

229
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:17,526
Why are you getting so mad?

230
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:19,856
There's not a single person who doesn't know Kang Ki Tak...

231
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:21,097
was once in love with Geum La Hui.

232
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:25,137
Why? Are you reminded of the past?

233
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:26,696
There's no reason for me to answer you.

234
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:39,747
Gosh, those punks.

235
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,786
Do you want to grab a drink with me?

236
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,195
You must have high standards.

237
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:53,357
How dare you hit on her?

238
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:55,096
Why would she drink with you?

239
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:57,026
Move. Yes?

240
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,535
I got a taxi, so I'll get going first.

241
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,266
- Taxi! - Wait, no...

242
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:02,436
I'll go with you.

243
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:04,976
I'd rather drink with a zombie.

244
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:07,107
Sir, please hurry.

245
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:12,116
I wanted to grab a drink with Myoung Ji.

246
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:13,217
Why is she interfering?

247
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,887
That murderous lady!

248
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:24,456
Where are you?

249
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:26,326
I just got home.

250
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:29,897
I see.

251
00:12:30,497 --> 00:12:31,736
I'm sorry about before.

252
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:33,666
I've been on edge these days.

253
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:35,967
Do you want to grab some whiskey with me?

254
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,176
I'm tired. I'm going to go to bed now.

255
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,206
Really?

256
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:44,176
Let's drink another time then.

257
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:45,517
Get some rest.

258
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:16,276
Do Hyuk.

259
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:19,316
What happened?

260
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,916
Why did Mr. Bang suddenly go there?

261
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,517
He said he had to check something.

262
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:27,387
That's all he said.

263
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:29,987
Gagok District.

264
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:34,627
He invited me there.

265
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:36,925
Him? Do you mean the person...

266
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,337
who killed your granddaughter?

267
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,137
Who is he?

268
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:42,936
Sungchan Group's...

269
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:47,306
Sim Jun Seok.

270
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:49,906
Sim Jun Seok?

271
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:54,117
Luka.

272
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:55,887
Look up Sungchan Group's Sim Jun Seok.

273
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:59,285
He graduated from Seoul Science High School...

274
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:01,326
and graduated from Harvard University in 2015.

275
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:04,626
In 2017, he married Han So Ra, the eldest daughter of Course Group,

276
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:05,997
and they divorced in 2019.

277
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,396
He's currently working at Sungchan Group's US branch,

278
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:09,767
studying management and finance.

279
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:12,266
He's the sole heir to Sungchan Group,

280
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:13,896
and he's a prodigy...

281
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:15,766
who always came in first in his class.

282
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,476
His demeanour is unlike that of other wealthy people.

283
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:19,535
When news broke that he did a lot of volunteer work,

284
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:21,877
he gained a lot of popularity with the public.

285
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:24,846
I don't think that doing volunteer work...

286
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:26,946
is all that special.

287
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:29,516
I don't believe I'm helping those in need.

288
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:32,556
Rather, I feel like I'm fulfilling something that I lack.

289
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,857
Five years ago, Sim Jun Seok was married.

290
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:40,397
He was a married man whose affair with Han Mone couldn't be revealed.

291
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:44,026
Mr. Bang called him K.

292
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:46,836
K?

293
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:48,066
I've heard his name before.

294
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:50,736
He's a strong force in the underworld.

295
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,536
He does whatever he wants.

296
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:54,746
He's incredibly ruthless...

297
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:56,306
and an eccentric sociopath.

298
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:58,576
I can't believe K is Sim Jun Seok.

299
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:01,717
Mr. Bang said he knew Sim Jun Seok's true colours.

300
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:04,415
On the outside, he's a smart and respectable young man,

301
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,416
but underneath...

302
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:08,257
lives an incredibly scary monster.

303
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,227
To the point where Mr. Bang was afraid of him.

304
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:12,397
That's why Mr. Bang...

305
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:15,566
waited until I had power.

306
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:18,165
The power to go up against him.

307
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,367
There's news regarding Bang Da Mi.

308
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,035
The culprit behind the Bobble Case,

309
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:25,637
Lee Hwi So, her adoptive father, died today.

310
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:27,976
The police stated that Lee Hwi So,

311
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:30,607
who was receiving treatment at a nearby hospital,

312
00:15:30,706 --> 00:15:33,516
escaped with flammable material...

313
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,087
and died by suicide using a bomb.

314
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:38,756
- Lies. - At the scene of the suicide,

315
00:15:38,757 --> 00:15:40,256
they found...

316
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:43,087
skeletal remains alongside Lee Hwi So's body.

317
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:44,226
Currently, the police...

318
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:46,396
- will investigate the escape... - Skeletal remains?

319
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:48,565
- and have also sent the remains... - No way.

320
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:50,267
to the National Forensic Service for analysis.

321
00:15:50,627 --> 00:15:52,596
The Seoul Police Agency in charge of this case...

322
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:55,736
has revealed that they will consider the possibility...

323
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:58,006
that the remains belong to Bang Da Mi...

324
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:00,977
who went missing five years ago and has requested a DNA test.

325
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:02,606
Bang went missing at Seoul Culture Forest.

326
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:03,647
It's Bang Da Mi.

327
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:05,847
She's been buried in that well all this time.

328
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:09,686
How did Chairman Bang know where Da Mi was?

329
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,216
He must've had a hunch.

330
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,915
Maybe he knew who the culprit was.

331
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,756
To reveal the truth,

332
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:18,257
they must find out who the remains belong to.

333
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:23,026
I'm sure you know who it is too.

334
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:24,935
The person who killed Da Mi.

335
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:25,936
I don't know.

336
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:27,836
Don't lie. The culprit...

337
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:30,877
They will be conducting an urgent DNA test.

338
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,536
It's Mone's boyfriend. Right?

339
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:36,946
What makes you say that?

340
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:39,017
I know Geum La Hui.

341
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,915
When it comes to calculating a person's worth,

342
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,285
you're more exact than ChatGPT.

343
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:45,756
But you still signed a contract with Mone...

344
00:16:45,757 --> 00:16:47,525
despite knowing she gave birth.

345
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:49,955
That must mean that Mone's boyfriend...

346
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:52,897
has immense power. Don't you think?

347
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:55,696
Who's your boyfriend?

348
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,035
Tell me.

349
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:03,267
There's no need for you to hide it from me.

350
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:09,246
No.

351
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:15,587
Who killed your daughter?

352
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:18,557
Don't tell her.

353
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:26,426
Sungchan Group's...

354
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:36,307
Sim Jun Seok.

355
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:38,607
What?

356
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,317
So that's why he went there.

357
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:53,587
To find his granddaughter's remains.

358
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,357
He regretted it so much.

359
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,297
That he was the one who told Da Mi...

360
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:02,226
to go to the Digital Crime Support Center.

361
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:05,637
That's where Da Mi met Sim Jun Seok.

362
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:23,587
This...

363
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:27,316
is the wallet Da Mi lost at the support center.

364
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:28,327
(Bang Da Mi)

365
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:32,196
From the beginning,

366
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,897
it was K's plan to get Da Mi to come to the support center...

367
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:39,297
so that he could kill her.

368
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:43,637
Because Da Mi knew that Han Mone had a baby.

369
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:46,206
Are you saying he killed her to protect Han Mone?

370
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:49,077
It was to protect himself.

371
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:52,617
If it comes out that Han Mone had his child,

372
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:58,685
the truth that Sim Jun Seok is K will come out.

373
00:18:58,686 --> 00:18:59,916
All of this...

374
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,986
couldn't have been done by Sim Jun Seok alone.

375
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:04,857
I'm positive...

376
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:07,666
that Sungchan Group protected him.

377
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:11,995
That's possible. Especially since it's Sungchan Group.

378
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:13,935
I made TIKITAKA to find out...

379
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:15,236
what happened to Da Mi.

380
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,506
Then,

381
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:20,607
I went through all the messages of the people involved...

382
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:23,446
and recreated the incident from five years ago...

383
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,817
one piece at a time.

384
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:30,416
Finally, The whole puzzle has come together.

385
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:33,256
The culprit...

386
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:34,686
was Sim Jun Seok,

387
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:37,756
K.

388
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:50,807
K wrapped up Mone's lie.

389
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,037
Unfortunately,

390
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:56,446
everything went as K wished.

391
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:02,117
Dad.

392
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,156
Don't do this, Dad.

393
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,357
- Dad! - Bang!

394
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:18,736
Dad.

395
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:23,436
People will watch this deep fake video...

396
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,206
and believe that Lee Hwi So killed his daughter.

397
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:34,277
I'm going to send you an address.

398
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,586
Whether you go there...

399
00:20:36,587 --> 00:20:38,985
and get help is up to you.

400
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:40,256
Grandpa.

401
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:44,287
Thank you.

402
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:46,956
Thank you.

403
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,827
Thank you, Grandpa.

404
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,765
(Sungchan Group will support prevent digital crimes.)

405
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:57,976
What kind of place...

406
00:20:58,377 --> 00:20:59,807
is this?

407
00:20:59,877 --> 00:21:01,946
Since it's sponsored by Sungchan Group,

408
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:04,246
- we can trust it. - At that point, neither Mr. Bang...

409
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:08,716
nor Da Mi had any idea about the dark secret of that place.

410
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:12,617
Relax. This is a safe place.

411
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,327
Could you bring us some hot tea?

412
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:18,226
Yes, Director.

413
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:23,066
We've heard about you, Da Mi.

414
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:24,637
It's all a lie.

415
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,166
Help me.

416
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:32,406
Sim Jun Seok...

417
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:35,277
must have followed Da Mi from the support center.

418
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:44,516
We've arrived at Seoul's Culture Forest.

419
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:46,857
I can go on my own from here.

420
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:48,656
Dad said he would come.

421
00:21:49,456 --> 00:21:51,897
Thank you so much for the ride.

422
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:09,377
Okay. I'll head over.

423
00:22:11,176 --> 00:22:15,246
Play the pre-recorded live stream of Bobble that I made exactly at 7.

424
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:21,827
Because this deep fake technology has never been seen before,

425
00:22:22,486 --> 00:22:24,226
everyone will be fooled.

426
00:22:27,627 --> 00:22:28,726
Han Mone.

427
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:33,867
Da Mi.

428
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:36,637
Are you ready to reveal the truth?

429
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:39,537
Once I become a star, I'll repay you for everything.

430
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:42,206
So please don't do the live stream.

431
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:45,077
You're saying you don't want to lose anything.

432
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:47,246
You're out of chances now.

433
00:22:49,516 --> 00:22:50,617
Stop right there.

434
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:11,906
(Bobble Finally Tells All About Her Forbidden Love!)

435
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:16,547
Hello?

436
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:17,946
I...

437
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:20,716
think I killed Da Mi.

438
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:29,956
Han Mone!

439
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:36,196
After that,

440
00:23:36,926 --> 00:23:38,936
I found out Da Mi met Han Mone and Yang Jin Mo...

441
00:23:39,637 --> 00:23:41,367
from the messages they had sent to each other.

442
00:24:21,506 --> 00:24:22,676
I found her.

443
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:26,077
And Geum La Hui...

444
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:27,946
met Da Mi as well.

445
00:24:28,387 --> 00:24:29,915
Mom!

446
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,317
Mom!

447
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,117
What happened? Who did this to you?

448
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:40,156
Please save me, Mom!

449
00:24:41,027 --> 00:24:42,966
Be quiet.

450
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:45,496
Get away from my daughter.

451
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:48,137
Sorry.

452
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:53,176
Bang Da Mi.

453
00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:54,877
Listen to me carefully.

454
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,176
This is your last chance.

455
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:00,617
Cancel the live stream right away.

456
00:25:00,777 --> 00:25:03,246
You know I can't do that.

457
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:05,557
Everyone needs to know...

458
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,287
how I have been framed!

459
00:25:09,226 --> 00:25:11,287
Answer me! Say you'll cancel it!

460
00:25:12,297 --> 00:25:13,655
You have no other choice.

461
00:25:13,656 --> 00:25:14,656
If you don't,

462
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:18,597
our relationship is over.

463
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:21,166
Mom.

464
00:25:22,607 --> 00:25:26,577
You weren't such a bad person.

465
00:25:27,337 --> 00:25:28,847
Mom.

466
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:33,916
Mom. I'm sorry for being rude to you earlier.

467
00:25:34,077 --> 00:25:37,046
I must've been out of my mind. I won't do it again.

468
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:38,216
I'm sorry.

469
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:39,557
Please.

470
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:42,926
Please be my mom just this once.

471
00:25:43,327 --> 00:25:44,387
Please?

472
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:47,995
I won't ask for anything ever again.

473
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:50,266
Please, Mom.

474
00:25:50,827 --> 00:25:52,665
Please, Mom.

475
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:54,367
What do you want me to do?

476
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:56,637
Let's make a decision already.

477
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,077
Please, Mom!

478
00:25:58,107 --> 00:26:00,537
Please, Mom! Please!

479
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:05,277
Take her.

480
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:10,147
Make sure she can't talk,

481
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:13,817
no matter what you have to do.

482
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:17,226
Mom.

483
00:26:38,006 --> 00:26:39,216
Gosh.

484
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:42,746
Where is that punk, Hong Man Doo?

485
00:26:44,956 --> 00:26:46,087
Gosh.

486
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:53,057
But soon after,

487
00:26:53,627 --> 00:26:55,226
someone took Da Mi...

488
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:57,426
from Joo Yong Ju.

489
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:02,936
Hey.

490
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:08,107
That person...

491
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:10,176
was K,

492
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:11,547
Sim Jun Seok.

493
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,037
And one day,

494
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:39,006
I remembered something I should've forgotten forever.

495
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:46,016
Da Mi.

496
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,216
The moment...

497
00:27:48,587 --> 00:27:50,047
Da Mi died in front of me.

498
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,486
Dad.

499
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:58,226
Da Mi.

500
00:27:58,996 --> 00:28:00,097
Da Mi.

501
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:03,297
Dad.

502
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:06,496
Da Mi.

503
00:28:10,436 --> 00:28:11,506
Da Mi.

504
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:13,206
Save me.

505
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:15,376
- Please save me. - Dad.

506
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:16,777
If you don't save me,

507
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:18,347
the hunter will...

508
00:28:25,186 --> 00:28:26,416
shoot me.

509
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:29,357
Da Mi.

510
00:28:30,256 --> 00:28:31,287
Da Mi.

511
00:28:31,897 --> 00:28:33,557
Da Mi.

512
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:37,766
Da Mi.

513
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:39,996
It wasn't you, right?

514
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:44,307
You didn't do it, right?

515
00:28:44,637 --> 00:28:47,705
Da Mi. No!

516
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,946
Da Mi!

517
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:57,216
Don't.

518
00:28:58,857 --> 00:28:59,986
Da Mi died...

519
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:03,857
thinking her own dad betrayed her.

520
00:29:04,857 --> 00:29:06,057
No!

521
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:09,327
Da Mi.

522
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:11,766
No.

523
00:29:13,637 --> 00:29:15,436
No. Da Mi!

524
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:21,746
(Enjoy Seoul's Culture Forest)

525
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:24,406
That's the reason...

526
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,676
I can never forgive K.

527
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:31,387
Even now, I sometimes hear his laugh.

528
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:35,287
It drives me crazy.

529
00:29:42,097 --> 00:29:43,696
Do Hyuk. I know...

530
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:45,996
better than anyone how you feel.

531
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:51,037
I'm very sorry.

532
00:29:53,006 --> 00:29:54,837
Your family was sacrificed.

533
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,716
There was a time when I resented you.

534
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:06,117
But the real villain is someone else,

535
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:09,426
and he lives a double life as a good person.

536
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:12,827
I can't accept that.

537
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,765
(Welcome, Lee Hwi So)

538
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:25,436
(Welcome, Lee Hwi So)

539
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:27,936
He's warning me.

540
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:31,307
He knows who I am.

541
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:34,317
He wants me to come after him.

542
00:30:35,117 --> 00:30:37,787
You mean your cover's blown already?

543
00:30:39,557 --> 00:30:42,956
We'll play tag if that's what he wants.

544
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:12,387
I'm pregnant with his baby.

545
00:31:14,887 --> 00:31:15,926
What?

546
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:18,327
Don't you know what a player he is?

547
00:31:19,956 --> 00:31:22,597
You run errands for his family for cheap.

548
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:26,735
I'd rather date a player than a thug.

549
00:31:26,736 --> 00:31:29,106
I don't care how you treat me.

550
00:31:29,107 --> 00:31:30,206
But...

551
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:32,577
don't ruin yourself.

552
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:38,107
Who do you think did this to me?

553
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:44,887
Stop caring about me.

554
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:51,527
This is the last time we will meet.

555
00:31:53,327 --> 00:31:54,327
La Hui.

556
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:56,696
La Hui!

557
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:02,107
La Hui.

558
00:32:03,837 --> 00:32:05,006
Take my umbrella.

559
00:32:05,777 --> 00:32:07,436
You hate being in the rain.

560
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,996
I must relay some unfortunate news.

561
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:35,165
The skeleton found at Lee Hwi So's suicide site...

562
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:36,905
was identified as Bang Da Mi,

563
00:32:36,906 --> 00:32:39,837
the teenager who disappeared five years ago.

564
00:32:40,236 --> 00:32:43,106
Police stated the DNA matched...

565
00:32:43,107 --> 00:32:45,445
those from blood samples from the site...

566
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:47,215
of the shooting at Seoul Culture Forest,

567
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,416
which led to a speedy identification.

568
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:52,485
The National Forensic Service autopsy identified...

569
00:32:52,486 --> 00:32:54,516
the cause of death as a gunshot to the right chest.

570
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:57,455
Police say it's likely she died on site...

571
00:32:57,456 --> 00:33:00,496
when she disappeared five years ago,

572
00:33:00,726 --> 00:33:03,926
but as the culprit Lee Hwi So committed suicide,

573
00:33:04,027 --> 00:33:07,897
the truth behind Bang's death is still a mystery.

574
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:11,235
I stand before you today...

575
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:12,476
with a solemn heart.

576
00:33:14,236 --> 00:33:17,206
The murderer Lee Hwi So who maintained his innocence...

577
00:33:17,347 --> 00:33:20,945
returned to where he had hidden Bang Da Mi's corpse...

578
00:33:20,946 --> 00:33:22,716
and ended his own life.

579
00:33:23,246 --> 00:33:25,416
With that, he proved his guilt.

580
00:33:26,186 --> 00:33:27,486
His miserable end...

581
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:30,827
shows that eventually, the truth comes out,

582
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,027
- and that justice prevails. - Let's put this on.

583
00:33:34,797 --> 00:33:37,726
However, Bang's sad life and death...

584
00:33:38,537 --> 00:33:40,766
made me think as an adult who lived in the same era,

585
00:33:41,097 --> 00:33:42,506
and as prosecutor general.

586
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:45,107
I felt terrible.

588

innocent children and teenagers don't fall victim,

590
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:55,246
I promise to crack down on sexual crimes.

591
00:33:57,617 --> 00:34:00,317
I offer my condolences to Bang Da Mi.

592
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:02,185
That's all.

You and Ms. Geum were involved in a scandal.

00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:01,197
What do you mean?

738
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,536
Ms. Geum.

739
00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:05,507
I have bad news.

740
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:06,876
What is it?

741
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:08,436
My family's back.

742
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:10,076
They're at the airport.

743
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:12,677
Someone flew them in.

744
00:42:45,706 --> 00:42:46,717

(Song Ji A)

748
00:43:22,217 --> 00:43:23,345
Song Ji A.

749
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:25,587
You decided to come back and work for me?

750
00:43:26,016 --> 00:43:27,157
As if.

751
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:30,326
I called to tell you I have something.

752
00:43:30,987 --> 00:43:32,056
Your weakness.

753
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:33,596
How exciting.

754
00:43:34,096 --> 00:43:35,697
You can't afford to be so calm.

755
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,967
Your stupid threats can't harm me.

756
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:41,036
Sim Jun Seok.

757
00:43:46,107 --> 00:43:47,536
What?

758
00:43:47,806 --> 00:43:49,476
I saw with my own eyes.

759
00:43:50,007 --> 00:43:52,576
You drove off with him in a convertible.

760
00:43:54,346 --> 00:43:55,576
No way.

761
00:43:56,186 --> 00:43:57,846
What are you on about?

762
00:43:58,587 --> 00:43:59,786
Shall I...

763
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:04,087
tell the world your lover is Sungchan Group heir Sim Jun Seok?

764
00:44:04,386 --> 00:44:06,797
Or should I go to Chairman Sim first?

765
00:44:07,056 --> 00:44:08,697
Watch it, Song Ji A.

766
00:44:09,197 --> 00:44:11,496
Go after them and you'll end up dead.

767
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:13,766
I won't feel as bad if you go down with me.

768
00:44:16,507 --> 00:44:17,607
Ji A.

769
00:44:18,636 --> 00:44:20,237
Don't be so stupid.

770
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:21,536
What?

771
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:25,246
How will you silence me this time?

772
00:44:25,547 --> 00:44:27,345
You used Mone's fans and her teacher.

773
00:44:27,346 --> 00:44:28,777
What else is there left?

774
00:44:28,947 --> 00:44:30,286
Think rationally.

775
00:44:30,547 --> 00:44:31,916
Do you want to début?

776
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:34,587
Fine. I'll make you a singer.

777
00:44:35,056 --> 00:44:36,785
I'll offer all the support you want.

778
00:44:36,786 --> 00:44:38,757
I swear, on my name.

779
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:40,596
On your name?

780
00:44:41,496 --> 00:44:43,397
How can I trust you?

781
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:44,527
Trust me.

782
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,466
I guarantee your future.

783
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:47,666
I won't go back on my word.

784
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:49,567
You should...

785
00:44:49,806 --> 00:44:50,907
wait at home.

786
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,337
I have a meeting now. I'll come over when it's done.

787
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:54,777
Let's talk in person.

788
00:45:05,317 --> 00:45:06,956
That should work for now.

789
00:45:07,857 --> 00:45:09,927
She knows about K.

790
00:45:10,456 --> 00:45:12,897
I bet she's the one who flew in my family.

791
00:45:13,056 --> 00:45:14,496
No one else would do that.

792
00:45:15,456 --> 00:45:16,766
That's why you must...

793
00:45:17,127 --> 00:45:18,927
stop getting on her nerves.

794
00:45:19,127 --> 00:45:20,397
It got this far,

795
00:45:21,397 --> 00:45:23,266
and we must keep her close.

796
00:45:24,866 --> 00:45:26,806
I'm in no mood for a party.

797
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:28,136
I won't go.

798
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,076
Matthew invited us.

799
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:33,217
What excuse do you have?

800
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,547
Get ready.

801
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:37,987
I'll handle Ji A somehow.

802
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:45,857
(Sungchan)

803
00:45:48,056 --> 00:45:50,266
I won't fall for your lie again.

804
00:45:58,467 --> 00:45:59,737
The chairman's here.

805
00:46:17,427 --> 00:46:19,527
Wait! I just need a minute!

806
00:46:19,897 --> 00:46:20,996
Sir!

807
00:46:21,297 --> 00:46:22,495
Sir!

808
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:23,666
Just a moment!

809
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:24,967
Who are you?

810
00:46:25,127 --> 00:46:26,837
I want to meet Chairman Sim.

811
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:29,536
He's not a man just anyone can meet.

812
00:46:29,607 --> 00:46:31,366
I have something to tell him.

813
00:46:31,806 --> 00:46:34,036
Tell him I know his son well.

814
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:44,746
Hello, sir.

815
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:48,257
My name is Song Ji A.

816
00:46:48,987 --> 00:46:50,826
You know my son well?

817
00:46:52,286 --> 00:46:53,757
Is that true, Ms. Song?

818
00:46:54,956 --> 00:46:55,956
Yes.

819
00:47:07,576 --> 00:47:08,606
Welcome, everyone.

820
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:10,076
Come on inside.

821
00:47:10,177 --> 00:47:11,946
Thanks for having us.

822
00:47:11,947 --> 00:47:13,376
It's amazing.

823
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:15,376
- What a place. - My gosh.

824
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:17,346
- It's beautiful. - Come on.

825
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:23,127
I never imagined there would be a home up here.

826
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:25,657
It's incredible.

827
00:47:25,786 --> 00:47:27,857
It's on an unbelievable scale.

828
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:29,797
It was hidden for a reason.

829
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:32,266
Chairman Lee, the place suits you.

830
00:47:32,527 --> 00:47:34,296
It's so high-tech.

831
00:47:34,297 --> 00:47:36,466
I never have people around,

832
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:37,967
so I'm an awkward host.

833
00:47:38,036 --> 00:47:39,976
Thank you all for coming.

834
00:47:40,377 --> 00:47:42,035
We're honoured...

835
00:47:42,036 --> 00:47:43,846
to get to see your home.

836
00:47:43,907 --> 00:47:45,476
I want to brag already.

837
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:49,276
This party is to congratulate and welcome...

838
00:47:49,277 --> 00:47:51,947
Mr. Yang and Ms. Geum to the TIKITAKA family.

839
00:47:52,087 --> 00:47:54,116
Since we're all here, how about a toast?

840
00:47:54,186 --> 00:47:55,317
- Yes! - Sounds good.

841
00:47:55,587 --> 00:47:57,056
- Yes. - Let's.

842
00:47:58,456 --> 00:48:00,596
- Sounds great. - Let's do it.

843
00:48:06,337 --> 00:48:07,467
Here.

844
00:48:07,837 --> 00:48:09,407
A soju and beer mixer is the best.

845
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:12,407
A toast...

846
00:48:12,777 --> 00:48:14,236
to the both of them.

847
00:48:14,237 --> 00:48:15,507
- Cheers! - Cheers.

848
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:18,947
A toast to you, Matthew.

849
00:48:20,177 --> 00:48:22,116
- Cheers! - Cheers!

850
00:48:36,697 --> 00:48:38,996
This looks great.

851
00:48:41,266 --> 00:48:42,366
Goodness.

852
00:48:42,737 --> 00:48:45,206
Mr. Yang, congratulations.

853
00:48:45,607 --> 00:48:48,205
My daughter is such a huge fan of yours.

854
00:48:48,206 --> 00:48:51,007
Oh, did you say your daughter's name was Erica?

855
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:52,776
I heard from Ms. Geum.

856
00:48:52,777 --> 00:48:54,547
Your daughter is going to star in the same drama as Mone.

857
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:57,086
Come to my office sometime.

858
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,615
Let's talk about signing a contract.

859
00:48:58,616 --> 00:49:00,857
Oh, my. Are you serious?

860
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:04,587
Can you see me tearing up from being touched right now?

861
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:09,696
By the way, Erica goes to the same kindergarten...

862
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,265
as your daughter.

863
00:49:11,266 --> 00:49:13,135
Her name is Han Na, right?

864
00:49:13,136 --> 00:49:16,337
Oh, I think you're mistaken.

865
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:18,665
Han Na isn't my daughter.

866
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:21,476
Sadly, I'm still unmarried.

867
00:49:21,806 --> 00:49:24,947
Oh, my. I see.

868
00:49:25,377 --> 00:49:26,846
No wonder.

869
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:29,717
I thought you didn't seem like a married man.

870
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:32,955
I'm single too.

871
00:49:32,956 --> 00:49:34,415
Because of certain issues,

872
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:37,256
I had to get divorced from my kids' dad before they were born.

873
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:38,686
I see.

874
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:41,356
It must be so tough...

875
00:49:41,357 --> 00:49:44,126
to raise your kids on your own in this harsh world.

876
00:49:44,127 --> 00:49:46,365
Actually, I'm also back to being single.

877
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:47,495
Me too!

878
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:50,736
Gosh, come to think of it, we're all single here.

879
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,277
Lady... I mean, Dr. Cha.

880
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,176
I'm trying to talk here.

881
00:49:55,177 --> 00:49:57,176
Oh, my. I didn't realize.

882
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:58,576
You have such little presence.

883
00:49:59,306 --> 00:50:01,915
Myoung Ji, fate brought us together here today.

884
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,217
Treat me comfortably, like a sister.

885
00:50:04,686 --> 00:50:07,256
Oh, right. Have you signed up for a matchmaking service?

886
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:08,316
- What? - No...

887
00:50:08,317 --> 00:50:11,026
That's the first thing you should do.

888
00:50:11,027 --> 00:50:12,587
- Let me show you. - But why?

889
00:50:13,326 --> 00:50:15,496
Gosh, that murderer woman.

890
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:20,496
Murderer?

891
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:22,907
Did I say that?

892
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:25,506
It must be a habit from my job.

893
00:50:25,507 --> 00:50:26,737
- I've been saying it so much. - Commissioner Nam.

894
00:50:26,976 --> 00:50:28,676
Shall we have a glass of champagne?

895
00:50:28,677 --> 00:50:29,805
Sure, why not?

896
00:50:29,806 --> 00:50:31,447
Why? What is it?

897
00:50:33,317 --> 00:50:34,476
What?

898
00:50:40,257 --> 00:50:41,685
- Great work today, everyone. - Let's go.

899
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:43,825
- Good work. - Bye. Get home safe.

900
00:50:43,826 --> 00:50:45,156
We'll get going first.

901
00:50:45,157 --> 00:50:46,397
- Bye. - Bye.

902
00:50:51,726 --> 00:50:53,436
I'm so tired.

903
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:55,697
Gosh, me too.

904
00:51:13,587 --> 00:51:14,616
Paeng Hee.

905
00:51:24,326 --> 00:51:25,397
It's been a while.

906
00:51:25,726 --> 00:51:27,337
Did you follow me here from the bar?

907
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:31,337
Why? Did you want to slap the traitor in the face?

908
00:51:32,107 --> 00:51:33,706
Would that make you feel satisfied?

909
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:39,076
I was curious.

910
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:41,547
About how you've been living.

911
00:51:42,947 --> 00:51:44,016
I'm getting married soon.

912
00:51:45,116 --> 00:51:47,157
I'm tired of taking care of a man...

913
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:49,685
who has feelings for another woman in his heart...

914
00:51:49,686 --> 00:51:51,556
and doesn't even let me near him.

915
00:51:51,826 --> 00:51:53,927
I'm going to settle down with a man who says he likes me now.

916
00:51:55,556 --> 00:51:56,866
It's someone you know too.

917
00:51:58,226 --> 00:51:59,266
Yang Jin Mo.

918
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:03,136
Mom.

919
00:52:04,136 --> 00:52:05,206
Han Na.

920
00:52:05,907 --> 00:52:07,607
It's cold. Why did you come outside?

921
00:52:10,346 --> 00:52:12,446
Who are you, mister?

922
00:52:12,447 --> 00:52:13,547
Well...

923
00:52:14,746 --> 00:52:16,647
I'm a very close friend of your mom's.

924
00:52:20,016 --> 00:52:21,186
What's your name?

925
00:52:21,757 --> 00:52:22,987
No Han Na.

926
00:52:23,427 --> 00:52:24,456
Han Na?

927
00:52:24,686 --> 00:52:25,826
Han Na.

928
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:28,456
Can you head inside first?

929
00:52:28,697 --> 00:52:30,996
I'll be right in after I talk to my friend.

930
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:33,697
- Okay. Come in soon. - Okay.

931
00:52:36,636 --> 00:52:38,536
Bye, mister.

932
00:52:39,067 --> 00:52:40,136
Let's meet again, Han Na.

933
00:52:41,277 --> 00:52:42,337
Don't rush.

934
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:45,706
Who is that?

935
00:52:49,246 --> 00:52:50,587
I had a baby.

936
00:52:51,746 --> 00:52:52,817
She's Jin Mo's daughter.

937
00:52:54,786 --> 00:52:56,286
Don't come to see me again.

938
00:53:14,777 --> 00:53:16,906
- Gosh, it's nice to see you all. - This is so good.

939
00:53:16,907 --> 00:53:18,176
- It is. - Cheers.

940
00:53:18,177 --> 00:53:19,246
This is great.

941
00:53:22,717 --> 00:53:24,587
Could I please have your attention?

942
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:36,526
I am infinitely grateful that TIKITAKA Studio...

943
00:53:36,527 --> 00:53:38,596
has been officially launched.

944
00:53:38,697 --> 00:53:40,966
We at Cherry Entertainment will also fully support the endeavour.

945
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,135
To commemorate this day, we will reveal...

946
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,407
our first project to those of you here.

947
00:53:46,036 --> 00:53:48,107
In regard to my driving force,

948
00:53:48,377 --> 00:53:50,907
Chairman Lee was very satisfied.

949
00:53:57,886 --> 00:53:58,886
Oh, my.

950
00:53:59,886 --> 00:54:01,616
What? Michelle?

951
00:54:01,857 --> 00:54:04,685
Isn't she Director Michelle?

952
00:54:04,686 --> 00:54:06,696
She won the Palme d'Or recently.

953
00:54:06,697 --> 00:54:08,897
She's the busiest director in all of Hollywood.

954
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,196
I heard rumours that she was a Korean adoptee.

955
00:54:11,197 --> 00:54:14,635
And apparently, her movie schedule for the next ten years is booked.

956
00:54:14,636 --> 00:54:17,507
And the first one on her schedule is a project with TIKITAKA.

957
00:54:18,206 --> 00:54:19,266
Oh, my.

958
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:22,106
She's the director that Chairman Lee wanted the most.

959
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:23,177
And the heroine...

960
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:25,177
is none other than Mone.

961
00:54:26,007 --> 00:54:29,016
- Oh, gosh! Congratulations! - Congratulations, Mone!

962
00:54:30,116 --> 00:54:32,286
- Gosh. Congratulations. - Congrats!

963
00:54:32,487 --> 00:54:35,116
This is the first time I'm hearing this news too.

964
00:54:35,587 --> 00:54:37,087
I'm so honoured.

965
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:40,297
Thank you so much, Chairman Lee.

966
00:54:40,657 --> 00:54:41,696
And Ms. Geum.

967
00:54:41,697 --> 00:54:44,096
Gosh, I'm so curious to know what this movie is about.

968
00:54:44,297 --> 00:54:45,427
Don't you agree, Chairman Lee?

969
00:54:45,927 --> 00:54:47,466
The story is still a secret.

970
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:51,067
But I'm confident that we will not let you down.

971
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:53,705
Oh, if you need any advice from the police,

972
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:55,106
you can ask me any time.

973
00:54:55,107 --> 00:54:56,336
Of course.

974
00:54:56,337 --> 00:54:59,346
We are all strongly bound to each other by camaraderie.

975
00:55:10,987 --> 00:55:12,326
- What was that? - Why?

976
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:15,955
- What is going on? - What is it?

977
00:55:15,956 --> 00:55:19,127
Before that, I have something I need to check with you.

978
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:27,436
What is that?

979
00:55:31,976 --> 00:55:33,817
Please explain this video.

980
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:35,476
But... What...

981
00:55:38,686 --> 00:55:40,087
(Sungchan Group)

982
00:56:09,516 --> 00:56:10,647
It's been fabricated.

983
00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:13,086
It's an elaborately made deep fake video.

984
00:56:13,087 --> 00:56:14,716
Isn't that right, everyone?

985
00:56:14,717 --> 00:56:15,757
Fabricated?

986
00:56:16,257 --> 00:56:17,825
Where did you get that video?

987
00:56:17,826 --> 00:56:19,897
I just received it from an anonymous source.

988
00:56:20,996 --> 00:56:24,127
Right there. The people who are murdering others with weapons.

989
00:56:24,697 --> 00:56:25,797
That's you, isn't it?

990
00:56:34,277 --> 00:56:35,436
Ms. Geum La Hui.

991
00:56:36,677 --> 00:56:38,277
That's you, right, Ms. Geum?

992
00:56:41,317 --> 00:56:43,177
When you burned that handkerchief back then,

993
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:44,987
you were trying to destroy evidence.

994
00:56:48,386 --> 00:56:49,886
Mr. Yang Jin Mo.

995
00:56:51,056 --> 00:56:52,657
Please say something.

996
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:05,567
Tell the truth!

997
00:57:07,237 --> 00:57:08,837
What is this video?

998
00:57:09,436 --> 00:57:13,246
You people were at the scene of the deserted island murder, right?

999
00:57:13,547 --> 00:57:14,616
Well, the thing is,

1000
00:57:15,217 --> 00:57:17,317
it looks like us, but it's not us.

1001
00:57:17,786 --> 00:57:19,885
Gosh, this is so frustrating. That's...

1002
00:57:19,886 --> 00:57:21,257
The police will be here soon.

1003
00:57:22,556 --> 00:57:23,626
What?

1004
00:57:23,627 --> 00:57:25,927
And I am definitely going to give this video to the police.

1005
00:57:27,956 --> 00:57:29,825
You will have to pay the harsh price...

1006
00:57:29,826 --> 00:57:31,697
for lying to me.

1007
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:38,506
Chairman. All of this is because of Lee Hwi So.

1008
00:57:38,507 --> 00:57:40,106
No! Don't say it.

1009
00:57:40,107 --> 00:57:42,305
Our lives were being threatened by that man.

1010
00:57:42,306 --> 00:57:43,376
Stop it!

1011
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:44,377
Lee Hwi So?

1012
00:57:45,076 --> 00:57:46,817
That man committed suicide not too long ago.

1013
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:49,047
Lee Hwi So is...

1014
00:57:51,487 --> 00:57:52,885
not dead.

1015
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,987
I'll say it.

1016
00:57:57,987 --> 00:57:59,456
What do we have to hide at this point?

1017
00:58:01,096 --> 00:58:04,826
The seven of us are connected to the dead Bang Da Mi.

1018
00:58:05,197 --> 00:58:07,436
And so were the people who died on the deserted island.

1019
00:58:07,596 --> 00:58:09,035
We didn't do anything wrong.

1020
00:58:09,036 --> 00:58:11,436
That jerk, Lee Hwi So, is a crazy psychopath!

1021
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:13,676
He did all sorts of bad things to his adopted daughter...

1022
00:58:13,677 --> 00:58:15,176
and even stole that girl's grandfather's wealth...

1023
00:58:15,177 --> 00:58:17,546
to throw his own child in jail! He's a crazy jerk.

1024
00:58:17,547 --> 00:58:19,146
That doesn't make any sense.

1025
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:20,646
How is something like that possible?

1026
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:21,877
It's true!

1027
00:58:22,547 --> 00:58:25,186
What happened that day was a murder show put on by Lee Hwi So.

1028
00:58:25,346 --> 00:58:27,116
He just toyed with all of us.

1029
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:29,217
We weren't in our right minds!

1030
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:36,397
Ms. Go Myoung Ji.

1031
00:58:37,797 --> 00:58:39,297
What on earth is the truth?

1032
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:41,567
Tell me, as an educator.

1033
00:58:43,136 --> 00:58:44,206
Okay.

1034
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:47,737
Mone is telling the truth.

1035
00:58:48,076 --> 00:58:50,107
I have two kids.

1036
00:58:50,147 --> 00:58:53,916
How could a woman like me do something so terrible?

1037
00:58:54,177 --> 00:58:55,377
That's right.

1038
00:58:55,717 --> 00:58:57,947
We all have so much to lose.

1039
00:58:58,047 --> 00:59:01,385
Do you think it makes any sense that people like us...

1040
00:59:01,386 --> 00:59:03,427
would kill someone we just met?

1041
00:59:03,587 --> 00:59:04,726
Matthew.

1042
00:59:05,886 --> 00:59:07,226
You have to believe us.

1043
00:59:12,726 --> 00:59:13,936
Chairman Lee.

1044
00:59:14,797 --> 00:59:16,666
If this incident comes to light,

1045
00:59:16,936 --> 00:59:19,306
we will all end up in a difficult position.

1046
00:59:20,076 --> 00:59:22,837
And TIKITAKA will face huge losses as well.

1047
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:26,677
Are you threatening me right now?

1048
00:59:28,377 --> 00:59:29,476
No.

1049
00:59:29,547 --> 00:59:30,947
It's not a threat.

1050
00:59:31,087 --> 00:59:33,516
I mean we should look for a way for all of us to live.

1051
00:59:33,587 --> 00:59:35,185
If you want all of us to live,

1052
00:59:35,186 --> 00:59:36,786
just answer what I'm asking you.

1053
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:38,987
Did you people kill Bang Da Mi?

1054
00:59:39,686 --> 00:59:42,556
There must be a reason why Lee Hwi So came up with this.

1055
00:59:42,956 --> 00:59:44,527
It really wasn't us.

1056
00:59:45,197 --> 00:59:47,237
The real culprit who killed Bang Da Mi was...

1057
00:59:49,996 --> 00:59:51,067
someone else.

1058
00:59:51,136 --> 00:59:53,036
So who is that real culprit?

1059
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:03,516
I know.

1060
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:04,546
You can't say it.

1061
01:00:04,547 --> 01:00:05,547
Why not?

1062
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:07,186
We're all about to die here.

1063
01:00:07,286 --> 01:00:08,456
Do you know who it is?

1064
01:00:08,786 --> 01:00:10,626
Then just hurry up and say it.

1065
01:00:10,627 --> 01:00:12,927
Chairman Lee might help us.

1066
01:00:17,397 --> 01:00:18,527
Will you...

1067
01:00:18,927 --> 01:00:20,297
really help us?

1068
01:00:21,697 --> 01:00:23,096
If you hear that person's name,

1069
01:00:23,366 --> 01:00:25,866
you won't be able to step away from this mess either.

1070
01:00:26,036 --> 01:00:28,177
I will decide that after I hear who it is.

1071
01:00:30,706 --> 01:00:31,877
Ms. Geum.

1072
01:00:35,277 --> 01:00:37,547
The police have arrived at the front door.

1073
01:00:39,246 --> 01:00:41,056
Whether or not I open that door...

1074
01:00:41,717 --> 01:00:43,186
depends on your answer.

1075
01:00:50,266 --> 01:00:51,366
K.

1076
01:01:00,837 --> 01:01:02,976
It's Sim Jun Seok, Sungchan Group's heir.

1077
01:01:03,337 --> 01:01:04,447
What?

1078
01:01:15,516 --> 01:01:16,556
Don't do this.

1079
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:20,697
(Sungchan)

1080
01:01:21,956 --> 01:01:23,996
I understand what you're saying, Ms. Song Ji A.

1081
01:01:26,826 --> 01:01:27,996
Come in.

1082
01:01:32,507 --> 01:01:34,136
Drive my guest home.

1083
01:01:34,576 --> 01:01:35,706
Yes, sir.

1084
01:01:36,706 --> 01:01:37,846
I will escort you to the car.

1085
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:50,757
What happened?

1086
01:01:54,326 --> 01:01:55,956
I've sent the police away.

1087
01:01:56,027 --> 01:01:57,265
Still,

1088
01:01:57,266 --> 01:01:59,197
this doesn't mean I believe you.

1089
01:01:59,297 --> 01:02:00,467
We won't be...

1090
01:02:00,636 --> 01:02:03,297
arrested as soon as we leave, will we?

1091
01:02:03,467 --> 01:02:05,567
As you said, if this incident comes to light,

1092
01:02:06,107 --> 01:02:07,936
TIKITAKA will face great losses as well.

1093
01:02:08,277 --> 01:02:10,136
I want to take some time to think things over for now.

1094
01:02:10,706 --> 01:02:12,007
But I am a businessman.

1095
01:02:13,177 --> 01:02:15,115
Since I vouched for your characters,

1096
01:02:15,116 --> 01:02:17,286
you should also put something precious to each of you...

1097
01:02:17,447 --> 01:02:18,746
on the line to make things fair.

1098
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:20,047
What...

1099
01:02:20,556 --> 01:02:23,416
Are you saying you want to take something as collateral?

1100
01:02:24,956 --> 01:02:26,286
You even want collateral?

1101
01:02:26,386 --> 01:02:28,657
Are you playing some kind of joke on us?

1102
01:02:32,027 --> 01:02:33,127
Hey,

1103
01:02:33,326 --> 01:02:36,397
all I have is my life.

1104
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:39,206
If you want me to write a will right now, I'll do it.

1105
01:02:39,866 --> 01:02:41,035
Whether or not you kill me...

1106
01:02:41,036 --> 01:02:42,706
is entirely up to you.

1107
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:47,616
All right.

1108
01:02:48,016 --> 01:02:50,487
I will put my career as a doctor on the line.

1109
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:52,587
You know how great that is, don't you?

1110
01:02:53,246 --> 01:02:55,587
I might as well put my position as a police commissioner on the line.

1111
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:56,916
I...

1112
01:02:57,927 --> 01:02:59,487
will put my career as a teacher on the line.

1113
01:02:59,786 --> 01:03:00,897
I will also...

1114
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:04,697
put my life as a celebrity on the line.

1115
01:03:08,967 --> 01:03:10,096
Then, the two of you...

1116
01:03:10,806 --> 01:03:12,507
will put your positions as the CEO of TIKITAKA Studio...

1117
01:03:12,837 --> 01:03:14,306
and Cherry Entertainment on the line.

1118
01:03:15,377 --> 01:03:18,547
I really hope what you all said was the truth.

1119
01:03:20,416 --> 01:03:21,746
I will find Lee Hwi So.

1120
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:25,147
Whether he really is a crazy psychopath like you said,

1121
01:03:25,746 --> 01:03:26,947
or if he's the victim,

1122
01:03:27,757 --> 01:03:28,956
we will soon find out.

1123
01:03:41,797 --> 01:03:44,107
(Matthew Lee, Yang Jin Mo)

1124
01:03:44,536 --> 01:03:46,837
Were you really Sim Jun Seok's lover?

1125
01:03:47,476 --> 01:03:49,607
Then were you pregnant with his baby?

1126
01:03:50,036 --> 01:03:51,575
The baby died.

1127
01:03:51,576 --> 01:03:52,846
It's all in the past now.

1128
01:03:53,206 --> 01:03:55,116
You sure are an amazing girl.

1129
01:03:55,476 --> 01:03:57,816
How did you seduce the son of the great Sungchan Group?

1130
01:03:57,817 --> 01:03:59,217
And he's a married man at that.

1131
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:01,516
Well, anyway, we got over one crisis for now.

1132
01:04:01,757 --> 01:04:03,725
Now, Sim Jun Seok and Matthew are on our side.

1133
01:04:03,726 --> 01:04:05,826
We have nothing to fear because of that jerk, Lee Hwi So.

1134
01:04:06,286 --> 01:04:08,857
Let's all relax and get some good sleep tonight.

1135
01:04:09,657 --> 01:04:11,067
We still have stuff to do.

1136
01:04:11,496 --> 01:04:12,696
What else do we have left?

1137
01:04:12,697 --> 01:04:14,636
There's someone who's trying to reveal Mone's past.

1138
01:04:14,697 --> 01:04:16,936
We have to make her shut her mouth. Her name is Song Ji A.

1139
01:04:17,036 --> 01:04:18,266
Song Ji A?

1140
01:04:19,266 --> 01:04:20,805
Is she still causing trouble?

1141
01:04:20,806 --> 01:04:22,706
Isn't Song Ji A that girl?

1142
01:04:22,806 --> 01:04:24,006
The girl who failed to make her début...

1143
01:04:24,007 --> 01:04:25,177
because of a school violence scandal?

1144
01:04:25,377 --> 01:04:27,317
It's just one thing after another.

1145
01:04:30,346 --> 01:04:31,516
We shouldn't just sit here like this.

1146
01:04:32,016 --> 01:04:33,286
Let's all go together.

1147
01:04:33,587 --> 01:04:36,416
Let's go and threaten her, pay her off, or whatever.

1148
01:04:36,516 --> 01:04:38,186
We should make her shut her mouth quickly.

1149
01:04:39,956 --> 01:04:42,657
Are you going to let a single bedbug burn down the entire building?

1150
01:04:44,067 --> 01:04:46,865
What are you doing? Get up already. Come on.

1151
01:04:46,866 --> 01:04:48,067
- Let's go. - All right. Let's go.

1152
01:05:13,927 --> 01:05:15,027
What's this?

1153
01:05:15,627 --> 01:05:16,956
- Why is the door open? - What is this?

1154
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,596
Is Ji A even at home?

1155
01:05:19,627 --> 01:05:21,237
Did she already catch on and run away?

1156
01:05:21,266 --> 01:05:22,936
Look, her shoes are still here.

1157
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:26,206
Gosh, don't fret about and just call her.

1158
01:05:26,306 --> 01:05:28,107
- I'll try calling her. - Okay.

1159
01:05:31,447 --> 01:05:32,976
I have a bad feeling.

1160
01:05:33,746 --> 01:05:35,015
- I hear it from over there. - What?

1161
01:05:35,016 --> 01:05:36,516
Did she pretend like she wasn't home?

1162
01:05:39,487 --> 01:05:40,657
Ji A.

1163
01:05:41,916 --> 01:05:43,087
Ji A?

1164
01:05:45,886 --> 01:05:47,157
It's me, Geum La Hui.

1165
01:06:20,127 --> 01:06:21,326
What is that?

1166
01:06:23,427 --> 01:06:25,127
(Whoever calls K recklessly will certainly die.)

1167
01:06:25,326 --> 01:06:27,027
"Whoever calls K recklessly..."

1168
01:06:28,837 --> 01:06:30,165
"will certainly die."

1169
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:31,837
(Will certainly die)

1170
01:06:32,206 --> 01:06:33,366
What is this?

1171
01:06:43,217 --> 01:06:45,817
(Whoever calls K recklessly will certainly die.)

1172
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:21,016
(The Escape of the Seven)

1173
01:07:21,116 --> 01:07:23,115
Whoever makes my father mad...

1174
01:07:23,116 --> 01:07:25,386
will pay the price, no matter what.

1175
01:07:25,427 --> 01:07:27,796
The real culprit is still out there. Why must we be the scapegoats?

1176
01:07:27,797 --> 01:07:29,455
I have no intention of dying at K's hands.

1177
01:07:29,456 --> 01:07:31,126
Do you still only value your own life?

1178
01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:32,466
You're Lee Hwi So's accomplice, aren't you?

1179
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:34,466
She's my own daughter that I gave birth to!

1180
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:38,035
Why on earth is K so deeply involved in Bobble's case?

1181
01:07:38,036 --> 01:07:40,576
I can't watch anything bad happen to you too!

1182
01:07:40,706 --> 01:07:42,476
I will stay with you until the very end.

1183
01:07:44,377 --> 01:07:45,846
Shall we begin...

1184
01:07:46,076 --> 01:07:47,147
the bloody punishment?
