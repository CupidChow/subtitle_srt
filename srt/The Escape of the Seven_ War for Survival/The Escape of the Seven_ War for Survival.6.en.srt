(in this drama are fictitious.)

(All child actors were shot under supervision.)

12
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:04,077
(Episode 6)

13
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:07,017
Oh, my gosh.

14
00:01:09,348 --> 00:01:10,917
I think she's dead.

15
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:13,087
Is she dead?

16
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:29,136
Who's there?

17
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:31,577
Be it a person or a monster, it better not show up.

18
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:32,807
I'll kill it if it does.

19
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:36,818
The body.

20
00:01:57,837 --> 00:01:58,967
You called for a yacht, right?

21
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:02,807
Yes, I called.

22
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:05,506
Oh, you were all here.

23
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:07,347
I've been looking all over for you.

24
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:08,408
Is the boat here?

25
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:10,017
We can all get on it, right?

26
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:11,216
How many are you in total?

27
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:13,217
By the way, is everyone all right?

28
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:14,617
Everyone is okay.

29
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:15,918
We're a total of...

30
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:22,287
- twenty-six people. - Yes, there's enough room.

31
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:26,698
Thank you, Father.

32
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:28,597
Thank you, too, Buddha.

33
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:32,397
But why did you come here at this hour?

34
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:35,007
It's none of your business. Just lead the way.

35
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,366
I'll give you enough money.

36
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:38,306
Money's not the issue.

37
00:02:38,307 --> 00:02:40,508
It's just that this island is so dangerous that no one comes here.

38
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:41,947
There's no signal,

39
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:43,547
bats and wild animals live here.

40
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:45,117
There are poisonous plants everywhere, too.

41
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:46,578
Are you all okay?

42
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:48,216
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

43
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:49,217
Listen here.

44
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:51,958
Just hurry up and lead the way properly.

45
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:53,427
(Boreumdeul Dock)

46
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:56,127
Are you sure you're all right?

47
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:01,428
How many times do we have to say we're all right?

48
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:07,807
Okay.

49
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:09,567
We have to get out of here quickly.

50
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:12,237
Jeju's weather can change multiple times a day.

51
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:13,276
Try to keep up.

52
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,578
The only way is through the thorny bushes.

53
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:26,258
Which way should we go?

54
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,127
This way. Come this way.

55
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:30,928
Darn it.

56
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:34,867
Be careful. Go that way.

57
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:37,467
- Gosh. - Yes.

58
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:42,737
- Goodness. - Watch your step.

59
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:43,807
Darn it!

60
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:51,346
Why is that jerk making us go through this?

61
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:53,147
What? Bug.

62
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:55,347
- Goodness. - Move along.

63
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:59,817
- Are you all right? - My leg.

64
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,057
Let me see.

65
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,027
You're bleeding a lot.

66
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:04,597
I can wrap it up for you.

67
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:09,967
The path is too narrow.

68
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:14,668
- There. - Thank you.

69
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:19,208
You'll be all right. Let's go.

70
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:35,558
- Goodness. - We made it.

71
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:38,226
Stop!

72
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:39,427
- What? - Goodness.

73
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,937
I don't think we should go this way.

74
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:49,967
- Wait. - Oh, no.

75
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:51,607
Darn it!

76
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:03,958
Why are you all so scared?

77
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:06,586
I'll go first.

78
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:08,086
- Hey. - You shouldn't.

79
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:09,128
Hey.

80
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:11,128
Don't.

81
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:23,467
Get me out of here!

82
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:25,377
I can't move my feet. Hurry!

83
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:27,578
- That idiot. - Hurry up!

84
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:29,276
Darn it.

85
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:30,476
- Gosh. - Pull.

86
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:32,577
- Pull me out! - Hold my hand.

87
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:34,087
Grab her.

88
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:44,328
What happened?

89
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:47,167
- What? - That punk.

90
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:50,568
What are you up to?

91
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:52,137
Why would you lead us to a swamp?

92
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:53,907
I told you to lead the way properly.

93
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,407
The path is gone.

94
00:05:57,938 --> 00:06:00,776
The path was right here, but it got covered by the swamp.

95
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,976
There are poisonous plants everywhere. This is the only way.

96
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:04,677
If you touch one, you die on the spot.

97
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,717
And there are so many wild animals here.

98
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:08,948
Darn it.

99
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:12,388
So are you saying we have to go through this swamp?

100
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:15,188
That sounds like wild boars.

101
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:17,557
The wild boars must be after us again.

102
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:18,757
There's no time.

103
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:21,127
Everyone, do something.

104
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:23,397
Stop whining, woman.

105
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:24,698
If this is the only path,

106
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:27,137
someone has to make the sacrifice. That's the only way.

107
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:29,568
Someone has to be our stepping stone.

108
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,107
"Stepping stone?"

109
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:36,107
Hey, this way.

110
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:40,748
Those people are going to save us.

111
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:42,317
Everyone, don't say anything.

112
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,447
I'll be the bad guy.

113
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:44,917
I think this is the way.

114
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,328
- What? - What's wrong this time?

115
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:51,927
Darn it.

116
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:54,067
What are you all doing?

117
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:57,237
I got so many thorns on me, so I'm taking them out.

118
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,336
Gosh. I can't go any further.

119
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,907
You all go on ahead.

120
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:04,638
- Goodness. - Don't you want to live?

121
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:06,737
Can't you hear the boars coming after us?

122
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,747
- Let's go. - Darn it.

123
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:10,618
- Come on. - Let's hurry up.

124
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:13,948
Gosh.

125
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:19,856
What's going on?

126
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,387
Hey, you jerks!

127
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,026
- Oh, gosh. - Goodness.

128
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,558
- Darn it. - Darn it.

129
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:29,226
- Help! - Oh, no.

130
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:30,938
- Help. - What are you doing?

131
00:07:31,638 --> 00:07:33,068
- Hey! - Stop.

132
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,907
- You jerks! - Hey.

133
00:07:37,378 --> 00:07:38,578
- Stop! - Move.

134
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:07,837
Let go of me.

135
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:42,738
Where did the guide go?

136
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:46,008
That jerk. I'll cut his pay in half.

137
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:47,608
I'm thirsty.

138
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:54,547
I'm going to send that jerk to prison.

139
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:59,557
Isn't that a well?

140
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:02,257
- Water. - It's water.

141
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:03,998
It's a well. I'm sure it's a well.

142
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:08,297
Water!

143
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,187
Move.

144
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:31,758
I feel much better.

145
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:45,437
What...

146
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:47,437
What is that?

147
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:08,787
Those...

148
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:10,628
are monsters that protect this island.

149
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,697
No way!

150
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:15,768
Are we all going to die now?

151
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:23,108
Somebody do something!

152
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:24,677
Someone has to make the sacrifice...

153
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:26,138
to save the rest of us.

154
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:31,018
How could you all do this to me?

155
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:33,047
Shouldn't you at least save me?

156
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:37,957
You all said you'd give me your lives.

157
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:39,518
Get it together.

158
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:41,587
There's not a single person here...

159
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:42,827
who can protect you.

160
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,657
- Stop. - Help us.

161
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:21,297
How could you?

162
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:22,628
This is a curse.

163
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:24,968
This is that girl's curse!

164
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:26,998
Shut up!

165
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:28,508
Bring it on!

166
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:30,537
Bring it on!

167
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:49,388
Get it together.

168
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:05,677
Bang Da Mi.

169
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:07,878
I don't care if this is your curse.

170
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:09,848
You can't take me!

171
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:17,018
You're the one who gave birth!

172
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:22,527
It's all your fault.

173
00:12:33,638 --> 00:12:34,667
One more time!

174
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:29,827
What happened?

175
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:31,327
Was it not a monster?

176
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:33,297
Where's the monster?

177
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:35,067
Where did the monster go?

178
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:36,468
It was definitely here.

179
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,238
It can't be.

180
00:13:39,598 --> 00:13:41,407
I fought a monster.

181
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:49,207
Why are you looking at me like that?

182
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:51,248
I'm not the only one who killed them.

183
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:53,378
You all killed them too.

184
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,457
You're right.

185
00:13:58,657 --> 00:13:59,758
You're right.

186
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:01,628
We...

187
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:03,687
didn't kill anyone.

188
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:06,628
We were just protecting ourselves.

189
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:10,297
Whether we were hallucinating or not,

190
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,898
all we could do was fight.

191
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:15,868
Throw your guilt out the window!

192
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,238
I have twins at home.

193
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:22,407
My precious children are waiting for me.

194
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:25,177
Even if it means I have to kill you all,

195
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,748
I'm going to survive no matter what!

196
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:29,087
That's what I was going to say.

197
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:30,348
Bring it on if you dare.

198
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:31,957
I'm going to kill you if you do.

199
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,858
You should be afraid of me.

200
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:38,258
This is the worst!

201
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:43,128
We shouldn't have come here in the first place.

202
00:14:57,947 --> 00:14:59,047
Skeleton...

203
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:03,988
We all drank skeleton water.

204
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:10,998
What?

205
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,327
Skeletons!

206
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:18,498
What are you talking about?

207
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:20,666
There are no skeletons. What's with all the fuss?

208
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:21,968
Are you blind?

209
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:24,437
There are skeletons inside the well, you jerk.

210
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:34,148
Hey.

211
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:36,686
- You're on drugs. - What do you think you're doing?

212
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:37,858
You're on drugs!

213
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,518
Someone must have drugged us.

214
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:41,027
Snap out of it!

215
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:46,898
There are no skeletons.

216
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:48,098
You...

217
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:49,927
are all...

218
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:51,898
hallucinating right now.

219
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:53,697
You're insane.

220
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:58,537
Who was it?

221
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:01,248
What are you doing over there?

222
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:04,917
That guide.

223
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,046
Hey, you punk!

224
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:07,946
Where did you go off to by yourself? What took you so long?

225
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,648
I found a quicker path.

226
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:10,988
It's this way.

227
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:13,218
Once we cross this hill, you'll see the boat.

228
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:15,427
We're almost there. Hang in there.

229
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:16,687
Let's go.

230
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:18,957
If we miss the tide, the boat won't be able to depart.

231
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:21,228
We're almost there.

232
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:04,508
I'm exhausted.

233
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:07,378
Let's take a break. I can't go any further.

234
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:20,487
Hey, mister.

235
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:23,628
How much longer do we have to go?

236
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:26,798
The dock is a little further down this way.

237
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:29,267
You said that just a while ago!

238
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,767
What's going on?

239
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:38,407
What happening?

240
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:40,437
What is it now?

241
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:06,398
Hey. Get up.

242
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:09,167
Get up. Hurry.

243
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,538
Get up. Hurry.

244
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:17,707
Get up. We're in big trouble.

245
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,907
Get up. Come on.

246
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,747
Get up. Hurry.

247
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:38,557
Was this where the dock was?

248
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,167
Hey. Where is the boat?

249
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:43,868
It was definitely here.

250
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:45,996
It must've been swept away overnight.

251
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:49,406
You punk. Are you kidding me?

252
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:51,337
What are we supposed to do?

253
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:52,706
It's not his fault.

254
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:54,507
We have to think of a solution!

255
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:57,878
Darn it!

256
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,558
Over there. It's a boat!

257
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:11,058
- What? - Hey.

258
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,227
We can live!

259
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:16,797
It's a boat!

260
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,898
- Yes! - Yes!

261
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:23,307
That's only for seven people. Only seven people can ride it.

262
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:24,807
We have 13 people right now.

263
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,307
If we all get on, it will sink.

264
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,338
So?

265
00:20:27,747 --> 00:20:30,506
Are you saying only seven of us can get out of here alive?

266
00:20:30,507 --> 00:20:32,577
We need to choose who will get on that boat.

267
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:34,548
Someone has to give up.

268
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:56,437
That is ridiculous.

269
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,777
- Move! - Move!

270
00:20:59,778 --> 00:21:01,648
- Oh, my. - Hey!

271
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:04,477
- Hey! - Hey!

272
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:32,578
Hey!

273
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:19,217
I was joking earlier.

274
00:22:32,368 --> 00:22:33,397
Let's go together.

275
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:36,007
Move, you bastard!

276
00:22:43,608 --> 00:22:45,717
Push!

277
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:08,368
Is it just seven of us left now?

278
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:10,737
What do we do now?

279
00:23:12,237 --> 00:23:13,808
We need to go back to the hotel.

280
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:15,706
What about the dead people?

281
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:16,707
We...

282
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:20,278
were never here.

283
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:23,217
Is that possible?

284
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:25,486
There is nobody at the hotel until 9am.

285
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,457
The employees get there at 9am.

286
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:29,956
If you all listen to me, it's possible.

287
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:32,927
No. I'll make it possible.

288
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:38,898
If we get our stories straight,

289
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:43,467
the seven of us in the boat are the final winners.

290
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:52,377
Oh, goodness.

291
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:55,588
Come on. Work!

292
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:02,388
- Save me. - Oh, my.

293
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,186
I don't have the strength to hold on any longer.

294
00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:06,197
What are you doing? Let go!

295
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:07,997
This boat is full!

296
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:10,426
I came here because of you all.

297
00:24:10,427 --> 00:24:11,936
Pull me up!

298
00:24:11,937 --> 00:24:13,666
That was your choice!

299
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,868
You can't do this to me.

300
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:17,038
Please?

301
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:20,038
Please save me.

302
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:22,808
Save me.

303
00:24:24,348 --> 00:24:25,517
Save me!

304
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:27,278
Save me!

305
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:42,697
- Stop it! - Die!

306
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:44,598
Stop it.

307
00:24:54,677 --> 00:24:55,907
Gosh. Let's go.

308
00:25:46,098 --> 00:25:48,967
Get changed in your rooms and meet back in the lobby.

309
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:39,878
(Cha Ju Ran, Bang Chil Sung's murderer)

310
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:50,227
(Ko Myung Ji, the adulteress teacher of Myeongju Girls' High School)

311
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:52,957
(Ko Myung Ji)

312
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:56,667
(Ko Myung Ji, the adulteress teacher of Myeongju Girls' High School)

313
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:00,798
(Ko Myung Ji, the adulteress teacher of Myeongju Girls' High School)

314
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:14,747
(Min Do Hyuk, the creator of Bobble)

315
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:17,887
Bobble! Ms. Bobble?

316
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,157
- "Bobble." - "Bobble."

317
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:40,977
(Nam Chul Woo, the druggie detective)

318
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:45,477
Drink this.

319
00:27:49,747 --> 00:27:51,017
(Geum La Hui, Bobble's biological mom)

320
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:54,388
(Geum La Hui, Bobble's biological mom)

321
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:56,957
I'm your mom now.

322
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:12,278
(Han Mone, Myeongju High's real teen mom!)

323
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:15,907
How?

324
00:28:17,677 --> 00:28:19,917
(Han Mone, Myeongju High's real teen mom!)

325
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:32,926
(Yang Jin Mo, Scarlet Letter's creator!)

326
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:34,727
Create fake news.

327
00:28:34,858 --> 00:28:35,996
Call it "Scarlet Letter?"

328
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:37,598
- Justice! - Justice!

329
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:46,207
It has to be Joo Yong Ju.

330
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:48,447
Did you find...

331
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:50,246
a threatening note?

332
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:51,378
You too?

333
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:55,288
The jerk did something he deserved to die for.

334
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:58,216
He might have left clues.

335
00:28:58,217 --> 00:28:59,517
Let's search his room.

336
00:29:02,427 --> 00:29:03,657
Check his shirts.

337
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,207
That dirtbag.

338
00:29:24,177 --> 00:29:25,618
It was him.

339
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:27,717
That psycho.

340
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,917
We found drugs in Joo Yong Ju's room.

341
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:33,187
What did I tell you?

342
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:35,257
My gosh.

343
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:38,858
Then were we actually all drugged?

344
00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:42,167
No wonder. That's why I felt so high.

345
00:29:42,568 --> 00:29:45,898
But why would he drug us?

346
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:47,568
What does he have against us?

347
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:49,737
He turned to booze after he hurt his leg...

348
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:51,068
and gambled himself into debt.

349
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:55,048
Did he want to take us down with him?

350
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:57,507
He deserved to die.

351
00:29:58,318 --> 00:30:00,217
Wait. Then...

352
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:03,517
what happened on the island was all a hallucination?

353
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:09,528
No.

354
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:11,697
It actually happened.

355
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:15,568
We killed people.

356
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:17,298
With my own hands,

357
00:30:19,298 --> 00:30:20,767
I murdered someone.

358
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:24,767
Then we are all going to prison.

359
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,638
No way. I can't go.

360
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:28,608
I can't become a murderer.

361
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:30,848
My kids.

362
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:33,648
I can't make them kids of a killer.

363
00:30:34,348 --> 00:30:35,687
Did you forget what I said?

364
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:39,917
We never went to that island!

365
00:30:40,618 --> 00:30:42,827
All this was Joo Yong Ju's doing!

366
00:30:42,828 --> 00:30:43,956
We're not guilty!

367
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:45,197
That's right!

368
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:46,528
We're victims.

369
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:49,798
We got drugged, lost our minds, then killed each other.

370
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:51,398
Or else we'd have been killed.

371
00:30:51,737 --> 00:30:53,368
That doesn't change anything.

372
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:56,736
We're alive, and they're dead.

373
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:58,977
The unchanging fact is that we killed them.

374
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:10,947
Calm down, everyone.

375
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:13,788
The truth is,

376
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:17,457
I'm the Jeju Police Commissioner.

377
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:19,957
What?

378
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:21,497
A police commissioner?

379
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,727
So that's why you had that aura.

380
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,338
Will you please help us out?

381
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:30,138
I think it's best to say I wasn't here.

382
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:33,476
People could question my impartiality,

383
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:35,947
so let's say I was never here.

384
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:40,977
Don't try to get sneaky.

385
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:42,446
You'll just save yourself?

386
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:43,788
You idiot!

387
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:47,118
I can't investigate if I'm a suspect.

388
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:56,926
Fine.

389
00:31:56,927 --> 00:31:58,128
Then say...

390
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:01,838
the host invited me, and I dropped by for a while.

391
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,608
Can you do that much?

392
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:07,407
Very well, then.

393
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:09,977
How do we prove we weren't on the island?

394
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:11,946
First, we must destroy the evidence.

395
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:15,348
Did you bring the clothes and shoes you wore last night?

396
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:18,147
I brought mine.

397
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:20,687
I flushed the accessories just in case.

398
00:32:20,987 --> 00:32:22,888
What if it clogs the toilet?

399
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:26,128
My gosh. You fool.

400
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:28,226
Don't shout!

401
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:30,227
I checked to see the water go down!

402
00:32:30,497 --> 00:32:31,627
How dare you...

403
00:32:31,628 --> 00:32:33,068
There's no time for this!

404
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:37,107
The staff will come in at 9am.

405
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:38,907
We have just one hour.

406
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:41,578
We must work together to get through this.

407
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:45,078
First, you three, clean the pool.

408
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:47,617
If they find any trace of drugs,

409
00:32:47,618 --> 00:32:49,348
we'll all become prime suspects.

410
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:52,057
Commissioner Nam, delete the footage...

411
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:54,157
from the cameras between the hotel and the dock.

412
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:56,987
If you can't, smash things up.

413
00:32:58,157 --> 00:33:01,028
Mr. Yang, get rid of the lifeboat we got back in.

414
00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:08,098
Min Do Hyuk, get all these clothes and follow me.

415
00:33:12,138 --> 00:33:13,378
Hang on.

416
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:18,677
There was a sign here.

417
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:20,318
Let's see.

418
00:33:21,677 --> 00:33:22,847
(Boreumdeul Dock, Inquiries welcome)

419
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:23,987
I found it.

420
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:43,736
I think we're almost done.

421
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:45,436
I'll help out at the pool.

422
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:47,378
- Finish up for me. - Go ahead.

423
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:04,588
Die! Let go!

424
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:13,367
I won't feel guilty.

425
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,767
Anyone who gets in my way...

426
00:34:16,037 --> 00:34:17,468
will get crushed!

427
00:34:51,037 --> 00:34:52,408
Thank you.

428
00:34:58,718 --> 00:35:00,346
This hotel is the best.

429
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:02,988
The bed was huge and so comfortable.

430
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:05,318
I slept without a care in the world.

431
00:35:05,557 --> 00:35:07,457
I wish someone would've whisked me away.

432
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:17,267
Hello.

433
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:18,996
I'll have an espresso.

434
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:21,037
- Nice and strong. - Sure.

435
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:22,737
Good morning.

436
00:35:22,738 --> 00:35:24,167
Did you sleep well?

437
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:26,108
Yes, so well.

438
00:35:26,278 --> 00:35:28,306
Oh, this looks delicious.

439
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:29,747
You look great, Mone.

440
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:31,976
Of course, I would.

441
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:33,417
I'd have no reason not to.

442
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:35,017
Take a seat.

443
00:35:35,318 --> 00:35:37,947
The party last night was amazing.

444
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:39,187
It was.

445
00:35:41,818 --> 00:35:43,557
Can I have more coffee?

446
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:45,028
Me too.

447
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:50,597
Why are there so few people?

448
00:35:50,997 --> 00:35:52,468
Are they sleeping in?

449
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:55,267
You told us to come down by 10am.

450
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:57,667
Yes.

451
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:01,807
- Manager? - Yes.

452
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:05,206
Ms. Geum?

453
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,117
Can you phone the other guests?

454
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,787
They must've had too much to drink last night.

455
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:10,917
Sure.

456
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:29,108
I'm so full.

457
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:30,807
I enjoyed that.

458
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:33,408
Ms. Geum, the rooms are empty.

459
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:35,107
They're not answering their cells.

460
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:37,047
I even had the staff search the paths,

461
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:38,207
and they were nowhere.

462
00:36:38,747 --> 00:36:39,948
That can't be.

463
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:43,887
We all returned to our rooms around midnight.

464
00:36:44,687 --> 00:36:46,017
I checked.

465
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:48,617
Didn't they check out in the morning?

466
00:36:49,227 --> 00:36:50,826
Their belongings are still here.

467
00:36:50,827 --> 00:36:52,258
What are you saying?

468
00:36:52,298 --> 00:36:53,858
Did they evaporate?

469
00:36:55,528 --> 00:36:58,096
How could people evaporate?

470
00:36:58,097 --> 00:36:59,238
Steam maybe.

471
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:05,167
Do you think...

472
00:37:05,778 --> 00:37:08,008
they took a yacht out to sea?

473
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:11,378
- Yes. - They could've.

474
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:12,778
Goodness.

475
00:37:14,648 --> 00:37:17,088
Shouldn't we call the police?

476
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:19,417
Yes, of course, we must.

477
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:24,528
I am the police.

478
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:27,928
Remain here, just in case.

479
00:37:32,198 --> 00:37:33,798
Ms. Geum La Hui the CEO?

480
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:36,867
I believe you hosted this event.

481
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:39,637
Tell me what happened last night.

482
00:37:40,477 --> 00:37:42,347
The party ended at midnight.

483
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:46,576
It was our first night here.

484
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:49,088
We had a busy following day, so we'd decided to end things early.

485
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:52,287
I made sure everyone returned to their suites,

486
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:54,917
then I went to bed, completely exhausted.

487
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:57,887
You didn't hear anyone leave?

488
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:01,858
I went to Mone's room for a while.

489
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:04,096
I gave her a massage,

490
00:38:04,097 --> 00:38:05,867
had a glass of wine, and then came back.

491
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:09,108
Mone's staying in a suite on the top floor.

492
00:38:09,508 --> 00:38:11,267
It's a way away from the other rooms.

493
00:38:11,568 --> 00:38:13,838
A yacht outing was planned for today.

494
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:17,107
Is it your yacht, Mr. Yang?

495
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:20,717
Yes. It was a secret event I'd planned for Mone.

496
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:21,877
How did you hear about it?

497
00:38:21,878 --> 00:38:24,787
There's a deserted island about 20 minutes away.

498
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:27,457
Your yacht was found there this morning.

499
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:29,658
A deserted island?

500
00:38:31,957 --> 00:38:33,128
That can't be.

501
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:36,166
How can a boat that big get washed away like that?

502
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:38,528
I'm not sure. Maybe it wasn't anchored properly.

503
00:38:39,437 --> 00:38:41,937
Did you go to that island last night?

504
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:43,908
Me?

505
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:45,436
I was so drunk that...

506
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:47,437
I fell asleep as soon as I got to my room.

507
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,607
You slept through the whole night?

508
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:53,016
Right. I woke up once.

509
00:38:53,017 --> 00:38:55,217
Joo Yong Ju buzzed my room phone.

510
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:58,117
He wanted to take the yacht out, but I said no.

511
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:03,227
Did Joo Yong Ju take the yacht?

512
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:06,357
He slammed on my door so hard.

513
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:08,128
I thought he was crazy.

514
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:11,697
He talked nonsense about having a great party...

515
00:39:11,698 --> 00:39:13,838
on some deserted island.

516
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:15,667
He was so drunk,

517
00:39:16,108 --> 00:39:17,738
I ignored him and pushed him away.

518
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:20,178
Ms. Geum came to my room.

519
00:39:20,278 --> 00:39:22,306
We had a glass of wine,

520
00:39:22,307 --> 00:39:24,207
and then I went to bed at around 1am.

521
00:39:25,278 --> 00:39:28,346
Oh, I spent a short time at the gym.

522
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:30,448
I met Ms. Ko there.

523
00:39:31,488 --> 00:39:34,387
She was my homeroom teacher, and I was so pleased to see her.

524
00:39:34,617 --> 00:39:36,057
We chatted for a while then parted ways.

525
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:44,767
Okay.

526
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:48,468
I go to bed early and wake up early.

527
00:39:48,537 --> 00:39:50,838
I returned to my room before the others.

528
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:53,378
I had to talk to my twins too.

529
00:39:53,678 --> 00:39:56,107
I had a short workout at the hotel's gym,

530
00:39:56,108 --> 00:39:57,178
and on my way back,

531
00:39:57,707 --> 00:40:01,678
I noticed a guy called Joo Yong Ju visiting the other rooms,

532
00:40:01,977 --> 00:40:04,386
looking for people to hang out with.

533
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:08,557
That was about... I think it was about 1am?

534
00:40:08,887 --> 00:40:12,398
He told everyone he'd show them something amazing,

535
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:14,658
and he took them out.

536
00:40:14,798 --> 00:40:17,727
I think he said something about going to an island.

537
00:40:18,798 --> 00:40:21,237
Oh, I heard something else.

538
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:23,337
Something like the sound of a boat?

539
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,237
But I can't be sure.

540
00:40:25,238 --> 00:40:26,678
I was in bed then.

541
00:40:30,977 --> 00:40:33,378
You can skip me. You know who I am.

542
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:35,948
I still have to interview you.

543
00:40:36,117 --> 00:40:37,588
Is this how you do your job?

544
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:41,787
I dropped by at the invitation of the host.

545
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:45,658
Don't waste your time with someone innocent...

546
00:40:46,428 --> 00:40:47,997
and find the missing people first.

547
00:40:48,398 --> 00:40:49,468
We found them.

548
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:52,028
You did?

549
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,198
Where?

550
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:55,937
On the island.

551
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:59,678
We found 28 bodies in front of a cave by a cliff.

552
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,838
You take that side, and you take this side.

553
00:41:31,568 --> 00:41:33,207
Come on. Hurry up!

554
00:41:39,648 --> 00:41:41,647
You two, this way. The rest, go straight in.

555
00:41:41,648 --> 00:41:42,687
Move it!

556
00:41:47,818 --> 00:41:50,658
Until we figure out how the people died,

557
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:52,928
none of you can leave the hotel.

558
00:41:53,298 --> 00:41:54,298
- Gosh. - What?

559
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:55,628
Please cooperate.

560
00:41:57,028 --> 00:41:59,337
I heard you found the bodies...

561
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:01,338
all in one place.

562
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:03,206
Is that true?

563
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:05,738
Yes. They were stacked and tangled up.

564
00:42:06,577 --> 00:42:08,977
Why? Do you find that odd?

565
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:10,807
Of course, it's odd.

566
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:13,116
How could the bodies be stacked...

567
00:42:13,117 --> 00:42:15,448
unless it was a mass suicide?

568
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:18,616
She's on the housekeeping team.

569
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:19,758
She has something to say.

570
00:42:21,158 --> 00:42:23,758
I saw something this morning.

571
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:26,057
On my way to work,

572
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:30,798
I smelled something burning, so I got closer.

573
00:42:31,227 --> 00:42:33,937
Someone was burning something in a trash can.

574
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:35,198
Someone was burning something?

575
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:36,707
Who was it?

576
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,207
Her.

577
00:42:40,008 --> 00:42:41,678
She was burning clothes.

578
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:44,977
There was a lot, so I was really surprised.

579
00:42:45,948 --> 00:42:48,116
I was supposed to come in at 9am,

580
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:50,117
but I got in 30 minutes earlier.

581
00:42:54,287 --> 00:42:55,387
Listen.

582
00:42:56,128 --> 00:42:57,657
I got up this morning...

583
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,198
and realized someone had gotten into Mone's suitcase.

584
00:43:00,457 --> 00:43:03,528
I had a bad feeling about it, so I burned all her clothes.

585
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:05,528
Then what's this?

586
00:43:06,198 --> 00:43:07,867
It's a man's handkerchief.

587
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:10,767
What's going on?

588
00:43:11,307 --> 00:43:13,678
You said you burned Han Mone's clothes!

589
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:16,648
I can find out about this with a DNA test!

590
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:21,218
Don't hazard any guesses, Detective Kang.

591
00:43:22,247 --> 00:43:24,048
Don't be such an amateur.

592
00:43:25,448 --> 00:43:28,387
These people are in shock.

593
00:43:28,758 --> 00:43:30,886
Don't try to force the pieces together.

594
00:43:30,887 --> 00:43:32,858
Find evidence and use that.

595
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:34,928
Tell the truth.

596
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:38,398
Didn't you all go to the island last night?

597
00:43:38,798 --> 00:43:40,467
Something crazy happened there,

598
00:43:40,468 --> 00:43:42,908
and to cover it up, you burned the clothes...

599
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:47,207
that could become evidence. Yes?

600
00:43:55,617 --> 00:43:56,617
I'll explain.

601
00:44:04,787 --> 00:44:05,827
Ms. Geum?

602
00:44:09,698 --> 00:44:10,767
I'm Matthew Lee.

603
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:29,187
Matthew Lee? TIKITAKA's chairman?

604
00:44:29,648 --> 00:44:32,087
I heard he looked hideous, but he's so handsome.

605
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:34,587
He had a massive mole that made him shy away from people.

606
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,588
Be quiet.

607
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:42,158
The handkerchief is mine.

608
00:44:42,628 --> 00:44:44,298
I threw it in the trash can.

609
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:45,727
Why?

610
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:48,238
Do I have to give a reason too?

611
00:44:51,707 --> 00:44:53,738
I heard you'd be inspecting the crime scene.

612
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:56,076
As the chairman who's backing this event,

613
00:44:56,077 --> 00:44:57,607
I'd like to attend as well.

614
00:44:57,608 --> 00:44:58,678
Please do.

615
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:02,917
I'm the Jeju Police Commissioner.

616
00:45:06,258 --> 00:45:07,318
Nam Chul Woo.

617
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:10,287
Right.

618
00:45:10,288 --> 00:45:11,357
(Commissioner Nam Chul Woo)

619
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:12,428
I'll come too.

620
00:45:14,898 --> 00:45:16,198
I hosted the event.

621
00:45:16,497 --> 00:45:19,128
If anyone should be responsible, it should be me.

622
00:45:19,698 --> 00:45:20,698
Okay.

623
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:32,307
There won't be a problem, right?

624
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:34,846
If they find any trace of us...

625
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,017
Two of our allies will be there.

626
00:45:37,747 --> 00:45:39,117
We must trust them.

627
00:45:42,928 --> 00:45:45,358
Who could have left that threatening message?

628
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:47,597
Mr. Yang?

629
00:45:48,798 --> 00:45:51,097
Could it have been Ms. Ko?

630
00:45:52,028 --> 00:45:53,497
Or the doctor?

631
00:45:55,738 --> 00:45:57,267
Who on earth was it?

632
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,108
Only Da Mi knew I was dating a married man.

633
00:46:02,008 --> 00:46:04,008
Who could have left something like that?

634
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,077
Was it Mone?

635
00:46:11,117 --> 00:46:12,818
Chairman Bang is dead,

636
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:15,858
so why would La Hui pick a fight with me now?

637
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,528
Was it really Joo Yong Ju who looked into my past?

638
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:24,327
Let's not think about it. He's already dead.

639
00:46:24,568 --> 00:46:25,597
It's over.

640
00:46:34,608 --> 00:46:35,608
What?

641
00:47:06,608 --> 00:47:08,207
Why did you help me earlier?

642
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:10,608
It's not your handkerchief.

643
00:47:10,977 --> 00:47:12,508
It seemed like you needed help.

644
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:15,548
The police were persistent over nothing.

645
00:47:17,017 --> 00:47:18,517
I don't trust the police.

646
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:26,298
Regardless, thank you. It almost caused me trouble.

647
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:30,897
To be honest, that handkerchief belongs to our road manager.

648
00:47:30,898 --> 00:47:32,097
You don't have to explain.

649
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:35,838
We must be close.

650
00:47:37,068 --> 00:47:38,738
That island looks creepy.

651
00:47:40,477 --> 00:47:41,678
Let's get ready to get off the boat.

652
00:47:59,327 --> 00:48:00,327
(Do Not Enter, Police Line, Ongoing Investigation)

653
00:48:06,898 --> 00:48:08,298
What's going on?

654
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:10,068
I don't see anything.

655
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:13,137
We were hallucinating because we were high.

656
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:16,148
The aurora behind there was entrancing.

657
00:48:26,557 --> 00:48:29,287
We can bury the body inside that cave.

658
00:48:31,227 --> 00:48:32,727
I don't see the cave either.

659
00:48:33,227 --> 00:48:34,758
Then Joo Yong Ju's body...

660
00:48:39,437 --> 00:48:42,366
The commissioner is here to investigate this himself!

661
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:43,937
Salute to the commissioner.

662
00:48:50,747 --> 00:48:52,048
Thank you for your hard work.

663
00:48:52,508 --> 00:48:54,148
Since this is a bizarre case,

664
00:48:54,747 --> 00:48:56,186
please do your best.

665
00:48:56,187 --> 00:48:57,287
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

666
00:49:00,387 --> 00:49:02,057
Where are the bodies?

667
00:49:02,827 --> 00:49:03,928
Over here.

668
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:16,096
Just think about this situation.

669
00:49:16,097 --> 00:49:17,468
Isn't it so strange?

670
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:20,177
How could all the bodies be in one place?

671
00:49:20,178 --> 00:49:21,807
Especially when they died in different places?

672
00:49:23,207 --> 00:49:25,507
It's true. It was chaotic.

673
00:49:25,508 --> 00:49:28,177
People were eaten by bats, drowned by a waterfall,

674
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:30,787
sucked into a swamp, crushed by rocks,

675
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:32,488
and run over by wild boars.

676
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:35,116
There was a tiger!

677
00:49:35,117 --> 00:49:37,657
A red-eyed tiger.

678
00:49:37,658 --> 00:49:40,258
Where did you see a tiger? Are we living in the Joseon Era?

679
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:42,528
What are you all talking about?

680
00:49:43,628 --> 00:49:45,766
It wasn't a wild boar or a tiger.

681
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:46,996
It was a lion.

682
00:49:46,997 --> 00:49:49,097
Can you all be quiet?

683
00:49:49,298 --> 00:49:52,137
Be it a wild boar or a tiger, all of that's meaningless!

684
00:49:52,207 --> 00:49:53,637
Is this meaningless too?

685
00:49:58,207 --> 00:49:59,717
(Min Do Hyuk, the creator of Bobble)

686
00:49:59,718 --> 00:50:01,448
"Min Do Hyuk, the creator of Bobble."

687
00:50:01,847 --> 00:50:02,917
"Creator of Bobble..."

688
00:50:03,548 --> 00:50:04,988
What does that mean?

689
00:50:05,787 --> 00:50:08,218
The first person to call Bang Da Mi "Bobble" was me.

690
00:50:12,898 --> 00:50:15,658
Everyone. It's time for you to come clean.

691
00:50:16,867 --> 00:50:18,928
Everyone here has a relationship with Bang Da Mi. Right?

692
00:50:19,698 --> 00:50:21,537
Joo Yong Ju said it himself.

693
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:23,936
Yesterday was the day Bobble died.

694
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,107
All of this was a coincidence?

695
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:27,108
Darn it!

696
00:50:28,707 --> 00:50:30,177
Stop with your nonsense.

697
00:50:30,178 --> 00:50:31,707
How is this nonsense?

698
00:50:31,977 --> 00:50:34,318
Why did my mom and brother die?

699
00:50:34,477 --> 00:50:35,877
They died because of Bobble's mom.

700
00:50:35,878 --> 00:50:37,588
They just burned to death in a fire.

701
00:50:39,988 --> 00:50:41,718
I got involved in the worst way...

702
00:50:42,088 --> 00:50:43,327
with Bobble.

703
00:50:43,528 --> 00:50:45,258
Goodness.

704
00:50:45,588 --> 00:50:48,097
The family that lived above Bang Da Mi's house...

705
00:50:48,928 --> 00:50:50,096
Right?

706
00:50:50,097 --> 00:50:51,197
If...

707
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:53,738
this happened because of Bobble,

708
00:50:53,997 --> 00:50:55,637
I won't let it go.

709
00:50:55,968 --> 00:50:57,468
I won't suffer twice.

710
00:50:58,908 --> 00:51:01,307
I don't even know who Bobble is.

711
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:03,947
Come to think about it,

712
00:51:03,948 --> 00:51:05,407
Mone,

713
00:51:05,408 --> 00:51:07,017
didn't you go to school with her?

714
00:51:14,687 --> 00:51:16,287
Why aren't you saying anything?

715
00:51:17,988 --> 00:51:19,628
You were her homeroom teacher.

716
00:51:21,128 --> 00:51:22,258
Really?

717
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:25,096
Why are you bringing me into this?

718
00:51:25,097 --> 00:51:27,198
She was a transfer, so I barely even remember her name.

719
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:33,076
What about you, Mr. Yang?

720
00:51:33,077 --> 00:51:36,178
How would I know a country girl like her?

721
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:42,378
In any case,

722
00:51:42,617 --> 00:51:45,448
we put an embargo on this case, so news doesn't get out.

723
00:51:45,948 --> 00:51:49,517
So keep your mouths shut so that nobody finds out.

724
00:51:53,258 --> 00:51:54,457
Darn it!

725
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:05,838
Hello, sir!

726
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:30,727
Are you okay?

727
00:52:33,937 --> 00:52:35,068
I'm fine.

728
00:52:38,108 --> 00:52:39,307
What's the situation?

729
00:52:39,508 --> 00:52:41,278
We found these drugs in a puddle.

730
00:52:41,637 --> 00:52:44,278
It's a significant amount that's enough for 40 people.

731
00:52:44,648 --> 00:52:46,977
It appears there was a drug party here.

732
00:52:47,048 --> 00:52:49,887
We found 28 bodies piled on top of one another.

733
00:52:50,048 --> 00:52:51,988
We need to investigate further,

734
00:52:52,218 --> 00:52:54,357
but it appears a fight broke out while they were high,

735
00:52:54,358 --> 00:52:55,758
and they ended up killing each other.

736
00:52:56,117 --> 00:52:59,358
There are 29 people who are missing, so why are there only 28 bodies?

737
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:03,068
We haven't found the body of the instigator, Joo Yong Ju, yet.

738
00:53:03,628 --> 00:53:06,468
We found a similarity in the bodies.

739
00:53:06,568 --> 00:53:08,937
Their necks and limbs have been broken.

740
00:53:09,037 --> 00:53:10,306
It's likely to be Blicka,

741
00:53:10,307 --> 00:53:13,037
the drug known as the Zombie Drug.

742
00:53:13,637 --> 00:53:14,837
"Blicka?"

743
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:16,548
The drug from China?

744
00:53:18,648 --> 00:53:19,818
"Blicka?"

745
00:53:20,218 --> 00:53:21,517
Where have I heard it before?

746
00:54:03,128 --> 00:54:04,588
It's me, Min Do Hyuk.

747
00:54:05,387 --> 00:54:07,798
I called you to give you a tip.

748
00:54:08,198 --> 00:54:11,068
But this one is a huge scoop.

749
00:54:11,867 --> 00:54:14,497
You have to give me a lot of money this time.

750
00:54:15,298 --> 00:54:16,767
You know Han Mone, right?

751
00:54:17,037 --> 00:54:19,238
This girl, Han Mone...

752
00:54:49,937 --> 00:54:51,608
- You can't come in here. - You can't come in here.

753
00:54:57,207 --> 00:54:58,278
Sir.

754
00:54:58,648 --> 00:55:00,017
I found a bracelet.

755
00:55:06,557 --> 00:55:08,017
You can't go around touching things!

756
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:10,428
It could be a key piece of evidence.

757
00:55:13,597 --> 00:55:14,698
Here you go, sir.

758
00:55:35,077 --> 00:55:36,887
Are you being serious?

759
00:55:37,648 --> 00:55:39,318
Everything is true.

760
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:41,617
I saw it with my own two eyes.

761
00:55:42,117 --> 00:55:44,287
The cave, the forest, and the cliff...

762
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:46,088
We hallucinated it all.

763
00:55:46,457 --> 00:55:47,857
There was nothing there.

764
00:55:47,858 --> 00:55:49,028
There was no swamp.

765
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:51,097
It was just a small pond.

766
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:52,968
But...

767
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:55,497
how are you going to explain Joo Yong Ju's body?

768
00:55:58,968 --> 00:56:02,878
We definitely buried it under rocks, so how could it disappear?

769
00:56:03,037 --> 00:56:05,477
They found a body eaten by bats,

770
00:56:05,707 --> 00:56:07,576
so how does it make sense that the body buried next to them...

771
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:08,718
disappeared?

772
00:56:09,178 --> 00:56:11,887
Are you trying to suggest a dead person walked out of that island?

773
00:56:12,347 --> 00:56:13,588
There's one more thing.

774
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:15,917
The sign at the dock disappeared.

775
00:56:16,057 --> 00:56:18,128
The sign with the number of the employee.

776
00:56:18,727 --> 00:56:19,787
Check your call records.

777
00:56:24,827 --> 00:56:25,867
There's nothing here.

778
00:56:26,097 --> 00:56:28,238
There's no record of me calling anyone last night.

779
00:56:29,068 --> 00:56:30,738
I'm sure I called them.

780
00:56:31,937 --> 00:56:34,576
You all saw me call someone to come get us.

781
00:56:34,577 --> 00:56:37,678
Then are you saying we hallucinated him too?

782
00:56:37,948 --> 00:56:40,477
Gosh, I'm getting chills!

783
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:43,317
The handkerchief that detective brought...

784
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:45,117
That employee gave it to me!

785
00:56:46,247 --> 00:56:48,758
How could someone who was there suddenly not exist?

786
00:56:50,387 --> 00:56:51,858
This is a curse.

787
00:56:52,088 --> 00:56:53,898
A curse from Bang Da Mi.

788
00:56:54,898 --> 00:56:56,097
Darn it!

789
00:57:13,008 --> 00:57:15,378
Thank you for cooperating with the investigation.

790
00:57:15,648 --> 00:57:17,416
I vouched for all of you,

791
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:19,517
and they granted you permission to return home.

792
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:20,858
You guys can leave now.

793
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:24,457
Goodness. Thank you so much, sir.

794
00:57:24,787 --> 00:57:28,226
With your help, things got taken care of so quickly.

795
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:30,198
I thought I'd be stuck here for a couple of days.

796
00:57:30,968 --> 00:57:32,826
Considering your social positions,

797
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:36,298
I got them to agree not to release the list of survivors.

798
00:57:37,238 --> 00:57:40,238
I've prepared my personal jet, so you guys can leave now.

799
00:57:42,278 --> 00:57:45,207
As the sponsor of this event, I sincerely apologize...

800
00:57:45,508 --> 00:57:46,608
for getting you involved in this.

801
00:57:48,017 --> 00:57:49,048
Goodbye.

802
00:57:53,758 --> 00:57:54,917
Thank you!

803
00:58:02,658 --> 00:58:05,227
Excuse me, sir! Hold on.

804
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:06,597
Hold on.

805
00:58:10,037 --> 00:58:13,007
I know this isn't the right situation...

806
00:58:13,008 --> 00:58:14,878
to bring this up,

807
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:17,278
but I don't think I'll get another chance.

808
00:58:18,178 --> 00:58:21,417
I heard you were looking for someone to run TIKITAKA Studio.

809
00:58:22,548 --> 00:58:23,548
Please give me...

810
00:58:24,448 --> 00:58:25,588
that position.

811
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:28,457
Oh, I forgot about that.

812
00:58:28,718 --> 00:58:29,818
Didn't we have a meeting today?

813
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:34,057
It's time for Korea to make a series like Marvel.

814
00:58:34,698 --> 00:58:35,898
I'm confident.

815
00:58:36,097 --> 00:58:38,797
I, Geum La Hui, created the best production house...

816
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:39,798
in all of Korea in just five years,

817
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:41,838
and nothing I've done so far has ended in failure.

818
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:43,936
If you choose me,

819
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,778
you'll not only get all the projects LH Media is working on...

820
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:49,338
but also Han Mone.

821
00:58:50,807 --> 00:58:53,548
We already have someone lined up for that position.

822
00:58:56,517 --> 00:58:58,686
It would've been nice if we had this discussion sooner.

823
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,718
It's too bad.

824
00:59:00,017 --> 00:59:03,928
I value the worth of a promise.

825
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:08,358
Chairman Lee.

826
00:59:16,198 --> 00:59:20,077
If I want something, I always make it mine.

827
00:59:24,108 --> 00:59:25,747
I won't lose this.

828
00:59:33,187 --> 00:59:34,187
What?

829
00:59:35,787 --> 00:59:38,057
Ms. Geum! We're in trouble!

830
00:59:39,787 --> 00:59:40,827
What?

831
00:59:45,497 --> 00:59:46,528
She's here!

832
00:59:47,037 --> 00:59:48,068
Start filming!

833
00:59:53,008 --> 00:59:54,576
Ms. Geum. Is Han Mone okay?

834
00:59:54,577 --> 00:59:55,577
Is it true...

835
00:59:55,578 --> 00:59:57,707
that there was a mass murder during the Jeju Island event?

836
00:59:57,878 --> 01:00:00,576
Is it true an embargo was put in place to hide this?

837
01:00:00,577 --> 01:00:03,377
There were over 20 victims who were your fans.

838
01:00:03,378 --> 01:00:04,786
How do you feel right now?

839
01:00:04,787 --> 01:00:06,487
Can you tell us about the incident?

840
01:00:06,488 --> 01:00:08,917
- What happened on that island? - I'm sorry.

841
01:00:09,758 --> 01:00:11,886
Please make way. My artist is having a hard time.

842
01:00:11,887 --> 01:00:12,956
Please move!

843
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:14,757
Don't you feel bad for your deceased fans?

844
01:00:14,758 --> 01:00:16,826
You said you loved your fans when they spent money.

845
01:00:16,827 --> 01:00:18,326
But you're turning a blind eye to the deceased.

846
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:19,597
Is this the type of person you are?

847
01:00:28,477 --> 01:00:29,608
Watch your mouth.

848
01:00:30,207 --> 01:00:32,607
Until we release an official statement,

849
01:00:32,608 --> 01:00:34,717
please do not write any articles.

850
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:35,947
If you fail to do so,

851
01:00:35,948 --> 01:00:37,818
we will take legal measures for defamation.

852
01:00:38,948 --> 01:00:40,917
- Mone, please give us a statement. - Mone!

853
01:00:42,117 --> 01:00:44,386
- Mone! - Please tell us how you feel!

854
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:46,927
- When will you release a statement? - Oh, my!

855
01:00:46,928 --> 01:00:48,326
- No! - Tell us!

856
01:00:48,327 --> 01:00:50,027
- Please move! - Give us a statement!

857
01:00:50,028 --> 01:00:52,766
- Make way! - Move aside!

858
01:00:52,767 --> 01:00:54,937
- Don't take photos! - Move aside!

859
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:56,198
- Move! - Make way!

860
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:57,607
- Mone! - Stop!

861
01:00:57,608 --> 01:00:58,837
- Don't do this! - Stop!

862
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:00,377
You can't come up here!

863
01:01:00,378 --> 01:01:01,607
- You can't! - Stop.

864
01:01:01,608 --> 01:01:03,036
- You can't. - No!

865
01:01:03,037 --> 01:01:05,677
- You can't come up here! - Stop!

866
01:01:05,678 --> 01:01:06,747
Stop!

867
01:01:07,077 --> 01:01:08,277
(Mone, Queen of Communication, Turns Silent at Fans' Death?)

868
01:01:08,278 --> 01:01:10,247
(Is This the End for Top Star, Mone?)

869
01:01:11,517 --> 01:01:12,616
(Mass Number of Fans Continue to Quit Mone's Fan Club)

870
01:01:12,617 --> 01:01:14,087
(Mone, Queen of Communication, Turns Silent at Fans' Death?)

871
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:15,157
(They died because they were Han Mone's fans.)

872
01:01:15,158 --> 01:01:16,318
What's the situation?

873
01:01:16,457 --> 01:01:18,257
The public has turned their backs on her.

874
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,056
Negative articles about her are overflowing too.

875
01:01:20,057 --> 01:01:21,257
There's even a rumour...

876
01:01:21,258 --> 01:01:23,326
that Mone committed suicide due to depression.

877
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,067
Advertisers are worried about public opinion,

878
01:01:25,068 --> 01:01:26,596
so they don't want to extend their contracts.

879
01:01:26,597 --> 01:01:29,597
Lora Cosmetics already informed us they're removing her from their ads.

880
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:31,337
What sneaky people.

881
01:01:31,338 --> 01:01:33,577
They were begging for us to sign with them.

882
01:01:36,338 --> 01:01:38,778
Buy all the products in the Lora Cosmetics skincare line...

883
01:01:39,207 --> 01:01:40,878
- that Mone models for. - What?

884
01:01:41,077 --> 01:01:43,448
Make sure it gets sold out in the department stores and online.

885
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:45,416
- If their sales go down suddenly, - This is crazy.

886
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:46,718
there's nothing we can do.

887
01:01:46,957 --> 01:01:49,056
We need to stop this before people start boycotting.

888
01:01:49,057 --> 01:01:50,116
Yes, ma'am.

889
01:01:50,117 --> 01:01:52,557
- Who's in charge of socials? - Me.

890
01:01:52,787 --> 01:01:54,357
Why haven't you posted an apology?

891
01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:56,658
Can't you see our silence is why they're tearing her apart?

892
01:01:57,128 --> 01:02:00,967
I think this is something that Mone should handle herself.

893
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:03,068
Hey. Did you fall asleep or something?

894
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:05,737
Mone's the one who went off the grid.

895
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:07,206
Wake up!

896
01:02:07,207 --> 01:02:09,277
I heard the instigator was Mone's stalker.

897
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:11,448
I heard he hit on her in Jeju.

898
01:02:11,847 --> 01:02:14,177
- What if we used that? - We can't.

899
01:02:14,178 --> 01:02:16,948
We could get criticized for turning a fan into a stalker.

900
01:02:22,658 --> 01:02:25,827
Then what about this?

901
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:41,077
Da Mi...

902
01:02:43,077 --> 01:02:44,148
Da Mi...

903
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:50,417
Do you not care you're ruining my life?

904
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,957
Tell them you had the baby!

905
01:02:54,588 --> 01:02:56,257
Then come to school tomorrow and tell the truth...

906
01:02:56,258 --> 01:02:57,727
in front of everyone.

907
01:02:58,387 --> 01:03:00,556
You prove that I'm innocent!

908
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:02,297
Han Mone was the one who had a baby!

909
01:03:02,298 --> 01:03:05,327
Was it wrong for me to help out a friend?

910
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:08,467
Da Mi, when I become a top star,

911
01:03:08,468 --> 01:03:09,898
I repay you for everything.

912
01:03:11,068 --> 01:03:13,266
So don't do a live stream.

913
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:14,537
You don't have any more chances left.

914
01:03:16,437 --> 01:03:17,508
Stop.

915
01:03:38,968 --> 01:03:41,338
Mone! What's wrong?

916
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:46,037
What's wrong?

917
01:03:48,678 --> 01:03:51,108
I killed Bang Da Mi.

01:04:29,517 --> 01:04:33,516
(Geum La Hui, Bobble's biological mom)

919
01:04:33,517 --> 01:04:37,686
(The Escape of the Seven)

920
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:38,956
LH Media...

921
01:04:38,957 --> 01:04:40,757
will no longer maintain our contract with Mone.

922
01:04:40,758 --> 01:04:42,757
I refuse to quit here!

923
01:04:42,758 --> 01:04:44,467
We're in trouble. Bang Da Mi showed up.

924
01:04:44,468 --> 01:04:46,467
Bang Da Mi was alive?

925
01:04:46,468 --> 01:04:48,797
Yang Jin Mo. Do you really have nothing to say?

926
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:50,367
You know Da Mi too, don't you?

927
01:04:51,408 --> 01:04:53,706
They'll find the culprit themselves...

928
01:04:53,707 --> 01:04:54,837
if they want to survive.

929
01:04:54,838 --> 01:04:56,476
It'll be the future of those seven.

930
01:04:56,477 --> 01:04:58,547
Are you sure that man is Lee Hwi So?

931
01:04:58,548 --> 01:04:59,576
The DNA test.

932
01:04:59,577 --> 01:05:01,377
Are you going to get revenge or something?

933
01:05:01,378 --> 01:05:02,577
What I want...

934
01:05:03,318 --> 01:05:05,088
is to find out!
