(Episode 14)

13
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:08,899
We're in trouble, sir.

14
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,940
Jun Seok has disappeared.

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,309
What?

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,909
When? Where to?

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,879
We're looking into it now, but we're sure he's not on the island.

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,519
I think he manipulated the security cameras and escaped.

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,149
And you didn't know that until now?

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,619
You knew he was talented in that area!

21
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,990
Go and get him right away.

22
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:34,300
If he gets caught, Sungchan will not be safe either.

23
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:36,999
We must find him first, no matter what.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,068
Hurry up!

25
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:39,369
I will do my best.

26
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,059
Did you sleep well, Chairman Lee?

27
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,860
Did you sleep well too, Han Na?

28
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,698
Han Na, should I lift you up high?

29
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,169
There you go.

30
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,870
I sometimes feel jealous about how close you two are.

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,840
You're jealous?

32
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:33,659
- What? - Even if I can't meet Do Hyuk...

33
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,759
Wait. It's being tapped again.

34
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:37,690
I'll call you back.

35
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,728
And 9608...

36
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:42,799
(Power off)

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,799
(Korea Telecom, Long distance calls)

38
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,439
What were you going to say earlier?

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,880
You said you found out who K is.

40
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,579
We were duped again.

41
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,350
Matthew...

42
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,049
Matthew was K.

43
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,250
What?

44
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,319
How can K be Matthew?

45
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,589
Then, Lee Hwi So didn't get plastic surgery.

46
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,659
It was Sim Jun Seok?

47
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,759
That's right.

48
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,198
He pushed out Chairman Bang's plans,

49
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,470
and he used it to his advantage.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,199
Do Hyuk doesn't know that Matthew is K yet.

51
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,439
We have to let him know as soon as possible.

52
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,009
Then, where is Madam No?

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,109
The person I left Madam No with definitely had your voice!

54
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,650
I bet it was Matthew.

55
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,519
I think he lured you using Deepfake technology.

56
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,690
Darn it!

57
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,419
Han Na is K's daughter.

58
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,789
I kept her alive five years ago.

59
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:46,829
Let's meet up and talk.

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,859
(Seoul Culture Forest)

61
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:14,819
Get him.

62
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,929
(Seoul Culture Forest)

63
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,200
Fine. Bring it on!

64
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,580
I'm sorry,

65
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,150
but I don't think Kang Ki Tak will be able to make it.

66
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,660
What? Are you really...

67
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,760
K?

68
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:51,989
Are you Sim Jun Seok?

69
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:55,760
Jin Mo. I warned you.

70
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,470
If you keep acting up, you'll end up like Um Ji Man.

71
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,869
Where is Kang Ki Tak, you jerk?

72
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:10,780
That's why you shouldn't betray other people so easily.

73
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,249
What you said to that wench, No Paeng Hee...

74
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,580
I heard it all.

75
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,950
My daughter is alive?

76
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,358
Thanks to you, I got to be reunited with my daughter.

77
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,129
Should I thank you...

78
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:29,260
or kill you?

79
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:33,999
An adorable lie comes with a price.

80
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,269
No Paeng Hee, who you like so much.

81
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,069
I will kill her first.

82
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,710
No!

83
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,710
Paeng Hee has done nothing wrong.

84
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,350
She only got unlucky and got tangled up with me!

85
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,660
K. I'll do whatever you want.

86
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:58,329
I'll die if you want me to.

87
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,400
I'll become a dog or a pig if you want me to.

88
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:04,400
Woof!

89
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,410
Please. I beg you.

90
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,979
Please let that woman live.

91
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,020
Please...

92
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,520
Okay. Then,

93
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,020
let's chop off one of your wrists.

94
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,869
What?

95
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,239
Prove your loyalty to me.

96
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,438
A promise that you'll be my dog or pig until you die.

97
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,640
A promise that you will live as my slave for life.

98
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:54,179
Then, I will let that woman live.

99
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,390
Gladly.

100
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,189
But you have to keep your promise.

101
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,570
I almost cried because of your pure love, Jin Mo.

102
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,129
I didn't expect this, Jin Mo.

103
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:14,199
Just kill me instead.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,840
What good is it to cut off one of your wrists?

105
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:20,939
Min Do Hyuk...

106
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,280
can never know that I'm Sim Jun Seok even in his next life.

107
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,450
The moment you reveal my identity,

108
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,879
that woman,

109
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,320
my daughter, and you...

110
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,590
will no longer exist in this world. Got it?

111
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,809
I'm sorry to interrupt your rest.

112
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:53,438
I will tell her to be more careful.

113
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,679
No need. Kids should grow up to be bright and cheerful.

114
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,409
I'll get going now.

115
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,249
I have so much work piled up.

116
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,519
- What about you? - I'll head over to the gallery.

117
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,590
I'll call you later.

118
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,590
Ms. Dimples.

119
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,189
Goodbye, Ms. Dimples.

120
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:16,429
This is Yang Jin Mo's daughter?

121
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:18,499
I'll see you again.

122
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,790
Hey.

123
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,029
What were you up to?

124
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,929
Matthew, what about Ki Tak? Did you find anything out?

125
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,470
I've been looking all over for him,

126
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:55,070
but there aren't any signs of life yet.

127
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:56,940
I think...

128
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,169
you should prepare yourself for the worst...

129
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,809
"Prepare myself for the worst?"

130
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,409
What are you talking about?

131
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,878
Are you saying that those jerks at Sungchan...

132
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,209
killed Ki Tak or something?

133
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,549
If K behaves as usual, he would've already killed him...

134
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,350
or would be torturing him in the worst way.

135
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,618
In the most painful way that it might be better for him to die.

136
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,759
Darn it...

137
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,399
Right.

138
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,999
Hurry up and go to your father.

139
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,300
Go and wreak as much havoc as you want.

140
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,670
(When Sungchan Group moves, the world moves with it.)

141
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,200
Yes, sir.

142
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:32,239
Min Do Hyuk will go to Sungchan.

143
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,239
Make way for him so no one can interrupt him.

144
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:39,050
So he can run wild like a madman.

145
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,649
Why did you want to see me?

146
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,050
Is your relationship with Jun Seok true?

147
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,149
Yes, it's all true.

148
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,090
We dated,

149
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,159
and we had a child too.

150
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,090
Don't be mistaken that we were also in love too.

151
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:27,460
We just fulfilled what the other needed.

152
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:29,560
What happened to the child?

153
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:31,930
Are you raising it?

154
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,109
Soon after birth,

155
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,239
the child died.

156
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,779
When was the last time you saw Jun Seok?

157
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,720
I met with him briefly about a month ago.

158
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,350
A month ago?

159
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,119
In Korea?

160
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,659
Yes.

161
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,540
Why on earth did you appear in that ridiculous movie?

162
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,040
Why are you revealing your own weakness?

163
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,220
Were you threatened by Matthew or something?

164
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,519
Who on earth is that guy Matthew?

165
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,320
What is his reason for tormenting Sungchan...

166
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,829
Matthew is not the reason why I decided to shoot that movie.

167
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,359
It's because of Sim Jun Seok.

168
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,099
Sim Jun Seok was worried that his wrongdoings would be revealed...

169
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,839
and killed Da Mi.

170
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,570
And he abandoned me cruelly.

171
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:46,369
K is...

172
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,810
a monster in human form.

173
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:56,680
You can't go inside.

174
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,989
Security. Call security!

175
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,269
Chairman.

176
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:21,580
Where is Kang Ki Tak?

177
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,739
What are you talking about right now?

178
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,879
Who is Kang Ki Tak?

179
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:29,149
Are other people's lives worthless...

180
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,920
if it means you can save your son?

181
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:35,119
Where is Kang Ki Tak?

182
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,629
Mr. Gu!

183
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:41,700
Mr. Gu!

184
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,800
Chairman.

185
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,170
Don't sacrifice any more innocent people.

186
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,639
Let's just die together.

187
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,979
- Stop it! - Stop!

188
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:12,790
Han Mone...

189
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,659
Han Mone. Wake up.

190
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,978
Han Mone.

191
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,489
Can you hear me?

192
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,290
Han Mone!

193
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,460
Chairman.

194
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,970
Are you okay?

195
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,398
- Get him right now! - Yes, sir.

196
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,840
No, just leave him alone.

197
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:58,810
I'm fine.

198
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,738
If it gets out that I met with Han Mone as well,

199
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:04,149
things will be even worse for us.

200
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:07,680
Han Mone never came here.

201
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,850
Yes, sir.

202
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,920
I must meet with Matthew.

203
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,930
What's on his mind?

204
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
What on earth does he want?

205
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,700
(Dual Sonic)

206
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:31,810
Pack a few of these up for me.

207
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,470
Should I prepare about 100 sets?

208
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:35,540
Your great skin is all thanks to me.

209
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,649
Make it 200 sets.

210
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,608
I'll give them out as presents for the production crew.

211
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:42,149
Seriously. You are generous, indeed.

212
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,720
How was it with Matthew?

213
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,289
You're looking radiant. Were you that happy?

214
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,060
Was it absolutely crazy?

215
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,659
He trusts me.

216
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,300
I even revealed my own weaknesses...

217
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,629
and miraculously got the shoot to restart.

218
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,199
You're right.

219
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,269
I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about that time.

220
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,809
How did you reveal that Da Mi was your own daughter...

221
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,580
and even cry so much like that?

222
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,479
You should be acting, not Mone.

223
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,149
You'd be a hit at Cannes and the Oscars.

224
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:22,460
Be careful not to get caught.

225
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,229
The moment our plan gets out, you and I are both dead.

226
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,330
You can relax while you're here.

227
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,529
By the way,

228
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:33,970
how did things turn bad between Kang Ki Tak and Matthew?

229
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,439
I'm sure...

230
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,070
those two didn't fight with knives over you.

231
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,179
I'm sure it's about money.

232
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,509
The money that the old man left behind.

233
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:44,978
I feel bad for Kang Ki Tak.

234
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:47,210
Right before the love of his life,

235
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,979
he became shark bait.

236
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,829
No way.

237
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,269
What if he dies before we even get to him?

238
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:09,899
Hurry up.

239
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:31,330
Do Hyuk.

240
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,430
Run away.

241
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,460
Do Hyuk? Does he mean Min Do Hyuk?

242
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,040
Yes, it's me. Do Hyuk.

243
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,570
Do you have anything to say to me?

244
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,540
Chairman Bang's money.

245
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:48,409
Where did you hide it?

246
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,080
We need money to fight!

247
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,590
Hurry up and tell me.

248
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,259
Three...

249
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,560
Four...

250
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:06,259
Three, four?

251
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:20,240
I think he's dead.

252
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,480
What should we do?

253
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:30,080
Throw him back out.

254
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,889
I'll wire you the money right away.

255
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,659
He will drift far away to sea.

256
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,080
How far along is the artwork?

257
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,480
About 70 percent.

258
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,789
Finish everything within the next three days.

259
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,090
Wait. It's not like I'm running a factory. How will I do that...

260
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,990
I feel great today.

261
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:10,290
Okay.

262
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,399
Chairman Lee?

263
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,760
It's you, isn't it?

264
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,570
How did you think to visit our gallery?

265
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,540
Aren't you Sungchan's enemy?

266
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,409
Anyway, it's nice to meet you.

267
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,879
I'm the director here.

268
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,609
I know that very well.

269
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,218
Why?

270
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:36,320
Do you feel uncomfortable around me?

271
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,449
There is absolutely no need.

272
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,790
I'm very unbiased.

273
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:45,260
I'm not close with my brother at all.

274
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,800
Whoever wants to buy my art...

275
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,929
is always welcome.

276
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,770
It's good to meet you too.

277
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,199
Director Sim Mi Young.

278
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,169
You even know my name.

279
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:02,480
We're having a 20th anniversary party for our gallery in 3 days.

280
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,010
Would it be okay if I invited you?

281
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,719
It's a special party just for VVIPs.

282
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,480
I'll try my best to make time.

283
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,020
This way. Yes.

284
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,490
Right this way.

285
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,629
Oh, my. You're here, Ms. Hong.

286
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,599
I was going to call you.

287
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,800
Coffee.

288
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:24,899
Yes, ma'am.

289
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:27,070
I had a bit of a headache.

290
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:30,000
I heard about your son's engagement being called off.

291
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,269
He almost got into a scam marriage.

292
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,780
They completely tricked us that she was an adopted daughter.

293
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,409
What do they take our family for?

294
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,949
If we bring in a girl whose bloodline is a mystery,

295
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:41,780
we'll only end up muddying our family line.

296
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,090
Those who are from dirty backgrounds always end up...

297
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,619
showing it somehow.

298
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:50,089
When you introduced her as your future daughter-in-law...

299
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,858
My goodness.

300
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,689
She was carrying a knock-off.

301
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:57,500
I had a bad feeling about her the moment I saw her.

302
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,969
If we're talking about bad feelings,

303
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,540
your nephew is even worse.

304
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:06,070
He just doesn't have that noble shine.

305
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,139
Is he perhaps...

306
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,050
a son Chairman Sim had out of wedlock?

307
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,918
Right?

308
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,919
He has a bit of a dreary look in his eyes.

309
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:22,118
And look how he's ruining the family's image in the end.

310
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,830
I can't even lift my head up in public because of the shame.

311
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,159
(Room 303)

312
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:36,769
Where did the patient go?

313
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,539
Ms. Han Mone?

314
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,239
She just left.

315
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,708
She had a shoot to get to.

316
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,040
A shoot?

317
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,279
You should've called to say you'd be late.

318
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,749
Michell chewed us out because you weren't here.

319
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,080
Why was your phone turned off?

320
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,789
I had my reasons.

321
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,790
There's no time. Hurry.

322
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,349
It's infuriating.

323
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,289
That Michell witch. So what if she's the director?

324
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,188
Why is she taking it out on us?

325
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:00,628
I could beat her up if we met elsewhere.

326
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:01,729
Should I do that?

327
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,029
Don't lay a hand on her.

328
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,699
What? You say that when you slapped her across the face?

329
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,340
Michell...

330
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,869
is Ji A's older sister.

331
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,669
Ji A?

332
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,179
The Song Ji A we know?

333
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:19,409
Is that how she knew what we said to Da Mi?

334
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,519
And she's making the movie...

335
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,050
to mess with you, Mone?

336
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,550
Dad!

337
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,859
You killed my dad!

338
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,570
Cut! Okay!

339
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:46,209
- Good job, everyone. - Thank you.

340
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:47,839
- Well done. - Thanks.

341
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,079
- Nicely done. - Good job.

342
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,209
- Thank you. - What's that?

343
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,350
Hey, what are you doing?

344
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:57,948
You can't shoot in this condition.

345
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,919
I won't skip the shoot over something like this.

346
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,958
I'll finish the movie...

347
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,189
and won't quit even if I die trying.

348
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,458
I'll win Best Actress with this movie,

349
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:06,989
attend all the film festivals,

350
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,199
and climb even higher.

351
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:11,129
Anyone who wants to can come after me.

352
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,540
Why did you do it?

353
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,909
Why did you get in the way of the flying club?

354
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:20,840
Because I need Chairman Sim to live.

355
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,309
Why? Why can't he die?

356
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,310
Does it break your heart?

357
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,649
You want to protect K's dad?

358
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,550
Tell me. Why are you getting in my way?

359
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,530
If Chairman Sim dies, so do you.

360
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:44,299
Unless you want to go back to prison,

361
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,730
you should learn to hold back.

362
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:47,369
You're worried about me?

363
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,399
- You? - You can thank me.

364
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,209
Or buy me a meal.

365
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,678
Three, two, one.

366
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,780
When are you free?

367
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,520
When I don't have a shoot.

368
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,350
I'll make the reservation.

369
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:07,789
As Matthew protects Ms. Geum,

370
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,459
Do Hyuk, you protect me.

371
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,129
No thug would ignore a woman who saved his life.

372
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,698
I'm surrounded by enemies,

373
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:16,959
and I need you to get out alive.

374
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,619
Three and four.

375
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,290
The numbers must be connected to Da Mi.

376
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,229
(Proof of Enrollment)

377
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,969
(Lee Da Mi)

378
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:58,540
(Deokseon 3-gil 34)

379
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:07,050
(Deokseon 3-gil 34)

380
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,490
It was somewhere here.

381
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,500
Why the drastic change?

382
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,469
Geum La Hui?

383
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,080
What are you doing here?

384
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:37,780
I knew it.

385
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,809
Did you come here without telling me to take all the old man's money?

386
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,049
As if we had an alliance.

387
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,090
That got trashed long ago.

388
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,289
I came by just in case.

389
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,020
No need for both of us to waste time.

390
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,129
What about you? Why are you here?

391
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,330
Well, you know, I'm full of energy.

392
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,070
Didn't Da Mi live here once?

393
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:06,270
Deokseon 3-gil 34.

394
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,379
The numbers Kang Ki Tak gave us was this address.

395
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:12,750
Now that I'm here, I'm not so sure.

396
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,648
The old house is gone.

397
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:17,719
This playground was built right on the spot.

398
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,750
Why didn't I think of that?

399
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,989
The old man had a child-like side.

400
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,459
He loved to play hide and seek.

401
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,060
I'm pretty sure that somewhere here,

402
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,428
a massive safe is buried.

403
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,169
A playground...

404
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:40,609
What was that? Didn't you see us here?

405
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,938
There were people there?

406
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:45,010
I was too drunk to notice.

407
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,020
Why are you spying like a couple of thieves?

408
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,889
What's wrong with him?

409
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,590
We're drenched.

410
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,020
What's this smell?

411
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,859
I stink.

412
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,060
Let's go for now.

413
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,530
What is this smell? The darn old man.

414
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:07,500
(Deokseon 3-gil 34)

415
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,199
Blood is what's important.

416
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:45,739
Is he perhaps...

417
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,740
a son Chairman Sim had out of wedlock?

418
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:59,020
Crazy wench. I'll kill her!

419
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,060
Hey, Do Hyuk. It's me.

420
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:11,330
Tell everyone to gather right now.

421
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,730
At Geum La Hui's house.

422
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,010
Crazy wench!

423
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:25,580
I will make you pay for running your mouth.

424
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:28,780
You have a new mission.

425
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:30,878
Location, Sungchan Gallery.

426
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:33,750
D-day is 3 days from now, the 20th-anniversary party.

427
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,319
What's the new mission?

428
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,560
Steal the real paintings from the gallery's VIP room...

429
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,100
and replace them with Go Myoung Ji's fakes.

430
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,129
You want us to steal too?

431
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,240
Why at the anniversary party?

432
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,438
The place will be full of guests and security.

433
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,368
How about we reschedule?

434
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:56,010
Hey, you!

435
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:02,419
Do you think I'm asking a favor?

436
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,919
Do as you're told.

437
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,889
Myoung Ji, get invitations for the seven here.

438
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:11,090
Okay.

439
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,429
Attention.

440
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,128
The party takes place at the main exhibition hall...

441
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,199
on the second floor.

442
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,469
The VIP room with all the artwork...

443
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:22,270
is right here as you can see.

444
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,968
If you walk fast,

445
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,810
you can reach the VIP room in a minute and 40 seconds.

446
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,708
Take all the originals to the van waiting outside,

447
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,179
and in their place, hang the fakes from the van.

448
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,780
Excuse me.

449
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,490
Can I be excluded?

450
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,819
A star like me is easily noticed.

451
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,459
There's no exception.

452
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,659
You're in on this together.

453
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,270
If it's a group activity,

454
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,369
leave it to me, a long-time police officer.

455
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:57,639
Stealing requires stamina too.

456
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,839
I'll train the group hard for two days to up their speed...

457
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,540
The person in charge of this mission...

458
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,850
is Yang Jin Mo.

459
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,020
Yang Jin Mo?

460
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:11,550
Why him?

461
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,619
I graduated the Police Academy with honors!

462
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,790
After all the work I put in...

463
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,759
No Paeng Hee, who you like so much.

464
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,770
I will kill her first.

465
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,968
Min Do Hyuk...

466
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:31,770
can never know that I'm Sim Jun Seok even in his next life.

467
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:34,169
The moment you reveal my identity,

468
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,840
that woman and you will no longer exist in this world.

469
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,020
What? You can't do it?

470
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,990
I can.

471
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,689
I'll sell my soul if that's what it takes to pull it off.

472
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:56,230
Right, you can do this.

473
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,429
You've always been a piece of trash, Yang Jin Mo.

474
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:02,500
You've always been a dog or a pig who obeyed K's word all your life.

475
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,609
Faster!

476
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,148
Move faster, more energetically!

477
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:13,449
Faster!

478
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,579
I hate exercise more than anything.

479
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,289
Look. My hands shake so much I don't think I can paint.

480
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,590
You don't care if we all die because of you?

481
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,330
Don't just stand there! Keep running!

482
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:27,929
Up!

483
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,239
Get back up!

484
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,438
Come on!

485
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:38,309
Han Mone, do it! Okay!

486
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,168
One more! Twenty-four!

487
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:42,580
(Obongjip)

488
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:48,649
(Obongjip)

489
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:51,020
Eat up.

490
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,750
Small octopus is great for guys. Eat up.

491
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:01,830
What's so funny?

492
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:05,800
Look at you all.

493
00:31:06,129 --> 00:31:08,799
You all used to be successful in your own right,

494
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,908
and now we're stuffing our faces as if we're being chased.

495
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:13,708
Is that not funny?

496
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:15,208
Who cares when there's good food?

497
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:16,280
Eat up.

498
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,580
I haven't seen Kang Ki Tak recently.

499
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,608
Have you heard anything?

500
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:22,979
He split from Matthew.

501
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,980
What?

502
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,928
Isn't it obvious?

503
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:35,260
None of us have seen him.

504
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:37,060
Anyway,

505
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,469
isn't it better for us?

506
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,868
We're being watched...

507
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:42,340
by 2 people now instead of 3.

508
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:48,740
I'm really curious about something.

509
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:51,480
How does Matthew know so well about K?

510
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,919
He even knows K's family's deepest secrets.

511
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,350
He even knew about...

512
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,919
Chairman Sim's hidden family.

513
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,118
Yes.

514
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,760
Have you forgotten that Matthew has access to TIKITAKA?

515
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,589
I bet he spies on Sungchan the same way he spied on us.

516
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,730
There's nothing weird about that.

517
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,770
I think you're the one who's weird.

518
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:17,899
The reason you suddenly became so meek around Matthew.

519
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,409
The reason you left your kid with Matthew.

520
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,080
Is that girl really your daughter?

521
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,149
Since when did you care so much about me?

522
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,850
Quit asking questions.

523
00:32:34,689 --> 00:32:36,159
Finish up. Let's get back to the workout.

524
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,029
Yes!

525
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,760
One less mouth at the table!

526
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:44,859
(Baek's Diner)

527
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:57,939
Two gukbap and a beer, please.

528
00:32:58,879 --> 00:33:00,050
One beer.

529
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:03,980
Take a seat.

530
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,889
Are you doing this to mess with me?

531
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,790
I asked you to treat me, not buy me gukbap.

532
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:16,429
And at a place...

533
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,530
an hour away from where we were?

534
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:22,340
My first part-time job as a teen was at a gukbap diner.

535
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,739
Blood sausage, boiled pork, you know,

536
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,070
the leftovers.

537
00:33:26,469 --> 00:33:28,270
My family feasted on that.

538
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,350
Thanks so much.

539
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,379
Goodness.

540
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,750
Why did you order alcohol?

541
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:42,490
Are there bikers for hire?

542
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,789
It's for you, not me.

543
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,919
I thought you'd want to drink.

544
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,060
Here we go.

545
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,830
Here.

546
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,869
Would you like a shot too?

547
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:55,399
No?

548
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,750
Min Do Hyuk, you...

549
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:16,290
Why do moms...

550
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,130
care so much if their kids eat or not?

551
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
I'm leaving. You can eat all you want.

552
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,400
- Sit down. - No.

553
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,940
Sit down!

554
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:34,909
Is it that hard to let your mom see you eat?

555
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,679
Some people would give anything to do that.

556
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,250
You psycho.

557
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,069
Goodness.

558
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:02,569
Sit over here.

559
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,909
I'll take them.

560
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,239
Ma'am.

561
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:11,209
One gukbap.

562
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,980
It's just for me. One bowl.

563
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,190
Lady.

564
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,759
When did I order gukbap?

565
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,259
I ordered pork backbone hangover soup.

566
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,460
Pork backbone.

567
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,199
Pork backbone.

568
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,469
If you can't take orders, you shouldn't be in business.

569
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,368
I apologize.

570
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:43,110
Fine, whatever. Bring me the soup.

571
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,880
You were right.

572
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:52,449
Does this mean...

573
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,289
the gukbap is for free?

574
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,059
Yes. What did I tell you?

575
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,190
We just have to say she got the order wrong.

576
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,790
Aren't you proud of me?

577
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,960
You're a couple of losers.

578
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,770
What?

579
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,529
What did you just say?

580
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,069
Did you say that to me?

581
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,178
No way.

582
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,179
- Honey. - What?

583
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,219
Come and take a photo. It's Han Mone.

584
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:25,118
It is Han Mone. Come here.

585
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,189
I'm a fan.

586
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,290
- No way. - Take a photo.

587
00:36:28,759 --> 00:36:30,759
How dare you touch me, you loser?

588
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:32,429
Get lost.

589
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,730
The gukbap's a waste on you.

590
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:38,730
You should know better. You're a celeb.

591
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,600
Say that again.

592
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,299
Shall I post this and get you retired?

593
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,440
Post it all you want.

594
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,540
Make me look good if you can.

595
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,080
You'll do anything for free food.

596
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,049
Have you no shame, you beggar fools?

597
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:59,218
I let you talk, and you talk like you cleaned your mouth with a rag.

598
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,250
Hey.

599
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,089
I hit women too, you know.

600
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,360
Why you...

601
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,159
Hey! Darling!

602
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,730
- Are you okay? - Hang on.

603
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,528
Do you know how much this jacket cost?

604
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,569
I'm really okay. That didn't hurt at all.

605
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,469
Hey, you. Stop filming.

606
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,799
Put it away.

607
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,670
I said, stop filming.

608
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,540
Stop filming...

609
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,639
Honey, are you okay?

610
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,309
- This is great. - What are you doing?

611
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,380
Let's both post videos. You'll...

612
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,520
Don't.

613
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:32,650
get posted nationwide as the diner assaulter.

614
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:34,448
Okay, fine.

615
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:36,259
- Okay, let go. Gosh. - Are you okay?

616
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:37,989
- Let's go. - Darn it.

617
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,730
Let's get out of here.

618
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,670
I'm so jealous of people whose moms are around.

619

(On the day of Sungchan Gallery's 20th Anniversary Celebration Party)

620

Min Do Hyuk.

621
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:43,589
Today will become a very special and incredible day for you.

622
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,429
You can look forward to it.

623

(20th Anniversary Exhibition)

624
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,330
Sungchan's slush fund.

625
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,029
I plan to smuggle out the gallery's artwork first.

626
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:57,899
I will switch out all the real pieces for fake ones.

627
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,509
And I will bring shame to your father's name.

628
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:02,809
- Hello. - Hello.

629
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,810
- Here. - Okay.

630
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:06,350
Head that way.

631
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,449
- Hello. - You're here.

632
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,420
She's here.

633
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:27,630
Red and blue?

634
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:32,469
Hello.

635
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:36,540
You're beautiful.

636
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:37,739
Thank you.

637
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,250
You look amazing.

638
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,559
I love your current drama.

639
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,360
- Thank you. - Thanks.

640
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,739
Matthew Lee, welcome!

641
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,299
You actually came.

642
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:09,480
When I said you'd come, all the VVIPs said they would too.

643
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,778
Don't worry.

644
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:13,408
My brother won't come.

645
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:14,509
I don't mind.

646
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,449
I have important plans and must dash.

647
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,150
We got to see each other and that will have to do tonight.

648
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,049
Congratulations on the 20th anniversary.

649
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:24,360
What a shame.

650
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,730
Let's take a photo before you leave.

651
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,060
Here.

652
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,159
Smile.

653
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,170
One, two, three.

654
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,169
I look lovely.

655
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,040
One more. One, two, three.

656
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,218
There are 15 guards...

657
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:51,880
and 12 paintings in the VIP room.

658
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:53,689
Once the alarm's down,

659
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,219
we have 15 minutes until the cops come.

660
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:57,360
We must be done by then.

661
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,029
We take the stolen originals to the van outside,

662
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,298
then take the forgeries to the VIP room...

663
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:03,460
and hang them.

664
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,429
- Cha Ju Ran. - On standby.

665
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,600
Go Myoung Ji, lead the way to the VIP room.

666
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,899
Leave it to me.

667
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,568
I need a break. I'm so nervous...

668
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:11,798
I keep wanting to pee.

669
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:13,138
How did a scaredy-cat like you...

670
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,409
become a cop?

671
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:16,179
If this plan succeeds,

672
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,110
we'll get a few pieces too, right?

673
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,979
Then I want the Friedrich.

674
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,119
I want the Klimt, no, Egon Schiele.

675
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,889
Mone. Do you want to Monet?

676
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,659
I'm not interested in paintings.

677
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:32,289
I just want to get this done and go home to rest.

678
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,889
In exactly 30 minutes,

679
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,659
we will start the mission.

680
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,369
Why does he keep speaking informally to us?

681
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,778
You are so beautiful.

682
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:54,349
Is there anything you lack, Director Sim?

683
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,948
Beauty, wealth...

684
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:58,020
You have a good eye.

685
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,349
By the way, what is your name?

686
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,519
- Nam Chul... - Oh, one moment. Sorry.

687
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,889
Oh, welcome.

688
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:06,730
Hello?

689
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,759
Auntie. Congratulations on the 20th-anniversary party.

690

Oh, my. Is this Jun Seok?

691
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:19,009
Oh, my. Where are you? Are you in the US?

692
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,468
You didn't know.

693
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:22,409
It's been a while since I came back to Korea.

694
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:25,480
The dress you're wearing today is very beautiful.

695
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:27,279
What a great cobalt color.

696
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:36,690
Are you...

697
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,859
Are you here?

698
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,789
I prepared a small gift for you.

699
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,759
- I'm sure you'll like it. - Oh, no.

700
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,199
- You like avant-garde hats, right? - Where are you right now?

701
00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:49,199
Let's meet right away. I'll come to you.

702
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,310
Hey, Sim Jun Seok.

703
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,380
Is he trying to ruin me or what?

(Sungchang Group Chairman Sim Yong)

705
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:15,290
I said I wouldn't go.

706
00:43:16,299 --> 00:43:17,860
I don't have time to party right now.

707
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:21,730
Yong. Jun Seok came to the gallery.

708
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:24,669
Are you sure?

709
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,609
He even brought me a gift.

710
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:29,409
Come here and take him right away before he ruins my party.

711
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:34,549
Get the car ready this instant.

712
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,499
- Oh, my. - What's going on?

713
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,099
- What happened? - Director Sim. Are you okay?

714
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,069
You must've drank too much.

715
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,799
Jun Seok is here. We need to catch him right away.

716
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,310
What? Who's here?

720
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,520
- It's time. - What?

721
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,159
- Please calm down. - What?

722
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:19,259
Please calm down.

723
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:21,960
Please calm down.

724
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,169
- What's going on? - Let's go.

725
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,429
You cannot do that.

726

- Please stop. - Oh, no.

727
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,639
- What's happening? - Everyone, calm down.

728

00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,568
Oh, my. Aren't you Matthew?

733
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:37,670
I am.

734
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:41,270
Why are you dressed so humbly?

735
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:43,110
I almost didn't recognize you.

736
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:46,250
But then, you look noble...

737
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,610
regardless of what you wear.

738
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,619
You're Director Hong Ji Na. Right?

739
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,520
Do you know me?

740
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:53,689
Of course.

741
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,190
How could I not know the wife of Jijoong Group?

742
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:01,959
Director Sim told me...

743
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,659
there was a piece in the VIP room that she wanted to show me.

744
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,469
Could you lead the way?

745
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,069
Director Sim said that to you?

746
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,199
Yes.

747
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:11,569
That's news to me.

748
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:15,069
Not just anyone can go in there.

749
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:17,580
Only Chairman Sim and I can.

750
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,650
If you put it that way,

751
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:24,580
it makes me sad.

752
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:26,150
I'm...

753
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:27,819
not just anyone.

754
00:46:37,299 --> 00:46:40,299
How does it feel to die in the hands of a fake?

755
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:00,150
We have a big problem. K is here.

756
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:02,859
Director Sim clearly said so.

757
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,860
- What? - What?

758
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,989
K?

759
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,860
I think K has noticed.

760
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,528
Shouldn't we stop the mission?

761
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:11,158
Of course. We should run right now.

762
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:12,429
What are you doing?

763
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:17,569
Report to Matthew right now. K is here!

764
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:20,409
If he blows up the gallery, we'll be the ones to die.

765
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,008
We cannot change any plans...

766
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:25,979
until we get new orders from Matthew.

767
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,380
Move the paintings first.

768
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,449
What are you waiting for, Go Myoung Ji?

769
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,250
Follow me this way.

770
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:41,360
Matthew. Answer the phone.

771
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,699
Gosh. Why isn't he picking up?

772
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,170
I need to catch that punk, K, first.

773
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,880
Darn it.

774
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,069
- Go. - Go.

775
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:33,880
Be quiet.

776
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,860
Sungchan Group will soon be investigated by the prosecution.

777
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:46,860
They will be suspected of selling fake pieces of art.

778
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,929
They'll meet their ruin by becoming fakes which they so detested.

779
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:55,569
(20th Anniversary Exhibition)

780
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,589
Here.

781
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,330
What happened?

782
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:23,929
Min Do Hyuk isn't here.

783
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,130
What?

784
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:26,900
Where did he go at a time like this?

785
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,299
Did something go wrong?

786
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,710
This mission has failed. Let's stop here.

787
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:37,379
Something unexpected happened.

788
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,309
I decide whether or not to stop.

789
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,278
Grab two paintings each as we practiced...

790
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:43,079
and take off right away. We don't have time.

791
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,849
Hurry up before K does something.

792
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,150
You crazy bastard.

793
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,819
If we get caught and killed by K, will you take responsibility?

794
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:54,460
That's not the only way to die.

795
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:57,230
Gosh.

796
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:00,270
Move quickly.

797
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,290
Oh, no.

798
00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:47,710
Gosh, I'm so dizzy. My fingers hurt.

799
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,879
- Here and here. - Oh, Director Sim.

800
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,920
Oh, no.

801
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,459
Where is Jun Seok?

802
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,230
I can't find him.

803
00:51:02,529 --> 00:51:04,028
I was so surprised.

804
00:51:04,029 --> 00:51:06,230
Look at me!

805
00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:08,900
What are you doing? Go and find him now.

806
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:26,350
What?

807
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:44,299
Murder suspect, Sim Jun Seok, is in this gallery.

808
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,039
Who said such a thing?

809
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,779
Sim Jun Seok called the police himself.

810
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,210
This is Sim Jun Seok.

811
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:58,448
If you want to meet me, come to Sungchan Gallery.

812
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:01,119
I'm wearing a plaid shirt and a black baseball cap.

813
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:03,219
That's enough to find me, right?

814
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:05,659
We will close off all doors in the gallery.

815
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
This is the police.

816
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:21,069
A murder suspect is in here.

817
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,509
- What? - Keep calm and stay in one place.

818
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,979
- What? - A murder suspect?

819
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,048
- Please come forward. - What?

820
00:52:27,049 --> 00:52:29,250
- Please come forward. - Please come this way.

821
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,719
(Police)

822
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:35,189
- What's going on? - I don't know.

823
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,420
- Goodness. - What are they doing?

824
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,270
What is that?

825
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,069
What is that chair? It wasn't here earlier.

826
00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:52,339
What is that?

827
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:54,409
What's going on?

828
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,549
Someone died!

829
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:15,929
Where are you going? The paintings!

830
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:17,699
Darn it!

831
00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:33,779
The door's locked.

832
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:36,110
It won't open.

833
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,350
I think they locked the entire building.

834
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:43,060
I think we got caught!

835
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,989
The problem isn't that we stole the paintings.

836
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:48,029
In the worst case, we could be framed for murder.

837
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,659
None of us are the culprit.

838
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,360
We were together the whole time.

839
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:54,869
She's right. No matter what happens, we have to be each other's alibi.

840
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,440
Will they believe us?

841
00:53:56,739 --> 00:53:58,940
We've already done a lot of bad things.

842
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,710
Min Do Hyuk! Are you there?

843
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,639
The door's locked!

844
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,610
Do you hear me? Min Do Hyuk!

845
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,480
Hold on.

846
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,589
I think I saw him earlier.

847
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,719
By the secret tunnel over there.

848
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,819
What's he up to this time?

849
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,130
Do you think he set us up?

850
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:22,360
To frame us for murder?

851
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,429
Did you see the dead woman's face?

852
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,029
We know her.

853
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,999
Ms. Hong from Jijoong Group.

854
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,199
Ms. Hong?

855
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:31,900
They chat with each other on TIKITAKA.

856
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,810
Who do you think killed her?

857
00:54:37,009 --> 00:54:39,540
First, everyone get out of here and go back to the party.

858
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:41,880
I'll think of a way to move the real paintings in the van.

859
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,679
Matthew will cover for us.

860
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,179
Hurry up and move!

861
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:49,819
Hold on.

862
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:53,489
We must not do anything that looks suspicious.

863
00:54:53,759 --> 00:54:55,960
Act natural and calm. Like nothing happened.

864
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:58,929
Like we were just enjoying the party. Be calm.

865
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,819
It was perfect.

866
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:26,830
There's no better partner than you.

867
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:29,190
There's one last thing...

868
00:55:29,489 --> 00:55:31,730
that I need you to do for me.

869
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,110
The final target of today's mission.

870
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,739
Min Do Hyuk.

871
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,968
Can all guests in the gallery...

872
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:16,580
please come to the party hall right away?

873
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,210
I repeat.

874
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:22,049
Can all guests please return to the party hall?

875
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,679
This is an emergency.

876
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,520
Detective Kwon!

877
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,049
We're in trouble, sir!

878
00:56:28,989 --> 00:56:30,190
We found a body.

879
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,520
What?

880
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,588
Please follow us.

881
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,059
Darn it. What is this?

882
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,089
Excuse us.

883
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,230
- Really? - You can't leave.

884
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,298
They're all leaving. Why can't we?

885
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:43,068
We're the police. You can't go yet.

886
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:44,169
Please follow orders.

887
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,239
You can't go out.

888
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:55,009
Oh, my gosh!

889
00:56:58,619 --> 00:56:59,779
What is that?

890
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,088
Oh, my gosh!

891
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:08,259
- Oh, no! - Ms. Hong!

892
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,758
Move aside!

893
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,959
- Move aside! - Move aside!

894
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,060
Move aside!

895
00:57:12,259 --> 00:57:13,299
- What the... - Move aside.

896
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,929
You mustn't be here.

897
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,369
(Father! Do you remember what happened that day?)

898
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,040
Yong.

899
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:19,569
It's Jun Seok.

900
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,068
Jun Seok did this!

901
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:23,779
- Please stay back! - Oh, my gosh!

902
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,580
What is this?

903
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,710
- Move aside! - What on earth is going on?

904
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:32,250
(Father! Do you remember what happened that day?)

905
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,049
Honey!

906
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,060
Mr. Gu.

907
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,130
Where are you?

908
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,429
Jun Seok...

909
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:45,230
- Honey. - Jun...

910
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:46,730
Honey, wake up!

911
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:48,170
Wake up!

912
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:49,599
Honey!

913
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,770
Mr. Gu!

914
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:52,469
Mr. Gu...

915
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:59,239
Jun Seok.

916
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,989
Jun Seok.

917
00:58:09,449 --> 00:58:10,589
Did you do this?

918
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,190
Why?

919
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:15,790
Jun Seok.

920
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,500
Why on earth did you do this?

921
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,100
Father...

922
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,100
No... Well...

923
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,040
Mom kept saying something weird.

924
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:32,239
She said I was a fake.

925
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,279
I didn't change at all.

926
00:58:35,909 --> 00:58:37,980
I'm the same person I was before!

927
00:59:10,219 --> 00:59:13,690
Father. You remember what happened that day, don't you?

928
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:17,420
The day that I killed Mother.

929
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,159
The day that I was completely abandoned by you.

930
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,399
Now, it's you and Sungchan Group's turn to be judged.

931
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,839
And, your real son...

932
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,709
Why do you think I gave Min Do Hyuk...

933
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:18,549
a plaid shirt as a present?

934
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:29,730
Wait!

935
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,059
- Please stay back. - What is this?

936
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,629
- You can't come through! - Let us leave.

937
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,729
- Hold on. Please. - What is this?

938
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,029
- What is this? - Oh, my!

939
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,939
- Just let us go! - Please stay here!

940
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,269
- Things will continue as planned. - What is this?

941
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,400
- What? - Hold on!

942
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,270
Jin Mo, move.

943
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:43,909
What are you doing?

944
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:45,639
Wait...

945
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,779
Why do you think Min Do Hyuk had my precious watch?

946
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,819
The watch that Father gave me as a present. The one and only...

947
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,179
handmade diamond watch.

948
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:55,319
Where did you get this?

949
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,290
There's blood on it.

950
01:00:57,389 --> 01:00:59,118
Yes. I found it in the bathroom.

951
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,589
I held onto it in case it belonged to Sim Jun Seok.

952
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,000
Can you check?

953
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,429
Sure.

954
01:01:06,759 --> 01:01:08,029
(JS Sim)

955
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:09,770
It is.

956
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,298
Seeing as to how the initials are the same,

957
01:01:13,299 --> 01:01:15,239
I'm positive it belongs to Sim Jun Seok.

958
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,638
Arrest him.

959
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,979
Hold on. What are you doing?

960
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,850
This is all a trap that I set up.

961
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:25,779
My plan to turn Min Do Hyuk into the murderer, Sim Jun Seok.

962
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,790
I'll return the name, Sim Jun Seok, to that punk now.

963
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:31,259
In my way.

964
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,230
Be honest.

965
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:41,699
You're...

966
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:43,600
working with Sim Jun Seok. Right?

967
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:47,539
You helped Sim Jun Seok commit murder,

968
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,009
got rid of the evidence,

969
01:01:49,569 --> 01:01:51,409
and helped him get away.

970
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:53,679
Where did Sim Jun Seok run away to?

971
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:59,420
How many times must I tell you it's not me for you to understand?

972
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:00,819
Hey!

973
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:03,190
Sit up straight.

974
01:02:04,389 --> 01:02:05,618
Sir, I'm telling you...

975
01:02:05,619 --> 01:02:08,159
that I'm the one who wants to kill that jerk.

976
01:02:08,589 --> 01:02:11,729
He's the murderer who killed my family.

977
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,259
Then what did you do at that time?

978
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,400
What were you doing when the victim died?

979
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,400
Tell me everything you did...

980
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:20,440
since entering the gallery at 9:20pm.

981
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,610
I know you have a record.

982
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:24,678
Do you know how many times...

983
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:26,409
we caught you acting suspicious on the CCTV cameras?

984
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,379
Call Chairman Matthew Lee.

985
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,049
He'll prove my innocence.

986
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,790
Please give me my phone, so I can call Matthew.

987
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:39,520
Hurry up and give it to me.

Breaking news.

994
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:11,189
Last night, at Sungchan Gallery's 20th anniversary party,

995
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:14,488
the wife of the chairman of Jijoong Group, Hong, was murdered.

996
01:03:14,489 --> 01:03:17,999
The prime suspect is Sim Jun Seok, heir to Sungchan Group.

997
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,299
The police have revealed that Sim escaped at the scene,

998
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:21,369
Min Do Hyuk.

any merciless thing,

1002

If the suspect Sim...

1007
01:03:42,889 --> 01:03:45,318
We were contacted by the president's chief secretary,

1008
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:48,329
and we were informed that during this morning's meeting,

1009
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:50,960
the president called for Bang Da Mi's case to be reopened.

1010
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:54,170
The only way for Sungchan Group to survive...

1011
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,699
is to bring Jun Seok back in,

1012
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:58,900
so they asked us to make a swift decision.

1013
01:04:17,619 --> 01:04:19,989
How is Chairman Sim doing?

1014
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,630
I bet he wants to die.

1015
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:27,029
Soon, things will go the way you want.

about Min Do Hyuk?

1019

Just leave him.

1020
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,850
His father should act first to lock him up.

1021
01:04:41,549 --> 01:04:42,650
Yes, sir.

1022
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,650
What if...

1023
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:52,819
I didn't know...

1027
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,020
Don't say that.

1028
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:27,929
I am just a secretary who supports you.
