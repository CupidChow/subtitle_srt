1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,120
Okay. Okay. Okay.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,760
Pick one randomly.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,640
These are all the rich girls in the city.

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,480
Marriage

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,080
can also make our company

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,720
will be doubled.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,120
It's finally time.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,840
I'm not going on a blind date.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm not going on a blind date either.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,440
You watch that drama too?

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,240
Do you think

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,320
the boss just now?

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,320
Look at him. Look at him.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,280
Look at him. Look at him.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:45,920
Dad.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,440
Don't watch the director's TV series anymore.

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
You've watched it too.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,680
Don't worry, son.

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,320
I asked you to choose

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,440
our brand ambassador this year.

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,160
Take a look.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,400
Let me think about it.

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,480
By the way,

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,400
Do you remember

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,080
I grew up playing with you.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
That's called Ou.

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,800
Ruo-ra.

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,680
Yes.

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,000
Do you remember

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,080
She's back.

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,760
She asked about you two days ago.

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,680
Why do you ask me?

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,400
Ou's Group has doubled the market value.

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,120
Think about it.

35
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,880
No, no, no.

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,800
It's impossible, dad. Think about it.

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm in the rising stage of my career.

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,880
I will never consider

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,720
about love.

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,840
I don't have enough energy.

41
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,120
We grew up together.

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,840
Let's meet.

43
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,320
Let's meet.

44
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,200
I'm not going on a blind date.

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,039
Don't push me.

46
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,880
The market value will double.

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,080
Son, think about it.

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
Li Tian Ran.

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Just help me to go to the warehouse this weekend.

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,000
It won't take long.

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,240
It's weekend.

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,200
You watch dramas and play games at home.

53
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,240
and asked me to go to the warehouse for you.

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,240
Do you think it's appropriate?

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,160
Actually,

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,120
I went to see a doctor.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I...

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,520
I have a stomachache for days.

59
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,360
I can't hold on any longer.

60
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,960
Fan Sisi.

61
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,920
Life and death are important.

62
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,120
You can't just say it.

63
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,480
Is the trust between people

64
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
Is that not worth mentioning?

65
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,680
Shame.

66
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,280
Even if I'm not going to see a doctor,

67
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm not playing games.

68
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,840
It's for the launch of the merchandise.

69
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,000
Li Tianran.

70
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,200
Think about it.

71
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,320
Tell me when you've made up your mind.

72
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,560
Li Tian Ran.

73
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,640
Think about it.

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,160
I would like to invite you to the dinner at 7 p.m. tonight.

75
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,840
Address: Hotel Hilton.

76
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,120
You're killing me.

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
I should have asked the driver to give me a ride.

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,720
Forget it.

79
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,240
I don't have to see Aurora.

80
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,040
Excuse me. Excuse me.

81
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,159
Waiter.

82
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,880
Hello, waiter.

83
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm not a waiter.

84
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,760
You are?

85
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,440
I'm the owner.

86
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,560
One lobster pasta.

87
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,680
Shredded shredded pork noodles with pickled vegetables.

88
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,840
I'll buy it if the noodles are gone.

89
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,960
What?

90
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,640
I went to the bathroom.

91
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,720
They're all gone.

92
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,040
Hello.

93
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,640
Let me introduce.

94
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,040
This is the new employee of the three departments.

95
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,880
He's handsome.

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
This is Kang Mi

97
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,640
who just came back.

98
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,760
Rich line.

99
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,040
Shrimp Exercise.

100
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,040
Your wealth line is so long.

101
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,080
Buy stocks.

102
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,920
You will win.

103
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,080
Win for sure.

104
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,760
Come on.

105
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,120
Give me some luck.

106
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,280
Don't be so petty.

107
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,160
We're all

108
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,360
We're all friends.

109
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,520
Xiaomei, you're here.

110
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,800
Excuse me.

111
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,680
My God of Wealth.

112
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,040
Let’s go.

113
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,520
My God of Wealth.

114
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,480
Let's go home.

115
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,560
What are you doing?

116
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,520
Sorry, God of Wealth.

117
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,320
I’m so sorry.

118
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,640
God of Wealth.

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,080
Have some luck.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Remember to buy shrimp's stocks.

121
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,800
shrimp craftsmanship.

122
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,000
Remember.

123
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,040
Don't regret if you don't buy it.

124
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,159
You know each other?

125
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,080
If you don't know him, don't give him nicknames.

126
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,880
You have to let the fish know this for seven seconds.

127
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
I'll wear your small shoes.

128
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,640
No.

129
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,200
This horse is new here.

130
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,120
He's not familiar with anything.

131
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,159
You're a senior.

132
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,120
Teach him more.

133
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,560
Marshal Ma.

134
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,920
Gangmi is a senior,

135
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,880
she’s young and innocent.

136
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,960
and unfamiliar.

137
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,160
She's our little sister.

138
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,040
You should take care of her too.

139
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,040
Okay.

140
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,080
I have something to do.

141
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,240
You two

142
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,480
more about each other.

143
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,760
You're young and innocent.

144
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,440
You're drunk too.

145
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,480
You're not sociable.

146
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,159
Look, look, look.

147
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,920
Earth...

148
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,720
Earthquake

149
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,400
Come on. Come on.

150
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,240
Shake

151
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,480
Really?

152
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,120
Don't you think Gangmi and the white horse are handsome?

153
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,400
are a little strange?

154
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,320
I don't care.

155
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,680
Don't try to trade gossip for my labor.

156
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,440
No way.

157
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,080
You're so stingy.

158
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,480
It's natural.

159
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,039
I didn't see it before.

160
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,919
I suddenly found that

161
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,400
What?

162
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,840
I've always been strong.

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,600
Of course.

164
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,240
You look healthy.

165
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,039
Look at your pale face.

166
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,360
Go on.

167
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,480
Report.

168
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,640
I knew it.

169
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,360
This new product

170
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,080
promotion proposal

171
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,760
You should do it.

172
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,720
Speaking of

173
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,400
I won't go to the warehouse

174
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,400
I won't go to the warehouse for you.

175
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:57,960
Save it.

176
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,960
Why can't you go to the warehouse for me?

177
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,080
I'll queue up at 7.

178
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm tired. I'm tired.

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,680
Hi.

180
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,200
Hi.

181
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,320
It's a misunderstanding.

182
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,840
That wasn't the real me.

183
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,640
You can forget it.

184
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,000
How?

185
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,280
No, don't worry.

186
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,360
You just need to know more about me.

187
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,040
you will find

188
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,640
Actually,

189
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
I'm not like that.

190
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,760
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

191
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,640
Hello. Hello. Hello.

192
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,080
That friend last night.

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,160
I'll ask her to explain to you.

194
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,440
Reiko.

195
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,320
Ingrid didn't drink well yesterday.

196
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,880
Come to my house tonight.

197
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,280
Nonsense.

198
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
What? Don't you miss Ho?

199
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,280
A few nights ago,

200
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,440
You two have a good time

201
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,560
I'm jealous of him lying in your arms.

202
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
I have to explain to you.

203
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,840
It's like this.

204
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,080
It's like this.

205
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,480
It's here. It's here.

206
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,240
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.

207
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,880
I miss you so much.

208
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
I can't sleep if I can't see you tonight

209
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,600
No.

210
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,160
"Look, look, look, look, look, look, look." "Look, look, look, look."

211
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,240
I... I want to make it clear to you.

212
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,640
No.

213
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,400
This one

214
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,840
Come on, come on, come on.

215
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,480
Come on, come on, come on.

216
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
I'll go back to work.

217
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
No, no, no.

218
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,320
You...

219
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,880
Why do these two cats

220
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
become your pet?

221
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,040
You traitor.

222
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,640
Besides,

223
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,720
you've been a good drinker for so many years.

224
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,080
You haven't improved at all.

225
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,160
Just one glass of beer.

226
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,160
Every time to take care of you,

227
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,320
to take care of you.

228
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,920
Get lost.

229
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,800
Work relationships are complicated.

230
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,200
Really?

231
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,480
You can't judge a book by its cover.

232
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,320
But

233
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,480
even if she knows who her colleague is,

234
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,320
you should keep her secret.

235
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,760
She's a girl after all.

236
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,320
You know it.

237
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,360
You know it too.

238
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,200
You're right.

239
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,720
You're older than me.

240
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,800
You know more than me.

241
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,560
You must know more than me.

242
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,040
It's not good to know too much.

243
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,520
Now I realize

244
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,320
she likes to use me more and more.

245
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,160
She used you?

246
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,040
I thought she just got off work.

247
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,000
after work.

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,520
What do you mean?

249
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,160
That's another world.

250
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,320
She doesn't

251
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,080
live in the same world.

252
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,800
Although

253
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,200
if you drink too much,

254
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,440
when you drink too much.

255
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
But when I think of those men, I can't stop thinking about them.

256
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,000
You're right.

257
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,520
She must be a sea king.

258
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,360
What did you say?

259
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
She's drunk.

260
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,600
She's really a sea king.

261
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,120
I didn't expect that.

262
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,080
I didn't expect Fan Sisi

263
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,320
Not only you have another face,

264
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,800
You have two, three.

265
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,920
100 sets.

266
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,720
Alcohol?

267
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,960
Logically, you can get drunk after work.

268
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,360
or a sea king,

269
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,880
is your personal matter.

270
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,680
But you still like to use others.

271
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,920
That's your fault.

272
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,960
Don't judge a book by its cover.

273
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,080
Fan Sisi.

274
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,960
I know you now.

275
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,080
Bai.

276
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,480
Thank you.

277
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,720
You must be thirsty.

278
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,640
I brought you water.

279
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,800
This trick

280
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,680
It's a bit old-fashioned.

281
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,560
It doesn't work.

282
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,400
But I'll open it for you.

283
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,320
It's natural.

284
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,760
You must be tired.

285
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,720
Wipe your sweat.

286
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,960
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.

287
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,160
No need to explain.

288
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,880
I know what you want to say.

289
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,760
Like this. Like this. Like this.

290
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,800
Really?

291
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,440
and you'll be like this. You'll be like this.

292
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,560
Although you're drunk, deceiving,

293
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,480
and games in the mortal world,

294
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,120
But you're a good girl, right?

295
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,680
Don't worry.

296
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,640
Although I can't agree,

297
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,920
but I understand.

298
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,360
I will always remember this.

299
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
I won't have any prejudice against you.

300
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,720
Always remember.

301
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,800
What should I do?

302
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,960
I understand.

303
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:08,720
Marshal.

304
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,040
Be smart.

305
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
and interact with the audience.

306
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,280
Look.

307
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,600
We're working here.

308
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,960
She is slacking off again.

309
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:17,960
Marshal Ma.

310
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,040
I’m thinking

311
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,840
she was drunk

312
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,880
and a sea king.

313
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,520
I think it's a bit serious.

314
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,640
a little serious.

315
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,480
But drinking is a new problem.

316
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,560
I have to keep an eye on him.

317
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,240
Also,

318
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,960
I'm worried that she'll ask you for help.

319
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,960
Be smart this time.

320
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,640
Don't be fooled by her again.

321
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,960
I'm fooled by

322
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,680
by her innocent appearance.

323
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,000
Actually, I thought

324
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,480
she was quite warm-hearted.

325
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,600
Now it seems

326
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,200
it's all an illusion.

327
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,360
Mr. Natural.

328
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,720
Brother Natural

329
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,320
Brother Natural

330
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
There are so many people over there.

331
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,720
Let's go over there.

332
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,280
The white horse is handsome.

333
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,200
Come here.

334
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,800
I'm drunk.

335
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,760
I'm a sea king.

336
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,280
Who are you to talk about me like that?

337
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,240
That Gangmi...

338
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,480
Bai, help me.

339
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,040
Don’t get me wrong.

340
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,320
I'm not talking about you.

341
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,520
I mean Fan Sisi.

342
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,880
What's wrong with Fan Sisi?

343
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,600
No.

344
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,040
I didn’t say it.

345
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,920
Marshal said it.

346
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,040
The white horse is handsome.

347
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,000
What did you say about me?

348
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,440
Nothing.

349
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,680
I'm not talking about you.

350
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,840
Then who likes drinking?

351
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,600
Who are you talking about?

352
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,440
Are you talking about Jiangmei?

353
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,160
You mean Fan Sisi?

354
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,280
Yes.

355
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,200
I've been talking about Fan Sisi.

356
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,200
Yes.

357
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,280
I'm talking about Gangmi too.

358
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,160
Who said that?

359
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,440
Come here!

360
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,440
Who are you to frame me? Fine.

361
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,200
How could you say that to me?

362
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,320
My friend asked me to pick up the cat.

363
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,920
What did I do wrong?

364
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,600
Picking the cat.

365
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,000
Chao and Hao

366
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,360
are just two Garfiel cats.

367
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,720
Have I ever done this before?

368
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,080
No, no.

369
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,160
I was so nice

370
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,000
in front of the leader.

371
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,640
You're so ungrateful.

372
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,840
Who are you to spread rumours?

373
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,720
Who do you think you are?

374
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,480
Listen to me.

375
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,440
Let me explain.

376
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,480
I'm sorry.

377
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,560
Don't. This belongs to the company.

378
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,680
It's not a big deal.

379
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,000
such a trivial matter?

380
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,720
Why?

381
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,920
You think too much. I'm pissed off.

382
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,880
Who are you to spread rumors about me? I'm sorry.

383
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,480
I thought you didn't drink when I heard it.

384
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,960
It's good to be young.

385
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,320
So enthusiastic for work.

386
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,320
Okay.

387
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:23,720
Sisi

388
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,480
You're here

389
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,240
Sisi

390
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm off work.

391
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,520
What are you doing?

392
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:31,960
Move.

393
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,520
No.

394
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,800
Don't be angry.

395
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,760
Don't be angry.

396
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Anger leaves room for bad guys.

397
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,040
Don't be angry.

398
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,720
Don't be angry.

399
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,400
You're the one who's upset.

400
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,320
Stupid.

401
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:53,760
You smiled.

402
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,920
You'll be fine if you smile.

403
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,400
It's okay.

404
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,120
Help me.

405
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,440
Help me.

406
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,560
Help me.

407
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,360
Thank you.

408
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,560
Sisi

409
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,240
I was wrong today.

410
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,880
To show my sincerity,

411
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,320
I'll take you home.

412
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,560
A new electric donkey.

413
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,840
It's fast and exciting.

414
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,200
Is it safe?

415
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,040
It's safe.

416
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,120
Look.

417
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
I'll bring you a helmet.

418
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,840
What about you?

419
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,440
I...

420
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,720
Hello. Hello.

421
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,280
Sorry.

422
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,480
I need you to guide me.

423
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,640
You're wearing a helmet and giving me a ride.

424
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,400
Don't worry. I'm worried.

425
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,440
Sit tight.

426
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,920
Wear a helmet when riding an electric bike.

427
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,480
You can't bring people.

428
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,960
This is the traffic rule, you know?

429
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,160
I know it now.

430
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,000
Now I know

431
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
I'm sorry.

432
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,360
The whole place is booked today.

433
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:24,760
Sorry.

434
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,440
I'll give you a discount next time.

435
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,480
Sure no problem

436
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,920
Come again.

437
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,720
Bai.

438
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,680
What are you doing?

439
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,120
Gangmi.

440
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,320
I'm sorry.

441
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,280
From now on,

442
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,360
I will tell you

443
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,680
that night

444
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,400
everything that happened.

445
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,320
This is the first time we met.

446
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,280
Let's start over.

447
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,480
Hello.

448
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,560
I'm a new employee.

449
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,320
A white horse.

450
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,000
I look forward to working with you in the future.

451
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,480
Bai,

452
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,080
I have to teach you a lesson.

453
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,520
Actually, when we apologize to friends,

454
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,240
sincerely

455
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,400
Just say sorry.

456
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,040
At most...

457
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,960
A cup of milk tea is enough.

458
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,120
You...

459
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,560
is too much.

460
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,320
My dad taught me

461
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
It's normal to be polite.

462
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,520
You're right.

463
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,720
Here's to you.

464
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,520
Cheers.

465
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,920
Hey, aren't we brothers?

466
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
I'm done.

467
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,320
You don't drink?

468
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
You don't look like a man.

469
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,280
No.

470
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Drink it.

471
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,720
It's trembling again.

472
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,920
The line of wealth is so long.

473
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,000
You have to buy stocks.

474
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,240
You can definitely make money.

475
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,520
If you want to buy stocks,

476
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,880
you have to buy shrimp work.

477
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,840
Awesome.

478
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,320
The God of Wealth is the God of Wealth.

479
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,120
You’re really different.

480
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,400
Let me have some luck.

481
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,560
Look.

482
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,520
I just bought an electric car.

483
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,880
It's full of motivation.

484
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,640
Infinite renewal.

485
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,560
It's definitely worth it.

486
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,520
Where did you buy this car?

487
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,880
I bought it online.

488
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,640
It's second-hand.

489
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,080
It's cheap.

490
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:45,960
It's used.

491
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,600
Have you read it carefully?

492
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,320
What do you mean?

493
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,040
Do I look like someone who was cheated?

494
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,120
I'm very cunning.

495
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,680
The seller said

496
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,760
I've never ridden this car.

497
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,800
99 New

498
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,000
Look at this chair

499
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,760
Look at the wheel.

500
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,120
Look at the trunk.

501
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,160
It's so solid and practical.

502
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,440
Look at the delivery order.

503
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,720
You ran a lot.

504
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,600
Fusion.

505
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,960
It's very popular now.

506
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,120
Most modern civilization

507
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,800
are merged.

508
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,440
Smart phone.

509
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,280
It's just a computer.

510
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,400
A combination product.

511
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,680
Car industry

512
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,840
It's no longer just a machine.

513
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,320
but also information industries.

514
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,080
