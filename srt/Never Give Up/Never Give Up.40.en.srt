00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,050
his or her salary will be deducted.

688
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,340
By the way,

689
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,460
there's one more thing.

690
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,010
I went out to see the stars last night.

691
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,080
I forgot to wear glasses,

692
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,950
so I didn't see it clearly.

693
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,620
Li Tianran, don't you study astronomy?

694
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,840
Tell me

695
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:12,000
how is this week for Sagittarius?

696
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,500
It's a five-star week

697
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,350
for Sagittarius.

698
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,730
Give out the roses and you will get the flavor.

699
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,940
A five-star week?

700
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,960
Give out the roses and you will get the flavor.

701
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,350
I have to do good deeds this week.

702
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,820
Don't.

703
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,660
Don't.

704
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,480
Forget it.

705
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,660
Dear Mr. Yu,

706
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,290
back then,

707
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,720
it was me who pursued

708
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,660
Ms. Fan Sisi in the first place.

709
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,210
That led to today's consequences.

710
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,890
I feel very guilty.

711
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,750
I'm willing to resign.

712
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,410
I won't cause any trouble for you.

713
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,390
Ms. Fan is

714
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,530
an excellent employee.

715
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,030
If Gaofa loses her,

716
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,610
it will be a great loss.

717
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,400
I believe in the future,

718
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,910
she can create more value for Gaofa.

719
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,220
♫I'm a great young man♫

720
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,190

00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,990
This place is really good.

743
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,960
Yes.

744
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,690
Right?

745
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,000
Tianran, Tianran.

746
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,900
Change seats with Ji.

747
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,770
We will have a drink.

748
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,750
Change it.

749
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,770
Come on, let's change it.

750
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,250
The point is...

751
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,540
I can't feel my legs...

752
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,420
Come, Ji.

753
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,270
Have a drink

754
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,310
Where's your cup?

755
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,270
Hurry up.

756
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,590
One, two, three, four, five.

757
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,760
Stop drinking.

758
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,940
We haven't finished our business yet.

759
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,810
Do you remember

760
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,130
the tradition of our Planning Department 3

761
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,710
every year?

762
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,120
[Wish box]

763
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,420
Wish box.

764
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,830
This is the tradition of our Planning Department 3.

765
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,770
[Wish box]

766
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,420
At the end of this year,

767
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,650
we need to see

768
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,340
if last year's wish has come true

769
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,650
and then make a new wish.

770
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,790
Let's start.

771
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,180
Here.

772
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,150
It's Director Yao's.

773
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,150
Director Yao's wish is to get promoted.

774
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,520
Don't worry, Director Yao.

775
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,510
I'll retire earlier than you.

776
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,320
Work hard to get my position.

777
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,400
Okay?

778
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,190
Thank you, sir.

779
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,780
Whose is this?

780
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,580
Mr. Ji's.

781
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,880
Congratulations, Mr. Ji.

782
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,850
Your wish has come true.

783
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,190
Mr. Ji's wish is a raise.

784
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,350
[Ji Huahua. My wish is a raise.]

785
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,280
It increased

786
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,300
32.53 yuan.

787
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,120
That's a raise, right?

788
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,810
No matter how much it is, it is a raise, right?

789
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,430
Let's see

790
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,630
Wu Yimei's wish.

791
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,960
Wu Yimei's wish is

792
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,670
to become more beautiful.

793
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,580
You're beautiful enough.

794
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,640
Give yourself a break

795
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,230
and give us a break.

796
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,020
I'll try to restrain myself.

797
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,480
Try to restrain yourself. Very good.

798
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,810
Let me see

799
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,120
who's next.

800
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,380
Jiang Mei's wish is too simple.

801
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,950
Mei's wish is

802
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,570
to drink more milk tea and gain no weight.

803
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,610
I want to be slim.

804
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,690
You need to gain weight. You're too skinny.

805
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,100
Eat more.

806
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,400
Look at this.

807
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,650
Whose wish is this?

808
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,910
[I wish I can participate in more activities in the new year.]

809
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,650
It has no name.

810
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,250
I wish

811
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,070
I can participate in more activities

812
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,360
in the new year.

813
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,940
[I wish I can participate in more activities in the new year.]

814
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,990
It has no name.

815
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,480
Whose is it?

816
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,130
It's mine.

817
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,760
No matter whose wish it is,

818
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,410
we'll organize more activities next year.

819
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,650
Wu Mingshi will take charge of

820
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,970
all activities.

821
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:50,710
Okay.

822
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,470
Okay. Okay.

823
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,050
Okay?

824
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,370
Okay.

825
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,870
Go. Go. Go.

826
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,290
Let me propose a toast.

827
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,470
Li Tianran, how many years have you had this wish?

828
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,390
I wish I can have a sweet relationship

829
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,110
next year.

830
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,620
Come on, Tianran.

831
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,140
Tianran,

832
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,760
you need to try your best.

833
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,560
You'll get a good result if you try your best.

834
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,130
That's right, Tianran.

835
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,810
You're such a disappointment.

836
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,380
A year has passed

837
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
and you're still single.

838
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,840
It's okay. I'll be with you.

839
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,820
I'm single too.

840
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,430
Who doesn't want a sweet relationship?

841
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,610
I want it too.

842
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,070
I'll try my best.

843
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,160
In the past year,

844
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,160
we've all worked hard

845
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,250
and lived hard.

846
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,840
The most I heard in Planning Department 3

847
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,080
is that

848
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,140
every difficulty can defeat us.

849
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,900
But one year has passed.

850
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,510
who is defeated?

851
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,860
At worst,

852
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,690
get down on all fours today and push yourself up tomorrow.

853
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,810
That's right.

854
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,740
