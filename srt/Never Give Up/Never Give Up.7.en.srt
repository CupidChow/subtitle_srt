1
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,560
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,320
There's a Perseus meteor shower tonight.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,280
Do you want to see it?

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,120
The meteor shower.

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,040
Where is it?

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,240
I saw it.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,640
Make a wish.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,760
Make a wish.

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,800
You studied astronomy.

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,400
So you really like stars.

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
You only studied astronomy.

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,240
When I was in my hometown,

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
I liked watching stars at night.

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,000
At that time,

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,160
even small stars could shine.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
I rarely see them in big cities now.

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,560
Are you homesick?

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,560
A big city.

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,600
It's not as good as I thought.

20
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:35,920
It's okay.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,720
Just cry if you want to.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,560
I can't see it.

23
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,040
A new drama.

24
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,480
I'm here.

25
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,560
Is everyone here?

26
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,960
I've read the eight drafts

27
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
I've read it again.

28
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,520
There are some problems.

29
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,200
Yes.

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,040
Go ahead.

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,440
Yes.

32
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,120
Coming

33
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm watching it too.

34
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,680
I was about to say it.

35
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,840
Sir, you first.

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,600
Why aren't Team Leader Fan and Chief Wu here?

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,840
Come on, Chief Wu!

38
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,960
Hang in there. Come on.

39
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,000
What's wrong?

40
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,200
Where's Team Leader Fan?

41
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,920
He went to bed so early.

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,560
You must delay the work you can delay.

43
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,280
Maybe I'm lucky.

44
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,880
You don't have to work if you're fired tomorrow.

45
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,840
Who is it?

46
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,320
Me. Am I interrupting you?

47
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,600
You're already bothering me.

48
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,520
Well...

49
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,400
Well, Mr. Yu

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,520
in the group.

51
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,640
Answer me now.

52
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,000
I've summarized it for you.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,280
It's about three big and seven small.

54
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,840
I'll tell you now

55
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,600
Really?

56
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm charging my phone.

57
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,360
I didn't see it.

58
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,880
Don't worry. I'll pay it tomorrow.

59
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,680
Okay.

60
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,320
Remember to go back to Mr. Yu.

61
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,080
Bye.

62
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,520
I'll leave you alone.

63
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,040
So annoying.

64
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,160
Five.

65
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,120
Four.

66
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,120
Three.

67
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,160
Two.

68
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,000
One.

69
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,880
Bye, everyone.

70
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,040
Where is he?

71
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,640
Where is he?

72
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,080
Gone.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,560
No

74
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,800
Sisi is running too fast.

75
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,680
But Brother Natural,

76
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,600
I don't think Sisi is that kind of person.

77
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,000
Did you hear it wrong?

78
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,600
Impossible.

79
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,040
You made it so clear.

80
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,960
How could it be wrong?

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:56,960
Sisi

82
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,240
Where have you been these days?

83
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,080
I've been waiting for you to come back.

84
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,480
Mo Mo, don't be angry.

85
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,440
I just came to see you

86
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,600
during work.

87
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,760
I'll go back to accompany you after work.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,400
Let's play all night tonight.

89
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,480
Then cancel the date

90
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,320
with Yan Yan tonight.

91
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,160
Let's make a date on Sunday.

92
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
She's two-timing.

93
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,360
It was clear.

94
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,240
No wonder Mr. Fan

95
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,080
after work.

96
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,080
She doesn't go out usually.

97
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,760
How could she have time for a date?

98
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,640
Could it be...

99
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,320
hiding a beauty in a golden house?

100
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,560
A long-distance relationship.

101
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,159
Just wait.

102
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
The result will come out soon.

103
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,080
I've figured out what happened to Ms. Fan.

104
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,640
She admitted

105
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,360
she has two boyfriends.

106
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,960
Mr. Yu has read

107
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,160
Mr. Yu has read it.

108
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,120
He said yes.

109
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,480
Why did he change it

110
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,760
he said he couldn't do it, but he had to change it.

111
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,320
Mr. Yu.

112
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,520
Just get used to it.

113
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,640
Well,

114
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,720
Are you busy tonight?

115
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,480
Actually, I...

116
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,080
accompany Yan Yan.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,680
How did you know?

118
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Mo Mo...

119
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,200
You know Mo Mo?

120
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,880
Li Tianran.

121
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,159
Are you spying on my life?

122
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,159
No, no.

123
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,400
Modern society is normal.

124
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,000
Do you really think it's normal?

125
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

126
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,040
I think so too.

127
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,320
This is a healthy hobby.

128
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,080
Don't tell Mr. Yu and Mr. Gil.

129
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,400
The older generation can't understand.

130
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,760
Don't worry. I'll keep it a secret.

131
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,800
I'm leaving.

132
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Just as I expected.

133
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,200
And it's a long-distance relationship.

134
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,000
Both.

135
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,160
After my investigation,

136
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,320
she has been home for the past week.

137
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,280
She hasn't gone on a date.

138
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,840
So it's online dating.

139
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,280
It’s a long-distance relationship.

140
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,559
But I don’t know one thing, Bai.

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Young people like you

142
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,760
are in love now.

143
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,799
Are you healthy?

144
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,240
No. Absolutely not.

145
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,520
Looks like our view of love

146
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,360
is quite consistent.

147
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,440
The receptionist is in a relationship, you know?

148
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,480
Are you in love?

149
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,560
His boyfriend is Liu Zeyan.

150
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
He's a domineering CEO.

151
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,760
Liu Zeyan.

152
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,320
Why does this name sound so familiar?

153
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,680
Yan Yan.

154
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,960
Oh my god.

155
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,480
There's a lot of information.

156
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,680
Five.

157
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,680
Four.

158
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,720
Three.

159
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,560
Two.

160
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,440
One.

161
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,040
There's no rush.

162
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,560
No hurry.

163
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,680
Comrades,

164
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,120
our proposal today

165
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,600
our proposal today.

166
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,800
So he asked us to

167
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,000
as the original proposal

168
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,360
with the original proposal.

169
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,320
So, who will do the hard work?

170
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,960
It's time to show my characteristics of a warm man.

171
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,840
Darn it.

172
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,320
Sisi and I are neighbors.

173
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,560
It's easier for us to work overtime.

174
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,240
We'll do it this weekend.

175
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,760
We'll try our best to get the plan out.

176
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,080
Is it Mr. Fan?

177
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,640
I want to care about you and change you.

178
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,000
and bring you back.

179
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,800
Am I right, Ms. Fan?

180
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,880
Okay, thank you.

181
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,720
The rest of you, get off work.

182
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,280
Okay.

183
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,600
Bye, Brother Tian Ran.

184
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:02,920
Bye.

185
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,080
Bye, Director Yao. Thank you.

186
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,680
I'll take it.

187
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,200
Ms. Fan.

188
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,640
Thanks to me asking Director Yao

189
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Otherwise, he would have given this project to Ms. Ji.

190
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,360
It’s a great opportunity

191
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,080
is a great opportunity to perform.

192
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,200
Li Tian Ran.

193
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,080
Can I ask you a question?

194
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:30,880
Excuse me.

195
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,280
Do you hate me?

196
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,920
At first, I was a little...

197
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,920
I wanted to

198
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,600
to be your cold neighbor

199
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,120
and never see you again, right?

200
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
I didn't even come to you for work.

201
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,400
I didn't ask you to work overtime.

202
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,960
I let you stay at home alone.

203
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,760
You'll be bored to death.

204
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,640
That's great.

205
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,960
Then I thought about it.

206
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,760
I think

207
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
you're quite nice to me.

208
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,200
You gave me a router

209
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,960
and introduced shrimps to me.

210
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,960
So as a senior in the company,

211
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,760
I think I should guide you

212
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,440
and help you.

213
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,800
Let's work together and improve together.

214
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,280
so that you don't spend your time on love.

215
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,680
You'll suffer from love in the future.

216
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,160
You'll suffer big losses for the cheap.

217
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,720
Fan Sisi

218
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,960
Don't go. Where are you going?

219
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,040
Let's get back to work.

220
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,280
Team Leader Fan.

221
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,880
I'm done.

222
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,160
I won't bother you then.

223
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,680
By the way,

224
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,560
the Yan Yan you mentioned is

225
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,160
Liu Zeyan?

226
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes.

227
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,000
You should spend some time with Mo.

228
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,000
Yanyan is fine.

229
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,000
Why?

230
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,880
Listen to me.

231
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,600
Wait.

232
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,800
I think

233
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,160
we should

234
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,400
and living space

235
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,480
Cut it.

236
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,400
When you knock again,

237
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,800
Raise a red card when it comes to work.

238
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,880
Raise blue tiles when it comes to life.

239
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,880
You...

240
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,640
You even made two brands.

241
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,640
You can just make one.

242
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,160
Okay.

243
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,480
Bye.

244
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,040
Come in.

245
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,840
No.

246
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,120
I can't let her sink anymore.

247
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,720
Sisi, I know

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,960
you don't want to use your personal time to talk about work.

249
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,440
Well,

250
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,600
I won't bother you with work anymore.

251
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,680
That's great.

252
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,160
How about this?

253
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,800
How about memorizing the lines?

254
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,680
Recite the words.

255
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,160
Look.

256
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,240
memorizing words is not work, right?

257
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,120
It's to improve yourself.

258
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,040
In this way,

259
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,800
when we meet foreign clients,

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,520
our department will have two translators.

261
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,640
This isn't work, is it?

262
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm just preparing for

263
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,160
for the coming work.

264
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,640
No.

265
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm not even going to do a proper job.

266
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,920
You want me to memorize the words?

267
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
You don't want to memorize the words either.

268
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
How should we improve ourselves?

269
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,320
Get a certificate.

270
00:13:59,720 --> 00:13:59,960
Got it.

271
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,280
Shall we go for a night run?

272
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,920
Go.

273
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,880
You've gained weight.

274
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,840
One, two, one.

275
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,480
One, two, one.

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,040
One, two, one.

277
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
One, two, one.

278
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,960
One, two, three, four.

279
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,720
I can't run anymore.

280
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,240
I can't run anymore

281
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,840
Sisi, come on.

282
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,400
Hang in there.

283
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,320
How about we run another five kilometers after work tomorrow?

284
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,680
Li Tian Ran, let me ask you a question.

285
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,120
What?

286
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,360
Do you think

287
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,200
people have the right to rest?

288
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,520
What do you mean?

289
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,480
Get lost.

290
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,520
Come on.

291
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,960
Come on. Come on.

292
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,760
I can't run anymore.

293
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,440
Come on! Come on!

294
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,200
Run!

295
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,000
Come on.

296
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,640
Don't pull me.

297
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,240
Come on. Come on.

298
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,640
One, two, one.

299
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,120
One, two, one.

300
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,600
One, two, one.

301
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,880
I don't memorize the words.

302
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,400
and I don't want to work overtime.

303
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,680
Third, I don't want to work out.

304
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,560
I'm lazy.

305
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,600
But I don't need to be whipped.

306
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,400
My social phobia

307
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,160
I don't need warmth

308
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,120
I'm behind

309
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,200
And I don't need to be promoted.

310
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
I just want to

311
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,640
alone

312
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,160
shallow happiness, okay?

313
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,200
And this.

314
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
I take it back.

315
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,800
What do you mean?

316
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,040
From now on,

317
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,080
no matter who you are,

318
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,600
don't knock on this door again.

319
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,240
or I'll show you

320
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,800
I'll kill you all.

321
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,520
Kill them all.

322
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,280
What do you mean?

323
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,520
I want to leave the group.

324
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,320
Remove all the work group.

325
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
This is the real meaning of the weekend.

326
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,600
Brother Natural.

327
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,040
Are you worried about Mr. Fan?

328
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,680
In the past two days,

329
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,760
in order to prevent her from getting too into the character,

330
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,600
I knock on her door whenever I have time.

331
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,680
and knock on her door whenever I have time.

332
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,160
and take her to do various things to distract her.

333
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,200
but it didn't work well.

334
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,560
Ze Yan

335
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,680
a liar?

336
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,080
So,

337
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
No wonder Sisi said

338
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,880
she can't save much money.

339
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,240
How shameless.

340
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,280
How could he

341
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,920
to fool an ignorant girl?

342
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,800
What is this?

343
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,800
I can't let her go on like this.

344
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,600
I need to call her.

345
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,440
Call her.

346
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,560
Why?

347
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,319
Why did you make my Mo Mo black?

348
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,480
Sisi, what's wrong?

349
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,800
Are you crying?

350
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,160
Li Tian Ran.

351
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,520
My Mo Mo has turned black.

352
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,359
I told you he's not a good guy.

353
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,520
Who did you call black?

354
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,840
My Mo Mo is so gentle and considerate.

355
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,040
He is a pervert.

356
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,080
Mo Mo.

357
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,480
Not Yan Yan.

358
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,560
Mo Mo has turned black too.

359
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,320
Both of them are liars.

360
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,320
Sister Sisi will be so sad.

361
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,760
Brother Nature, go back and comfort her.

362
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,320
Leave it to me.

363
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,560
Sisi

364
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,120
Don't hang up.

365
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,240
I'll go back to you now.

366
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,320
Don't let them take advantage of you.

367
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,520
I told you.

368
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
This kind of relationship

369
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,600
is unreliable.

370
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
Mo Mo.

371
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,880
Mo Mo.

372
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,960
How did he turn black?

373
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,840
Real perfect love

374
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,440
will never happen, Fan Sisi.

375
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,960
But don't go extreme.

376
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,680
You can't devote all your emotions

377
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,880
just because

378
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,560
on Yanyan.

379
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,800
To be honest,

380
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,640
Yan Yan is not the east.

381
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,160
I don't know what's going on

382
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,040
Sisi, don't cry

383
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,480
Here's the thing. I'm back.

384
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,600
If you think

385
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,840
it's convenient,

386
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,760
maybe we can

387
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,000
eat

388
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,880
Li Tian Ran.

389
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,600
Where was I?

390
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,680
Yes, Mo Mo looks like a scientist,

391
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
but in fact, he is developing

392
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,600
a technique to destroy humans.

393
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,160
What?

394
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,560
Anyway,

395
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,240
I spent so much money on them.

396
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,800
for them.

397
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,960
I can't.

398
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,360
I'll get even with them later.

399
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,760
Natural.

400
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,080
Thank you for listening to me.

401
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,440
Actually,

402
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,640
I've been pretending to be tired.

403
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,920
I was afraid that my colleagues would find out.

404
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,080
I pursued in Chinese comics.

405
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,200
Chinese comics.

406
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,360
and Chinese comics.

407
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:19,960
Yes.

408
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,440
Yan Yan and Mo Mo are...

409
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,760
Chinese comics?

410
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,320
Yes.

411
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
They are the characters in my Chinese comics.

412
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,560
The money you spent on them

413
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,880
The merchandise.

414
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
You don't know their limited edition

415
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,440
It's hard to collect.

416
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,040
A pillow alone costs a lot.

417
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,280
I haven't bought new clothes

418
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,120
for several months.

419
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,880
You're not dating online.

420
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,320
Online relationship?

421
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,800
I told you.

422
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,160
Perfect love doesn't exist in three dimensions.

423
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
Isn't it good to watch dramas?

424
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,920
What online relationship?

425
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,240
So,

426
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,600
you always thought

427
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
I'm two-timing?

428
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,120
Li Tian Ran, are you stupid?

429
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,160
Well,

430
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,400
I'll go back if there's nothing else.

431
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,480
Fan Sisi.

432
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,560
I'll let the whole company know

433
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,520
you don't work overtime

434
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,880
and don't meet clients.

435
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,120
I don't recite words, I don't run at night.

436
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,160
I'm going home to keep paper people.

437
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,480
You're a paper farmer when you work.

438
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:36,960
Li Tian Ran.

439
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,640
You draw cards?

440
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,960
If you don't work hard, you're drawing cards.

441
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,360
No.

442
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,760
You keep a paper man.

443
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,480
I was wrong.

444
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,920
Wait, I'm sorry.

445
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,560
I'm sorry.

446
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,160
What do you mean?

447
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,720
Are you apologizing?

448
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,720
Naturally sorry.

449
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,760
It's okay.

450
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,160
So, have you forgiven me?

451
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,120
It depends.

452
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,480
It's okay.

453
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,120
Do you need to wash your clothes?

454
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,400
I do.

455
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,920
Do you need my help?

456
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,440
Come in.

457
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,800
Green is forgiveness, right?

458
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,800
No, it's Momo's lucky color.

459
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,880
Looks like I need to apply for a class.

460
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,000
and learn English.

461
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,520
Why learn English?

462
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,400
There will be a better translator anyway.

463
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,360
Really?

464
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,800
Like what?

465
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,920
I saw the news the other day that

466
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,880
a translator

467
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,920
similar to Bluetooth earphones.

468
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,120
Put it on your ear

469
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
you can hear the interpretation.

470
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,480
Then

471
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,040
I don't have to learn English anymore?

472
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,680
Not just English.

473
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,400
Like Chinese

474
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:18,920
You can also translate.

475
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,800
Really?

476
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,720
Great.

477
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,160
I hope it goes public soon.

478
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,160
More importantly,

479
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,320
I want someone

480
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,760
who can talk to my boss.

481
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,480
Translate Regalia.

482
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,760
The boss is talking.

483
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,640
Are you out of your mind?

484
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,960
Don't make such a stupid mistake, okay?

485
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,360
Why didn't you send me the information I asked for?

486
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,840
What are you doing during working hours?

487
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,480
I've told you 800 times.

488
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,840
We have to follow the first draft.

489
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,120
Do you understand or not?

490
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,600
Are you out of your mind?

491
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

492
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,680
Okay.

493
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,120
Mr. Yu.

494
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,640
You're right.

495
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,160
Your suggestion

496
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,440
is very useful.

497
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,760
I'll definitely submit it tomorrow morning.

498
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,760
Sisi

499
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,760
The goal is to

500
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,520
Isn't it

501
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
the value of life?

502
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,000
What are you thinking?

503
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,920
The goal of work is not to work.

504
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,440
Sisi

505
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,480
Sometimes I feel

506
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,440
I'm poor and ugly.

507
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,600
So ordinary.

508
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,000
Don't be sad.

509
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,720
At least your judgment is right.

510
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,040
Sisi

511
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,440
I'm not gifted.

512
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,720
I can only work harder than others.

513
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,600
Indeed.

514
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,800
If you don't work hard,

515
