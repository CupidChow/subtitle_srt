520
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,580
Don't wait for him.

521
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,550
Come on.

522
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,450
Mr. Yao.

523
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,180
Let me tell you.

524
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,400
You're amazing.

525
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,330
Today,

526
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,350
we didn't see

527
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,020
how did you

528
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,450
get rid of Cui Hualang?

529
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,690
That's nothing.

530
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,800
I

531
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,830
just used some tips

532
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,360
in life.

533
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,790
The amazing one

534
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,970
is Ms. Wu.

535
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,040
What did she do?

536
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,170
What did she do?

537
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,450
How should I put it?

538
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,070
Anyway, you will know

539
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,160
when you see her.

540
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,560
But I still don't understand

541
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,570
why we can't

542
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,430
take responsibility of

543
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,300
Rice Cake system.

544
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,350
Silly kid.

545
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,700
If Rice Cake system

546
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,020
is as important

547
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,960
as Mr. Zheng

548
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,990
said,

549
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,550
why does he insist on

550
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,460
giving it

551
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,020
to Planning Department 3?

552
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,060
In my opinion,

553
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,180
Rice Cake system

554
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,210
is our group's

555
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,130
hottest potato,

556
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,430
hardest bone,

557
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,990
the most dangerous bomb,

558
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,660
and the worst bad debt,

559
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,359
right?

560
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,819
I see.

561
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,740
Anyway,

562
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,730
under the leadership of Mr. Yu

563
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,450
and me,

564
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,060
Planning Department 3 worked together

565
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,250
and avoided

566
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,869
Rice Cake Project completely.

567
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,030
Congratulations.

568
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,430
Let me propose a toast.

Cheers.

571
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,860
Thank you.

572
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,220
Sorry for being late.

573
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,610
What are you talking about?

574
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,130
We're talking about

575
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,490
avoiding Rice Cake Project.

576
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,380
Avoid?

577
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,690
Why do we avoid it?

578
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,580
I met Mr. Cui today.

579
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,620
He talked a lot

580
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,480
about Rice Cake Project.

581
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,470
I think this is

582
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,950
a rare opportunity.

583
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,750
What did you tell Mr. Cui?

584
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,830
I said we will do it.

585
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,390
I said it must be given to

586
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,270
Planning Department 3.

587
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,940
He immediately gave me the proposal.

588
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,380
Li Tianran.

589
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,410
Will you

590
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,760
take responsibility

591
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,560
for developing Rice Cake system

592
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,120
on behalf of Planning Department 3?

593
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,420
Act or perish.

594
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,760
I...

595
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,440
Yes.

596
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,380
Can I do that?

597
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,940
No problem.

598
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,710
Think about it.

599
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,010
With the help of Mr. Yu,

600
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,320
with the support of so many employees

601

602
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,770

on behalf of Planning Department 3.

608
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,040
I don't have a pen.

609
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,090
How about this?

610
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,760
I'll take it back and sign it for you.

611
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,780
I'll send it to you after I sign it.

612
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,440
