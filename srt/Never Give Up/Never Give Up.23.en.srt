00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,930
Last week, the group's finance staff was on leave.

508
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,090
So we won't be paid until Monday.

509
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,670
Hold on a little longer.

[Zero days before payday]

511
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,850
[Two days before payday]

512
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,790
[Lucky day to step on eggs]

513
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,860
Defen, do you have to work overtime?

514
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,580
Of course.

515
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,970
There is free wifi,

516
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,380
free heating and air conditioning here.

517
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,760
What a waste not to use it.

518
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,990
Have you had dinner yet?

519
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,180
Why don't we have dinner together?

520
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,520
I... I've already eaten.

521
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,720
When I was out for business,

522
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,990
I ate something on the way.

523
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,220
Okay.

524
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,050
No one will

525
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,270
have dinner with me again.

526
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,580
Why don't you just eat alone?

527
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,750
You even need company for dinner.

528
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,640
I'm afraid of eating by myself.

529
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,650
What's so scary about it?

530
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,710
It's just

531
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,150
that when eating alone

532
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,300
in a restaurant,

533
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,610
I always feel lonely.

534
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,610
And the people around you

535
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,270
will look at you with a strange look.

536
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,370
And I can't order many dishes.

537
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,140
It makes me look lonely.

538
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,830
It's said that the highest level of difficulty

539
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,030
in eating alone

540
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,160
is to eat hot pot and buffet alone.

541
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,610
It's not difficult.

542
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,650
I often eat buffet alone.

543
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,270
It's the kind of western-style lawn wedding

544
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,390
that's been popular nowadays.

545
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:11,910
Western…

546
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,520
Yes, just go and eat.

547
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,270
The bridegroom thinks I'm the bride's family.

548
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,700
The bride thinks I'm the bridegroom's family.

549
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,800
In fact, I'm not from either side.

550
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,630
I don't know anyone.

551
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,440
Then how can you go there if you don't know anyone?

552
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,840
As long as I know the dishes.

553
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,990
Baihe,

554
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,810
Mr. Wei just said

555
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,560
today is Xiaozhi company's

556
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,310
Chief Wang's wedding ceremony.

557
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,660
It's at the Seafood Restaurant.

558
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,910
He asked you to deliver the money for the wedding.

559
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,570
You should go.

560
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,940
Chief Wang.

561
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,280
I'll go.

562
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,970
Yes, I...

563
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,880
Seafood Restaurant?

564
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:36,910
I'll go.

565
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,450
You don't know Chief Wang.

566
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,060
That's just right.

567
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,070
The point is I know the restaurant well.

568
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:42,900
Well.

569
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,440
You just give me the money for the share.

570
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,050
I thought you had dinner.

571
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,950
I can have another.

572
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,700
Then I'll give him the money.

573
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,630
Okay.

574
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,870
A few days ago, some women from Department 1

575
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,710
badmouthed Mr. Zheng behind his back.

576
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,080
I was caught in the middle.

577
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,200
Indeed.

578
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,090
What do you mean?

579
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,150
You see this kind of thing.

580
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,380
If I go along with them,

581
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,870
I'll have to join them

582
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,370
in badmouthing Mr. Zheng behind his back.

583
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,660
I don't think it's necessary.

584
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,040
If I don't agree with them,

585
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,710
they must think I'm a traitor.

586
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,590
I can neither affirm nor deny them.

587
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,140
It's so hard.

588
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,890
Yes, so I ran away.

589
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,030
You were wrong.

590
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,970
You can't avoid that

591
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,870
by agreeing, disagreeing

592
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,940
or running away,

593
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,110
but by asking questions.

594
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,540
Asking questions?

595
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,620
I wasn't the only one who saw it.

596
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,250
Zhi Shuang saw it too.

597
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:42,960
Did you?

598
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,420
Yes.

599
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,670
And Chief Jang.

600
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,710
Chief Zhang saw it too.

601
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,690
No way.

602
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,570
It's true.

603
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,610
Really?

604
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,730
It's true.

605
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,490
Is it?

606
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,350
Yes.

607
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,170
No way.

608
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,860
Like Gaodefen.

609
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,360
Really?

610
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,700
Is it?

611
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,310
No way.
