It's me.

345
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,970
You asked me to think about it last time.

346
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,530
So

347
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,630
I thought about it.

348
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,990
After thinking about it,

349
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,730
I just kept thinking and thinking.

350
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,140
I couldn't figure it out.

351
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,850
I'm sorry.

352
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,400
I'm sorry.

353
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,310
Can you give me some more time

354
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,320
and let me think about it?

355
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,790
Then I'll tell you

356
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,500
what exactly I thought of.

357
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,300
You can leave now.

358
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,130
It's done?

359
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,570
It's done.

360
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,670
Is that okay?

361
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,400
Think about it.

362
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,870
If someone hits you on the left side of your face today,

363
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,700
do you want to hit him on the right side of his face?

364
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,440
Yes.

365
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,120
That's right.

366
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,600
Great, pretty sister.

367
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,660
This is how you should treat people like this.

368
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,490
So the guy

369
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,920
who sent you 60-second voice messages

370
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,070
didn't dare to send it again, right?

371
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,270
He didn't even say a word.

372
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,110
That's right.

373
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,540
Can't we

374
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,580
talk on the phone?

375
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,130
The phone didn't ring either.

376
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,160
That's right.

377
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,250
It's work.

378
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,570
Email is better.

379
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,470
You know what's better?

380
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,110
He didn't even send any emails.

381
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,480
So, pretty sister,

382
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,060
how did you contact them?

383
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,160
I don't.

384
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,070
You still need to contact them?

385
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,510
Think about

386
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,000
what kind of clients you should choose.

387
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,410
Young people.

388
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,860
I see.

389
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,120
Beautiful aunt.

390
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,450
A…

391
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,360
Auntie?

392
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,740
Manager Hu,

393
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,960
you can't unfriend me.

394
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,030
You can't block me.

395
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,210
Say it.

396
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,440
Ms. Wang.

397
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,860
Look at my eyes.

398
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,160
You have beautiful legs.

399
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,970
Do I?

400
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,520
They're long.

401
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,850
Thank you.

402
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,360
Where did you get your eye bags done?

403
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,310
They're beautiful.

404
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,560
You can look up.

405
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,900
Look at the eyeliner.

406
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,450
There are some extra strokes.

407
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,320
I know she can tell it.

408
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,480
She's really an expert.

409
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,290
You can see it.

410
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,820
That's what I get irritable over.

411
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,600
Yes.

412
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,630
This is annoying.

413
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,140
What's even more irritating is

414
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,510
my husband even said

415
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,030
it was just an eyeliner

416
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,490
and I could just wipe it off and re-draw it.

417
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,520
No way!

418
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,170
Re-drawing is never as good as the first time.

419
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,820
That's right.

420
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,260
And if you don't do it right the first time,

421
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,160
the whole makeup will be ruined.

422
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:41,910
That's right.

423
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,410
And then you have to remove it.

424
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,240
And after that, you have to reapply the foundation.

425
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,150
Blush, eyeliner.

426
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,150
And finally, lipstick.

427
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,020
You know us.

428
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,810
Who am I?

429
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,310
Your problem

430
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,090
is a bit tricky.

431
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,200
But I have a solution.

432
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,190
From now on, you'll do it for her.

433
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,930
She'll do it for her.

434
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,180
And then you do it for her.

435
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,540
You can

436
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,860
just do it together.

437
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,690
Won't the failure rate be even higher?

438
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,020
Wu Yimei, listen to me.

439
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,740
A woman's face is a battlefield.

440
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,140
If you don't stand shoulder to shoulder

441
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,010
and fight together,

442
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,880
where would the beauty

443
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,630
come from?

444
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,560
You've charged for so many cards.

445
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,560
Why not give them to me?

446
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,320
You have a point.

447
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,140
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

448
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,250
What are you waiting for?

449
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,120
Makeup!

450
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,680
Rushing.

451
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,460
What's the rush?

452
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,980
He beat me to it.

453
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,350
No matter the old

454
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:35,900
or the young all beat me to it.

455
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,360
All right.

456
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:36,990
What do they want?

457
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,740
Forget it.

458
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,430
Don't.

459
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,550
What do they want?

460
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,700
They don't know how to behave.

461
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,750
Ms. Wang,

462
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,760
I need emotional counseling so much.

463
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,340
Hi.

464
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,050
Sorry, sorry.

465
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,550
It's okay.

466
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,670
It's just clothes.

467
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,050
I have to wash them at home when they get dirty.

468
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,550
Excuse me, Mr. Cui.

469
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,400
I messed up your bag.

470
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,250
It's okay. Just wipe it and it'll be clean.

471
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,810
Mr. Cui, are you okay?

472
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,510
You stepped on my shoe.

473
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,920
You stepped on my new sneakers.

474
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,010
I just bought them.

475
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,310
My new sneakers.

476
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,310
It's okay to step on my face.

477
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,840
But you can't

478
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,150
step on my shoes.

479
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,890
So for you,

480
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,750
shoes are more important than life.

481
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,130
I have a way to get rid of it once and for all.

482
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,140
It gets better

483
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,660
when you put up with it for a while.

484
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,710
It's nothing

485
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,770
when your legs get broken.

486
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,810
Bear it!

487
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,020
Help!

488
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,260
Help! Help!

489
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,950
Ms. Wang, you did the right thing.

490
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,830
That's the way to go

491
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,230
with people like him.

492
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,930
Mr. Yu.

493
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,960
Even a reasonable person like you

494
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,140
has emotional problems?

495
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,570
Ms. Wang.

496
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,220
I don't think of it as an emotional problem.

497
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,550
I prefer to call it

498
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,260
proper psychological stress relief.

499
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,010
That's right.

500
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,760
Until this morning.

501
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,650
What are you honking for?

502
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,440
Are you the only one with a horn?

503
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,230
Like I can't see the road?

504
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,050
If you're in a hurry, you can fly.

505
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,090
What are you honking for?

506
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,360
How can you say this?

507
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,500
I just honked.

508
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,320
Is this necessary?

509
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,070
This is so necessary.

510
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,480
I hate

511
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,990
people honking behind me.

512
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,530
Honk. Honk.

513
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,640
What are you honking for?

You ruined

515
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,230
my good mood of the day.

Stop it.

517
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,540
Mr. Yu.

518
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,190
Do you have a problem with that?

519
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,080
Where am I?

520
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,720
Vice Chairman Zheng.

521
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,900
You're going to the company?

522
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,040
You'd better hurry.

523
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,580
I can't prevent you.

524
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,720
Wish you a good day.

525
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,270
Hurry up.

526

Pass.

527
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,490
Road rage is a very common problem.

528
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,510
But it's difficult to treat.

529

The apple has almost nothing left.

530
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,240
Come on.

531
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,340
Explain your wake-up anger

532
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,470
to the expert.

533
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,700
You still claim you have no problem?

534
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,440
I don't have wake-up anger.

535
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,470
You're still denying it.

536
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,600
You look familiar.

537
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,010
You and I have a connection.

538
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,460
I didn't know you were a psychologist.

539
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,830
I have seven degrees.

540
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,790
Seven degrees? That's impressive.

541
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,340
Mr. Yu, why don't you talk first?

542
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,250
We'll wait…

544
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,250
Ms. Fa's wake-up anger

545
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,320
is so bad

546
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,100
that it's affecting the work of the Planning Department 3.

547
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,260
We had to take over

548
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,160
the Rice Cake Project.

549
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:54,740
That's true.

550
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,800
It's affecting our work.

551

You have to come first.

Ms. Fan first.

Excuse me.

Stop!

You two are just perfect for each other.

What do you mean?

557
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,400
Road rage and anger

558
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,590
can be treated together.

559
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,050
How to treat road rage and anger together?

560
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,900
You can go to work together

561

and share the journey.

I just changed lanes. What are you honking for?

Like you're the only one who knows how to drive.

Why don't you fly over then?

It's tough for him too, Ms. Fan.

You'll feel better at the sight of the sky.

Calm down.

Try it again!

Come here if you dare.

Believe it or not, I'll smack you.

Wonderful.

I don't even touch the steering wheel.

I can't get out my road rage.

That's perfect for both of us.

Can you give me a ride?

No.

No.

Then why should we give you a ride?

Tianran and Bai didn't attend the consultation.

603

Don't you guys get irritable over anything?

No, I don't think so.

It's a bit strange.

It's strangely pretty.
