00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,250
Yes.

Tianran.

516
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,760
What are you doing?

517
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,060
The tea in the Almighty House is good.

518
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,940
I want to go to the toilet.

519
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,160
Did Mr. Zheng say

520
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,700
where to get approved for going to the toilet?

521
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,690
Ask Mr. Yu to sign it.

522
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,320
Not more than three times a day.

523
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:56,930
Okay.

524
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,630
Not more than five minutes per time.

525
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,430
Where is Mr. Yu?

526
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,700
I think he went to meet clients

527
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,840
and was locked outside.

528
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,020
Then...

529
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,220
What should I do?

530
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,320
Tianran, I know a place.

531
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,880
Come with me. Hurry.

532
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,590
Hurry up.

533
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,450
Where is it?

534
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,000
Is this our company?

535
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,060
There is such a place in our company?

536
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,260
Why didn't I know?

537
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,400
Bai.

538
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,050
Who told you this?

539
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,830
An online friend told me.

540
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,340
How is it?

541
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,620
Is it amazing?

542
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,170
What online friend? How did your online friend know this?

543
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,120
Is he a hacker?

544
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,380
No, no.

545
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,100
This place is so luxurious.

546
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:51,980
What is this place?

547
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,110
I don't know. We have a place to hide.

548
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,930
Is that the latest one?

549
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,550
The latest one.

550
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,560
Lower your voice.

551

Wine.

552
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:10,970
Game handles.

553
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,200
Why is there always someone occupying the lounge?

554
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,680
This...

Mr. Zheng.

The list of people

who slacked in work the most and left the desk the longest

559

is out.

560

Tell everyone to have a meeting

to announce it.

562
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,070
But...

563
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,770
This is a warning to others.

564
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,560
Tell the Finance Department

565
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,750
to deduct his salary.

566
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,260
But...

567
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,660
But what?

568
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,410
Do you have a problem with me?

569
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,290
I dare not.

570
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,360
Go.

571
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,020
But...

572
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,060
Have you received

the email?

574
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,090
I think this typical case

575
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,860
must be strictly handled

576
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,770
so that other employees

the name of that employee.

581
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,880
I can't.

00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,500
Why not?

583
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,210

604
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,100
Hello, Chairman.

605
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,610
Have a seat.

606
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,090
Mr. Zheng,

607
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,760
did your paid life restriction work

608
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,400
this month?

609
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,160
Forced labor

610
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,740
will not increase people's passion for life,

611
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,280
Instead, it will greatly reduce

612
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,580
everyone's enthusiasm and passion for labor.

613
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,830
Do you know

614
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,360
the number of people who submitted the resignations

615
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,390
has raised three times this month?

616
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,240
Who came up with this stupid idea?

617
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,990
Yes, sir.

618
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,200
You're right.

619
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,000
But we did it

620
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,610
for the company.

621
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,940
But have you forgotten

622
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,810
how Gaofa developed into a big and powerful company?

623
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,950
It was to give employees

624
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,930
complete trust and freedom.

625
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,190
So our employees

626
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,460
are the most loyal

627
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,000
in all companies.

628
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,640
What about now?

629
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,610
No toilet.

630
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,050
No makeup.

631
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,590
How can the employees agree with the company?

632
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,260
Chairman,

633
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,240
the employees always do personal things

634
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,150
during working hours.

635
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,060
Is it right to arrange work

636
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,470
when they are off work?

637
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,430
Yes.

638
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,590
As leaders,

639
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,790
you don't

640
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,650
focus on work,

641
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,030
but think about

642
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,380
how to treat employees as enemies all day long.

643

What are you thinking?

644
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,990
And you, Zheng.

645
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,950
Think about it.

How did you get this position?

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,500
What made you?

648
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,400
All of you are the same.

649
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,560
Never forget your origins.

650

Think about it.
