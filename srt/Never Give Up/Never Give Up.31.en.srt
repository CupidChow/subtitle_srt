00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,210
And the whole Finance Department

517
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,370
had to do it with him on New Year's Eve.

518
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,090
I know this.

519
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,200
But Tianran wasn't to blame

520
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,060
for that.

521
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,440
Let me tell you.

522
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,870
Director Yao was more annoying.

523
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,240
He left work on New Year's Eve

524
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,160
and remotely ordered

525
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,450
some instant noodles for us.

526
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,600
He was so stingy.

527
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,990
Director Yao has been single

528
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,240
for a reason.

529
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,440
Today he also defended Li Tianran.

530
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,120
If not for his provoking,

531
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,630
Mr. Yu

532
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,210
wouldn't have

533
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,920
assigned us this task.

534
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,900
That's right.

535
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,090
It's his fault.

536
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,490
Let's not help Mr. Yu

537
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,640
with this mission either.

538
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,410
No way.

539
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,830
We can't let him get away with it.

540
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,100
I'm under pressure

541
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,290
all because of him.

542
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,590
Yu Qimiao

543
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,350
said I was old.

544
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,319
But I'm

545
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,079
younger than him.

546
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,530
He said I was not active.

547
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,230
Where are you all day long?

548
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,060
Where are you?

549
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,040
Where are you?

550
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,560
Okay.

551
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,430
Okay.

552
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:14,890
Here is the thing.

553
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,140
Mr. Yu is after all the department manager.

554
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:16,720
Here.

555
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,650
Let's think about Director Yao.

556
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,109
You've carried Director Yao all along.

557
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,200
You have a good relationship.

558
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,490
Yao Siwen.

559
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,900
Is that him?

560
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,730
Yes.

561
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,010
Ungrateful villain.

562
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,990
He is always dressed up in fancy clothes.

563
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,910
Are you pretending to be something big?

564
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,180
Mr. Ji.

565
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,190
Mr. Ji.

566
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,550
How can you call me that?

567
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,880
I'm your master.

568
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,260
Okay, okay.

569
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,220
His face is all broken.

570
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,090
How about this?

571
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,260
Think about

572
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,110
your wife.

573
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,710
Think about your harmonious family.

574
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,520
Right?

575
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,010
Family.

576
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,290
Wife.

577
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,620
Wife.

578
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,330
Don't go there.

579
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,000
It's dangerous there.

580
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,680
Don't.

581
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,370
Let go of me.

582
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,740
I... I didn't want to jump off the building.

583
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,090
As to my wife,

584
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,710
I can only let out my feelings through shouting.

585
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,140
Honey,

586
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,060
promise me.

587
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,560
Give me an extra 100 yuan of pocket money

588
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,880
this month.

589
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,360
It's the end of the month soon.

590
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,320
Where's the money?

591
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,390
Call out.

592
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,080
Give it to me.

593
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,190
How's that?

594
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,370
I feel much better.

595
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,010
Did you release your feelings?

596
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,000
It's so good.

597
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,340
It's different when you shout.

598
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,520
Come on.

599
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Okay, Tianran.

600
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,170
It's getting late.

601
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,940
You should go home.

602
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,560
Okay.

603
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,600
Otherwise, my wife would reproach me again.

604
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,150
That's right.

605
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,630
So

606
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,940
you must be careful

607
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,020
with marriage.

608
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,820
Yes, I understand.

609
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,730
It's not easy.

610
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,850
It's not easy.

611
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
It's not easy.

612
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,440
Really.

613
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,490
Don't be angry.

614
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,320
Mr. Yu.

615
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,080
We've tried everything.

616
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,500
It's just not working.

617
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,000
I think

618
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,010
it's all Li Tianran's fault.

619
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,560
You can't say that.

620
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,710
I think Li Tianran…

621
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,360
What do you think?

622
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,400
What's the big deal?

623
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
You guys are so inefficient

624
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,650
and can't even solve this.

625
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,730
Solve this

626
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,060
before you go to work tomorrow.

627
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,320
Otherwise, your year-end bonus…

628
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,280
No, then...

629
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,490
Then let's do it together.

630
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,300
Together.

631
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,920
Together.

632
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,600
Come on.

633
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,270
Okay.

634
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,910
Don't worry.

635
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,750
Hurry up.

636
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,870
I promise to finish the job.

637
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,130
I'll get on my job then.

638
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,550
It's okay.

639
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,320
I can...

640
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,640
Come to my office.

641
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,030
Let's discuss

642
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,410
the project.

643
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,340
Looks like they're going to make a big move tonight.

644
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,190
Take care of ourselves.

645
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,280
Sit.

646
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,500
Sisi, come here.

647
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,530
I'm sorry to say

648
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,070
that I was a bit impulsive that day.

649
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,930
We didn't play well.

650
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,890
So that day doesn't count.

651
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,990
We'll start again today.

652
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,790
Dear colleagues,

653
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,510
Fan Sisi, Li Tianran,

654
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,810
we're here today

655
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,750
mainly to work together on

656
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,510
team unity

657
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,690
and cohesion.

658
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,740
Of course.

659
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,890
Both Ms. Fan and Li Tianran

660
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,080
are very good colleagues

661
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,750
in Planning Department 3.

662
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,430
But no matter how close we're,

663
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,560
we can run into

664
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,950
some problems…

665
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,970
We've achieved our purpose anyway.

666
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,410
Just accept the good.

667
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,140
OK.

668
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,940
In the workplace.

669
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,740
So today…

670
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,940
Director Yao,

671
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,670
guys,

672
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,420
you have come just in time.

673
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,710
In fact,

674
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,970
Tianran and I

675
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,280
have decided to make up.

676
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,710
I haven't even gotten to the point yet.

677
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,300
But...

678
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,590
Ms. Fan has always been understanding.

679
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,730
But Li Tianran...

680
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,400
He... he often...

681
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,550
It's hard for him to change.

682
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,560
I've changed.

683
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,320
I have reflected deeply on

684
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,350
my mistakes.

685
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,310
I decided to

686
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,320
apologize to Ms. Fan.

687
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,230
Ms. Fan,

688
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,130
