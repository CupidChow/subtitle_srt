No, I don't.

846
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,020
I thought the coins were free

847

Didn't you read the user agreement?

849
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,870
It's written in Article 258 of the user agreement.

850
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,740
Who would read 258 articles?

851
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,290
I just agreed to everything.

852
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,680
Did you read every article of the agreement?

853
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,330
Yes.

Did you fall asleep during the game?

859

The box by the foot is you.

863
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,770
By the way, the system just informed me

864
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,510
that 99 coins can revive a teammate.

865
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,760
How about I purchase 99 coins?

866
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,380
Wait.

867

I did.

It's convenient for you to find a good restaurant.

909
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,980
You always say to chill at work,

910
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,310
but you act very actively.

911
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,460
You're trying to start a rat race.

912
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,700
You left me no choice but to tell them about

my family restaurant.

914
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,690
You only saw what you saw.

915
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,060
I didn't list our regular restaurants

916

Beef is your favorite, isn't it?

924

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,990
Sure.

942
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,650
Dried scallops are good.

Look, there are so many of them.

How can you eat preserved eggs?

953

What's wrong with that?

954
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,640
You know I don't like preserved eggs.

955
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,510
It smells terrible.

956
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,030
Don't eat preserved eggs if you dine with me.

957
