[Person not concerned is allowed to enter the experimental site.]

520
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,900
Our beta test this time

521
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,540
is mainly to simulate

522
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,760
some simple family first aid scenes

523
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,700
such as

524
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,880
stiff neck,

525
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,250
cut

526
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,730
and fire.

527
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,270
Aiming at these situations,

528
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,290
we have developed

529
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,630
an ecological restoration emergency system

530
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,450
with strong matching-

531
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,510
Rice Cake Protection.

532
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,720
And this system

533
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,120
has been connected to

534
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,070
the internal ecological network of the group.

535
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,540
Of course, we should thank Mr. Zheng

536
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,430
for the fearless behavior of beta test.

537
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,460
He made outstanding contributions

538
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,420
for the successful beta test.

539
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,670
And our team

540
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,180
is very optimistic about

541
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,020
the prospect of Rice Cake Protection.

542
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,390
Zheng Qiguai

543
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,090

to the southernmost part of the earth.

546
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,760
Let her reflect on herself.

547

[lucky day to step on eggs]

548
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,660
Yes.

549
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,750
Right.

550
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,730
I'll send you the analysis report

551
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,120
and testing data later.

552
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,200
Okay.

553
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,340
Thank you. Bye.

554
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,120
Why are you so busy every day?

555
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,280
Ms. Fan, don't you think

556
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,830
you don't even know what you're busy with?

557
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,380
Working is so boring every day.

558
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,340
That's how work is.

559
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,770
So after work,

560
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,910
we have to things we like

561
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,000
to enjoy our lives

562
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,270
and balance the pain of working.

563
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,090
What do you usually do, Sisi?

564
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,600
Reading Chinese comics, watching TV series, eating snacks,

565
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,320
buying blind boxes, merchandises, and figures.

566
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,010
There are many things to do.

567
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,000
So fulfilling.

568
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,600
Entertainment is important,

569
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,040
but

570
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,250
shouldn't we also

571
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,000
find some fun in work?

572
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,710
Mr. Yu is right.

573
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,150
Think about it.

574
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,350
The working time

575
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,760
is two thirds of our life time.

576
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,470
If you treat work as torture,

577
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,250
how can you feel happy in life?

578
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Am I right, Ms. Fan?

579
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,780
Am I right, Jiang Mei?

580
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:48,580
Yes.

581
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,120
Mr. Yu is absolutely right.

582
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,200
Here's your chrysanthemum tea.

583
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:51,820
Thank you.

585
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,120
I like to hear you talk.

In the current environment,

587
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,090
we have work and tea.

588
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,650
How happy!

589
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,540
You have to find and create your own sense of happiness.

590
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,260
You wrote it?

591
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,320
What kind of crap is this?

592
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,140
I used to think working is torture.

593
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,590
What the hell did you write?
