We've been working overtime these days.

173
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,440
We can't even finish it.

174
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,590
And Mr. Zheng said

175
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,620
we must submit it next Monday.

176
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,450
We can't delay it for a day.

177
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,110
Dismiss.

178
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:05,860
Dismiss.

179
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,720
Wait.

180
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,840
You can submit the project plan

181
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,150
three days late.

182
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:10,960
This...

183
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,060
The annual party is coming

184
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,920
in a few days.

185
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,520
I think your show is great.

186
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,140
You should perform on stage.

187
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,370
No, no, no.

188
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,870
We're just having fun in private.

189
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,110
We can't perform on stage.

190
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,540
Yes, you can.

191
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,480
How about this?

192
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,810
I quit.

193
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,010
I'll catch up with the progress of the Rice Cake project.

194
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,320
You can be back to practice.

195
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,110
This won't do.

196
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,150
If Sisi quits,

197
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,280
we will have no lead singer here.

198
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,280
Yes.

199
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,590
Unless...

200
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,930
Unless Mr. Zheng

201
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,690
can be our lead singer,

202
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,920
it might work.

203
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,580
I...

204
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,740
[I like working overtime.]

205
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,460
You can.

206
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,190
You can.

207
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,040
Absolutely.

208
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,080
You can.

209
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:50,990
Absolutely.

210
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,970
Can I?

211
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,050
For the progress of the Rice Cake project,

212
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,930
I'll play

213
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,070
with you.

214
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,170
Yes.

215
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,590
Just for fun.

216
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,130
What an honor.

217
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,120
[I like working overtime.]

218
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,840
Let's practice in the conference room

219
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,190
at three o'clock tomorrow.

220
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,120
[I like working overtime.]

221
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,920
Wait.

222
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,350
Two o'clock.

223
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,900
Two o'clock.

224
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,120
Two o'clock. Okay, two o'clock.

225
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,280
Tianran.

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,220
Just focus on your plan.

227
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,530
We'll stall him.

228
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,290
Let him sing.

229
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:37,350
[I like working overtime.]

230
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,610
Dismiss.

231
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,900
Mr. Zheng, let me introduce

232
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,260
our choir members

233
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,299
who have studied music for more than 10 years on average

234
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,600
and

235
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,390
are close to

236
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,180
professional level.

237
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,390
First of all, the rhythm and beatbox part.

238
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,450
Director Yao.

239
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,910
Ms. Wu.

240
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,000
The biggest characteristic of this part is

241
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,670
deep

242
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,900
and rhythmic.

243
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,870
Director Yao, isn't your key

244
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,460
too low?

245
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,300
Low? It's in C major.

246
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,270
I have to use a ladder.

247
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,320
I can't go up.

248
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,250
Ms. Wu,

249
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,750
your rhythm is a mess.

250
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,500
I had failed the music class

251
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,270
since the third grade.

252
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,020
How about this?

253
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,870
You two do the beatbox.

254
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,930
It's a beat anyway.

255
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,370
Okay.

256
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,360
No one can tell if it's a mess.

257
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,100
No problem.

258
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,480
Okay?'

259
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:26,820
Okay.

260
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,990
Alto.

261
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,740
Mr. Ji and Jiang Mei.

262
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,600
You can take it as

263
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,780
a male and female duet.

264
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,830
Its characteristic is that the male voice is vigorous

265
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,530
and the female voice is sweet.

266
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,040
Mr. Ji.

267
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,250
Mr. Yu.

268
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,360
I can sing the Alto,

269
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,370
but it doesn't mean I'm middle-aged.

270
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,090
I'm still young.

271
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,450
Actually, I can sing that young part.

272
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,560
Don't worry, Mr. Ji.

273
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,270
I'm the youngest in our department.

274
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,830
Let's call it the youngest vocal part.

275
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,550
Let's call it the low vocal part.

276
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,760
Low vocal part?

277
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,620
Low vocal part.

278
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,560
I need to introduce

279
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,140
our conductor especially.

280
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,480
Li Tianran.

281
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,440
Li Tianran, you really know how to conduct?

282
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,800
I spent a lot of money

283
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,150
learning from Mr. Wang Wuliu.

284
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:26,530
Look.

285
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,590
Three beats on one side

286
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,080
and four beats on the other.

287
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,400
Together.

288
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,090
See?

289
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,440
She can teach this?

290
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,800
It's none of your business.

291
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,390
Just tell me how it is.

292
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,640
I guess that's it.

293
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,410
Can he do it?

294
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,440
I think he's good.

295
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,820
You are in.

296
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,590
Okay.

297
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,660
Let's do our best.

298
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,460
He once learned from an internationally

299
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,390
famous conductor,

300
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,750
Wang Wuliu.

301
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,760
Wu Mingshi and I

302
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,020
are also part of the vocal.

303
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,890
Our voices may not be able to hear.

304
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,250
We just make up the number.

305
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,760
But most importantly,

306
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,880
the Planning Department 3 is all here.

307
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,220
Mr. Yu, you're too modest.

308
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,760
I didn't expect that the Planning Department 3 has so many talents.

309
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,970
All of you have unique skills.

310
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,070
But our band

311
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,530
should have a name.

312
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,120
Speaking of that,

313
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,980
I think our band should be called

314
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,130
"Amazing Zheng".

315
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,510
After all, our lead singer

316
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,340
is really amazing.

317
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,230
Why don't we call it "Handsome Zheng"?

318
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,800
It suits Mr. Zheng

319
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,330
and our band's temperament.

320
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,260
Speaking of temperament,

321
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,910
why don't you call it "Upright Zheng"?

322
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,070
Isn't that Mr. Zheng himself?

323
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,150
Why don't we call it "Righteous Zheng"?

324
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,200
That's a good name.

325
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,860
Let's call it "Righteous Zheng".

326
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,410
Righteous Zheng.

327
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,870
I can't believe that worked.

328
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,550
You know a lot, Tianran.

329
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,320
You know Mr. Zheng's rival

330
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,800
is Mr. Xie.

331
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,770
No matter what name

332
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,670
our band is,

333
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,270
I believe

334
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,570
we can attract everyone's attention

335
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,310
as long as we go on stage at the annual party,

336
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,450
mainly the chairman's attention.

337
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,590
Mr. Yu. Mr. Yu.

338
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,230
Don't make me look like

339
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,120
I like showing off.

340
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,780
Gaofa's annual party

341
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,550
belongs to every one in Gaofa.

342
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,130
