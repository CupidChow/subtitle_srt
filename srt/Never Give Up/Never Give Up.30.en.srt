[Planning Department 3]

Our focus this time

181

is to thoroughly learn

182
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,730
the Work Manual of our Chairman

of Gaofa Technology.

184
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,680
Look at this 3rd branch

of the 8th small point of the 2nd major point,

it is about the consciousness of innovation.

Innovation is...

188

I have a question, Sir.

Excuse me.

190
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,510
What is the difference between

and pursuing innovation and change

193

from the former 3rd small point of the 5th major point?

This is our Chairman's work manual.

Understand?

200
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,790
I understand.

201

No buts.

How about this?

You go to the General Affairs Office,

get ten boxes of paper,

Tianran's face won't get hurt.

211

This is what the manual said.

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,820
Mingxiu.

346
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,110
I took out your charger out.

347
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,630
Come and get it.

348
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,970
I'm at the bus stop.

349
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,090
I can't walk anymore.

350
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,850
Why are you avoiding me?

351
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,620
I'm avoiding you?

352
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,810
What a joke.

353
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,710
Leave now.

354
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,370
I'm not leaving.

355
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,110
I'll leave if you don't.

356
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,850
Sisi.

357
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,980
Why are you harassing my sister?

358
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,340
Li Tianran.

359
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,360
What are you doing here?

360
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,100
I...

361
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,040
What's wrong with you two?

362
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,470
This is for you.

363
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,250
I'll tell you next time.

364
00:12:59,270 --> 00:12:59,980
Sisi.

365
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,860
I like...

366
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,520
Shut up.

367
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,680
I'm not usually serious.

368
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,340
Thank you.

369
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,640
But this time, I...

370
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,610
Let's talk another day.

371
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,240
No, I'm going to say it this time.

372
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,160
Say it here.

373
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,810
Fine, I can say it here.

374
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,310
I'm not afraid in front of Mingxiu.

375
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,410
I've thought it through.

376
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,420
I'm really not...

377
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,390
Li Tianran.

378
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,490
No matter what you want to say,

379
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,740
don't say it.

380
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,400
Bye.

381
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,560
Sisi.

382
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,940
What do you want to say to her?

383
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,780
I just want to tell her...

384
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,350
Forget it.

385
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,380
She has gone so far.

386
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,420
What's there to say?

387
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,610
Let's go.

388
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,380
Let's go.

389
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,590
Let's go.

390
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,050
Wait.

391
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,880
What happened?

392
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,610
Let's go.

393
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,280
Don't you have something to tell me?

394
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,680
Tell me now.

395
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,210
You can tell me now.

396
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,850
No one is here.

397
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:02,580
Okay.

398
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,420
I just want to know

399
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,310
what I did wrong.

400
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,590
Tell me.

401
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,670
Fine.

402
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,370
Say no more.

403
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,020
Nothing is good.

404
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,570
Save me some face.

405
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,400
Li Tianran.

406
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,820
Actually,

407
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,560
you're not bad.

408
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,970
You are good.

409
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,300
Well...

410
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,880
Then...

411
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,840
What do you mean?

412
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,350
Why are you suddenly like this?

413
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,680
Don't you know

414
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,140
many things will be troublesome

415
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,750
if you say it out loud?

416
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,190
Can't we just get along peacefully like this?

417
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,890
Isn't it good to be so casual?

418
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,100
Other things can be casual.

419
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,700
How can this be casual?

420
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,430
Have you forgotten Director Zhao?

421
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,450
Director Zhao?

422
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,860
He was forced to resign

423
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,010
due to office romance.

424
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,650
We're in the same office.

425
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,630
We're superior and subordinate.

426
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,500
If we got caught,

427
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,500
broke up, became unhappy,

428
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,550
then one of us was forced to resign,

429
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,450
would this be the result

430
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,760
we both want to accept?

431
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,060
But you can't stop dating

432
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,190
because you're afraid of being fired.

433
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,720
It's normal for young people

434
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,630
to fall in love in the office.

435
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,760
What if we become more motivated

436
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,950
when we're together?

437
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,150
Work becomes less tiring when men and women work together.

438
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,830
Right?

439
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,130
You're right.

440
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,240
No problem.

441
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,130
But

442
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,240
if I agree to

443
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,240
to be with you so rashly,

444
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,570
it'll be too dangerous.

445
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,180
We...

446
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,560
We are in the same office.

447
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,840
Well, we...

448
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,880
We workers

449
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,210
are not qualified to be so willful.

450
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,940
Fine.

451
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,580
Tell me.

452
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,890
What should we do?

453
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,270
I say what to do?

454
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,170
Give me ten days.

455
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,270
Let me think about it.

456
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,570
Ten days later,

457
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,350
I'll give you an answer.

458
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,590
Seven days, okay?

459
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,580
Anyway,

460
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,300
keep your distance.

461
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,650
Don't let anyone

462
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,950
see any signs of our relationship.

463
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,460
May I ask

464
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,290
what's our relationship now?

465
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,650
What relationship?

466
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,320
We're just colleagues.

467
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,840
I'm leaving.

468
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,790
Keep your distance.

469
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,900
Okay.

470
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,130
Colleagues, keep the distance.

471
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,110
Is green pepper on sale?

472
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,250
Why did you put so many?

473
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,780
It doesn't taste good.

474
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,630
Colleague.

475
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,160
Try it. It's delicious.

476
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,900
Ms. Wu.

477
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:58,780
Have some.

478
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,250
Try it.

479
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,760
Thank you.

480
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:19,980
Colleague.

481
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,610
No, Tianran.

482
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,630
What are you doing?

483
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,860
I saw a post online saying

484
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,000
drinking other people's water

485
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,400
will make you feel less spicy.

486
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,120
Your ignorance

487
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,680
can always break my lower limit.

488
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,410
No.

489
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,520
Something's wrong with you two.

490
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,230
You've been acting strange these days.

491
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,340
Tell me.

492
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,390
Are you two...

493
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,360
I didn't...

494
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,730
I know.

495
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,350
Democratic evaluation is coming.

496
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,810
Yes.

497
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,800
I knew it.

498
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,270
You're right.

499
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,040
Don't eat that.

500
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,740
This one.

501
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,690
Try it.

502
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,400
Which one do you like?

503
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,100
Okay.

504
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,580
Don't push.

505
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,230
The last one. Be self-aware.

506
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,200
The elevator is overloaded.

507
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,840
Hurry up.

508
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,110
Time to work. I'm late.

509
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,440
Good morning, colleague.

510
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,620
Hurry up.

511
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,560
Our cooperation

512
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,240
is one plus one equals more than two.

513
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,400
It's not only about profit,

514
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,100
but it can also

515
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,890
bring more additional benefit

516
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,030
to our two brands.

517
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,060
So, Ms. Fan.

518
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,640
The second part...

519
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,550
Ms. Fan.

520
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,450
It's already noon.

521
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,050
Would you like to ask Mr. Liu

522
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,900
to have lunch with us?

523
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,670
Thank you.

524
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,510
Of course.

525
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,140
Mr. Liu,

526
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,330
please

527
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,350
have dinner with us.

528
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,440
I'll do as you say.

529
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,540
Let's talk while eating.

530
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,180
Okay.

531
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,300
Should we order the 58-yuan

532
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,330
regular employee meal

533
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,400
or the 98-yuan

534
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,680
VIP exclusive set?

535
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,700
Of course the most expensive one among the VIP sets.

536
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,190
But last time you said his level...

537
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,400
My throat hurts.

538
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,370
Let's go.

539
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,330
Let's go.

540
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,360
58 yuan is enough.

541
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,900
Yes.

542
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,390
Hello, give me an ice cream.

543
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,430
Okay.

544
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,790
Give me a...

545
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,860
Team Leader.

546
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,030
I didn't expect to meet you here by fate

547
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,210
as colleagues.

548
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,320
Give me a pistachio flavor one.

549
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,600
I'm in a bad mood recently.

550
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,450
I want to be happy by eating some ice cream

551
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,070
Then, I don't want ice cream anymore.

552
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,290
Give me a cup of hot cocoa.

553
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,070
My heart is cold lately.

554
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,760
Some colleague is too cruel.

555
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,820
I don't want it in a cone.

556
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,050
I want a it in a bowl.

557
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,690
Maybe one day I'll lose my job

558
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,030
because of someone.

559
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,420
I have to prepare in advance.

560
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,530
I want full sugar.

561
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,280
After all, life is too hard.

562
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,750
Excuse me.

563
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,140
Scan the code to pay.

564
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,210
Are you paying together or separately?

565
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,510
We'll discuss

566
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,080
about this.

567
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,830
Logically speaking,

568
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,040
as colleagues,

569
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,910
it's not a big deal

570
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,010
to treat you ice cream.

571
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,820
But we have to

572
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,690
avoid being recognized as a couple now.

573
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,490
So it's better to go dutch.

574
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,360
What do you mean?

575
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,530
Nothing.

576
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,570
Just what I said.

577
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,960
Fine.

578
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,380
I don't want it anymore, okay?

579
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,430
I was wrong.

580
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,430
I admit

581
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,510
I was messing around.

582
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,790
That's because I can't stand it anymore.

583
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,720
I promise you ten days.

584
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,340
It's only the fourth day.

585
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,770
I don't want to wait any longer.

586
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,880
Sisi, do you know?

587
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,670
Since you came to our department,

588
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,350
since you moved next door to me,

589
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,250
we've changed from colleagues to neighbors,

590
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,670
and from neighbors to friends.

591
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,030
Everyday, I see you at work

592
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,770
and after work.

593
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,650
You are everywhere in my life.

594
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,530
How about

595
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,010
I'll avoid you these days?

596
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,380
Do you know?

597
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,420
The reason I knock on your door

598
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,270
at 8:04 a.m everyday

599
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,370
is that I want to see you one minute earlier.

600
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,460
I know you are angry when you get up.

601
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,960
But I think

602
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,110
you're cute when you curse.

603
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,450
I know you like Chinese comics

604
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,330
and blind boxes.

605
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,420
I don't understand these.

606
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,440
But I'm willing to learn

607
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,360
and get close to you.

608
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,990
I know you don't like to work overtime.

609
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,190
So I'm willing to work overtime for you

610
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,880
and finish your work.

611
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,090
I know you're short,

612
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,150
but I'm not tall either.

613
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,410
I admit that I'm stupid.

614
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,080
In my life,

615
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,930
I do everything casually.

616
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,080
But I've never been casual

617
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,610
about liking you.

618
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,230
They call me Black Hole.

619
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,230
Only you call me heating pad.

620
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,070
Because I just want to warm you up.

621
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,710
I used to think

622
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,620
being with you every day was a habit.

623
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,130
Now I realize

624
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,270
I'm used to being dependent on you.

625
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,470
Time can prove everything, right?

626
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,710
I will make you believe

627
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,730
with my actions

628
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,970
that I'm not being impulsive with you,

629
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,100
but I'll be with you to the end.

630
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,460
Enough.

631
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,000
Brother.

632
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,510
I can't stand it anymore.

633
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,220
Why are you talking about height?

634
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,740
What do you mean that I'm short and you're not tall?

635
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,310
This is more disgusting

636
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,300
than Yu Zhongzhong's TV series.

637
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:46,980
Sisi,

638
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,500
you don't like

639
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,320
being harassed by me?

640
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,270
Think carefully.

641
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,780
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

642
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,640
Li Tianran, listen carefully.

643
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,990
My sister Sisi wants me to tell you

644
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,710
she doesn't like you.

645
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,720
She doesn't like you.

646
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,130
Do you hear me? Right?

647
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,120
Who said I don't like him?

648
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,490
At first,

649
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,170
I thought you were annoying and dull.

650
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,670
It's hard

651
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,950
to live.

652
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,150
It's hard to move.

653
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,710
It's hard to work overtime.

654
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,650
It's hard to have no money at the end of the month.

655
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,980
It's hard to be afraid alone.

656
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,810
But...

657
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,210
as you said,

658
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,600
I don't know

659
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,630
I don't know

660
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,560
when I started

661
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,720
to be afraid of nothing.

662
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,210
It's okay.

663
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,880
Li Tianran is next door.

664
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,060
It's harder for him than me.

665
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,510
Screw ten days

666
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,060
and workplace code.

667
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,940
Li Tianran.

668
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,320
I like you too.

669
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,040
From now on,

670
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,520
I'm your girlfriend

671
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,900
♫Small light♫

672
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,810
♫Can melt the night♫

673

00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,870

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,280
♫Small people♫

♫Will be cared for♫

677

Right,

678
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,900
we're done discussing.

679
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:44,580
I'll pay.

680
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,470
This is my girlfriend

681
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,420
♫Through the crowds♫

682

♫Through the crowds comes the flowers♫

684
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,340
Tell me honestly.

685
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,280
Who taught you

686
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,870
these sweet lines?

687
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,380
