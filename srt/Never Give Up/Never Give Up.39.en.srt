Either I'll die from the heat

342
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,190
or from the sunburn. What should I do?

343
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,700
Go Jiang Mei.

344
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,610
Go Jiang Mei.

345
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,490
Go Jiang Mei.

346
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,560
Last five seconds.

347
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,340
Four, three, two.

348
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,010
It's not over yet.

349
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,660
One.

350
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,590
Good.

351
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,130
Twelve strokes a minute.

352
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,080
It doesn't look good.

353
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,950
How am I going to

354
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,480
get to the top?

355
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,880
Did you buy a swimsuit?

356
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,610
Yes.

357
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,100
Did you buy a swim ring?

358
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,890
Yes.

359
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,020
I Also bought ten little yellow ducks.

360
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,090
Quack.

361
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,760
Thank you.

362
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,300
Here.

363
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,750
Didn't you say you were going on vacation?

364
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,820
Why do we have to come so early?

365
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,900
It's earlier than work.

366
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,940
We're here to ride a bike.

367
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,230
There are tandem bikes here.

368
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,760
There are also tandem bikes

369
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,790
in the park near home.

370
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,850
I've never seen you ride one.

371
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,680
Is it the same?

372
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,420
What's it like here?

373
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,290
What's it like at home?

374
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,220
Excuse me, can you store my luggage for me?

375
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,870
Thank you.

376
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,590
Hurry up.

377
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,080
Now?

378
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,590
Now.

379
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,540
Ride bike around the island.

380
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,620
Draw a circle of love along the resort.

We're still late.

There's only a bike for three people left.

393
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,040
So, I can go back and catch up on my sleep, right?

394
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,300
No, no. Forget it.

This can do too.

396
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,860
It's just a little longer.

397
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,280
Well.

398
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,480
Let me push it out

399
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,880
and correct the position first.

400
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,930
Come on.

00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,460
It's done.

Good.

403
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,190
The morning belongs to the two of us

404
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,290
is about to start.

405
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,020
Sisi, get in.

406
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,680
Sisi.

407
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,990
Tianran, it's you guys.

408
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,790
Why are you here?

409
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,280
Honey.

410
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,560
Where's my blue rash vest?

411
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,490
I just washed it for you.

412
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,780
You washed it?

413
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,620
Why did you wash it?

414
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,210
Yao.

415
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,580
My rash vest was washed.

416
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,590
My wife washed it.

417
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,390
It's good.

418
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,610
We're not going mountain climbing.

419
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,750
It's physically demanding.

420
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,790
We need to relax.

421
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,230
Let's go to a hot spring.

422
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,880
There's a hot spring resort recently

423
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,270
that is very well advertised.

424
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,440
Let's go there.

425
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,360
Yes, a hot spring.

426
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,120
Team building.

427
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,170
Let's all be honest with each other.

428
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,110
Yes, okay?

429
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,530
It's a deal.

430
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,930
Wash your vest too.

431
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,950
Okay, let everyone know.

432
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,610
That's it.

433
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,200
Director Yao called me this morning,

434
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,600
saying we're not going to climb the mountain.

435
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,950
We'll go to the hot spring instead.

436
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,120
So I was asked to come and explore the area first.

437
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,640
Wait.

438
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,750
Why are you here?

439
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,540
Sisi, aren't you meeting a client?

440
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,900
Yes, the client.

441
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,770
Mr. Xu sent me

442
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,470
the address

443
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,650
and it turned out to be

444
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,850
this spa hotel.

445
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,620
What a coincidence.

446
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,040
Japanese customers like to take a bath.

447
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,250
That's not good.

448
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,660
How can you have a meeting at a hot spring hotel?

449
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,250
I don't think he means good.

450
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,350
I'll go with you later.

451
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,980
No, no. There is no need.

452
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,730
I've judged him for that.

453
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,040
And... and...

454
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,080
I don't think

455
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,070
he dares to come today.

456
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,290
That's good.

457
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,880
Tianran.

458
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,110
Aren't you attending

459
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,270
your uncle's wedding?

460
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,450
My uncle, he...

461
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,220
I asked him that question too.

462
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,520
Guess what?

463
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,490
His uncle

464
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,880
was supposed to hold the wedding here.

465
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,580
But

466
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,540
his wife ran away.

467
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,550
The wedding is failed.

468
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,210
The bride ran away?

469
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,380
What a sad story.

470
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,450
It's so sad.

471
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,470
It's okay, Tianran.

472
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,340
We can turn sadness into strength.

473
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,430
We can exercise

474
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,220
and let it out

475
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,410
I'm going to check it out too.

476
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,780
Sisi, sit in the back.

477
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,830
The back is safe.

478
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,760
That's fine.

479
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,130
Get on then.

480
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,700
The three-seat bike is just right.

481
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,250
It's for you.

482
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,530
Let's go.

483
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,580
Let's go.

484
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:05,580
It's okay.

485
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,580
Go, go, go.

486
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,830
♫Don't worry I won't miss you♫

487
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,930
♫Keep it mysterious♫

488
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,190
♫Be vibrant♫

♫All my troubles and sorrows are none of my business♫

492
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,570
♫None of my business ♫

493
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,830
Tianran,

494
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,290
don't be too sad about your uncle.

495
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,950
What's the saying?

496
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,700
You have to leave the wrong one to meet the right one.

497
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,680
Yes, let's live with that.

498
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,990
It's useless for me to be sad.

499
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,270
That's right.

500
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,450
Let's go for a ride and take a break.

501
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,720
You'll feel better.

502
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,520
Right?

503
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:53,980
No.

504
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,100
Look at the road.

505
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,790
No, I...

506
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,100
I want to see if Sisi is here.

507
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,710
You... you're in charge.

508
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,580
The safety of us is attached to the bike.

509
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,290
Be safe.

510
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,780
Okay.

511
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,829
Sisi.

512
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,599
Tianran.

513
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,589
Have you noticed

514
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:11,150
this is a circular lane?

515
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,460
As long as we keep riding

516
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,250
and riding,

517
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,440
we can ride back to the original point.

518
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,420
I can tell.

519
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,630
It's a dead end.

520
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,339
Ms. Fan, about your client,

521
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,260
Tianran, about your uncle,

522
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,260
I've heard about it.

523
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,849
Ms. Fan,

524
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,400
this kind of client with bad character

525
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,560
is not worth fighting for.

526
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,720
It's not a pity to lose him.

527
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,290
But by mistake,

528
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,510
you've met up with us.

529
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,010
That's a good thing.

530
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,660
It's a good thing.

531
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,920
And about your uncle,

532
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,700
let it go.

533
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,040
I've let it go.

534
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,630
Not all love is like that

535
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,890
in this world.

536
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,210
Okay.

537
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,870
Today is the first day of team building. You can do anything you want.

538
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,070
We'll have group activities tomorrow.

539
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,670
So today we're free

540
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,520
to eat, drink and play.

541
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,040
It's all on the company.

542
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,290
Thank you.

543
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,370
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

544
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,080
Sisi.

545
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,690
Great, you're finally here.

546
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,760
I heard the spa here is very comfortable.

547
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,690
Let's go and try it.

548
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,080
We can also get a manicure on the way.

549
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:06,660
Let's go.

550
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,010
Wait... wait...

551
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,510
I'll go first.

552
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,510
Go.

553
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,820
I'm a cosmology expert, Wang Wuliu.

554
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,490
You're meant to meet me.

555
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,540
If you happen to see this video…

556
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,320
Hello.

557
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,030
I'd like to ask.

558
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,860
This is the ticket I wrote off this morning.

559
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,980
Can you refund it?

560
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,360
Sorry, sir.

561
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,530
You can't return it if it's already been written off.

562
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,140
Listen.

563
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,760
The main problem is that our company

564
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,790
happens to be here for a reunion.

565
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,190
And the room is overbooked, you know?

566
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,980
Why don't you give me a refund secretly?

567
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,440
The invoice has already been issued.

568
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,460
It can't be refunded.

569
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm sorry.

570
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,950
It's

571
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,250
2888 yuan.

572
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,770
I just can't return it.

573
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,670
Two, hang the love lock on the Lovers' Bridge,

574
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,210
put the words of love on the love lock

575
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,420
and lock it on the bridge,

576
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,080
so that the river god under the bridge

577
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,040
will wish you to be true

578
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
and faithful to each other.

579
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,130
There is never a third choice.

580
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,420
It's high noon.

581
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,820
The sun is shining.

582
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,680
Sisi, I'm at the Lovers' Bridge.

583
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,660
[Li Tianran]

584
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,510
Where have you been?

585
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,700
I'm waiting.

586
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,450
[Fan Sisi]

587
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,490
I just got my face done.

588
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,500
Almost there.

589
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,760
How about over there?

590
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,390
This place is okay.

591
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,270
Then let's go.

592
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,490
Wait, let me see if it's locked.

593
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,730
Sisi, are you coming?

594
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,400
[Li Tianran]

595
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,280
[Fan Sisi]

596
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,750
I'm getting a massage. Almost there.

597
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,280
[Li Tianran]

598
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,760
Sisi, how about finishing it

599
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,060
tomorrow?

600
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,190
Come here first.

601
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,730
[Fan Sisi]

602
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,500
I'm getting a manicure.

603
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,510
One hand left.

604
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,490
Almost there.

605
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,860
Tianran.

606
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,870
Sorry.

607
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,820
The hotel spa…

608
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,560
And massage

609
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,110
and the manicure

610
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:04,910
were really

611
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,480
slow.

612
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,060
Yeah.

613
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,320
Why do you want me to come here?

614
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,280
To hang a lock?

615
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,380
This is Lovers' Bridge.

616
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,670
Why don't we hang one too?

617
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,560
Isn't it corny?

618
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,300
Yes.

619
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,410
Then let's go.

620
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,920
Let's do this one.

621
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,190
What are you carving?

622
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,050
Li Tianran, Fan Sisi.

623
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,330
Hold hands and grow old together.

624
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,350
Tianran, Ms. Fan.

625
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,410
You're hanging a lock too?

626
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,700
Hold hands.

627
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,600
And then?

628
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,950
Go for the projects.

629
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,000
Hold hands. Go for the projects.

630
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,850
I've decided to go for it with Tianran next year.

631
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,570
We'll do well in the project.

632
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,100
That's right.

633
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,420
That's not what you said.

634
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,000
That's what we said.

635
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,330
This is novelty.

636
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,800
Director Yao,

637
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,660
this phrase is from the “Book of Songs”,

638
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,350
originally referring to two brothers

639
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,810
who fought bravely on the battlefield.

640
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,740
It's right to be used

641
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,630
in the case of Ms. Fan and me

642
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,680
create a career together.

643
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,100
What are you engraving on this?

644
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,100
Let me see.

645
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,420
It's about

646
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,470
how I hope Mr. Yu to retire,

647
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,830
so that I can take over his position.

648
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,070
By the way, young man.

649
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:24,870
I remember now.

650
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,420
You said

651
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,060
you wanted to carve

652
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,190
your wish to find three girlfriends this year.

653
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,890
You would be a vegetarian for life for that.

654
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,890
I left one of the characters.

655
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,540
No, you didn't.

656
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,200
It's complete.

657
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:36,850
Is that so?

658
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,410
Nothing is missing.

659
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,230
I misremembered.

660
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,530
We rode the two-seat bicycle in some way.

661
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,920
It didn't say a three-seat one couldn't do.

662
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,460
Done.

663
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,620
We also hung the lock.

664
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,090
The sentence was only half correct.

665
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,380
Bai.

666
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,600
We always say we can round…

667
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,430
Up.

668
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:12,980
Right.

669
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,140
Round it up.

670
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,280
Consider it done.

671
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,620
Done.

672
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,780
There's never a third choice.

673
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,270
Three, you can take a dip in the rose pool.

674
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,790
The scent of roses.

675
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,160
The heavenly pool.

676
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,790
Let the hot spring water

677
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,300
stretch

678
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,590
your cold limbs.

679
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,700
Make up the rest by yourself.

680
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,160
Bai.

681
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,770
Did you go to hot springs at daytime?

682
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,540
God.

683
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,350
Forget about it.

684
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,630
Mr. Ji made me

685
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,760
experience each pool three times.

686
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,590
My hands are puffy.

687
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,670
Make a wish when the meteor is not falling.

688
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,450
Your dreams can come true.

689
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,480
People are either playing with their phones

690
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,600
or sleeping now.

691
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,170
There must be no one there

692
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,450
if I go to the rose pool with Sisi now.

693
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,260
Finally, please give me a five-star review.

694
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Did you sleep?

695
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,470
[Li Tianran]

696
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,950
See you at the rose pool.

697
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,540
Sending all my love for you.

698
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,380
Hello?

699
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,580
Where are you?

700
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,640
At the rockery.

701
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,710
Yes, the rockery.

702
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,820
Go further on.

703
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,950
You will see a road sign.

704
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,650
Then turn to the right.

705
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,610
Just keep going.

706
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,100
Okay. Waiting for you.

707
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,670
The hot spring

708
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,180
symbolizes our hot love.

709
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,530
Tianran.

710
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,180
Mr. Ji.

711
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,440
What are you doing here?

712
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,590
Haven't you been here in the daytime?

713
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,520
Daytime is daytime.

714
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,690
This is the night.

715
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,770
I'm telling you.

716
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,760
You have to enjoy the hot spring

717
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,140
24 hours a day,

718
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,630
every now and then.

719
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,980
Otherwise it'll be a loss.

720
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,920
No way.

721
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,560
You can't always stay in the pool

722
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,320
at your age.

723
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,010
What if you get high blood pressure from it?

724
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,540
I'm telling you.

725
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,390
You'll be in trouble

726
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,130
if you faint in the pool.

727
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:53,950
It's okay.

728
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,250
My body…

729
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,710
My... my body...

730
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,150
What? What's wrong?

731
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,340
Tianran.

732
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,410
With what you said,

733
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,560
I…

734
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,280
Am I right?

735
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,040
Come up here.

736
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,060
You should go back to rest.

737
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,380
I see.

738
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,080
I have low blood sugar.

739
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,300
Just eat something sweet.

740
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,340
You see?

741
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,120
I'll be fine soon.

742
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,780
Come on.

743
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,150
And red wine.

744
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,480
What?

745
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,540
Did you call me?

746
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:38,940
Come down.

747
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,540
You…

748
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,640
Enjoy it yourself.

749
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,840
Tianran, since you're here,

750
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,780
get in here.

751
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,610
You just don't know how to enjoy your life.

752
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,630
Fortunately, no one has noticed.

753
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,880
What's wrong?

754
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,200
Nothing.

755
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,030
I saw you fell asleep.

756
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,180
I turned off the TV for you.

757
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,360
I didn't fall asleep.

758
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,030
Tianran.

759
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,900
I'm watching TV.

760
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,720
I've been in the spa too much today.

761
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,060
I'm sleepy.

762
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,140
Where did you go just now?

763
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,070
It's so late.

764
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,750
You didn't go to the hot spring, did you?

765
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,940
No, I didn't.

766
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,460
I went for a swim in the pool.

767
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,540
Are you that disciplined?

768
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,030
You went for exercising so late at night?

769
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,200
I'm impressed.

770
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,470
Absolutely.

771
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,170
Bai, do you think people

772
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,020
should stop doing something halfway?

773
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,000
No.

774
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,050
You've already done it.

775
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,490
Why don't you finish it?

776
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,470
I'm not talking to you.

777
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,860
I have to watch TV.

778
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,680
Four, go to the lake to see the stars.

779
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,850
There's a shooting star. Make a wish.

780
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,120
Legend has it

781
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,790
that make a wish when a meteor falls,

782
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,460
and your wish can come true.

783
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,440
Make a wish when the meteor is not falling,

784
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,250
and your dream can come true.

785
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,870
So grab your beloved her

786
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,090
to see the meteor shower together.

787
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,050
Don't miss it

788
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,900
if you see this.

789
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,220
If you're hesitant, you'll lose the chance.

790
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,160
Finally, please give me

791
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,430
a five-star praise.

792
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,190
Let me send all my love

793
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,010
to you.

794
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,140
Tianran.

795
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,400
You haven't stopped this day.

796
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,070
What are you doing now?

797
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,010
Hurry up.

798
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,350
It's too cold outside.

799
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,830
I took a quilt from my room.

800
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,140
It's much warmer, isn't it?

801
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,740
You called me out at this time of night.

802
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,860
You're not asking me to look at the stars, are you?

803
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,520
Did you see the commercial?

804
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,450
What commercial?

805
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,060
Nothing. Luckily you didn't.

806
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,000
It's been a long time

807
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,670
since I've seen so many beautiful stars.

808
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,540
Right?

809
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,530
You don't see them in the city, do you?

810
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,040
It's beautiful.

811
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,790
Didn't you study astronomy?

812
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,890
Tell me what they are.

813
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,490
You really want to hear it?

814
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,190
Okay.

815
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,450
Did you see the biggest one?

816
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,700
Do you know what that is?

817
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,710
The Big Dipper.

818
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,780
No, that's the moon.

819
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,560
What is it?

820
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,380
There it is.

821
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,200
The Big Dipper is over there.

822
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,620
Look.

823
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,600
The seven stars.

824
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,260
The south side of the Big Dipper.

825
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,950
There is a sickle-shaped star.

826
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:53,830
That cluster

827
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,200
is Leo.

828
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,540
The brightest one in Leo

829
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,940
is called Regulus 14.

830
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,680
And then, if we go that way from Leo,

831
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,560
look at that,

832
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,360
keep going that way.

833
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,870
That's the constellation Ursa Minor.

834
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,900
If the weather is good,

835
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,040
we can see

836
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,150
a circular spot of light with naked eye.

837
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,630
You're charming when you talk professionally.

838
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,580
Am I?

839
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,610
Between Regulus 14 and Hornbill,

840
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,190
there is the point where the ecliptic and the great equator meet.

841
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,300
It's called the Autumnal Equinox.

842
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,150
On the 23rd of September every year…

843
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,170
All right.

844
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,080
If you keep talking, I'll get distracted.

845
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,020
Okay, I'm done.

846
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,840
♫Small light♫

847
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,700
Sisi.

848
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,680
♫Can melt the night♫

849
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,500
We rode the bike

850
