00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,770
by selling the phone.

175
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,150
Then the transportation.

176
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,110
I will walk

177
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,320
within

178
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,320
two kilometers

179
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,670
and run

180
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,490
within five kilometers.

181
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,159
What about five kilometers above?

182
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,080
I will run for a while and rest for a while.

183
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,000
It doesn't cost any money.

184
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,240
You're different.

185
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,160
Look at your clothes.

186
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,990
Your clothes cost

187
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,440
a few thousand, right?

188
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,940
And you always buy this kind of stuff.

189
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,970
What is this?

190
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,910
The electronic product

191
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,240
is useless

192
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,160
and its price falls fast.

193
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,710
Is it smooth?

194
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,680
Just have fun.

195
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,030
Go ahead.

196
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,960
332 days.

197
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,190
If I want to buy a house in the central,

198
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,970
332...

199
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,680
Dear colleagues,

200
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,290
I want to ask you something.

201
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,990
Can you save money

202
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,510
every month?

203
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,610
I can.

204
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,950
I give all my salary to my wife every month.

205
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,580
My wife can save more than half of it.

206
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,580
Me too.

207
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,730
My mom saves 80 percent of my salary

208
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,970
every month.

209
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,610
She said I can use it when I get married.

210
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,830
But according to my performance in the past two years,

211
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,980
she changed it to a ten-year fixed deposit now.

212
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,660
No, no, no.

213
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,930
You are forced to save.

214
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,540
It can't count.

215
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,700
Jiang Mei.

216
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,630
can you save it?

217
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,570
I can save a third of it.

218
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,020
The consumerism is too cunning.

219
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,400
I'm in a good condition recently.

220
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,340
I saved some.

221
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,830
Sisi.

222
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,060
It seems that

223
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,320
only the two of us live paycheck to paycheck.

224
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,890
Since I was starved last month,

225
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,350
I adjusted my assets structure.

226
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,680
Now I have a surplus

227
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,920
every month.

228
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,610
You have an assets structure?

229
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,610
No.

230
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,930
I’m wondering

231
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,520
why can't I save money?

232
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,990
It's reasonable for Gao Defen

233
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,490
who is stingy

234
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,159
to save money.

235
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,630
Jiang Mei needs to change three outfits a week.

236
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,220
Well.

237
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,340
Ms. Wu's makeup is so exquisite every day.

238
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,340
Director Yao has over 300 pairs of sneakers.

239
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,210
Mr. Ji's son

240
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,659
is obsessed with lego.

241
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,670
You have memberships of every video website.

242
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,400
How could you save money?

243
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,990
By sharing.

244
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,860
I share a wardrobe

245
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,420
and I can wear eight new outfits a month.

246
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,630
It only costs over 100 yuan.

247
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,200
I make my makeup at the beauty counter.

248
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,360
I just need to buy one lipstick occasionally.

249
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,790
I only wear my sneakers several times

250
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,980
and sell them in the second-hand market.

251
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,090
It's a current asset.

252
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,130
Lego can be rented.

253
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,290
Don't you know that?

254
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,970
Don't tell me the memberships of video websites are...

255
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,340
I'm in charge of odd months.

256
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,110
Jiang Mei is in charge of even months.

257
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,500
Ms. Wu will be in charge of the next quarter.

258
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,240
Everyone,

259
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,420
we've known each other for so long.

260
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,190
Why didn't anyone tell me?

261
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,570
You didn't ask.

262
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,180
What are you doing?

263
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,900
You are not staying?

264
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,530
Are you running away?

265
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,409
Defen.

266
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,310
Let me tell you.

267
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,930
The clothes

268
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,530
can be rented.

269
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,170
Makeups

270
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,970
can be made at the beauty counters.

271
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,830
The memberships

272
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,159
can be crowdfunded.

273
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,450
Tell me

274
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,280
your secret of sharing in life.

275
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,190
You scared me.

276
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,450
I thought you were running away.

277
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,960
Actually,

278
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,790
sharing life

279
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,430
is not as complicated as you think.

280
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,980
Just remember

281
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,090
to ask yourself three questions when it comes to sharing life.

282
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,480
Ask myself three questions. Which three questions?

283
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,450
First question.

284
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,100
[One, will I die without this?]

285
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,540
Will I die without this?

286
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,380
Will I die?

287
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,550
Two,

288
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,430
[One, will I die without this?]

289
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,430
[Two, is its function irreplaceable?]

290
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,480
Is its function irreplaceable?

291
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,580
Is its function irreplaceable?

292
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,320
Three.

293
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,800
Can I use sharing instead of buying?

294
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,000
[One, will I die if I don't use this?]

295
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,000
[Two, is its function irreplaceable?]

296
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,000
[Three, can I use sharing instead of buying?]

297
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,160
Sharing instead of buying?

298
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,940
Will I die without the game player?

299
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,060
No.

300
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,799
You got it.

301
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,789
Will I die without the computer?

302
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,480
Yes, I will.

303
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,590
If I can't finish my work,

304
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,559
Mr. Yu will kill me.

305
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,730
So

306
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,850
is its function irreplaceable?

307
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,360
I have a PC in the company

308
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,490
and I have a phone and a tablet

309
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,360
at home.

310
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,190
It can be replaced.

311
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,750
So,

312
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,440
if you don't need electronic products like this,

313
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,670
you can rent them

314
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,800
on the Internet.

315
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,330
The laptop is still yours.

316
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,900
The game player is still yours.

317
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,580
But you have an extra rent.

318
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,680
You can add a brick

319
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,750
for your house in the suburb of the city.

320
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,540
It can be closer.

321
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,690
It could be even more closer.

322
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,200
Let me teach you another move.

323
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,340
The clothes...

324
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,470
I need to wear it.

325
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,010
Yes.

326
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,930
The clothes are irreplaceable.

327
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,570
Can you borrow

328
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,840
the clothes?

329
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,460
I got it.

330
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,490
Bai,

331
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,850
I’ll meet a client tomorrow.

332
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,410
Lend me a suit.

333
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,780
Done.

334
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,520
You got it?

335
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,920
You know what?

336
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,260
I totally understand

337
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,530
the sharing life.

338
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,360
Good.

339
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,340
I need to clean it up.

340
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,970
Morning, Mashuai.

341
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,730
Tianran.

342
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,090
It's the suit you asked for last night.

343
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,190
I went out in a hurry this morning.

344
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,170
This is the only one I got.

345
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,540
But the size is...

346
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,460
It's okay.

347
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,520
Oversized clothes

348
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,520
is trendy now.

349
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,250
Besides,

350
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,500
I only meet with the client

351
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,260
for two hours.

352
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,120
I will make do with it.

353
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,710
Okay.

354
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,570
Thanks.

355
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,310
Li Tianran, is your phone a decoration?

356
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,670
I can't get through to you.

357
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,850
Sorry.

358
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,230
I suddenly found that

359
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,190
the mobile phone, tablet and computer

360
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:12,980
have similar functions.

361
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,790
So I rented my phone

362
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,570
and computer.

363
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,700
I only keep a tablet.

364
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,140
The screen is big and it's convenient to use.

365
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,770
What if I call you?

366
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,650
There is Wi-Fi everywhere.

367
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,850
I just connected a hotspot

368
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,760
on the subway

369
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,030
and scrolled on my phone for a long time.

370
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,770
I know you want to save money.

371
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,580
But haven't you gone

372
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,850
too far?

373
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,560
No.

374
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,290
I just realized

375
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,860
asking myself three questions

376
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,940
Gao Defen said to me

377
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,040
really works.

378
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,490
I rented everything

379
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,280
I can rent.

380
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,390
And I sold

381
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,210
those can't rent.

382
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,610
I saved 4,000 yuan by doing that.

383
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,050
4,000 yuan.

384
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,720
I haven't saved 4,000 yuan

385
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,170
for several months.

386
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,590
Defen,

387
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,860
I've calculated.

388
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,260
If I keep doing this,

389
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,230
I could buy a house in the suburb of the city

390
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,510
in three years.

391
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,490
What other secrets

392
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,420
of sharing life?

393
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,760
Please

394
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,430
tell me all of it.

395
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,990
There are some.

396
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,640
But

397
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,580
are you sure you want to learn so fast?

398
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,340
Yes.

399
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,610
Look at my eager eyes.

400
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:21,630
No.

401
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,270
I think

402
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,880
it's a little difficult

403
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,170
for you right now.

404
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,900
And I'm afraid...

405
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,670
Don't be afraid.

406
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:28,850
Tell me.

407
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:31,890
Fine.

408
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
I'll teach you

409
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,300
the ultimate question of sharing life.

410
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,240
The question is,

411
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:49,540
[Ultimate question, is there anything better than free?]

412
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,550
is there anything

413
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,610
better than

414
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,150
free?

415
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,230
Yes.

416
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,140
Profit.

417
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,540
[Ultimate question, is there anything better than free?]

418
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,540
[Profit]

419
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:53,960
Sharing life

420
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,430
is a consumption.

421
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,380
How can we make a profit?

422
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,550
Look.

423
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,750
So you need to change your mind.

424
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,350
You're focusing on people.

425
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,230
You need to focus on things.

426
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,940
Are you thinking that

427
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,080
I want to ride a bike

428
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,910
wear clothes

429
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,040
and play games?

430
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,850
You're too short-sighted.

431
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,830
What you need to think about now is

432
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,690
how to let the car run 24 hours a day,

433
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,690
make the clothes get fully used

434
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,880
and make the game player run at full capacity,

435
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,830
or even overloaded.

436
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,510
What is the core of the sharing economy?

437
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,770
It's to let things be fully used.

438
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,710
Amazing.

439
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,140
I learned it.

440
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,070
Not only did I master this,

441
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,490
I completely know how to use it.

442
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,940
Why is the light off?

443
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,210
Oh no.

444
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
He knew how to use it.

445
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,680
Could he use it right?

446
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,970
Morning, Sisi.

447
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,060
Morning.

448
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,310
Didn't you say you won't buy new clothes?

449
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,100
I didn't buy new clothes.

450
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,140
I'm just a porter of new clothes.

451
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,660
I can refund it within seven days.

452
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,350
As long as I get the time difference,

453
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,230
I have new clothes every day.

454
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,730
That's disgusting.

455
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,780
Wait a minute.

456
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,250
I think something is wrong.

457
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,590
Let me see. Let me think.

458
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,160
What the...

459
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,440
You're really good at making use of time.

460
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,500
Time is a kind of resource.

461
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,070
I could play a game for someone

462
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,200
while Director Yao is thinking.

463
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,980
I can earn one yuan if I get more points.

464
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,980
That's too much.

465

Thank you.

466
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,750
We'll give you the plan as soon as possible.

are you buying us drinks?

I don't come to the cafe often.

I can't come here for nothing.

I took three delivery orders.

I have to go now. I'm going to be late.

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,370
I promise

517
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,440
this will never happen again.

518
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,380
Okay? I...

519
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,190
Apologize to her.

520
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,580
Sorry, Sisi.

521
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,610
I didn't expect to disturb you.

522
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,180
Am I the only one who was disturbed?

523
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,050
The colleagues in the office

524
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,490
were all tortured by you these days.

525
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,050
Bai, Jiang Mei,

526
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,100
and Director Yao.

527
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,010
They just put up with you.

528
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:27,990
You are right.

529
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,380
I didn't expect

530
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,810
the sharing life

531
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,030
to be such a bother to you.

532
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,790
If that's the case,

533
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,250
I won't share anymore.

534
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,620
It's not that I don't want you to share.

535
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,930
It's good to save money.

536
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,600
But you need to have a bottom line.

537
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,100
Yes.

538
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,340
The purpose of a sharing life

539
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,410
is not to lower

540
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,920
the quality on all aspects of your life.

541
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,070
Besides,

542
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,710
you can lower your life quality.

543
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,760
You shouldn't lower mine.

544
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,260
You are right, Ms. Fan.

545
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,600
She has a point.

546
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,060
Well, Tianran.

547
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,710
Let me make it clear first.

548
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,030
In order to show my support,

549
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,790
from now on,

550
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,920
I will share everything I have

551
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,440
with you

552
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,599
for free.

553
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,819
Is that okay?

554
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,950
Well.

555
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,140
Let's try it in a small group.

556
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,880
Don't... Don't make trouble for other colleagues.

557
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,760
Can I?

558
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,880
You can use mine too.

559
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,520
But not my dolls.

560
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,730
Great.

561
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,329
Sisi.

562
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,760
Sisi.

563
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,850
It's an emergency. Can I borrow your kitchen?

564
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,860
What are you doing?

565
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,330
I sold the pot.

566
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,470
I need to borrow your pot.

567
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,630
What's the emergency?

568
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,160
If I don't fry it,

569
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,520
the potatoes will be oxidized.

570
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,450
Thank you.

571
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,840
I'll clean it up for you later.

572
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,860
Sisi. Sisi.

573
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,470
Sisi.

574
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,350
I'm sorry.

575
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,970
Please share your power strip with me.

576
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,290
Thanks.

577
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:11,780
By the way,

578
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,280
share your mop with me.

579
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,700
Thanks.

580
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,290
Wait.

581
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,240
What are you doing?

582
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,410
Li Tianran.

583
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,650
If you keep doing this,

584
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,570
I will be angry.

585
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,430
What did I do?

586
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,300
I'm living the sharing life.

587
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,960
Are you?

588
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,950
You're taking advantage of me.

589
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,430
What are you talking about?

590
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,990
Didn't we agree that

591
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,510
I can use your stuff

592
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,360
and you can take my stuff at will.

593
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,060
Besides,

594
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,760
I lent

595
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,720
a lot of things

596
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,190
to you.

597
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,640
Li Tianran.

598
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,890
I just borrowed

599
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,890
your Wi-Fi.

600
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,580
Why are you always

601
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,920
bringing it up?

602
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,990
Why don't you mention

603
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,300
the hair band I lent you,

604
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,400
the alarm you borrowed from me

605
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,890
when you treated Monday syndromes,

606
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,360
and the nail scissors

607
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,590
you took from me the night I couldn't sleep because of you?

608
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,270
And the cards I made for you.

609
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,460
You want to divide our stuff?

610
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,100
You want to make it clear, right?

611
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,220
You took a plate from me

612
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,000
when you made the cake.

613
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,740
When you

614
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,170
grew the succulent,

615
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,610
you took my toothbrush cup.

616
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,560
You also took the comfortable pillow

617
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,490
from me.

618
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,420
Also,

619
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,390
you almost caught a cold last time,

620
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,830
I used my hair dryer

621
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,950
to dry your hair.

622
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,500
Okay.

623
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,900
Just wait.

624
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,410
Why must you make it so clear?

625
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,680
Here is your stuff.

626
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,790
I don't want them. Bye.

627
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,620
Why were you shouting?

628
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,820
Your stuff is here too.

629
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,950
Fine.

630
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,760
You don't want them?

631
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,960
Good for you.

632
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,990
You have to beg me to give them to you one day.

633
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,560
The hair dryer belongs to Li Tianran.

634
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,090
I returned it.

635
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,550
Fine.

636
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,530
I'll air-dry it.

637
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,110
It's good for my scalp.

638
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,890
What's the big deal?

639
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,100
She doesn't let me use her stuff.

640
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,610
She's so petty.

641
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,940
But she said it herself.

642
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,140
Hers is hers.

643
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,420
Mine is mine.

644
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,880
That's good.

645
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,160
She won't take my things anymore.

646
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,140
No.

647
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,990
Did she really

648
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,680
take everything back?

649
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,390
It's none of my business. Why am I thinking about this?

650
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,500
I don't care if she throws them into the trash can.

651
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:57,890
What are you doing? Why don't you sleep?

652
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,840
It's okay. Go to sleep.

She has a conscience.

662
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,980
She didn't throw them away.

663

These should be gifts from her.

664

Yes. Right.

675
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,370
I didn't find it either.

You use this to cut your nails?

How could they stink?

Yes.

712
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,760
You need to be mentally prepared.

713
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,750
According to the failed cases before,

714

I think

715
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,950
we need to set a big goal

716
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,230
and then divide it into countless small goals.

Let me put it this way.

is to save money to buy a house.

My small goal

is to buy a screen
