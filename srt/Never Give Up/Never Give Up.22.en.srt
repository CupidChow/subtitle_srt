in front of Tianran's proposal.

181
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:02,840
Yeah.

182
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,240
We shouldn't compare them in the first place.

183

Yes, they're not comparable.

Okay.

187

The high-end phone we are going to launch this time

188
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,360
is the core product

189
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,740
to compete with Banana Mobile in the high-end market.

190
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,380
It must represent success and luxury.

191
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,190
What brand

192
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,820
can best represent success and luxury?

193
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,400
Ma,

194
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,280
the world's best luxury brand.

195
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,660
So...

196
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,290
So we're going to a co-branded

197

and cross-industry cooperation with Ma.

198

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,170
Is it the luxury brand

200
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,110
that doesn't do co-branding with any company?

201
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,940
Yes.

202
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,190
We will ask Ma

203
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,950
to launch platinum phone cases

204
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,180
rare leather phone cases,

205
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,430

206

you also have to buy a high-end speaker.

210
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,900
We also have to sell in bundles.

211

If you want to buy a cellphone,

212

you also have to buy a speaker

and two high-end terminal blocks.

214
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,090
Then, we'll also launch the Everest limited edition.

215
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,500
There are only two hundred globally.

216
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,970
The number will be engraved on the back of the phone.

217
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,630
The parameter remains the same, but the price will double.

Does Ma agree?
