I've never seen

513
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,330
such a pretty girl without makeup.

514
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,030
Look at you.

515
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,650
50 minutes for applying foundation

516
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,910
for a natural look.

517
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,810
30 minutes for drawing

518
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,390
naturally arched eyebrows

519
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,230
to look like a nice neighborhood girl.

520
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,600
20 minutes for eye shadows

521
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,430
to make you look deep.

522
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,880
10 minutes for eyelashes

523
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,250
to make your eyes look bigger

524
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,200
and cuter.

525
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,950
10 minutes for

526
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,130
first-love lips.

527
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,730
Why are girls always late for their dates?

528
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,670
It takes me two hours for natural makeup

529
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,690
before doing my hair and getting dressed.

530
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,240
How can I not be late?

531
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,130
I almost forgot.

532
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,040
Being a beauty,

533
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,460
my elbows should be pink too.

534
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,450
Recently,

535
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,170
I've learned an expression

536
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,360
called phone call phobia.

537
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,190
I know that.

538
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,500
For example, I'm scared of answering calls

539
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,940
or calling people.

540
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,090
Really?

541
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,210
Does that happen?

542
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,150
It means young people like you

543
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,240
tend to communicate online via WeChat.

544
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,640
You are not used to talking on the phone anymore.

545
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,230
Actually,

546
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,220
I think

547
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,560
it's tiring that I have to switch my mode

548
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,830
if I answer the phone.

549
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,230
What do you mean?

550
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,540
For example,

551
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,860
if I have to answer a work call now,

552
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,090
I have to be very positive

553
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,870
and happy

554
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,740
when I talk.

555
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,040
But I have my moment of being depressed

556
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,140
and tired.

557
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,360
If I have to force myself to be happy,

558
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,510
it would be so hard.

559
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,780
I see.

560
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,230
By the way,

561
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,230
I also prefer online communication.

562
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,410
Sisi,

563
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,410
you're the team leader.

564
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,550
How can you shirk the responsibility?

565
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,190
Who told you to do that?

566
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,340
[Mr. Yu]

567
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,100
Mr. Yu.

568
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,080
[Let's keep it between us.]

569
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,760
You are always cautious.

570
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,480
You keep all the records.

571
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,620
No wonder I think highly of you.

572
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,830
You can stand the test.

573
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,830
