00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,360
Tianran,

341
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,670
I think we're late.

342
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,800
This flight is full.

343
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,240
We'll have to take the next one.

344
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,090
How can we do that?

345
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,290
Mr. Yu just told us to

346
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,910
check the progress of the meeting

347
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,250
on the plane.

348
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:44,910
We have to fly there

349
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,580
even if we're hanging on the wings of this plane.

350
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,340
Don't panic when things go wrong.

351
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,420
I will teach you

352
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,800
some crisis management skills.

353
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,230
Miss.

354
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,680
Next.

355
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,580
We are all workers.

356
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,660
It's not easy to make a living, is it?

357
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,360
Give us a break.

358
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,960
Miss Liu, right?

359
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,190
Miss. Liu,

360
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,110
my name is…

361
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,160
Security guard.

362
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,400
No, no, no.

363
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,220
Tianran, let's go.

364
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:14,730
Come on.

365
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,870
Where are we going?

366
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,720
I called my uncle.

367
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,160
My uncle has got two VIP seats

368
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,640
for us.

369
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,100
Hurry up.

370
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,060
Let's go to the VIP lane over there.

371
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,540
What? What uncle?

372
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,100
Or we'll be too late.

373
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,980
You? What uncle?

374
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,950
Is he trustworthy?

375
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,620
Hello, please go inside.

376
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,200
Hello, please go inside.

377
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,070
Bai.

378
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,690
Well...

379
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,330
After takeoff,

380
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,750
give this document to Mr. Yu.

381
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,010
We'll work in a hurry on the plane.

382
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,220
This is how I imagine my work life to be.

383
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,020
What are you doing?

384
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,150
What are you doing sitting here?

385
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,790
Go to the economy class at the back.

386
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,300
Please check the seat for me.

387
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,130
Hello, sir.

388
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,220
This is your seat.

389
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,930
What?

390
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,810
Sit down, Tianran.

391
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,690
-Sit down. -No, no.

392
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,810
Hello, please come inside.

393
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,070
Hello, please come inside.

394
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,080
Hello, please come inside.

395
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,430
What's going on?

396
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,240
Don't worry.

397
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,630
You told me

398
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,570
the staff below V6

399
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,760
can only travel in economy class.

400
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,900
But I asked my uncle

401
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,410
to upgrade us for free.

402
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,340
Don't worry.

403
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,320
Absolutely no reimbursement issues are involved.

404
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,140
How's that, Tianran?

405
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,260
I didn't embarrass you, right?

406
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,880
Reliable.

407
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,090
Miss.

408
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,150
One beer, please.

409
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,170
Okay, wait a minute.

410
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,290
Two.

411
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:25,950
Okay.

412
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,340
Tianran, so…

413
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,750
Don't talk.

414
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,780
Sleep.

415
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,620
Tianran.

416
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,540
Don't talk.

417
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,890
I can't sleep.

418
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,300
I'm sorry. I'm the embarrassed one.

419
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,330
I have a narrow view.

420
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,950
Bai,

421
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,530
listen to me.

422
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,690
There are many unspoken rules

423
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,270
you have to learn

424
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,690
in the workplace.

425
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,140
Let's go.

426
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,760
Let's go.

427
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,700
-Where to? -Over there.

428
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:01,880
Wait.

429
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,700
Over there.

430
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,660
Gentlemen,

431
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,620
see if this room is okay.

432
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,180
Okay.

433
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,770
Thank you. Thank you.

434
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,660
Very good. Very good.

435
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,560
How's it?

436
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,830
What are you doing?

437
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,670
Is this

438
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,470
the unspoken workplace rule?

439
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,130
What are you thinking?

440
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,820
I'll teach you

441
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,980
the third lesson of the workplace now.

442
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,430
What's the target given by the company?

443
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,070
You, me, Mr. Yu

444
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,330
have three rooms in total.

445
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,450
But if you and I share a room,

446
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,820
we'll save the money for one room.

447
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,030
We can share 50-50. Isn't that great?

448
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,270
This is called business trip benefits.

449
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,180
Got it?

450
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,270
I get it, Tianran.

451
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,140
I have a way to get double the travel benefits.

452
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,760
What double?

453
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,660
Come with me.

454
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,490
What double…

455
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,570
Slow down.

456
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,660
What double benefits?

457
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,860
Why are we leaving here?

458
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,000
Wait a moment.

459
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:04,970
Bai.

460
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,360
Where are you going?

461
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,580
Where are you going?

462
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,220
Wait, you...

463
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,980
What do you mean you're not talking?

464
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,390
We'll be there soon, brother.

465
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,100
What soon?

466
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,040
Bai.

467
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,320
It's a six-star hotel.

468
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
That's right.

469
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,410
Then why are we here?

470
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,700
Tianran, here is the case.

471
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,520
You see?

472
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,870
The company said

473
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,630
Mr. Yu, you and me

474
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,230
would have a total of three rooms.

475
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,750
But if we stay at my uncle's hotel,

476
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,890
we can save two rooms.

477
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,310
Double travel benefits.

478
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,450
So this hotel is…

479
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,470
My uncle owns it.

480
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,980
How's that, Tianran?

481
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,900
Am I a fast learner?

482
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,250
Uncle.

483
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,480
Hey, Tianran, my nephew,

484
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,380
I've recently opened a new farmhouse.

485
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,700
There are beer, barbecue, hot pot,

486
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,660
bathing, back rubbing, accommodation, and everything.

487
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,020
Remember to come and have fun on weekends.

488
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,950
No problem, uncle.

489
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,890
I gotta go.

490
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,680
Like I don't have an uncle who owns a hotel.

491
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,710
Good morning, Director Yao.

492
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,640
Good morning, Director Yao

493
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,760
Si Si, Tianran. Good morning.

494
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,890
You live so far away

495
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,870
and you come to work so early. You don't even have breakfast?

496
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,850
Wow.

497
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,030
Good morning, Director Yao.

498
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,990
Si Si,

499
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,300
breakfast should be nutritious.

500
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,190
In the morning, you should…

501
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,240
Tianran,

502
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,890
what am I not doing well?

503
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,030
Why do I feel that Director Yao

504
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,420
just doesn't like me?

505
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,869
The fourth lesson for newcomers in the workplace,

506
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,060
don't drive a better car than the leader

507
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,079
in front of him.

508
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:09,980
You know?

509
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,240
If I'm right,

510
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,890
