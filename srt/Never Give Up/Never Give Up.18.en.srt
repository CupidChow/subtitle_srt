There's no harm.

509
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,610
But I've only been here for less than a year,

510
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,890
I don't know what to do

511
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,140
when talking about a job-hop with them.

512
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,820
Mashuai,

513
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,270
if you really want to go,

514
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,630
I'll go with you.

515
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,980
I don't dare to say that I'm a good talker.

516
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
At least I have more experience than you.

517
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,950
With me here, I promise

518
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,510
get you settled in the new place.

519
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,960
Mr. Ji.

520
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,460
You're so nice.

521
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:55,990
How about this?

522
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,210
To express my gratitude,

523
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,720
I'll ask them for

524
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,210
some tickets to the Basketball Cinema for you.

525
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,810
That's great.

526
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,430
I won't stand on ceremony then.

527
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,760
Three at least.

528
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,300
Okay.

529
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,250
Great!

530
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,550
Great!

531
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,410
Thank you.

532
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:08,940
Okay.

533
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,290
Don't worry. I'm here.

534
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,330
Mr. Ji.

535
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,660
If Tianran

536
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,530
wants to give you a experience voucher for a hotel,

537
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,550
don't say yes.

538

He wants to stand you up.

539
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,480
Am I that kind of person who takes advantage of others?

540
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,410
I ignored what he said just now.

541
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,360
That's good.

542
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,140
Don't worry.

543
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,940
I'll go get some water.

544
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,690
Okay.

545
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,290
A smart person like Mr. Ji

546
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,070
will see through the next one.

547
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,700
We have to use a set within a set.

548

I knew it.

549
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:00,940
He spent

550
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,610
half a month trying to get those tickets.

551
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,060
He couldn't have missed

552
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,360
the chance to get them.

553
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,650
It's up to Bai now.

554
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,200
As long as he doesn't go to the place he promised,

555
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,430
we'll win.

Why are you dressed so formally?

A company

wants to hire Bai Mashuai as the director.

563
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,500
He's inviting him to dinner tonight.

564
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,560
He's new in the company.

565

He doesn't know anything. He's so silly.

are you planning something?

What plan?

571
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,420
Think about it.

572
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,570
You've been in the company longer than Bai, right?

573
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,510
You're more experienced than him and have more connections than him, right?

574
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,190
When you talk with the leader,

575
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,190
maybe he'll like you

576
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,310

Am I right?

579
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,580
Your words make sense.

580
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,720
Is it possible?

Yes.

This is a good opportunity, right?

584
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,920
Then your salary will rise.

I'm telling you, this is a good opportunity.

Our uncle?

668
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,290
You should have told me earlier.

Then it

670
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,380
will be our own business.

tell our uncle

to think about me.
