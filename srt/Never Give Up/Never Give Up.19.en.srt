Yes.

I said

684

you could see the sunset once in a while.

When I came here this morning, it was over here.

That's right.

the sun...

Did you see the building?

690
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,730
It was shining on that tall building

691
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,440
and lighting the living room

692
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,270
by reflection. How great is that?

693
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,040
This is east, west…

This is northwest.

Didn't you say it was southwest?

North to South.

It has good ventilation and is cooler.

You can't say that.

704
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,980
There is a study at the left

705

and a kitchen at the right.

706
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,480
There's a shower room on the opposite side.

707
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,520
A big bay window.

708
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,090
It's like a view room.

709

What else do you want?

710
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,350
I'm touched by that.

711
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,290
In fact, I'm not used to sleeping in a big bed.

You know me.

713

I think it's good to sleep here.

Okay.

We'll talk about the rent later.

I'll make you a cup of tea first.

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,400
if my electronic bicycle

731

can be stolen downstairs.

732
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,120
You can put it in my house.
