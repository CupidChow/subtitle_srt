346
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,400
He slipped under the chair

347
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,810
and didn't get up all night.

348
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,210
Am I right, Director Sun?

349
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,880
That's nothing.

350
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,800
Bai,

351
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,810
what's your full name?

352
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,150
Bai Mashuai.

353
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,570
Bai...

354
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,740
What's wrong?

355
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,970
Ma...

356
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,470
What are you doing?

357
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,960
Shuai...

358
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,020
[Shuai]

359
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,330
Are you

360
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,700
the Bai Mashuai from Feima Group?

361
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,590
Feima?

362
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,060
No.

363
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm Bai Mashuai

364
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,590
from Gaofa Group...

365
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,380
from Gaofa Group...

366
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,840
Mr. Bai from Gaofa Group.

367
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,210
Nice to meet you.

368
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,900
Please don't be like this.

369
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,780
I'm here to learn with my colleague.

370
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,730
Got it.

371
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,590
Hello, Miss Jiang.

372
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,170
Hello.

373
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,990
No.

374
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,220
Director.

375
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,400
What's going on?

376
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,990
Let me introduce.

377
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,260
This is

378
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,620
Miss Jiang

379
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,470
from Gaofa Group.

380
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,600
This is

381
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,400
Bai...

382
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,600
Could it...

383
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,520
Ma...

384
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,430
be...

385
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,570
Shuai.

386
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,930
the young master?

387
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,830
Nice to meet you, Miss Jiang.

388
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,420
Mr. Bai.

389
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,320
Nice to meet you.

390
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,270
Nice to meet you.

391
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,440
Nice to meet you.

392
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,750
Jiang Mei,

393
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,760
is this

394
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,480
a special etiquette in the workplace?

395
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,090
I've never seen this before.

396
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,370
But Ms. Fan said

397
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,920
the more polite they are, the more dangerous it is.

398
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,060
Today is a tough battle.

399
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,350
We have to be careful.

400
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,850
Understood.

401
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,000
Nice to meet you.

402
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,170
Nice to meet you.

403
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,830
We're here to learn.

404
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,220
We're here to learn from you.

405
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,470
Please have a seat.

406
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,710
Have a seat.

407
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,570
You're welcome.

408
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,470
You're welcome.

409
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,510
Have a seat, please.

410
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,990
Have a seat.

411
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,700
Have a seat.

412
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,980
Have a seat.

413
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,220
I beg you.

414
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,620
Have a seat.

415
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,140
I beg you.

416
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,530
You're welcome.

417
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,310
Jiang Mei.

418
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,440
What should we do now?

419
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,640
I don't know.

420
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,280
I'm so nervous.

421
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,640
Well...

422
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,220
Ladies and gentlemen,

423
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,880
this is my first time

424
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,480
I've been to a business dinner with another company.

425
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,140
I know nothing.

426
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,270
How about we

427
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,070
relax a little?

428
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,750
Okay.

429
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,910
I'm relaxed.

430
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,340
I feel at home.

431
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,330
Li,

432
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,510
Mr. Bai said

433
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,670
to relax.

434
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,680
Perform something.

435
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,670
Take off your clothes and do aerobics.

436
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,250
Okay.

437
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,810
You don't have to.

438
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,570
Madam.

439
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,250
What are you doing?

440
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,400
Removing my makeup.

441
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,370
Am I relaxed enough?

442
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,290
What should we do?

443
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,060
Let's talk.

444
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,440
What do you think, Bai?

445
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,870
Sure.

446
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,820
Let's talk.

447
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,510
Ladies and gentlemen,

448
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,540
where should we start with?

449
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,500
Can we start with the weather?

450
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,640
What's with the weather?

451
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,070
We didn't prepare anything.

452
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,050
Sir,

453
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,630
the five jin of liquor you ordered is here.

454
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,950
Do you want some?

455
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,620
Sure.

456
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,090
Sure, let's drink.

457
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,040
Mr. Zhao.

458
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,350
I heard that the custom here is

459
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,600
talking while drinking.

460
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,730
My colleague Jiang Mei can't drink much.

461
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,380
I'll drink today.

462
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,130
Let's drink.

463
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,430
Let's drink.

464
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,500
Fortunately, I prepared it in advance.

465
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,520
I'll drink up first.

466
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,200
Mr. Zhao.

467
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,790
My colleague

468
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,170
Bai is new in our company.

469
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,100
He's a little shy.

470
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,100
Please forgive him.

471
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,510
Bai, stand up.

472
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,740
Please forgive us.

473
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,490
Please forgive us.

474
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,020
Open the liquor.

475
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,410
Hurry up.

476
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,870
Sorry.

477
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,900
Show our sincerity.

478
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,580
I'm sorry.

479
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,110
Right?

480
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,570
Come on.

481
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,790
Do we have to...

482
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,540
Drink with a bottle?

483
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,540
Wait.

484
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,000
It's been half a year.

485
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,380
The style of Feima Group

486
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,520
has changed.

487
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,860
I'll drink tea instead of liquor.

488
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,790
Here's to you.

489
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,220
Go, Bai.

490
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,490
How about we

491
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,640
drink tea?

492
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,190
Got it.

493
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,510
How can we get information by drinking tea?

494
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,430
Wait.

495
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,030
Bai

496
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,640
will drink liquor with you.

497
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,540
Let's drink liquor.

498
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,240
Okay.

499
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,480
Let's drink liquor.

500
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,170
Liquor.

501
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,570
It's inappropriate to let them drink liquor.

502
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,990
Drink tea.

503
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,010
Tea.

504
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,610
It's better to drink liquor.

505
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:38,740
Come on.

506
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,940
Let's drink liquor.

507
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,980
Drinking tea is good for health.

508
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,740
It's good for health.

509
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,790
Drinking liquor makes people happy.

510
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,940
Happy, happy, happy.

511
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,370
Drinking tea is good for business negotiation.

512
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,180
Business negotiation?

513
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
Let's talk.

514
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,750
Drinking liquor is good for business cooperation.

515
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,360
Drinking tea makes people peaceful.

516
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,650
Honey,

517
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,160
help me analyze something.

518
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,510
I think I was reckless today.

519
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,230
I sent Bai and Mei

520
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,560
to have dinner with

521
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,920
the Planning Department of Feima Group.

522
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,260
Do you think

523
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,800
it's like sending a goat to a tiger?

524
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,260
I sent them to get information.

525
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,700
What can they get?

526
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,800
Don't talk when eating.

527
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,790
Don't talk when eating.

528
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,420
I was reckless.

529
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,610
Director Sun.

530
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,860
Mr. Zhao.

531
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,900
Ms. Qian.

532
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:54,670
Bai.

533
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,460
Come here.

534
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,300
Hurry up.

535
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,030
Luckily, you didn't drink too much with them.

536
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,270
They can really drink.

537
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,230
Yeah.

538
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,600
It's lucky that we didn't drink.

539
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,180
I think they all like you.

540
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,860
Why don't we take this opportunity

541
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,410
to get information?

542
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,390
Director Sun.

543
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,940
Director Sun.

544
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,280
He passed out.

545
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,690
I'm Bai.

546
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,930
Bai?

547
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,010
I want to ask

548
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,060
how is your smart system

549
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,380
doing?

550
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,260
We will launch it in the fourth quarter of next year.

551
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,320
Which AI optimization company

552
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,380
do you plan to work with?

553
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,530
Dashi.

554
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,940
Have you quoted?

555
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,080
Yes.

556
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,550
How much?

557
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,610
It increased

558
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,780
by about 15% last year.

559
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,510
Jiang Mei,

560
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,280
we have everything we need.

561
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,210
Let's go.

562
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,050
Okay.

563
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,690
It's so easy to get information.

564
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,310
Why did Feima Group

565
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,570
send four of them here?

566
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,390
Probably

567
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,700
it means we can get them easily.

568
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,770
Good.

569
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,030
Bai,

570
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,280
to celebrate that

571
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,000
we completed the task for the first time,

572
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,630
cheers.

573
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,990
Let's go.

574
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,340
Let's go.

575
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,830
Jiang Mei, Jiang Mei.

576
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,540
Jiang Mei, Jiang Mei, Jiang Mei.

577
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,460
Let's go.

578
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,370
Go back.

579
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,770
I have a secret to share with you.

580
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,120
Actually,

581
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,340
I'm not the director of Planning Department 3.

582
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,410
I'm just

583
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,810
an ordinary employee.

584
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,290
That's all for my secret.

585
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,020
Bye.

586
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,040
But I have something to tell you.

587
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,010
Bai.

588
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,820
He's new in our company.

589
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,420
No, I have another secret.

590
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,220
That cup of tea

591
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,120
is too bitter.

592
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,640
But Qian's nails

593
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,210
are pretty.

594
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,460
I have one last secret.

595
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,400
Get up.

596
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,580
It's our

597
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,390
Rice Cake system's...

598
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,910
Jiang Mei, are you hungry?

599
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,940
Let's eat rice cake.

600
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,880
Let's eat rice cake.

601
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,280
Let's eat rice cake.

602
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,120
Bai.

603
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,970
Bai, I'm so happy.

604
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,440
Today is the first time

605
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,140
I completed such an important task

606
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,660
in Gaofa.

607
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,860
Me too.

608
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,420
But to be honest,

609
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,790
you've made great progress.

610
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,850
I remember when you first came to the company,

611
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,420
you didn't even know

612
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,390
how to use a printer.

613
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,600
Why were you so stupid back then?

614
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,610
But now you can

615
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,270
propose

616
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,500
and meet clients alone.

617
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,990
You made it

618
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,740
at such a big business meeting today.

619
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,980
You're amazing.

620
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,840
Let me give you applaud.

621
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,650
You too.

622
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,600
We did it together.

623
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,520
Both of us are amazing.

624
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,310
Come on.

625
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,480
Hurry up. Like this.

626
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,630
I agree.

627
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,550
By the way,

628
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,490
I want to tell you

629
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,700
my little secret.

630
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,380
When I was young,

631
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,490
my teacher always said I was a dull person.

632
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,430
I didn't talk and I was not cheerful.

633
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,630
I didn't want to fight for

634
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,540
the first place.

635
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,390
It's like getting an offer from Gaofa

636
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,320
is the best thing I've ever done

637
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,150
in my life.

638
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,620
But actually,

639
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,510
as long as a person has a dream,

640
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,720
he or she can do anything.

641
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,260
Look at Mr. Yu.

642
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,340
His rock band

643
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,700
used to perform in a live house.

644
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,270
Do you know

645
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,430
how popular it was?

646
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,130
So many people.

647
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,300
Sisi is also amazing.

648
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,850
Sisi became the team leader

649
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,860
at such a young age,

650
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,560
and she's so pretty.

651
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,780
No wonder Tianran likes her so much.

652
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,710
What?

653
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
You don't even know that?

654
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,560
You don't even care about this gossip.

655
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,150
You are lame.

656
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:23,910
Look.

657
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,260
I know so many secrets.

658
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,320
Did I tell you?

659
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,810
I didn't say anything.

660
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,050
Am I awesome?

661
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,400
I'm a secret keeper.

662
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:30,930
I don't know.

663
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,950
I don't know. I don't know.

664
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,990
No one knows.

665
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,880
-Jiang mei. -No one knows.

666
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,430
Jiang Mei.

667
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,650
Then...

668
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,080
Do you know my secret?

669
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,000
You must have a lot of secrets.

670
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,790
But I don't know yet.

671
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,670
I'll tell you

672
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,710
when I know.

673
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,840
After talking so much to you,

674
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,050
I feel so dizzy.

675
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,830
I should still be in my dream.

676
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,360
Why are you here?

677
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,460
You...

678
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,830
Don't get me wrong.

679
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,610
You were drunk last night.

680
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,800
I didn't know where you live.

681
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,330
So I brought you home.

682
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,390
You...

683
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,860
I slept over there last night.

684
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,530
I was drunk yesterday?

685
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,360
But I remember

686
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,070
I only drank a little.

687
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,990
You don't remember what happened

688
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,700
last night?

689
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,260
Yes.

690
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Last night,

691
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,560
