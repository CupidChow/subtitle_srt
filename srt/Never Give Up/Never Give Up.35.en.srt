00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,520
Classes?

343
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,130
What does that mean?

344
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,920
25

345
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,180
Female smoker.

346
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,710
Three points for smoking with pay.

347
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,940
80?

348
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,900
You are an old smoker.

349
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,420
For the sake of your health,

350
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,800
all 14 points should be deducted

351
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,180
and you'll immediately be sent to the South Pole.

352
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,590
Zero points.

353
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,460
You don't smoke.

354
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,140
Then why are you on the roof?

355
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,670
Reporting.

356
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,470
She's repeated

357
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,180
the song “Desert River Ballroom”

358
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,720
for nineteen times.

359
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,810
She was paid to be emotional.

360
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,340
That's even worse.

361
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,160
Deduct four points.

362
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,850
This is for you not working well.

363
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,530
Smoking.

364
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,940
Smoking is bad for health.

365
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,590
Deduct three points.

366
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,120
Remember.

367
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,540
Mr. Zheng

368
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,060
is doing great.

369
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,040
Are you running away,

370
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,800
Director Yao?

371
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,530
Why would I?

372
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,680
I never smoked, Mr. Zheng.

373
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,150
Then why did you come up?

374
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,920
I came up to make phone calls…

375
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,460
Paid phone calls.

376
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,230
Deduct six points.

377
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,080
Six points.

378
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,020
Six points?

379
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,170
This is for your smoking.

380
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,980
How about four points?

381
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,510
Eight points.

382
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,120
Six points.

383
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,590
Ten points.

384
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:46,900
Six points.

385
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,480
You called it.

386
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,070
An employee who works on the 12th floor

387
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,850
used the bathroom

388
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,500
on the distant 18th floor.

389
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,130
This is…

390
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,340
A Paid weight loss

391
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,090
B Paid toilet use

392
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,510
C Reporting beyond the level

393
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,570
D Reasonable

394
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,400
Three long and one short answer. Choose the short one.

395
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,100
D Reasonable

396
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,540
Why am I wrong again?

397
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,630
This question bank has 500 questions.

398
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,290
When can I finish it?

399
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,760
Oh my God.

400
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,120
It's already late.

401
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,230
To prove that someone is studying,

402
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,930
please face the camera.

403
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,020
Turn your head to the left.

404
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,190
First, to the left, right?

405
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,560
This…

406
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,630
I'm here.

407
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,580
I'm here.

408
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,140
No valid face activity detected.

409
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,430
Please relearn.

410
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:34,820
This…

411
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,680
I…

412
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,810
Why is my life so hard?

413
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,340
Almost there.

414
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,370
I'm off work.

415
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,240
Why isn't anyone moving?

416
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,050
You're not off work?

417
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,620
I'm hesitating.

418
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,310
Today's 51.6-minute

419
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,210
paid life

420
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,890
is only ten seconds short.

421
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,350
It was interrupted by Mr. Zheng.

422
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,210
If this goes on

423
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,250
and I keep calculating overtime,

424
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,620
it feels like it'll never be clear.

425
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,730
I figured it out.

426
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,920
I figured it out.

427
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,290
It's a total of 113 hours.

428
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,920
The company owes me 113 hours.

429
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,190
You only have 113 hours.

430
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,130
I counted it this afternoon too.

431
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,400
The company owes me

432
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,670
enough time for me to start slacking off

433
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,690
until five years later.

434
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,830
I'm afraid the company won't be able to pay it back.

435
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,170
Tianran,

436
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,290
you're still thinking about making the company

437
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,120
return your time?

438
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,160
You might as well

439
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:26,790
think about

440
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,550
how we can protect

441
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,430
the rest of our points.

442
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,110
I was just

443
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,810
lost in thought.

444
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,100
Another point was deducted.

445
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,630
It's only the beginning of the month and I have only nine points left.

446
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,630
Nine points.

447
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,820
I just took a phone call.

448
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,010
I have deducted six points.

449
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,210
That's so unfair.

450
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,710
I'm even worse than you guys.

451
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,040
I was told to drink milk tea with pay.

452
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,030
Now I have only eight points left.

453
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,670
I'm okay.

454
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,470
I still have ten points.

455
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,440
Who is worse than me?

456
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,950
I was deducted seven points

457
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,060
and sent to the study class.

458
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,220
You…

459
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,880
Mr. Ji.

460
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,480
Why don't you

461
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,380
take my points for now?

462
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,690
I have 14 points full.

463
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,840
Forget it.

464
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,600
You have to go to the gym at noon.

465
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,510
If you don't come back,

466
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,620
you'll have eight points deducted.

467
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,690
It's not so many.

468
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,350
No way.

469
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,190
We can't let Mr. Zheng

470
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,240
continue like this.

471
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,770
How come the company

472
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,760
makes overtime justifiable

473
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,780
and we have to be sneaky like this to

474
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,450
try to take back

475
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,760
our own time?

476
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:14,360
Yes.

477
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:14,670
Yeah.

478
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,030
I've come up with a way to deal with it.

479
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,040
Starting tomorrow,

480
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,710
we're going to stand up for

481
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,410
our own lives.

482
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,220
Okay.

483
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:30,760
Okay.

484
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,290
In Planning Department 3,

485
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,740
[Vice Chairman's Office]

486
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,730
Li Tianran has deducted four points.

487
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,610
Six points for Yao Siwen.

488
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,310
Seven points for Ji Huahua.

489
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,180
Good.

490
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,050
It's effective.

491
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,250
Mr. Zheng,

492
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,330
the new system has only been implemented for one day

493
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,250
and has influenced the whole Planning Department 3.

494
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,630
I think soon

495
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,850
they'll join up with Planning Department 2.

496
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,820
Within three days,

497
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,520
send them all to the study class.

498
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,810
I see.

499
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:02,680
Go.

500
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,350
Yes, sir.

501
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,560
Ms. Fan.

502
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,900
The meeting room has been set up.

503
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,210
We've contacted Gao Defen to work with us

504
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,600
in the bathroom.

505
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,210
Good.

506
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,960
Director Yao said

507
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,170
the rooftop alignment map was okay.

508
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,870
Come on, I have to finish

509
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,100
my 51.6-minute paid life today.

510
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,010
Tianran,

511
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,450
I have to enjoy

512
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,930
paid life today.

513
