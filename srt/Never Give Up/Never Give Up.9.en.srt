00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,240
Eight million.

346
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,550
[Eight million]

347
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,180
Also,

348
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,400
I heard that Banana Mobile is also working on a joint-design.

349
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,490
So we need to show them

350
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,590
our sincerity.

351
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,490
Not only we

352
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,630
changed the package of the new product,

353
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,790
but also we did product research for them

354
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,460
based on their style.

355
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,170
So apart from eight million,

356
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,280
we also have to consider R&D and design costs.

357

361
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,750

We'll contact the group

366

what's his specialty?

[Wu Yimei: No match. No one is found.]

[Wu Yimei in the database is not the same person sitting across.]

384

She's not on the employee list

385

386

Don't underestimate her.

Let's begin.

Oh no.

394
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,500
What's the first step I should do?

395
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,530
If they raise the budget, I'll...

396
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,320
Why doesn't Ms. Wu say anything? Did she forget what to say?

397
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,630
No way.

398
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,620
Ms. Wu

399

is very calm

401

How could she forget what to say?

402
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,190
She must be thinking about

403
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,950
how to use the most simple information

404

[No micro expression detected.]

Why did she stop again?

422
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,220

and took control of the situation.
