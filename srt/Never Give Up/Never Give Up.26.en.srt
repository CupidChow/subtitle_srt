173
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,770
Excuse me.

174
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,620
This girl...

175
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,490
She treated me like I'm robbing her.

176
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,710
What are you doing?

177
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,650
You scared me.

178
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,180
What are you doing?

179
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,580
Why did you come up from here?

180
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,630
The elevator broke down.

181
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,190
Where else can I get up from?

182
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,370
Don't you know there is a bad guy in the community?

183
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,470
Why are you back so late?

184
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,810
You're scarier than the bad guy.

185
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,760
Don't you know?

186
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,640
What's wrong with me?

187
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,780
I was kind enough to pick you up.

188
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,940
I brought a weapon to give you

189
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,070
for protection.

190
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,950
You, you want to protect me with this?

191
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,070
What's wrong?

192
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,130
Your face hurts when hit by it.

193
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,380
Did you get hit when you were young?

194
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,010
Yes.

195
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,240
Why did you follow me in?

196
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,560
How about this?

197
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,820
Let me check the house for you.

198
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,000
What if this bad guy comes in through the window

199
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,690
and hide

200
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,970
in your shoe cabinet?

201
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,790
How can anyone hide in a shoe cabinet?

202
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,360
He can hide in the bathroom,

203
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,250
right?

204
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,710
Anything is possible.

205
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,410
You need to be careful, you know?

206
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,160
He can hide in a cabinet like this,

207
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,350
or In the kitchen.

208
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,510
I don't think he can fit in the fridge.

209
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,440
In the sofa too, right?

210
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,450
That's unnecessary.

211
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,670
What do you mean?

212
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,340
What if he empties the sofa

213
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,290
and hides inside?

214
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,040
There are many perverts nowadays, okay?

215
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,409
The notice didn't say

216
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,900
the bad guy is a husky.

217
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,340
Stop joking.

218
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,380
Even if he doesn't hide inside,

219
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:44,570
he might hide some cameras

220
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,200
or some wiretaps.

221
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,010
Can you take it?

222
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,600
But don't worry.

223
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,590
With a man like me here,

224
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,620
he wouldn't dare to come.

225
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,800
He wouldn't dare to do anything to you either.

226
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,370
I didn't expect that you're so loyal.

227
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,150
Remove "I didn't expect that".

228
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,020
All right.

229
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,180
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

230
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,870
Okay.

231
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,070
You're back.

232
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,340
You're still here.

233
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,210
Li Tianran.

234
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,260
I know.

235
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,380
You're the one who's afraid, right?

236
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Gao Defen went on a business trip.

237
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,310
You are scared at home,

238
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,580
so you won't leave.

239
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,240
You've watched too many TV series.

240
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,920
How can you say

241
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,700
such a tacky line?

242
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,830
This kind of plot

243
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,290
won’t happen here.

244
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,770
Who sets a smart robot’s voice

245
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,830
into a man's voice?

246
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,150
All right, I'm leaving.

247
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,440
You're on your own now.

248
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,020
I'll leave you alone.

249
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,330
Why are you still here?

250
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,230
The lights in the corridor are out.

251
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,410
Many TV series have this scene.

252
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,880
I think...

253
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,060
I have a bad feeling.

254
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,390
Today, I'll stay here

255
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,100
to guard your house.

256
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,580
Just do what you should do. Don't worry about me.

257
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:54,960
Okay.

258
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,700
I won't disturb you.

259
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,630
Close the curtain.

260
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,900
Go.

261
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,680
Yes, put your bag here.

262
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,140
No problem. Don't worry.

263
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,320
Yes.

264
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,290
Go ahead.

265
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,460
Go up.

266
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,050
Wash up and go to bed.

267
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,210
Mom,

268
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,580
I'm happy living alone.

269
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,990
It's not that bad.

270
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,970
A blind date?

271
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,140
I don't want a blind date.

272
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,260
The man that Third Aunt introduced last time, he's no good.

273
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,550
We just started talking, but he asked me

274
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,290
if the company would help with

275
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,810
the education of future kids.

276
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,420
It's so happy to be single.

277
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,510
Well...

278
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,940
What's wrong with eating takeaways?

279
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,590
It's better than finding a random guy,

280
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,510
then cook for him and have children, right?

281
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,510
Enough.

282
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,660
Stop nagging.

283
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,040
Let me live a peaceful life.

284
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,450
Okay?

285
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,230
Nothing new.

286
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,250
What could happen at the new department?

287
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,790
What are you thinking?

288
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,780
There's no male colleague suitable for marriage.

289
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,570
No such neighbor either.

290
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,910
What's that sound?

291
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,110
Nothing.

292
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,840
No sound.

293
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,100
How could there be a man in my house?

294
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
You... You heard it wrong.

295
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,060
You heard it wrong.

296
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,370
I know.

297
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,910
Be careful.

298
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,530
Okay, that's it.

299
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,130
I'm hanging up. Bye.

300
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,040
What's your name?

301
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,230
Why did you step on me?

302
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,350
You can't scream even if I stepped on you.

303
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,730
I Can't scream when you stepped on me?

304
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,220
What?

305
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,580
My family is urging me to get married.

306
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,480
I don't understand.

307
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Why do people have to get married

308
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,490
or date?

309
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,780
Is the takeaway not delicious

310
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
or the TV series bad?

311
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,680
You're being selfish talking like this.

312
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,390
Your family cares about you.

313
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:54,950
Right?

314
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,210
In this situation,

315
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,210
you need a boyfriend to accompany you.

316
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,700
Then they will be at ease.

317
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,020
Wash up and go to bed.

318
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,280
Sisi.

319
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,320
Did I disturb you just now?

320
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,540
Stop talking and sleep.

321
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,780
I'm going to sleep. Okay.

322
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,340
Tuck up the quilt.

323
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,440
Cover your knees.

324
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,050
Otherwise, you'll get arthritis when you're old.

325
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,020
Leave the downstairs to me.

326
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,280
Don't worry.

327
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,980
I'm here. No mishap.

328
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay.

329
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:17,950
Good night.

330
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,840
Good night.

331
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,880
Sisi, you can't sleep, right?

332
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,390
If you can't sleep, let's talk.

333
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,530
No.

334
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,080
I heard that the salary increase list will be released next week.

335
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,990
There seems to be two people on the list.

336
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,080
You should be one of them.

337
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,280
The other one... Could it be me?

338
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,920
You think too much.

339
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,210
Actually, Mr. Yu

340
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,110
doesn’t talk good to me,

341
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,540
but I think he really

342
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,730
appreciates me in his heart.

343
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,030
What do you think?

344
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,730
And your relationship problem...

345
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,830
Let me tell you.

346
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,660
Don't be too torn.

347
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,680
After all, it's not easy

348
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,030
to find the right person in the crowds of people.

349
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,330
If you think there's someone suitable,

350
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,080
just date him

351
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,590
for now.

352
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,480
It's good to have someone to talk to, right?

353
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,420
No one knows how to live in the future.

354
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,750
I don't know if I can make it

355
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,100
in this city.

356
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,370
If not,

357
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,860
I'll go back to my hometown.

358
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,640
But it's not necessarily true.

359
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,140
What if

360
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,040
I am promoted to team leader next month?

361
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,140
When we first met,

362
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,790
we turned up noses at each other.

363
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,540
Now we are good friends.

364
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,650
Things are unpredictable.

365
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,390
Sisi.

366
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,290
Are you asleep?

367
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,530
What are you doing?

368
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,210
You're still up?

369
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,470
I'm fine. I'm looking for a lipstick.

370
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,340
Go to sleep.

371
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,630
When looking for a lipstick,

372
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,040
keep your voice down.

373
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,310
You're disturbing my sleep.

374
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,870
Okay.

375
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,240
Li Tianran, what are you doing now?

376
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,240
I'm looking for chili powder.

377
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,200
Looking for chili?

378
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,420
Do you want to cook? Looking for chili?

379
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,910
Keep your voice down.

380
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,080
I'm sorry.

381
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,540
By the way,

382
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,970
do you have a kite in your house?

383
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,670
A kite?

384
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,500
I'll put up with you looking for chili and a lipstick.

385
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,170
Why are you looking for a kite at this hour?

386
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,940
Do you want to take off?

387
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,440
If you make any more noise,

388
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,050
get out of here!

389
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,480
All right.

390
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,510
Stop shouting.

391
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,200
Leave the downstairs to me.

392
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,490
Don't worry.

393
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,050
I'm here. No mishap.

394
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,040
Sisi.

395
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,710
Your mom and I are here to see you.

396
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:12,870
Dad.

397
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,870
Dad.

398
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,240
What's wrong?

399
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,230
My eyes.

400
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,580
My eyes.

401
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,760
Are you okay?

402
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,170
I'll get some tissues.

403
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,990
What's this? It's burning.

404
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,220
My eyes.

405
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,950
What...

406
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,540
What happened?

407
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,510
Bring a towel.

408
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,260
Towel.

409
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,340
Why is it burning?

410
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,080
Don't move.

411
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,160
Dad, are you feeling better?

412
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,780
Do your eyes still hurt?

413
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,820
Shall we go to the hospital?

414
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,570
No, no, no.

415
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,480
Are you really not going? Do they hurt?

416
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,660
Mom, here.

417
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,050
Uncle, auntie,

418
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,470
I'm really sorry.

419
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,480
I didn't expect it to cause such a big trouble.

420
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,210
I'm sorry.

421
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,920
It's okay.

422
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,240
I really don't understand

423
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,000
what you young people are playing now.

424
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,550
But I'm not against it.

425
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,530
Well,

426
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,560
you two

427
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,250
be careful.

428
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,460
Dad, what are you talking about?

429
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,630
Tianran and I are just colleagues.

430
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,280
Yes.

431
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:21,940
How about this?

432
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,680
Well,

433
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,620
it's rare for your parents to come here.

434
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,880
You guys talk first.

435
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,640
Leave these here.

436
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,860
I'll clean them up later, okay?

437
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,020
I'll clean them up later.

438
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,930
Sisi is a girl. She's shy.

439
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,440
You're a grown man.

440
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,380
Why are you so shy?

441
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:35,940
Well...

442
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,330
You work out regularly, right?

443
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,330
No.

444
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,190
Sit.

445
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,780
What are you doing?

446
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,740
Sit down.

447
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,170
What are you doing?

448
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,310
Why are you being so rude?

449
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,630
You scared him.

450
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,010
Sisi said there is nothing between them.

451
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,850
What are you doing?

452
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,740
Sit down.

453
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,170
Sorry.

454
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,070
It's okay.

455
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,620
What did you say

456
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,910
your name was?

457
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,790
Tianran.

458
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,540
Tianran, right?

459
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,510
Come on, call me Second Uncle.

460
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,010
Second Uncle.

461
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,430
Son-in-law.

462
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,110
Second Uncle.

463
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,540
This is your Second Aunt.

464
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,560
Second Aunt.

465
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,400
Yes, Sisi is here too.

466
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,600
Sisi found a boyfriend in secret.

467
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,370
How is him?

468
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:15,830
Her Second Uncle.

469
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,940
If she wants a man, she should find a good one.

470
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,120
This is your Third Aunt.

471
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,950
You're all here.

472
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,770
Third Uncle.

473
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,410
Third Uncle.

474
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,890
Is this a gathering?

475
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,570
Call your brother and sister-in-law here.

476
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,690
Take a look.

477
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,430
You have a lot of family members.

478
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,150
Yes.

479
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,450
Come back and visit.

480
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
