00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,900
Don't hold it, just laugh if you want to.

341
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,450
Wait.

342
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,830
It looks like a good day now.

343
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,470
Man's plan is not as good as God's plan.

344
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,390
Even the typhoon is laughing at me.

345
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,010
Tianran.

346
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,090
If we work from home tomorrow,

347
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,940
is it a working day or a day off?

348
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,780
Bai.

349
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,460
You will come, right?

350
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,490
You just taught me yesterday

351
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,840
that it's a career killer.

352
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,340
to violate the social ban.

353
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,540
I... I...

354
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,930
May I?

355
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,450
Asking out colleagues after hours is prohibited.

356
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,410
Under no circumstances

357
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,620
can you make phone calls to colleagues after work.

358
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,710
Absolutely No.1.

359
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,380
Once violated,

360
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,540
your colleague's relationship ends with it.

361
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,940
If we don't work

362
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,650
today,

363
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,670
it's a holiday.

364
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,510
The social ban says

365
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,580
holiday parties are worse than

366
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,870
weekend parties.

367
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,330
Now that I think about it, I haven't had a good birthday

368
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,470
since I've been working.

369
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,320
Tianran,

370
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,040
it seems

371
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,640
that you're destined to be alone.

372
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,860
Hello, I've booked a private room.

373
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,550
My name is Li. Today is my birthday.

374
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,970
Sir, are your friends still coming?

375
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,150
Wait a little longer.

376
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,230
They should be here soon.

377
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,410
Okay.

378
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,050
I'm sorry.

379
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,800
It's okay.

380
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,840
I'm sorry.

381
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,400
Happy birthday, Tianran.

382
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,530
Didn't you say you weren't coming today?

383
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,510
Although I'm busy today,

384
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,620
your birthday is more important.

385
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,000
I made this cake for you.

386
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,100
Try it.

387
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,640
[Happy Birthday]

388
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,000
How can you be distracted on your birthday?

389
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,950
Open your present.

390
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,160
I picked it randomly.

391
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,200
If you don't like it, forget it.

392
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,450
What...

393
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,660
Tianran.

394
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,180
Go away.

395
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,750
Go away?

396
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,420
What are you doing all by yourself?

397
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,630
It's dangerous to leave the door open.

398
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,950
What am I doing?

399
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,030
What are you doing?

400
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:05,980
The last minute you were in my washroom,

401
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,090
the next you were in my kitchen.

402
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,420
And now you're coming from behind.

403
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,090
All right. Just go away.

404
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,000
Just let me have my birthday.

405
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,580
It's not over, is it?

406
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,710
Wait a minute.

407
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,510
Are you real?

408
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,950
Happy birthday, Tianran.

409
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,380
Happy birthday.

410
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,200
Is it real?

411
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,500
Why did you slap me?

412
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,310
It's loud.

413
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,460
It's real?

414
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,060
Of course it's real.

415
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,520
Tianran, have you lost your mind out of ecstasy?

416
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,650
No, no.

417
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,190
Wait.

418
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,280
Let me run it through.

419
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,790
It's real?

420
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,099
What?

421
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,930
Bai, did you forget what I taught you?

422
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,990
Breaking workplace rules has serious consequences.

423
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,510
Do you not want to work anymore?

424
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,640
Tianran.

425
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,750
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

426
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,329
You are the first person I met in Gaofa.

427
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,740
You take care of me so much.

428
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,030
You have taught me a lot.

429
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,740
I want to be your friend.

430
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,760
The 10th workplace ban,

431
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,490
it's strictly forbidden to become friends with colleagues.

432
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,710
Are you trying to

433
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,480
kill your career?

434
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,830
Would you?

435
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:40,820

you must have run here without a taxi.

00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,230
I said that too.

679
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,390
And he still let you drink?

680
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,050
I didn't get the stomachache from drinking.

681
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,400
It's from taking cephalosporin in front of him.

682
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,510
I should have known better than to drink it.

683
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,290
Are you dumb?

684
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,970
I didn't mean

685
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,230
to really take cephalosporin.

686
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,520
How much did you take?

687
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,730
One pill is fine.

688
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,540
One tablet.

689
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,340
Let's go to the hospital.

690
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:02,920
It's okay.

691
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,740
I've had my stomach pumped.

692
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,600
It's okay.

693
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,190
I've had my stomach pumped.

694
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,610
I'm just a little weak right now.

695
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,530
It's better to drink.

696
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,570
Come on, it's a good day today.

697
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,010
Let's have a drink together.

698
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,450
Mr. Zheng,

699
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,550
I took cephalosporin today.

700
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,250
I can't drink with you.

701
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,210
Then why are you here?

702
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,890
But you can't drink after taking cephalosporin.

703
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,680
Defen,

704
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,130
you didn't take pills too, did you?

705
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,270
I…

706
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,440
I also took pills today.

707
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,720
So…

708
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,250
You didn't all take pills today, did you?

709
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,940
So cheers.

710
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,840
I took de-alcoholic drugs.

711
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,500
I'll just drink it from the pot.

712
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,010
Good.

713
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,390
Make yourself comfortable. I'll drink up.

714
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,040
It's a little intense.
