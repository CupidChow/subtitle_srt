1
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:01,063
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,144 --> 00:00:02,246
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:03,495
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:45,966
Why do you look like someone I've known?

5
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,766
I don't think the world is that small.

6
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:50,486
It's really him.

7
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:52,269
The Kla that you knew is already dead.

8
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,286
But the one in front of you isn't that idiot.

9
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,846
Please marry me.

10
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,766
He's Carl.

11
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:02,185
Carl came from his Thai name, Kaokla.

12
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:04,486
He changed his name and surname.

13
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,188
That's why we couldn't find him.

14
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:07,287
I've told you

15
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:09,086
that couldn't kill me.

16
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:12,726
So, this time, it's my turn.

17
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,806
(Time doesn't make us love each other more,)

18
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,806
(but time will make us realize)

19
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:22,686
(the more pain you get from love,)

20
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,926
(the more hateful we are)

21
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:26,326
(than ever.)

22
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:34,286
You're back to kill me?

23
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:42,486
Khim.

24
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:44,286
Are you alright?

25
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,326
Why haven't you gone to sleep?

26
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:50,046
Are you hurting?

27
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:53,326
Today is so horrible.

28
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:58,886
I feel like

29
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,286
I'm in a nightmare.

30
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:08,246
You should sleep, Khim.

31
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,166
When you wake up tomorrow,

32
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:14,686
you'll feel better.

33
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:30,726
How is she?

34
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:37,566
He's that way.

35
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,846
Are you going back?

36
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:47,166
Thank you for visiting me here.

37
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:49,006
No matter where you are,

38
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,526
if you think of me, I'll fly to you.

39
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:54,286
I don't know when we will see each other again.

40
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:00,406
Prepare to get my surprise back.

41
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,686
Take care of yourself.

42
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,389
I don't want us to separate again.

43
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:20,766
I have to go.

44
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:25,886
See you.

45
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,989
Khim, you couldn't sleep?

46
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:21,886
She will be upset if she wakes up and sees this review.

47
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,486
The new hotel

48
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:27,686
was exposed that someone broke into a room.

49
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,806
It might become a scandal.

50
00:07:30,926 --> 00:07:33,246
Keep this a secret. Don't let Khim know.

51
00:07:33,422 --> 00:07:35,046
Khim has to recover herself first.

52
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,606
- Khim. - We're getting discredited.

53
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:46,966
They claimed we let someone break into their rooms.

54
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:50,726
They're trying to destroy our reputation.

55
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:54,806
I have to return to fix this problem.

56
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,046
Khim.

57
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:03,166
He is still alive?

58
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:04,686
He isn't just alive.

59
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:06,805
He's a famous person now.

60
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:09,486
The media said he's dating a famous model.

61
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:12,646
I don't know which hell he came from.

62
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,526
- Does Khim know about this? - Ms. Khim met him yesterday.

63
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:18,846
He's now a businessman called Carl Raman.

64
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:21,166
People have checked his record after he's famous.

65
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:25,526
He's an adopted son of the owner of the hotel booking website we're using.

66
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:30,026
He's doing a start-up for his "Minimalist" business group.

67
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:34,446
How is this possible? This means his business right now

68
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,206
is taking a share of profit from our hotel business.

69
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:41,526
He must have leeched off some women.

70
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,566
He intentionally came back to mock us.

71
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:50,966
(He's now considered a young businessman)

72
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:55,166
(who is famous for his sharing economy to create a community of sharing.)

73
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:57,206
(He lets people use accommodations,)

74
00:08:57,382 --> 00:09:01,086
(necessities, or even labor to trade with him which causes quite a ruckus.)

75
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:04,426
(He has more accommodation than some big hotels.)

76
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:06,526
(Some countries have started to ban his app.)

77
00:09:06,884 --> 00:09:08,731
(Now, he is interested to expand in ASEAN)

78
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:10,846
(after living in China for some time.)

79
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:13,846
He's the representative of a team that the prime minister's adviser

80
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:16,062
will sign an MOU.

81
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,926
If they can sign a partnership contract,

82
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:22,346
he can officially open his branch in Thailand.

83
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:27,166
You can't let him compete with us.

84
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:30,286
But the short-term project to rent out condominiums that you wanted to do

85
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:31,846
was a collaboration with him.

86
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:36,046
Who would know it's his?

87
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,006
As for the six-star resort on the island of Ms. Khim,

88
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:43,806
we have to cancel the project.

89
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:46,606
- Why? - That island is owned by Kaokla.

90
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:48,006
What?

91
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:49,526
This is getting ridiculous.

92
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:51,766
How did he become this rich?

93
00:09:54,238 --> 00:09:56,726
This morning, he attacked our hotel in Hong Kong

94
00:09:56,966 --> 00:10:00,566
on his hotel booking website with this review.

95
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:04,686
This isn't a coincidence.

96
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:07,886
He's back to get back at us.

97
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,446
He's just a prisoner.

98
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:11,686
He thinks of himself too highly.

99
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,526
He wants the government to support him.

100
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:17,486
Uncle, please stop his dream.

101
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:20,486
He thinks he's good enough.

102
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:24,286
Even though it's been several years, he's still arrogant.

103
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:26,766
- Thank you for having me. Yep. - Thank you.

104
00:10:33,685 --> 00:10:35,046
Your review is impactful.

105
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,326
They want to negotiate with us to delete that post.

106
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:40,806
They're good at not admitting their faults.

107
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,246
They want to compensate us by letting us stay for free anywhere

108
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:46,926
while asking us to not report this news.

109
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,286
What do you want?

110
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:51,966
If we can't delete the review,

111
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:55,246
reply that the review is a misunderstanding.

112
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:57,606
Don't let other customers think about that.

113
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,526
Call me if there's anything.

114
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:02,566
Okay.

115
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,046
Khim.

116
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:08,726
Look at this.

117
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,126
Why are people so interested in him?

118
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:14,286
Who is this man? Where is he from?

119
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:16,206
He's an attention seeker.

120
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:17,966
He likes to leech off of women.

121
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:20,446
He wants to stay in the spotlight.

122
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:26,926
Are you angry that he stole your spotlight at your hotel opening?

123
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,526
No.

124
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:31,886
Why would I be jealous of him?

125
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:39,846
Stop thinking about work and think about our wedding instead.

126
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:42,006
If Uncle Sin knows about this,

127
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,886
he might think we're not respecting him.

128
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,354
Ms. Khim. Ms. Khim.

129
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:50,661
Ms. Khim.

130
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:53,726
Is it true that Kaokla is still alive?

131
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:55,058
Oun.

132
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:57,613
Who is still alive?

133
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,326
Is Dad here?

134
00:12:01,796 --> 00:12:03,766
I have good news to tell him.

135
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:11,126
Did you propose to Ms. Khim, Mr. Thaen?

136
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:12,606
Yes.

137
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:15,286
I'm happy for you, Ms. Khim.

138
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:21,926
Mr. Sin would be extremely happy.

139
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:24,200
Why are you so excited?

140
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:28,366
Khim and I are getting married.

141
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,886
We would like to see Uncle Sin.

142
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,806
Something big happened, but you still want to celebrate?

143
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:39,966
Your ex isn't dead, but you already have a new man.

144
00:12:44,886 --> 00:12:46,446
I just want to let him know.

145
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:50,326
If you don't want to celebrate with us, you can just stand still.

146
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,726
- Let's go, Thaen. - Sure.

147
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:05,966
She's already buried her ex in the grave,

148
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:08,246
but he's now haunting us.

149
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,166
She's still acting innocent to deceive Thaen.

150
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:12,406
Hey.

151
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:14,366
I think this

152
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:15,923
might be a time bomb

153
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,163
that's waiting to destroy Khim's life.

154
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:26,286
Hello.

155
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:33,646
There's a problem at the hotel.

156
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:58,526
You dare to come into the tiger's nest.

157
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:00,806
They're the ones who invited me.

158
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:05,166
They wouldn't think you would dare to accept it.

159
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,526
There's nothing to be scared of.

160
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,326
He is really staying in our hotel?

161
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:15,486
Yes. It's the agreement to make him end the matter from Hong Kong.

162
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:20,326
I don't trust him.

163
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:23,830
Does he have ulterior motives?

164
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,030
I don't know.

165
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:28,286
I only know that he's staying with us indefinitely.

166
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,349
If you're worried,

167
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:39,126
I'll ask our people to watch over him.

168
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,566
Don't.

169
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:45,046
He'll find fault with us and claim we're invading his privacy.

170
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:50,326
I think we shouldn't engage in psychological warfare with him.

171
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:54,806
For now, just let our employees take great care of him.

172
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,846
Yes.

173
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,966
- I will carry your bag. - Hey.

174
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,010
It's alright. I can take care of it.

175
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:15,686
My boss doesn't like outsiders.

176
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:18,688
I'll call you if we want anything, alright?

177
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:20,486
Here. This one.

178
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,286
Please wash this.

179
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,430
Thank you.

180
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:29,646
I would like your ID card, please.

181
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:32,476
ID card? What would you need that for?

182
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,766
We have to check every guest who stays with us.

183
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:41,126
Okay.

184
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:43,406
There shouldn't be any problem.

185
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:49,166
Thank you. I'll return it to you later.

186
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:50,526
Sure.

187
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,526
He's looking down on me.

188
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:58,926
I told you to change your shoes.

189
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:04,006
They're my shoes. Why would I change them for something else?

190
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:11,526
Wear this.

191
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,646
Thai Hotels Association has reported

192
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:22,966
through my minister.

193
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:27,326
If we let anyone rent out their properties as a homestay,

194
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:29,846
it'll create unfair competition.

195
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,086
I understand.

196
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,806
This isn't the first time that hotels have tried to resist us.

197
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:36,566
Other countries have banned my company.

198
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,662
They've invested several million baht.

199
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,406
Of course, they wouldn't want someone else to steal their profits.

200
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:44,486
If we let anyone who doesn't have a certificate

201
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:47,326
to directly get in contact with tourists,

202
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:49,966
we won't be able to keep a standard.

203
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:54,166
If there's any problem, it'll ruin the image of our country.

204
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:57,566
Excuse me.

205
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:03,686
I'm here to deliver your clothes.

206
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:05,006
Get inside.

207
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:16,011
Here.

208
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,326
Come here again tomorrow.

209
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,806
But the hotel doesn't want me to come up.

210
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:21,686
If they're worried, tell them to call me.

211
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:23,286
Thank you.

212
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:31,286
Our service doesn't only aim for the tourists.

213
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,566
We're targeting the actual community.

214
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:35,726
Every villagers will get to be the host

215
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:37,246
to welcome tourists.

216
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:39,766
When Thai people are known for their kindness,

217
00:17:40,046 --> 00:17:41,246
this is the selling point.

218
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,806
I forgot my money. Now, please look.

219
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:53,046
There aren't a lot of countries

220
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:55,246
that are better hosts than Thailand.

221
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:03,046
If tourism grow,

222
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:04,646
it has to be sustainable.

223
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,733
I'm sorry.

224
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,070
Where are you going?

225
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:39,487
I'm sorry, but you're bothering other guests.

226
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:41,246
Please go outside for now.

227
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:42,766
I'm sorry.

228
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:47,406
We have to think again

229
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,166
before signing the MOU.

230
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:51,446
If not,

231
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:54,526
we're letting foreign investors

232
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,726
get the commission for free

233
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:58,606
without having to take responsibility.

234
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,926
Mr. Carl is here to visit you.

235
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:04,966
Mr. Carl is here.

236
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,526
Please, Mr. Carl.

237
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:37,581
I heard Dad is here.

238
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:40,206
Yes. He has an appointment with the adviser in the dining room.

239
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:42,558
Has anyone gone inside Mr. Carl's room?

240
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,166
Has anyone seen them go outside?

241
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:50,646
What's going on?

242
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:55,166
I called Mr. Carl here to let us discuss it straightforwardly.

243
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:58,406
I like fair competition.

244
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:02,206
An amateur

245
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:03,366
and a professional

246
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,726
shouldn't compete with each other on the same stage.

247
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,486
It's a different standard.

248
00:20:10,397 --> 00:20:13,726
Nowadays, investing in something with much stability is risky

249
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:15,286
as the world is changing rapidly.

250
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:17,486
A professional who can't adapt in time

251
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:19,206
will lag behind every day.

252
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:20,966
Service business

253
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:22,766
needs satisfaction from the customers.

254
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:24,406
There's no lagging behind

255
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:27,286
as long as we can make the customers satisfied.

256
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:37,686
- What's going on? - He's here.

257
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,166
It's because of this.

258
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:44,117
We don't know whether they want us to clean their room or not.

259
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,278
If they want us to clean it and we didn't clean it,

260
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:47,846
will we get a complaint?

261
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:51,926
If they don't want it and we go inside, we'll also get a complaint.

262
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:04,046
- Hello? - You can't go in. It's a trap.

263
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:07,086
He's trying to cause trouble.

264
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,846
Don't fall for his trick.

265
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,886
A weird guest like this does exist.

266
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:16,966
(We've found the VIP guest. He's in the dining room.)

267
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,806
The dining room.

268
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:27,046
You liked the soup when you came here last time.

269
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:29,165
Our chef has specially prepared it for you,

270
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,246
so you wouldn't miss it later.

271
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:37,526
We always give more than what we've been asked.

272
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,006
We want every guest to feel special.

273
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:45,846
If everyone was equally important,

274
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:48,686
there wouldn't be a double-standard case like that.

275
00:21:51,534 --> 00:21:53,366
If we use database,

276
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:56,286
I can give them what they want before they ask.

277
00:21:58,838 --> 00:22:01,246
We won't make our guests feel uncomfortable

278
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:03,806
or feel like they're at the wrong place.

279
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:06,526
For me, no matter where you are in this world,

280
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:08,781
you should feel like you're at home.

281
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,406
Because it'll make you want to come back again.

282
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,286
If we can't do something this easy,

283
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,006
a professional

284
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:16,806
doesn't mean anything.

285
00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:46,486
They said you're dead.

286
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:48,406
I'm afraid I'm tenacious.

287
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,166
Why did you come here?

288
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:54,446
To watch my enemy die.

289
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,686
The last incident made me realize

290
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,566
that we can die three times in our lives.

291
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,686
The first time is when we don't breathe.

292
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:25,206
The second time is when we lose our bodies.

293
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,446
The third time is when we die from our supporter's hearts.

294
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,926
This time, I'll take your life.

295
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:34,406
But I want you to suffer.

296
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,766
To live while no one remembers you.

297
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:39,846
Make people forget that you're still alive.

298
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:42,686
I'll make you feel like you want to die

299
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:45,406
without actually begging for it.

300
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,156
What happened?

301
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,006
He's back to humiliate me!

302
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:05,646
Why did you let him run around in our hotel?

303
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:08,646
If someone didn't enter his room in Hong Kong,

304
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:10,798
he wouldn't have anything to threaten us with.

305
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:13,966
The person in those photos was you, right?

306
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:17,646
I just wanted to investigate

307
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:19,846
why he has become Carl.

308
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,806
Didn't you just want to light up an old flame?

309
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:29,397
I don't want to be involved with him anymore.

310
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:31,726
Even if you want to, it's not like he's interested.

311
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:33,326
I heard now

312
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,526
he's far above your reach.

313
00:24:35,884 --> 00:24:37,366
Watch your mouth.

314
00:24:38,253 --> 00:24:40,006
I'm telling the truth, Uncle.

315
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,646
Carl's girlfriend is an Asian-wide famous celebrity.

316
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:46,766
She's pretty, rich, cute, and generous.

317
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:50,509
He wouldn't be interested in Saikhim anymore.

318
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,446
Don't let Thaenthai know about this.

319
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:57,446
If he knew about this back then,

320
00:24:57,608 --> 00:24:59,552
would the wedding actually happen?

321
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:02,338
Wedding? What wedding?

322
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:05,406
Khim, you haven't told Uncle yet?

323
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:08,446
Thaen would like to be your son-in-law.

324
00:25:09,114 --> 00:25:11,326
Congratulations, you've finally succeed.

325
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:24,214
Dad.

326
00:25:25,366 --> 00:25:28,846
I'm sorry for not telling you about my proposal.

327
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,606
Everything was too abrupt. I wasn't ready.

328
00:25:32,494 --> 00:25:33,686
Congratulations, Khim.

329
00:25:34,052 --> 00:25:35,686
You've grown up once more.

330
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:38,446
Thaenthai will support you with your work.

331
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:40,326
Because you have him,

332
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:42,446
that's why I retired to get into politics.

333
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:49,646
But we're not getting married because of that.

334
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:52,366
We're getting married because we love each other.

335
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:54,414
Love is good.

336
00:25:54,823 --> 00:25:57,966
If your love can support one another, that's even better.

337
00:25:58,574 --> 00:26:01,431
We shouldn't stay with someone who drags us down.

338
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:05,326
We weren't born to repeat the same mistakes.

339
00:26:06,438 --> 00:26:09,126
You almost let Thaenthai go once.

340
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:12,526
Fortunately, you came back in time.

341
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,446
Dad, you said it like

342
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:18,206
I wasn't worthy of Thaen.

343
00:26:18,437 --> 00:26:19,446
Khim.

344
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:22,426
You eloped with a man once.

345
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,990
No good man can accept that.

346
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:29,246
So, don't let him suspect anything about that.

347
00:26:30,566 --> 00:26:33,166
Even when you're already married. Understand?

348
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:36,566
Who would believe

349
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:37,726
that a dog

350
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:39,486
could become a cool man?

351
00:26:39,726 --> 00:26:42,764
He might be richer than Uncle's future son-in-law.

352
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:47,446
If he is your son-in-law, what would you think Uncle Sin would say?

353
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,025
What are you thinking?

354
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:54,526
You know Uncle Sin has compared me with Khim since we were children.

355
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:56,766
I've never been good enough for him.

356
00:26:57,166 --> 00:27:01,246
Mr. Sin, do you know that Prim has become the fashion director

357
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:02,654
of Unique Magazine?

358
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,486
Being their employee needs patience.

359
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:07,686
If you're half as good as Khim,

360
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:09,606
I would let you help with my hotel.

361
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:11,070
It's as you can see now.

362
00:27:11,508 --> 00:27:13,266
You're good for nothing.

363
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:17,946
Do what you want. Just don't let anyone criticize you when you're my niece.

364
00:27:19,023 --> 00:27:20,206
Mom.

365
00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:23,325
If I want to win against Khim,

366
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:25,766
I have to find a better husband than her.

367
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:30,486
Now, the man who is better than Thaen is Carl.

368
00:27:30,726 --> 00:27:36,366
If Khim knows that Carl loves me, she would go crazy.

369
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,886
Sure. Uncle Sin would love it.

370
00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:45,006
Indeed, Uncle Sin wouldn't be happy about it now.

371
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:48,686
But the future is uncertain.

372
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:51,646
Mom, think about it.

373
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:54,309
Uncle Sin values his benefit the most.

374
00:27:54,862 --> 00:27:58,423
One day, I believe that he will get money

375
00:27:58,685 --> 00:28:00,486
or influence from Carl.

376
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:08,846
I have the information that you've asked me to gather here.

377
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:12,926
Thank you.

378
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:17,926
What is Prompt doing?

379
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,126
He asked his people to investigate Kaokla.

380
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,566
He even knows it's a trap from Kla.

381
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:25,726
Why is Prompt still doing that?

382
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:27,606
He's even risking it with our employees.

383
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,326
If he catches us again,

384
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,566
he'll expose us again.

385
00:28:57,526 --> 00:29:01,486
(The VIP guest just went down. He's at the swimming pool.)

386
00:29:01,837 --> 00:29:03,566
That lady is Kaokla's guest.

387
00:29:03,805 --> 00:29:05,805
Since she checked in at our hotel,

388
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:07,926
she has almost never used our services.

389
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:10,141
She has only brought outsiders.

390
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:17,281
I'll follow you later.

391
00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:33,006
Ms. Saikhim.

392
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,326
It's fine.

393
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,526
What is he playing at?

394
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:29,977
Kloy.

395
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:41,926
Is that you, Kloy?

396
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:46,806
You still remember me.

397
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:51,006
How are you, Kloy?

398
00:30:52,446 --> 00:30:54,206
Probably not as good as you.

399
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,726
Don't worry.

400
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:57,286
I'm still alive.

401
00:30:57,446 --> 00:30:58,846
My fate hasn't ended yet.

402
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:06,966
You're probably here to see him.

403
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:08,926
You should go.

404
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:14,101
Congratulations, Ms. Bride-to-be.

405
00:31:14,557 --> 00:31:17,406
I hope you'll be together forever this time.

406
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,166
No!

407
00:31:54,286 --> 00:31:55,286
Kla.

408
00:32:02,846 --> 00:32:05,206
I don't understand why you have to come here.

409
00:32:06,678 --> 00:32:07,726
Oh.

410
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,686
Are you seducing your wife?

411
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:11,446
What wife?

412
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,086
You're dressing like this. You want her to look at you, right?

413
00:32:18,206 --> 00:32:20,046
She was looking at you earlier.

414
00:32:20,332 --> 00:32:21,606
You're satisfied now, right?

415
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,006
Happy, aren't you?

416
00:32:23,788 --> 00:32:25,926
Why would I feel happy? Let's go.

417
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:46,166
Kla, are you trying to settle down in this room?

418
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:51,846
Are you hungry?

419
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:54,406
Do you want me to pick up mushrooms around here?

420
00:32:57,589 --> 00:32:59,326
You always change your home.

421
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,126
Don't you want to find your actual home?

422
00:33:02,886 --> 00:33:05,926
You have money, but you act like you're a stray dog.

423
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,046
Having everything doesn't mean you're rich.

424
00:33:09,366 --> 00:33:12,326
Owning something doesn't necessarily make you happy.

425
00:33:12,886 --> 00:33:15,366
These materials can't be used to measure our happiness.

426
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:19,326
Even our body isn't ours. We're just renting to live in them.

427
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:26,486
I've been waiting for when I can get out of this ruined body.

428
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,766
If it wasn't for me,

429
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,286
you wouldn't get shot that day.

430
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:44,798
We're both damaged.

431
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,646
I lost my leg.

432
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,206
You lost your kidney.

433
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,126
We both lose one thing.

434
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:53,566
There'll be people who lose more than us.

435
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:55,166
I promise.

436
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:03,973
Right.

437
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:09,326
The progress of the negotiation with the bank.

438
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:20,244
The bank is interested in lending condos and houses for investment.

439
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,533
The borrower can rent out their houses for a short-term

440
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,286
to create extra income for new gen.

441
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:29,846
They want to partner up with our website and make it one of their services.

442
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:31,406
Do you think it's worth it?

443
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:34,259
I know that your investment

444
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:36,246
doesn't consider money as worth.

445
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:40,006
You know what you want in return.

446
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,886
Right?

447
00:34:42,686 --> 00:34:45,086
It's not a waste for me to send you to study abroad.

448
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:47,766
Proceed with this deal.

449
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:49,366
Sure.

450
00:34:50,366 --> 00:34:51,766
With this much profit,

451
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:54,206
people around here will be shocked.

452
00:35:11,406 --> 00:35:13,766
Kla's real father is a foreigner.

453
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:15,886
But he didn't know who his father was.

454
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:18,726
After Kla's born,

455
00:35:19,357 --> 00:35:22,526
Rakroy then learned that her husband has another child.

456
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:24,966
(But what's worse was that)

457
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,526
(she just learned that)

458
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:28,326
(he wanted to have another child)

459
00:35:28,566 --> 00:35:31,166
(to transfer his blood to cure his first child.)

460
00:35:33,326 --> 00:35:34,966
Asia Raman.

461
00:35:45,566 --> 00:35:48,166
(I didn't want Kla to be famous or rich,)

462
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:51,166
(not because I didn't want him to succeed.)

463
00:35:51,574 --> 00:35:54,326
(I want to protect him from those horrible people.)

464
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:06,926
(The wealth in my application is now bothering people.)

465
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:12,006
(Because we're focusing on people having their own jobs.)

466
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:13,766
(Because many people have a lot of jobs)

467
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,526
(but you know, those jobs don't suit them.)

468
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:20,286
(So, in my application, it'll help them find good jobs)

469
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:22,206
(and the job that really suits them.)

470
00:36:26,118 --> 00:36:27,366
He's like another person.

471
00:36:30,352 --> 00:36:31,646
Thank you.

472
00:36:37,215 --> 00:36:38,726
Hello, Ms. Khim.

473
00:36:39,046 --> 00:36:40,406
Such a coincidence.

474
00:36:41,464 --> 00:36:44,326
Carl is staying here. Have you seen him?

475
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,126
No.

476
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:49,006
Are you working in Bangkok?

477
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:50,517
No.

478
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:52,846
I'm here to surprise him

479
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,806
in return for when he came to surprise me in Hong Kong.

480
00:36:59,374 --> 00:37:01,606
Let me go prank someone first.

481
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:03,286
Later.

482
00:37:13,342 --> 00:37:16,002
Let me see. Is the patient better now?

483
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:17,806
Let me see.

484
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:19,606
I'm already better.

485
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:24,126
I was thinking of giving you a flower basket, but it'll make you worse.

486
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:28,726
I'm already okay now.

487
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:31,646
Are you sure?

488
00:37:35,021 --> 00:37:37,021
You still have to rest for now.

489
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:39,406
I don't want to take you anywhere that much.

490
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,206
We should just eat and go home.

491
00:37:46,486 --> 00:37:49,726
I told Dad about our wedding.

492
00:37:50,806 --> 00:37:54,906
Thaen, you can tell me when you want your family to come.

493
00:37:56,726 --> 00:37:57,726
Khim.

494
00:37:58,492 --> 00:37:59,846
I proposed to you so quickly

495
00:38:00,102 --> 00:38:02,926
because I want to take you away from that house.

496
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:07,326
Since the incident in Hong Kong,

497
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:09,606
I have to always be alert.

498
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:12,846
I don't know when Prompt will bring up that to mock me.

499
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:14,566
When I fall,

500
00:38:14,718 --> 00:38:17,246
those people are ready to add insult to my injury.

501
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,046
I'm sorry.

502
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:23,686
But for this matter, it's Uncle Sin's fault.

503
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:27,246
He made siblings compete against each other.

504
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:30,406
The house has become a battlefield.

505
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:33,646
I promise that

506
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,886
our family won't be like that.

507
00:38:39,638 --> 00:38:40,758
Let's order our meal.

508
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:52,166
Khim.

509
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:53,806
Those two people.

510
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:04,326
Ms. Khim.

511
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,880
I think we should change the mood.

512
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:24,486
They're staying in your hotel?

513
00:39:24,885 --> 00:39:26,926
Why have we run into them a lot lately?

514
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:29,126
I don't know

515
00:39:29,613 --> 00:39:31,966
if it's a coincidence or if it's intentional.

516
00:39:55,941 --> 00:39:56,966
Are you ready?

517
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:00,166
It's fun when I'm with you.

518
00:40:03,215 --> 00:40:04,726
Thaen, what are you looking at?

519
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:13,966
(Please consider the Arsa app. It can help a lot of people.)

520
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:15,606
They look down-to-earth.

521
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:18,286
They don't mind their privacy that much.

522
00:40:19,638 --> 00:40:21,886
I think they look suitable together.

523
00:40:25,086 --> 00:40:26,526
People like them. Look.

524
00:40:35,886 --> 00:40:40,246
They don't have to hide from the paparazzi like other celebrities.

525
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:44,046
Those two...

526
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:46,206
What is Prompt doing?

527
00:40:46,582 --> 00:40:48,366
He asked his people to investigate Kaokla.

528
00:40:50,817 --> 00:40:52,406
I'll be back.

529
00:40:53,588 --> 00:40:54,746
Khim.

530
00:40:55,182 --> 00:40:56,205
Khim.

531
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,006
- How long have they gone out? - Around 30 minutes.

532
00:41:05,149 --> 00:41:06,446
Is it really okay to do this?

533
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:07,926
Open the door.

534
00:41:10,244 --> 00:41:11,246
Prompt.

535
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,190
What are you doing?

536
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:15,366
Getting in to find out what he is planning.

537
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:16,766
Don't go in.

538
00:41:17,052 --> 00:41:18,246
It might be his plan.

539
00:41:18,446 --> 00:41:20,286
He made us suspect something.

540
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,286
When we break into it, he'll put a charge against us.

541
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:24,646
I'm not stupid enough to get caught like you.

542
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:26,966
Open it.

543
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,246
Prompt.

544
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:30,486
You don't know him as well as I do.

545
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:32,086
Why are you scared of him?

546
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:35,046
He came here to mock us. We can get him back.

547
00:41:36,942 --> 00:41:38,046
Prompt.

548
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:39,926
Prompt.

549
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,772
- What? - The prey is caught in our trap.

550
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,366
(This time it's her brother.)

551
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,966
- Deal with that nosy man for me. - Of course.

552
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,766
What's wrong, Khim?

553
00:42:25,446 --> 00:42:27,299
There's a VIP guest.

554
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:52,446
There's trouble.

555
00:42:56,189 --> 00:42:57,846
I have to deal with some problems.

556
00:43:04,286 --> 00:43:05,406
Answer it.

557
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:30,686
Have they answered it?

558
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:06,603
There's a phone call. What should we do?

559
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:08,493
Forget it. Don't mind it.

560
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,806
It's a waste. We haven't found anything.

561
00:44:25,686 --> 00:44:27,626
We can easily forgive the first mistake.

562
00:44:34,974 --> 00:44:36,726
But if you still repeat the same mistake,

563
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:45,246
it's called bad personality.

564
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:50,791
No. Let me answer the call first.

565
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,966
Hello?

566
00:44:57,806 --> 00:44:58,846
Give me that.

567
00:44:59,246 --> 00:45:03,129
Prompt, get out of his room. Someone's going there.

568
00:45:04,901 --> 00:45:06,606
You're acting in a group now?

569
00:45:06,925 --> 00:45:08,925
(My boss told me that)

570
00:45:09,149 --> 00:45:11,646
(he's impressed with your attention for him,)

571
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,006
(but please stop bothering him.)

572
00:45:14,237 --> 00:45:16,126
This is an invasion of privacy.

573
00:45:16,766 --> 00:45:18,086
We can't let this off easily.

574
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,960
We'll move out immediately.

575
00:45:44,053 --> 00:45:45,159
What are you looking at?

576
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:58,566
Officer,

577
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:04,406
please check his body.

578
00:46:04,693 --> 00:46:07,046
My boss's important item is lost.

579
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,006
It might be on him.

580
00:46:10,181 --> 00:46:11,646
Don't challenge me.

581
00:46:11,806 --> 00:46:14,886
If you can't find it on me, can you compensate me?

582
00:46:17,006 --> 00:46:18,686
I have to check your body.

583
00:46:19,326 --> 00:46:20,366
Go.

584
00:46:21,637 --> 00:46:22,686
- Sure. - Excuse me.

585
00:46:32,766 --> 00:46:33,926
This.

586
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:35,966
He really stole it from us.

587
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,086
Did you just frame me?

588
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:48,406
So, you're a thief.

589
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:51,206
We had to teach you a lesson so you won't come here again.

590
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,126
Please go to the police station.

591
00:46:53,445 --> 00:46:55,366
You're charged for trespassing and robbery.

592
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:57,806
You're cooperating to frame me.

593
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,886
Are you trying to get back at me?

594
00:47:02,283 --> 00:47:06,006
Last time, I was in prison because of your dirty scheme.

595
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:08,596
We're even now.

596
00:47:08,886 --> 00:47:10,206
- Let's go. - Let's go.

597
00:47:11,279 --> 00:47:12,279
Go.

598
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:14,205
You prick.

599
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:16,154
- Go. - You're a demon.

600
00:47:16,285 --> 00:47:17,805
I'll make you pay.

601
00:47:18,385 --> 00:47:20,606
Mark my words! Let me go.

602
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,686
Dad.

603
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:24,126
Why did we have to fire Mr. Chartchai?

604
00:48:24,357 --> 00:48:25,886
What did he do?

605
00:48:26,581 --> 00:48:29,006
Or do you want me to fire Prompt to end the case?

606
00:48:30,398 --> 00:48:33,358
But Mr. Chartchai only followed Prompt's order.

607
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,237
He's only did his duty.

608
00:48:35,518 --> 00:48:38,076
It's like we're making him a scapegoat.

609
00:48:38,173 --> 00:48:39,702
Or do you want to be the scapegoat?

610
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:42,366
Accept the blame for everything?

611
00:48:42,717 --> 00:48:44,477
Because you brought them here.

612
00:48:44,837 --> 00:48:48,326
If you didn't go with him that day, they wouldn't come here today.

613
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,566
We have to suffer the consequences of your actions.

614
00:48:51,692 --> 00:48:53,549
You haven't learned anything?

615
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:00,166
If I died on that day,

616
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:02,886
everything would be better, wouldn't it?

617
00:49:13,134 --> 00:49:14,238
Are you still hungry?

618
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:18,606
The sushi looks nice.

619
00:49:26,382 --> 00:49:27,382
Kla.

620
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:30,076
I've handled it for you.

621
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:32,606
We'll know how they'll compensate us tomorrow.

622
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:36,686
If they have no one else left, they'll fight each other.

623
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:43,486
Right. I've found your new accommodation.

624
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:45,526
In case you need a room tonight.

625
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,526
They said the bed is extremely soft. Don't forget to use it.

626
00:49:50,638 --> 00:49:52,286
Give me the key. I'll go back myself.

627
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,720
Make sure to go back to your room.

628
00:49:59,606 --> 00:50:01,326
They sign the contract in the end.

629
00:50:02,341 --> 00:50:04,926
He's announcing that he's our enemy.

630
00:50:05,126 --> 00:50:07,806
He expands his business in Thailand.

631
00:50:08,077 --> 00:50:10,526
He intentionally made you lose your face.

632
00:50:11,221 --> 00:50:12,566
It's not that easy.

633
00:50:16,678 --> 00:50:17,806
I know now

634
00:50:18,278 --> 00:50:20,046
why he stayed in our hotel.

635
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:21,366
Why?

636
00:50:25,454 --> 00:50:28,006
He's interested in the historic house opposite our hotel.

637
00:50:32,814 --> 00:50:34,686
I saw him using a telescope

638
00:50:34,886 --> 00:50:36,326
to watch the opposite side.

639
00:50:36,646 --> 00:50:39,846
When I looked into it, it was pointing at that house.

640
00:50:40,046 --> 00:50:41,606
But I didn't think anything of it at first.

641
00:50:42,366 --> 00:50:43,726
Until I run into this.

642
00:50:53,582 --> 00:50:55,686
He sketched that house's plan.

643
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:02,966
He also noted the phone number.

644
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:05,326
I've checked it.

645
00:51:05,638 --> 00:51:07,406
It's really that place's number.

646
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:10,486
My theory has to be correct.

647
00:51:10,638 --> 00:51:12,446
He's interested in that historical house.

648
00:51:14,285 --> 00:51:15,966
He thinks he's winning against us.

649
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:19,046
But actually, we're even for this round.

650
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:23,966
Yes. Prompt, it's like you punch him below his belt.

651
00:51:27,886 --> 00:51:31,166
Actually, we might imagining it ourselves.

652
00:51:32,414 --> 00:51:34,246
It's better than letting him bait us.

653
00:51:35,477 --> 00:51:37,646
If he wants that historical house,

654
00:51:37,846 --> 00:51:39,126
let's buy it now.

655
00:51:40,301 --> 00:51:41,846
Let's teach him a lesson.

656
00:51:44,126 --> 00:51:45,166
Uncle.

657
00:51:46,582 --> 00:51:49,606
I think it can be used for my condominium project.

658
00:51:50,127 --> 00:51:51,286
Isn't that good?

659
00:51:52,086 --> 00:51:54,166
I'll help you too.

660
00:51:54,286 --> 00:51:57,886
I'll investigate why he wants to buy that house.

661
00:51:58,286 --> 00:52:00,886
I'm good at below-the-belt stuff.

662
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,806
Because I risked myself and went into the tiger's nest,

663
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:12,086
we can get some advantages back.

664
00:52:14,566 --> 00:52:16,486
If you aren't brave enough, back away.

665
00:52:17,182 --> 00:52:18,806
This is a man's fight.

666
00:52:28,365 --> 00:52:31,686
People shared Carl's news all over the internet this morning

667
00:52:32,373 --> 00:52:36,414
because there's a live stream where he paid for black coffee in advance.

668
00:52:36,837 --> 00:52:39,206
It became free black coffee for those without money.

669
00:52:40,045 --> 00:52:42,406
People went out to find the free black coffee

670
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,686
and paid for them in advance to treat other people.

671
00:53:01,632 --> 00:53:03,446
People are praising him.

672
00:53:03,622 --> 00:53:05,326
They called Kaokla a saint.

673
00:53:06,126 --> 00:53:08,086
Some called him a clean man.

674
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,286
There are a lot of people who downloaded his app, "Arsa".

675
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:20,526
That is a boat driver

676
00:53:20,766 --> 00:53:23,166
who is transporting our guests at the back of our hotel.

677
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:26,486
Kaokla called him to be his driver by using his app.

678
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:28,246
I called him to ask something,

679
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,526
and I learned that Kaokla

680
00:53:30,796 --> 00:53:32,806
is using this app to create his reputation.

681
00:53:57,366 --> 00:53:59,326
Kaokla is forcing us to be the devil

682
00:54:00,293 --> 00:54:02,726
while he's being a saint in front of others.

683
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:08,686
(Kaokla developed the Arsa app to create a community of sharing)

684
00:54:09,406 --> 00:54:11,966
(by connecting people to share their kindness.)

685
00:54:12,206 --> 00:54:15,046
(They share what they have with other people)

686
00:54:15,206 --> 00:54:16,646
(or even share their own time.)

687
00:54:17,006 --> 00:54:18,718
(He can create value in their time)

688
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:21,606
(by letting them volunteer themselves to do any job)

689
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:23,126
(that is being requested)

690
00:54:23,453 --> 00:54:24,594
(such as getting a drive,)

691
00:54:24,725 --> 00:54:27,726
(buying something, lining in a queue, fixing a car,)

692
00:54:27,966 --> 00:54:30,446
(taking care, and teaching homework.)

693
00:54:30,693 --> 00:54:32,086
(They can be traded for money)

694
00:54:32,245 --> 00:54:34,245
(or be traded for volunteer points)

695
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:37,526
(which can be used to ask for other people's help.)

696
00:55:05,446 --> 00:55:07,046
(Successfully registered.)

697
00:55:20,513 --> 00:55:21,566
Claire.

698
00:55:23,926 --> 00:55:25,686
Are you here to send me off?

699
00:55:28,846 --> 00:55:31,206
Hey, I don't want to go back now if you're here.

700
00:55:32,566 --> 00:55:34,606
We're using our every second to its fullest.

701
00:55:40,526 --> 00:55:41,726
I'll give you this.

702
00:55:42,557 --> 00:55:44,326
It'll accompany you instead of me.

703
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:52,246
Are you crazy? Who would raise a mushroom for a lover?

704
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:55,846
Eat it instead of me for now.

705
00:55:57,206 --> 00:55:59,446
Don't die before we meet again.

706
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:09,646
When I'm not here, please behave yourself.

707
00:56:10,188 --> 00:56:11,385
Yes.

708
00:56:13,413 --> 00:56:14,766
Thank you.

709
00:56:19,429 --> 00:56:21,486
You're the cutest.

710
00:56:25,206 --> 00:56:27,366
I'm happy that I could finally meet you.

711
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,262
I'm Primprao,

712
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:31,846
Saikhim's cousin.

713
00:56:32,444 --> 00:56:33,886
We had almost become relatives.

714
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:36,501
Hey.

715
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:39,294
I know that last night,

716
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,277
you got my brother good.

717
00:56:41,637 --> 00:56:43,326
I'm here today

718
00:56:43,966 --> 00:56:45,326
to ask for peace.

719
00:56:45,686 --> 00:56:46,926
What peace?

720
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,246
I know they've attacked you quite a lot.

721
00:56:49,374 --> 00:56:50,765
I'm not like them.

722
00:56:50,857 --> 00:56:53,246
So, I think we can be friends.

723
00:56:55,668 --> 00:56:57,588
I'm not good at lying. I hate to put on a mask.

724
00:56:57,878 --> 00:56:59,486
I didn't lie or anything.

725
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:03,726
Everything I've said came from my heart.

726
00:57:04,163 --> 00:57:05,686
If you don't believe me,

727
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:08,726
you can prove it yourself.

728
00:57:16,278 --> 00:57:18,406
If you want a friend to accompany you,

729
00:57:19,446 --> 00:57:20,486
you can call me.

730
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:38,326
I thought she would want to come with us.

731
00:57:38,645 --> 00:57:39,966
Look at her eyes.

732
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,526
Do I look stupid enough to be easily deceived?

733
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,693
They're probably in a corner.

734
00:57:46,582 --> 00:57:48,166
So, they used this cheap trick.

735
00:57:54,086 --> 00:57:55,366
I asked this from a doctor.

736
00:57:55,693 --> 00:57:56,693
Take it.

737
00:57:56,886 --> 00:58:00,646
You work at night. Your body will fall ill if you don't adjust the time.

738
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:04,326
Don't be too reckless. Don't neglect your own body...

739
00:58:05,213 --> 00:58:06,773
Did you listen to me at all?

740
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:14,326
Wow. You're even more beautiful than in the photo.

741
00:58:16,846 --> 00:58:17,886
Dad.

742
00:58:18,302 --> 00:58:19,966
Khim and I are getting married.

743
00:58:28,366 --> 00:58:32,566
You even know they thought of you as a big pile of money.

744
00:58:32,924 --> 00:58:35,366
Do you still want to let them trap you?

745
00:58:43,846 --> 00:58:45,126
Why did Dad come here?

746
00:58:47,742 --> 00:58:49,806
Kaokla has gone into that house for some time.

747
00:58:50,845 --> 00:58:52,086
He hasn't come out yet.

748
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,046
Our people see his right-hand man waiting in front of it.

749
00:58:55,878 --> 00:58:57,366
My theory must be correct.

750
00:58:57,606 --> 00:58:58,966
They want that house.

751
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:01,486
Why do we have to pay attention?

752
00:59:01,686 --> 00:59:05,166
If we act like this, it's like we're one step behind him.

753
00:59:05,565 --> 00:59:06,845
We don't have to care.

754
00:59:07,303 --> 00:59:09,206
We can just live our separate ways.

755
00:59:12,661 --> 00:59:15,206
What if he opens a hotel opposite us?

756
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:16,566
What do you say?

757
00:59:16,749 --> 00:59:18,486
Are we waiting for him to attack us?

758
00:59:18,726 --> 00:59:20,886
That's why I suggest we should build a condo first.

759
00:59:21,382 --> 00:59:22,606
I'll do it myself.

760
00:59:23,134 --> 00:59:26,486
This isn't something that can be easily done whenever you want.

761
00:59:26,686 --> 00:59:28,086
Stay still if you're scared.

762
00:59:28,854 --> 00:59:31,286
Let Prompt do it. We can't let a coward

763
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:32,926
drag our business down.

764
00:59:44,326 --> 00:59:45,526
Wait.

765
00:59:45,837 --> 00:59:46,966
What did you forget?

766
00:59:48,132 --> 00:59:49,486
This way.

767
00:59:54,861 --> 00:59:57,184
Did they want to rush a marriage?

768
00:59:57,382 --> 00:59:58,382
No.

769
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,740
Khim and I decided it ourselves.

770
01:00:10,238 --> 01:00:13,806
Do you know Mr. Carl, a famous start-up businessman?

771
01:00:14,469 --> 01:00:17,566
He has a sister. I think she is more suitable for you.

772
01:00:19,845 --> 01:00:22,083
I think you want me to leech off a woman.

773
01:00:22,253 --> 01:00:25,246
Hey, we need a win-win situation for something like this.

774
01:00:45,298 --> 01:00:46,766
Where are you going, Lita?

775
01:01:01,246 --> 01:01:02,606
(Lita)

776
01:01:07,006 --> 01:01:09,246
Yeah. He is no good.

777
01:01:15,846 --> 01:01:17,526
Hello? Is it an emergency?

778
01:01:17,686 --> 01:01:19,846
- Oh. - Okay. I'm sorry.

779
01:01:37,526 --> 01:01:38,886
Did you get anything?

780
01:01:47,406 --> 01:01:49,086
I forgot about it.

781
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:51,670
I've prepared two sets every year.

782
01:01:52,214 --> 01:01:54,214
What should we do with the other set?

783
01:01:54,589 --> 01:01:58,126
He's still alive. If we still dedicate merits for him,

784
01:01:58,325 --> 01:02:00,325
I think it's abnormal.

785
01:02:01,349 --> 01:02:02,806
Just offer it for the monks.

786
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:05,166
Dedicate some merit to him.

787
01:02:05,446 --> 01:02:06,966
It might make it better.

788
01:02:09,406 --> 01:02:10,486
Delicious, right?

789
01:02:11,397 --> 01:02:13,966
If you like it, I still have more nice places.

790
01:02:14,966 --> 01:02:16,526
I understand.

791
01:02:17,629 --> 01:02:18,644
Understand what?

792
01:02:18,758 --> 01:02:20,366
When we have a delicious food,

793
01:02:20,589 --> 01:02:22,589
but we don't have anyone else to eat with,

794
01:02:22,726 --> 01:02:24,926
it's kind of heartbreaking.

795
01:02:25,566 --> 01:02:28,743
Love is like that. Only a lonely man would understand.

796
01:02:29,054 --> 01:02:31,486
We have to get through this loneliness.

797
01:02:32,766 --> 01:02:33,926
Why are you that dramatic?

798
01:02:34,222 --> 01:02:35,518
Isn't this true?

799
01:02:37,668 --> 01:02:40,086
When we want to tell something to someone, but we can't.

800
01:02:40,397 --> 01:02:43,166
I know you don't have anyone to talk with.

801
01:02:44,925 --> 01:02:46,766
Your girlfriend isn't here to let you talk.

802
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:53,306
Here. I like this one more.

803
01:03:00,966 --> 01:03:04,126
Your type is horrible. Don't send anyone ever again.

804
01:03:06,766 --> 01:03:09,366
Your pride is too high.

805
01:03:09,693 --> 01:03:11,406
(You only want a rich man.)

806
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,314
If you could get it, you would have gotten it long ago.

807
01:03:13,446 --> 01:03:16,729
If I blindly go with a man that you find for me,

808
01:03:16,902 --> 01:03:18,302
it's not good anyway.

809
01:03:18,421 --> 01:03:19,813
(I've studied this hard.)

810
01:03:19,949 --> 01:03:22,397
I can't just go back to our home

811
01:03:22,526 --> 01:03:24,326
- and make some skin cream. - What?

812
01:03:24,612 --> 01:03:26,636
How is it bad to make skin cream?

813
01:03:26,772 --> 01:03:29,246
You haven't learned your lesson, have you?

814
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,886
How many people's faces have you ruined?

815
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,412
(I had mediated with a lot of them.)

816
01:03:35,557 --> 01:03:37,606
How much money have you paid for the ingredients?

817
01:03:37,742 --> 01:03:39,096
(I beg you, Mom.)

818
01:03:39,206 --> 01:03:41,326
(Don't risk getting yourself in prison.)

819
01:03:41,486 --> 01:03:43,069
If you get reported again,

820
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:45,206
I won't bail you out.

821
01:03:45,526 --> 01:03:46,686
(Another thing.)

822
01:03:46,846 --> 01:03:48,446
If you want a good son-in-law,

823
01:03:48,566 --> 01:03:51,966
please save your face for me so that I can still face other people.

824
01:04:06,286 --> 01:04:08,766
I hope these creatures will be free.

825
01:04:09,437 --> 01:04:12,086
I hope they'll be free of death and regret.

826
01:04:12,477 --> 01:04:17,166
I hope this merit will reach the lost souls

827
01:04:17,582 --> 01:04:19,582
and enemies from my past life.

828
01:04:21,463 --> 01:04:23,126
I hope for your forgiveness

829
01:04:23,471 --> 01:04:25,446
and don't curse me again.

830
01:04:26,253 --> 01:04:27,766
You've committed sin all your life.

831
01:04:29,509 --> 01:04:31,686
Do you think this can clear off your sin?

832
01:04:39,574 --> 01:04:40,894
Did you follow me here?

833
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:42,446
From your behavior,

834
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,206
I think that's my question.

835
01:04:44,357 --> 01:04:45,766
This ritual is working.

836
01:04:46,342 --> 01:04:48,126
I was dedicating some merit to you.

837
01:04:48,334 --> 01:04:49,806
Are you here to ask for it?

838
01:04:50,156 --> 01:04:52,366
You can't even follow the five precepts.

839
01:04:52,566 --> 01:04:54,006
Do you think you have merit to share?

840
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:56,367
A sinful woman like you,

841
01:04:56,558 --> 01:04:58,366
do you think you have any good left?

842
01:05:05,316 --> 01:05:06,382
What are you doing?

843
01:05:07,393 --> 01:05:08,446
You know,

844
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:10,766
I've never wanted to do any sin

845
01:05:10,894 --> 01:05:13,526
until I want to curse you to death today!

846
01:05:13,781 --> 01:05:15,781
So we don't have to meet again.

847
01:05:15,886 --> 01:05:17,166
- Get away from me. - Hey.

848
01:05:18,006 --> 01:05:19,377
- Let it go. - Ms. Khim.

849
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:21,726
- Stop. - What's going on, Ms. Khim?

850
01:05:21,926 --> 01:05:23,446
It's him.

851
01:05:23,677 --> 01:05:24,806
Don't.

852
01:05:33,565 --> 01:05:35,976
Oun, I don't want to do any more sin than this.

853
01:05:42,326 --> 01:05:43,486
Saikhim.

854
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,486
Saikhim.

855
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,326
Ms. Khim.

856
01:05:51,533 --> 01:05:54,726
I can't believe that he's still alive.

857
01:05:55,774 --> 01:05:58,406
For me, he isn't Kaokla.

858
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,566
The only thing they share is their faces.

859
01:06:00,742 --> 01:06:02,646
But his behavior...

860
01:06:02,806 --> 01:06:05,046
I think he must be extremely grudgeful of us.

861
01:06:05,158 --> 01:06:07,646
It's nothing compared to what he has done to me.

862
01:06:10,557 --> 01:06:11,877
Ms. Khim.

863
01:06:12,399 --> 01:06:14,566
If we aren't compatible,

864
01:06:14,734 --> 01:06:16,734
we have to break up some day.

865
01:06:17,013 --> 01:06:20,846
But if you're destined to be together, you won't be separated like this.

866
01:06:21,126 --> 01:06:24,046
I've never felt disappointed that we've met each other.

867
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:26,533
Until today.

868
01:06:27,966 --> 01:06:29,366
Not just loving him,

869
01:06:29,526 --> 01:06:31,246
knowing him is even too much for me now.

870
01:06:35,886 --> 01:06:37,046
Here you are.

871
01:06:37,613 --> 01:06:41,086
We want to create a new experience for tourism.

872
01:06:43,229 --> 01:06:44,709
Hey, Kla.

873
01:06:46,238 --> 01:06:47,286
What did you do?

874
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:50,206
I fell into the water. Pod came to help me in time.

875
01:06:50,566 --> 01:06:52,646
What did you do to fall into the water?

876
01:06:52,851 --> 01:06:55,077
He's trying to catch fish.

877
01:06:55,206 --> 01:06:56,206
Huh?

878
01:06:59,326 --> 01:07:04,366
Wow. It's almost time for your wedding, but you still have some choices.

879
01:07:04,606 --> 01:07:09,086
How would Khim feel if she knew Thaenthai is double dating?

880
01:07:14,006 --> 01:07:16,046
- Back off. - Answer my question.

881
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:18,166
She wants to be the bank's partner.

882
01:07:18,366 --> 01:07:20,806
Oh, this means your father

883
01:07:20,893 --> 01:07:22,886
wants that daughter-in-law, right?

884
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:24,926
Take care of your problem first, Lita.

885
01:07:25,038 --> 01:07:27,126
You're dating different men every day.

886
01:07:27,415 --> 01:07:29,086
Hey, Thaenthai.

887
01:07:29,526 --> 01:07:31,286
Don't try to change the topic.

888
01:07:31,605 --> 01:07:32,886
Who is that woman?

889
01:07:33,326 --> 01:07:34,406
I'm sorry.

890
01:07:34,669 --> 01:07:37,046
Is there CCTV here? I lost something.

891
01:07:37,214 --> 01:07:39,031
Yes. What did you lose?

892
01:07:39,157 --> 01:07:40,326
My friend's boyfriend.

893
01:07:40,454 --> 01:07:42,046
My friend's boyfriend is missing.

894
01:07:42,303 --> 01:07:44,046
He probably got stolen a moment ago.

895
01:07:44,158 --> 01:07:46,446
I want some evidence to expose him.

896
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:56,158
- Lita. - That's my phone.

897
01:07:57,806 --> 01:07:59,286
Don't try to call Saikhim.

898
01:07:59,717 --> 01:08:01,006
You're only doing something nonsense.

899
01:08:02,406 --> 01:08:06,486
If you're this worried, you're afraid of letting her know, right?

900
01:08:06,646 --> 01:08:08,006
Khim is reasonable.

901
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,646
She won't get jealous over nothing.

902
01:08:09,734 --> 01:08:11,646
Because Khim is reasonable,

903
01:08:11,972 --> 01:08:13,606
that's why she's been deceived by you.

904
01:08:17,957 --> 01:08:19,326
We're getting married.

905
01:08:20,605 --> 01:08:22,486
If you're jealous that Saikhim has a man,

906
01:08:22,646 --> 01:08:23,806
please hide it.

907
01:08:24,037 --> 01:08:26,606
If Khim knows that you're betraying her,

908
01:08:26,766 --> 01:08:29,846
you will never get to marry her in this life, or even your next life.

909
01:08:30,726 --> 01:08:32,406
Give my phone back.

910
01:08:32,717 --> 01:08:33,846
No.

911
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:35,573
- Give my phone back. - No.

912
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:36,726
You won't give it back?

913
01:08:36,807 --> 01:08:38,807
Fine. Then, I'll get your phone instead.

914
01:08:38,909 --> 01:08:40,926
- Lita, what are you doing? - Give me that.

915
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:44,182
- No. What are you doing? - Get it out.

916
01:08:44,292 --> 01:08:46,366
Then, give my phone back.

917
01:08:53,286 --> 01:08:56,126
This isn't over yet, Thaenthai.

918
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:03,772
Lita.

919
01:09:05,773 --> 01:09:07,326
Lita, I'll get it for you.

920
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:26,546
Be careful.

921
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:28,660
Thaen!

922
01:09:36,109 --> 01:09:37,269
Thank you.

923
01:09:56,062 --> 01:09:58,566
Get this back to the car and start the car.

924
01:10:00,966 --> 01:10:03,086
(We want someone who can share their internet.)

925
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:05,926
(If anyone can share their internet, please come.)

926
01:10:12,606 --> 01:10:15,126
Will there be people who would want to share their internet?

927
01:10:15,842 --> 01:10:17,842
We have to rely on each other.

928
01:10:17,957 --> 01:10:20,286
Who would share something like this?

929
01:10:21,213 --> 01:10:22,653
You have delicious stuff.

930
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,680
Have you shared them with people around here?

931
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:27,046
- No. - See?

932
01:10:27,534 --> 01:10:29,406
We'll use your goat milk

933
01:10:29,712 --> 01:10:31,926
to trade with the internet signal.

934
01:10:35,182 --> 01:10:38,447
We ask for what they have and give them what we have.

935
01:10:38,588 --> 01:10:41,253
- Yeah. - It isn't that inconvenient.

936
01:10:47,445 --> 01:10:48,526
Hey.

937
01:10:48,814 --> 01:10:50,646
If the people around here are interested,

938
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:51,883
they'll accept the request.

939
01:10:52,046 --> 01:10:55,126
We will trade our goat milk for their internet. That's all.

940
01:11:00,815 --> 01:11:03,118
No one has accepted it. You're lying.

941
01:11:03,238 --> 01:11:05,246
Hey, calm down, kiddo.

942
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:07,190
You're impatient like a teenager.

943
01:11:07,749 --> 01:11:09,566
- How old are you? - Seven years old.

944
01:11:09,661 --> 01:11:10,726
Seven years old?

945
01:11:11,621 --> 01:11:12,886
You're as old as my child.

946
01:11:13,342 --> 01:11:16,446
If he had a chance to live, he must be as naughty as you.

947
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:42,170
Dad.

948
01:11:54,765 --> 01:11:56,485
What's the matter, Ms. Khim?

949
01:11:56,589 --> 01:11:58,566
- What's the matter? - Please drive.

950
01:12:06,356 --> 01:12:08,286
Why did you follow us?

951
01:12:08,446 --> 01:12:10,206
Prepare to get your payback.

952
01:12:10,565 --> 01:12:12,806
Hey, what are you doing?

953
01:12:13,006 --> 01:12:14,486
- No. - No.

954
01:12:18,088 --> 01:12:19,166
You're crazy.

955
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,901
You're a maniac.

956
01:12:23,046 --> 01:12:25,446
Because you've done a lot of sinful deeds,

957
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:27,286
you're even scared of an empty bucket.

958
01:12:30,808 --> 01:12:32,006
Are you alright?

959
01:12:32,727 --> 01:12:34,166
Please drive the car.

960
01:12:38,697 --> 01:12:42,366
I thought I would have nothing to trade for the internet.

961
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:51,166
So, you have to fire your employee to settle the matter with him?

962
01:12:57,646 --> 01:12:59,086
He's mean.

963
01:12:59,726 --> 01:13:01,606
He only acts like he's a saint.

964
01:13:02,566 --> 01:13:07,366
I don't believe that he doesn't want money when he has this big business.

965
01:13:08,638 --> 01:13:10,566
Do you know anything, Thaen?

966
01:13:12,702 --> 01:13:13,726
No.

967
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:15,206
I don't know anything.

968
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:17,726
Taste the soup for me.

969
01:13:19,941 --> 01:13:21,166
Please try it.

970
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:23,606
Here you are.

971
01:13:24,806 --> 01:13:26,126
How is it?

972
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,406
- Is it good? - It's good.

973
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:35,110
Thaen, what did your family say about our wedding?

974
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,686
I think we should host a small wedding.

975
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:45,406
The more guests we have, the more chaotic it'll get.

976
01:13:46,918 --> 01:13:50,726
I think this event should be held for only us two.

977
01:13:53,317 --> 01:13:54,766
I agree.

978
01:13:55,117 --> 01:13:59,166
A wedding isn't proof that people will truly love each other.

979
01:14:00,286 --> 01:14:03,566
Some people only show their true nature after a wedding.

980
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:09,406
I'm not talking about you.

981
01:14:10,006 --> 01:14:13,446
I was talking about people these days.

982
01:14:20,909 --> 01:14:23,606
We don't need to use a wedding to prove our love.

983
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:25,486
If you understand,

984
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:27,246
I don't want anything else.

985
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,560
Hi.

986
01:14:44,686 --> 01:14:45,726
Are you surprised?

987
01:14:47,685 --> 01:14:50,086
I heard you checked in to stay

988
01:14:50,198 --> 01:14:52,726
in several rooms of your app.

989
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:56,006
This is my friend's room.

990
01:14:56,246 --> 01:14:59,586
When I know you will be staying here, I...

991
01:15:01,022 --> 01:15:02,526
I prepared room service for you.

992
01:15:03,446 --> 01:15:07,326
How can I be sure that you wouldn't try to get into my room again?

993
01:15:12,886 --> 01:15:14,926
I could go in the room to surprise you,

994
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,686
but I chose to wait here

995
01:15:16,878 --> 01:15:18,095
for you.

996
01:15:43,286 --> 01:15:45,966
My friend is a steward. He is rarely in Thailand.

997
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:47,630
So, he rents out his room.

998
01:15:47,886 --> 01:15:50,526
And he hasn't lived here that much.

999
01:15:56,478 --> 01:15:58,966
When I said we're friends, that might not be the case.

1000
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:03,726
I'm his exercise trainer.

1001
01:16:20,566 --> 01:16:23,926
And my room service won't end just yet.

1002
01:16:37,257 --> 01:16:39,766
When you exercise and use your muscle incorrectly,

1003
01:16:40,446 --> 01:16:42,366
your muscles will be stiff like this.

1004
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:47,326
You should learn how to massage it to relax it.

1005
01:17:01,406 --> 01:17:04,126
If we get married and live here together,

1006
01:17:04,327 --> 01:17:05,846
do you think you can live here?

1007
01:17:07,046 --> 01:17:08,520
Why couldn't I live here?

1008
01:17:08,726 --> 01:17:10,526
I just wanted to ask.

1009
01:17:10,742 --> 01:17:13,246
In case you want to stay in a big house.

1010
01:17:14,573 --> 01:17:15,966
No way.

1011
01:17:16,414 --> 01:17:18,486
I can live anywhere

1012
01:17:18,876 --> 01:17:20,086
if there are two of us.

1013
01:17:21,509 --> 01:17:22,686
Is that true, Khim?

1014
01:17:22,878 --> 01:17:26,166
Should I let you stay here for a night as a test?

1015
01:17:28,374 --> 01:17:29,966
Please stay over tonight.

1016
01:17:30,934 --> 01:17:33,966
We're almost married. Don't worry about it too much.

1017
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:38,406
I'll go make coffee.

1018
01:17:38,542 --> 01:17:40,206
Do you want some?

1019
01:17:43,637 --> 01:17:44,806
Khim.

1020
01:17:45,742 --> 01:17:47,246
I haven't finished.

1021
01:17:47,726 --> 01:17:49,046
Why did you change the subject?

1022
01:17:57,221 --> 01:17:59,606
Lita is probably calling me.

1023
01:17:59,981 --> 01:18:02,526
I have to answer her. She's been calling me all afternoon.

1024
01:18:02,662 --> 01:18:04,886
Khim, I think it's nothing.

1025
01:18:05,086 --> 01:18:07,946
I should answer Lita's call. If not, she would be mad at me.

1026
01:18:17,289 --> 01:18:18,686
Hello, Lita.

1027
01:18:19,246 --> 01:18:22,046
Is something wrong? You called me in the afternoon.

1028
01:18:22,142 --> 01:18:24,142
(Khim, have you talked with Thaen?)

1029
01:18:24,301 --> 01:18:26,246
Did he tell you that he met me?

1030
01:18:29,446 --> 01:18:33,846
We're here together. He didn't say anything though.

1031
01:18:34,846 --> 01:18:35,846
Really?

1032
01:18:36,582 --> 01:18:39,726
And is he especially nice to you today?

1033
01:18:39,886 --> 01:18:42,086
Is he treating you much nicer than normal?

1034
01:18:48,094 --> 01:18:50,406
He cooked for me.

1035
01:18:50,949 --> 01:18:51,949
I knew it.

1036
01:18:52,446 --> 01:18:55,806
He treats you nicely to hide what he has done in the afternoon.

1037
01:18:56,766 --> 01:18:59,886
What's wrong, Lita? Why are you making it a big deal?

1038
01:19:02,961 --> 01:19:08,446
Khim, you're almost married. You should try acting like a wife for once.

1039
01:19:09,629 --> 01:19:11,366
If he's this nice to you,

1040
01:19:11,566 --> 01:19:15,166
he might be hiding something from you.

1041
01:19:15,806 --> 01:19:19,166
(You should try to see if he's hiding anything from you.)

1042
01:19:19,398 --> 01:19:20,726
(If you can't find it,)

1043
01:19:20,876 --> 01:19:23,486
don't marry him. That's all.

1044
01:19:41,486 --> 01:19:42,766
Is something wrong, Khim?

1045
01:19:56,526 --> 01:19:58,126
Your muscles are all so stiff.

1046
01:19:58,758 --> 01:20:02,326
How long haven't you exercised?

1047
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:11,886
Then, I'll massage them for you.

1048
01:21:08,718 --> 01:21:10,926
Where did you see Lita today, Thaen?

1049
01:21:12,606 --> 01:21:13,806
In the afternoon?

1050
01:21:14,278 --> 01:21:17,886
I had lunch with Dad and his client. I ran into Lita there.

1051
01:21:21,206 --> 01:21:22,646
Which client?

1052
01:21:27,517 --> 01:21:29,926
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

1053
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:33,926
By the way...

1054
01:21:35,086 --> 01:21:38,046
Are you going to stay with me tonight?

1055
01:21:58,614 --> 01:22:01,166
Is someone staying in the room beside yours now?

1056
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:04,566
You said he hasn't lived there that much.

1057
01:22:07,558 --> 01:22:09,046
Khim, don't change the subject.

1058
01:22:12,206 --> 01:22:13,966
If you aren't ready to stay with me,

1059
01:22:14,526 --> 01:22:15,926
you can just tell me.

1060
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,846
I...

1061
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:28,950
I...

1062
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:52,366
I boiled the water and forgot to turn on the cooker hood.

1063
01:22:52,486 --> 01:22:53,606
It's alright, Khim.

1064
01:23:00,346 --> 01:23:01,606
Khim, come here.

1065
01:23:06,758 --> 01:23:08,526
Please send the worker to us.

1066
01:23:10,886 --> 01:23:12,086
Yes. Thank you.

1067
01:23:18,946 --> 01:23:20,287
What's going on?

1068
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:22,846
I almost got my prey.

1069
01:23:24,182 --> 01:23:27,478
The smoke probably reached the detector, but I already turned it off.

1070
01:23:49,664 --> 01:23:52,446
Oh. You're staying here?

1071
01:23:52,599 --> 01:23:54,406
I just learned that you're staying here.

1072
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:57,846
The alarm that went off earlier was...

1073
01:23:58,476 --> 01:24:01,691
It's me. I boiled water and forgot about it.

1074
01:24:01,806 --> 01:24:03,966
There's probably nothing anymore.

1075
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:06,446
What's going on?

1076
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:11,326
Prim?

1077
01:24:21,141 --> 01:24:22,566
How did you get here?

1078
01:24:22,755 --> 01:24:24,406
Probably the same reason as yours.

1079
01:24:24,606 --> 01:24:27,646
The smoke detector went off because you were enjoying yourself, right?

1080
01:24:31,152 --> 01:24:35,366
Don't be too extreme next time. You're causing trouble to this building.

1081
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:41,686
It's safe now. The detector is off.

1082
01:24:41,965 --> 01:24:42,965
Thank you.

1083
01:24:45,174 --> 01:24:46,646
I'm sorry for bothering you.

1084
01:25:31,766 --> 01:25:33,766
I want to rest. You should go back.

1085
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,461
You're going to leave me like this?

1086
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:05,046
When did those two know each other?

1087
01:26:28,389 --> 01:26:30,966
(I won't be back home tonight.)

1088
01:26:31,246 --> 01:26:32,446
Look at her.

1089
01:26:32,983 --> 01:26:34,377
She's quick at this.

1090
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:07,926
(It's time for the second round.)

1091
01:27:17,909 --> 01:27:20,286
(I'll eat some clean food tonight.)

1092
01:27:20,486 --> 01:27:22,446
(It might be good for my health.)

1093
01:27:31,518 --> 01:27:32,766
You haven't gone back?

1094
01:27:33,246 --> 01:27:34,526
Can I go in with you?

1095
01:28:04,557 --> 01:28:07,006
A woman like Saikhim doesn't deserve good love.

1096
01:28:07,166 --> 01:28:10,806
You watch your man all day long. Are you afraid that he might get away?

1097
01:28:11,021 --> 01:28:14,606
I'm afraid he might only come back when it's convenient for him like you.

1098
01:28:14,855 --> 01:28:16,855
Don't tell me you're here to see Kaokla?

1099
01:28:16,974 --> 01:28:18,214
And so what?

1100
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:19,645
Are you jealous?

1101
01:28:19,812 --> 01:28:21,448
We can use this as evidence to say

1102
01:28:21,734 --> 01:28:23,766
that someone's using his app for prostitution.

1103
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:26,646
Deal with this father and daughter.

1104
01:28:26,861 --> 01:28:29,926
If you can't do it, I'll have to do it myself.

1105
01:28:30,141 --> 01:28:31,366
Show your true nature.

1106
01:28:31,629 --> 01:28:33,166
Stop acting already.

1107
01:28:33,341 --> 01:28:36,686
I'm starting to wonder whether you're worried about Saikhim.

1108
01:28:36,886 --> 01:28:38,046
No.

1109
01:28:38,326 --> 01:28:40,326
I don't care about those people.

1110
01:28:40,541 --> 01:28:41,926
Keep your eye on them.

1111
01:28:42,181 --> 01:28:44,526
I have to know what their relationship is.
