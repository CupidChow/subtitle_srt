1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,142
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,223 --> 00:00:02,326
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,407 --> 00:00:03,556
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:44,726
It's not an award.

5
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:46,326
It's a punishment for both of us.

6
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:47,702
If you want to get back at me,

7
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:49,458
don't drag anyone else involved.

8
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:51,444
- Ms. Rarin. - Rarin?

9
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:53,846
Everyone said you're dead, Mom.

10
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,006
Your dad forbade us from meeting each other.

11
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,886
Can you explain what the heck is going on?

12
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:02,046
She was the one who left me and you first.

13
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:03,686
Do you want me to feel sad?

14
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:05,966
If that's so, you've succeeded.

15
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:07,271
I'm hurt. Are you satisfied now?

16
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,326
- Let's divorce. - Transfer your share of the hotel

17
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:10,989
if you want to get a divorce to get married.

18
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:14,806
Did you want to flirt with your man? I'm sorry. You got the wrong one.

19
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:18,766
I don't know what happened between you and him.

20
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:23,246
But I think it's good that you're trying to keep your distance from him.

21
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,286
(The difference...)

22
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:30,446
(If we hate them, we still care about them.)

23
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:32,406
(If we don't love them,)

24
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,326
(even if we see their faces,)

25
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,086
(we won't feel anything.)

26
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:38,526
(I want to see his wish come true)

27
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:41,046
(to prove that we don't feel anything for each other.)

28
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:54,206
- Hello? - (Do you know your dad called me to visit him?)

29
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,646
He's worried about the corruption investigation.

30
00:03:58,126 --> 00:03:59,126
Really?

31
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:02,766
And is your divorce getting any better?

32
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:05,406
(Did he use your dad's case to negotiate with you?)

33
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:08,086
It's not getting better.

34
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,766
It won't be easy either.

35
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:12,206
What? What would you do now?

36
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:14,086
If he wants to play dirty,

37
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,806
I'll use the same trick as him.

38
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:22,965
Hello?

39
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:38,646
How did it get here?

40
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,446
Mom.

41
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:43,526
- Mom! - Hey.

42
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:45,086
What's wrong?

43
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,686
Where did you get this award?

44
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:51,086
Oh. Saikhim's boyfriend sent it to us.

45
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:54,406
But you broke it. Thank goodness they fixed it for you.

46
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:04,526
- But Mr. Sin told you to accept... - I said I didn't want it!

47
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:06,726
Tell him to go to hell!

48
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,206
Thaenthai knows I want it, so he sent it to us.

49
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:14,046
This album,

50
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,406
he sent it to me as a gift to show it to everyone.

51
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:18,766
He said

52
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:20,446
he wanted me

53
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,286
to be proud of you.

54
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,046
(I understand now)

55
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,446
(why Saikhim chose to marry this boyfriend.)

56
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,566
(Because he's cute and nice.)

57
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:39,326
(When he saw me feeling sad I wasn't invited to the event,)

58
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,006
(he sent photos)

59
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:42,966
(and videos that he took himself)

60
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:44,766
(to me to console me.)

61
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:47,177
Where are you going? Go and accept the award.

62
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:48,926
This way, please.

63
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,846
Congratulations.

64
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,526
Now, we'll take some photos. Please give her another round of applause.

65
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,286
(I started to feel it's a waste.)

66
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:08,286
(I really want this kind of son-in-law.)

67
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:09,686
(Why?)

68
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,446
(What has Saikhim done in her past life? She's so lucky.)

69
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,366
Why is your daughter so pathetic like this?

70
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:53,966
Oun.

71
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:55,358
Oun.

72
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:57,766
Ms. Khim, you're back.

73
00:06:57,894 --> 00:07:00,326
Are you hungry? Have you eaten anything?

74
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:02,966
I have already eaten.

75
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,246
- And why... - Oun, please go to bed.

76
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,006
Don't worry about me.

77
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:10,366
Yes.

78
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:40,046
Ms. Khim, do you need something? Why didn't you call me?

79
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:44,126
I just came to see if you're already asleep.

80
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,726
I want to hear your snoring before I go to sleep.

81
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:51,286
Ms. Khim...

82
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,606
I saw my mom today.

83
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,326
She came with her new daughter.

84
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:09,846
I'm jealous that they look so close together.

85
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:17,646
I want to brag to them that I still have Oun when Mom has a new daughter.

86
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:30,646
I shouldn't have felt sad

87
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,286
that someone took my mom from me.

88
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:38,846
Because I also took you from your child.

89
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,686
Thank you for staying with me.

90
00:08:43,197 --> 00:08:45,086
Although I don't have everything,

91
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:49,446
you haven't made me feel like I lack anything.

92
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:54,366
I'm already so fortunate that I have you.

93
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,406
Please greet her.

94
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:16,806
- Hello. - Hello.

95
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:19,406
- This way. - Go inside first.

96
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,166
Listen.

97
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:23,046
That girl,

98
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,686
Carl found her for me.

99
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:28,566
She helped me type out my recipe book.

100
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:31,126
They're volunteers.

101
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,006
They work for me

102
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:35,406
in exchange for my food.

103
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:37,982
They haven't really had any

104
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:39,366
balanced meals.

105
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:41,086
Look at that.

106
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:44,462
That boy. He's cutting the grass.

107
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:46,582
He also came here to help me

108
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:49,446
in exchange for one meal of food.

109
00:09:49,574 --> 00:09:53,046
Honestly, I think the Arsa app that Carl did

110
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,470
is really good.

111
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:58,886
It made my life much easier.

112
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:00,726
They said that

113
00:10:00,838 --> 00:10:04,206
technology will make people unkind.

114
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:06,046
I don't think it's true.

115
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,206
I'll readily argue with that.

116
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:13,206
This app can make society much better.

117
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:15,166
I think

118
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:18,406
Carl is really talented.

119
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,566
He can think of anything.

120
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:22,806
I really want to praise him.

121
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:25,726
But everyone who came here,

122
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:28,526
they all want something in return.

123
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:29,886
Yes.

124
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:33,526
Carl came here to work at that table every day.

125
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,566
I like that too.

126
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:38,726
It feels like he's here to accompany me.

127
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,326
And I don't feel lonely.

128
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:42,966
It's nice, isn't it?

129
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:44,686
What if one day

130
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:47,686
he doesn't just want to work here?

131
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,246
What if he's here to make money?

132
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:54,446
How would he make money? I don't understand.

133
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,966
I have to go back to my meeting.

134
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:59,206
I'll study with you later.

135
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:03,286
Sure. Then, you should take this back with you.

136
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:06,726
I'll ask Chor to pack it up for you in a moment.

137
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:08,446
- Chor. - Yes.

138
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:10,006
Come here.

139
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:13,005
Take all of these

140
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:15,646
and pack it up. Make it pretty.

141
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,486
- Be quick too. - Of course.

142
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:20,086
Make it pretty, alright?

143
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,806
I want you to see the truth.

144
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:35,246
I'm sorry that I have to do this.

145
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:46,085
Chor.

146
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:49,086
- It's done. - Hey.

147
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:51,606
- You're so slow. - Here you are.

148
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,886
Here you are.

149
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:58,286
You should try these desserts you made yourself.

150
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:00,512
Here. Goodbye.

151
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:02,366
Yes. See you later.

152
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,886
Wait.

153
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:06,566
Did someone forget something here?

154
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:11,566
What?

155
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,046
What?

156
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,126
Oh, this is probably from Carl.

157
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:19,606
They'll come back to get it.

158
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:21,166
Excuse me.

159
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:27,486
But this is the plan for our house.

160
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,532
Let me see.

161
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:01,966
Is this yours, Carl?

162
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:07,166
Where did you get it?

163
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:08,352
Don't ask us.

164
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:09,846
You come here every day

165
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,886
because you want to use this place for your hotel, right?

166
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:15,766
- It's not like that. - How isn't it like that?

167
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:19,086
I thought you came here because you were good-willed.

168
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,213
In the end, you want good money.

169
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:24,606
That's why you helped us with the expropriation issue.

170
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:27,236
Chor.

171
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:34,286
If you want this plot of land

172
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,126
to make it your hotel,

173
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:37,806
I'll gladly give it to you.

174
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,206
Lady.

175
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,526
What? Stay still.

176
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:46,766
But I have to ask you to wait for me to die first.

177
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:48,886
When I die,

178
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:50,387
give me that.

179
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:53,526
I can write my will

180
00:13:53,654 --> 00:13:56,166
to give this plot of land and this house

181
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:57,686
to you.

182
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:01,526
Because I don't have any descendants anyway.

183
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:04,726
But I'll ask you one thing.

184
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:06,766
I want you

185
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:08,822
to share your money from the hotel

186
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:11,806
with Chor sometimes.

187
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,566
Who would want your money, Lady?

188
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:16,366
Come on.

189
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:21,286
I didn't want to take your house.

190
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:25,326
Carl.

191
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,566
I want to give it to you.

192
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,571
I know that

193
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:33,046
you know how valuable this plot of land is.

194
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:36,046
You can use it to bring benefits to society.

195
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,846
If it's someone else,

196
00:14:38,046 --> 00:14:39,811
I won't trust them.

197
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,446
Think of this as my final words for you.

198
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:45,446
I don't care about my house that much,

199
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:47,646
but I'm worried about one thing.

200
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:50,286
I'm worried about Chor.

201
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:52,326
Just a moment.

202
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:54,446
Come on.

203
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,526
If it's here, is it because of that day...

204
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:04,806
Let him read it. I want the answer by today.

205
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,366
I tried to find this plan all day long.

206
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,006
I thought I had lost it. It's here instead.

207
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:14,446
It might be because you're delaying your divorce.

208
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:22,966
I think you should agree to the term that she sent you

209
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:25,806
before our Lady transfers the share and company back.

210
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:28,166
She did this much?

211
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:35,726
If she wants to expose us that much,

212
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:38,006
I'll expose our marriage certificate.

213
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,846
Khem, do it.

214
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:47,086
We're busy today. Sorry.

215
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:48,606
Hey, why are you in a hurry?

216
00:15:48,726 --> 00:15:49,893
Won't you say hi to me?

217
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:51,846
Next time then. It's urgent today.

218
00:15:51,957 --> 00:15:53,646
- Hey, stop. - Let go.

219
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:58,126
- Hey, you're too much. - You did this first, Saikhim.

220
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:03,806
Hey.

221
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:08,846
Why are they in a hurry?

222
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:21,486
The divorce agreement.

223
00:16:21,785 --> 00:16:23,766
Do you know that both of them

224
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,326
have registered their marriage?

225
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:27,246
We thought he was already dead,

226
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:29,061
so we stopped caring about it.

227
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,566
Who made this document?

228
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:34,566
I think Ms. Khim asked the lawyer, as she didn't consult with me.

229
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,566
If those two are still legally married,

230
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,846
Khim can't get married.

231
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:43,606
That's why she has to divorce secretly.

232
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:45,686
Divorce secretly...

233
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:48,406
Without demanding anything in return?

234
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:51,966
No.

235
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:54,877
He was the one who got me charged with corruption.

236
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:57,797
I have to get back at him.

237
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,566
What if he demands something back?

238
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:02,966
When we compare it, he has more to give us.

239
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,910
Even that historic house

240
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:07,326
can come back to us,

241
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,821
if we want it.

242
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:10,726
Ms. Khim is back.

243
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:13,526
Mr. Thaenthai would also like to see you.

244
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:18,806
I'm here to ask for Khim's hand in marriage.

245
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,846
We agree that we'll marry within the next six months.

246
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:27,886
So, I would like to ask you about the dowry first.

247
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,166
I'm also thinking about that.

248
00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:33,166
I've raised my daughter on my own.

249
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:35,086
For my daughter,

250
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,566
I don't think 200 million baht is too much.

251
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:38,966
Two hundred million?

252
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:44,726
Are you joking, Dad?

253
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:47,806
Your marriage has to match your status.

254
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,646
Right?

255
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:52,766
Dad.

256
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,006
Two hundred million isn't too expensive,

257
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:58,486
compare it with your opportunity that might be gone.

258
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:03,366
I believe that someone can give me more than this.

259
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:11,966
He said it like he didn't want to give you to me.

260
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,326
It's not that, Thaen.

261
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:18,126
Did I offend him in some ways, Khim?

262
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:19,566
Is it...

263
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,566
Is he offended that

264
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:24,126
I didn't bring my parents to ask for your hand?

265
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:25,646
I'm already a grown-up.

266
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,526
I don't have to wait for my dad to give me to someone.

267
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:31,846
Although Dad doesn't like it, I'll marry you.

268
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,766
I'll find a way to make a deal with him.

269
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:39,446
I don't want you to get into a fight with him.

270
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:45,526
I think you should wait for when my dad's mood is better.

271
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:48,046
I'm leaving.

272
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:03,086
What are you trying to do?

273
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:04,846
Don't you want me to get married?

274
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:06,286
How could you marry him

275
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:08,326
when you haven't divorced Kaokla?

276
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:12,926
How did you know?

277
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:15,107
Don't tell me he told you?

278
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,846
How could you hide something this big from me?

279
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:23,086
Because I caused this problem myself.

280
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:25,766
So, I'll be the one to fix it.

281
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:32,238
I'm going to negotiate our divorce with him.

282
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,526
Negotiate what?

283
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:36,126
To divorce him for nothing? Where is the negotiation?

284
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:38,846
Your life was almost ruined because of him.

285
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:42,086
You should get some matrimonial properties as compensation at least.

286
00:19:48,406 --> 00:19:51,006
When you said the 200 million baht was an opportunity cost,

287
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:54,126
it's money that you're trying to get from him, wasn't it?

288
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:57,526
Do you think he'll give it to me?

289
00:19:58,046 --> 00:19:59,446
He's this stingy.

290
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:02,286
We've offended him countless times.

291
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,414
If he won't give it to you, don't divorce.

292
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:06,126
Continue to leech off him.

293
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,526
You said you hated that he would leech off us.

294
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,166
But now, you're sending me to suck up his money?

295
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:14,446
I can't help it.

296
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:16,166
He doesn't know his place.

297
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:17,846
Serves him right.

298
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:20,046
I'll marry Thaen.

299
00:20:24,886 --> 00:20:27,846
I'll never let this matter get in the way of our wedding.

300
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:32,006
The fact that you're dating Thaenthai while you haven't divorced Kaokla

301
00:20:32,134 --> 00:20:34,134
means you've been deceiving him.

302
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:36,366
You're betraying him.

303
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,053
We don't even know whether after the problem is cleared,

304
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:41,366
would he be able to accept your past?

305
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,686
Kaokla...

306
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:45,806
You've seen everything about him.

307
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,286
You have nothing to lose.

308
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:49,326
I'll divorce.

309
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:54,606
I can't stand living in this world with that man anymore.

310
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:11,606
Here.

311
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:16,206
The new divorce contract

312
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:18,166
asks for matrimonial properties.

313
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:20,206
Now, she wants everything.

314
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:23,526
She really wants to stoop so low.

315
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:27,046
We have to pay her back if she wants this much.

316
00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:33,166
Go call her to see me.

317
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,286
Tell her we have to end it by today.

318
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,526
You said you didn't care,

319
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:47,693
but you actually want everything?

320
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:50,166
I know nothing.

321
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:54,406
Kla asked me to tell you that if you want to divorce,

322
00:21:54,852 --> 00:21:56,093
come talk with him.

323
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:57,886
If not, go sue him.

324
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:00,166
I'll go to talk with him.

325
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:16,246
Is your work done?

326
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,686
Should we go out?

327
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:23,246
Well, I have an urgent meeting with the hotel association.

328
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:25,126
I can't go with you, Thaen.

329
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:29,086
But we agreed that we would announce our marriage.

330
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:31,206
What would I do if you don't go?

331
00:22:32,806 --> 00:22:35,966
After I'm done, I'll go to you as quickly as possible.

332
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:38,606
It's really important.

333
00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:43,766
Khim, I'll wait for you at the restaurant then.

334
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,486
Yes.

335
00:22:56,102 --> 00:22:58,126
How did you find this place?

336
00:23:08,036 --> 00:23:09,526
It used to be a garage.

337
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:12,406
I decorate it to be temporary accommodation.

338
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:14,446
I can rent it out later.

339
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,917
It looks cool.

340
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:25,086
I think your taste is unique.

341
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:30,046
Do you think you can stay here?

342
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:32,566
If you can stay here, I can stay here too.

343
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:38,086
But I have bad news to tell you.

344
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,726
Mom has urgent work.

345
00:23:40,822 --> 00:23:43,086
She can't help you to take photos for the recipe book.

346
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:44,966
She said she's going back tomorrow.

347
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:46,782
You aren't upset with her, right?

348
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:50,926
It looks like your mom doesn't like me that much.

349
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:53,717
Usually, Mom is easier to talk to than this.

350
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:55,606
I don't know why she's like this.

351
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,206
We should do this.

352
00:23:57,526 --> 00:23:59,286
We should send off my mom tonight.

353
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:03,446
You must get on her good side before you can't see her anymore.

354
00:24:03,606 --> 00:24:04,806
Tonight?

355
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:11,166
What? You won't come tonight?

356
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:13,046
Okay.

357
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:15,886
You should handle your divorce first.

358
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:21,126
Yes. Thaen is here.

359
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:22,829
Don't worry.

360
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:24,726
I'll handle this for you.

361
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:39,486
Does he have another dirty trick?

362
00:24:49,374 --> 00:24:50,486
Lita.

363
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:52,006
Lita.

364
00:24:52,102 --> 00:24:53,446
Did Khim tell you where she is?

365
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:56,366
No. I thought I would meet Khim here.

366
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,886
I thought the toilet is here.

367
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:09,886
I need to go to the toilet.

368
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:23,246
Please call Khim. I want to know whether she'll answer your call.

369
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:37,406
She's not answering.

370
00:25:38,966 --> 00:25:40,686
Khim has been acting strange.

371
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:43,166
She looks like she's hiding something.

372
00:25:43,382 --> 00:25:44,686
How am I related to this?

373
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:46,966
You should blame yourself for that.

374
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:51,566
Mr. Ton, the customers forgot something.

375
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:57,606
Get in. Get in first.

376
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:05,086
Be quiet, Lita. Ton is outside.

377
00:26:05,238 --> 00:26:08,006
I don't want him to think we're talking secretly here.

378
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:12,526
Be quiet.

379
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,806
Let's go out.

380
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:55,646
Are you drunk?

381
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:22,686
I'm here for our divorce.

382
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:24,526
You said you didn't want anything.

383
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,246
What is this document demanding several million baht?

384
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:31,846
That's the document my dad sent to you.

385
00:27:32,126 --> 00:27:35,766
I know nothing of it. I'm here to assure you that I'll divorce for nothing.

386
00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:40,086
You can refuse several million baht

387
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:42,046
just to marry that man.

388
00:27:42,237 --> 00:27:43,406
Do you love him that much?

389
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:45,806
I love him more than you.

390
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:48,326
Prove that you love him more than you love yourself.

391
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:50,606
I'll divorce you in the morning then.

392
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:53,046
How would I prove myself?

393
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:54,606
Stay here for a night.

394
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:57,806
Sleep here for a night, and we'll go our separate ways.

395
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:00,486
Do you love him so much that you're willing to stoop so low?

396
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:08,086
If you love him enough, you can abandon your own pride.

397
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:11,126
It's not related to my pride.

398
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:13,206
You love him so much that you don't want to betray him?

399
00:28:13,446 --> 00:28:14,786
Only horrible people

400
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,006
would offer this kind of filthy deal.

401
00:28:17,182 --> 00:28:19,246
Killing your own child isn't horrible then?

402
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,366
What are you talking about?

403
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:22,726
When you left me,

404
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:24,686
you dared to do everything.

405
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,446
Even betraying me.

406
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:28,166
You were horrible to me.

407
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,366
Why are you so cautious when it's another man?

408
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:33,566
What do you see me as? Do you think I'm not a human?

409
00:28:35,406 --> 00:28:37,766
How would you want me to compensate?

410
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:38,966
Tell me.

411
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:41,086
But it can't be that filthy offer.

412
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,566
When you put me in jail and got an abortion,

413
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:46,566
aside from your life, nothing can compensate for that.

414
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,606
Who said I got an abortion?

415
00:28:50,823 --> 00:28:52,486
My miscarriage

416
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,246
was an accident.

417
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:56,806
In the letter that you sent me to ask for our divorce,

418
00:28:57,246 --> 00:28:58,486
you told me

419
00:28:58,726 --> 00:29:00,766
that you couldn't stand living with a poor man like me.

420
00:29:01,317 --> 00:29:03,006
(I got an abortion a few days ago.)

421
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,406
(I can't let him be born with a father like you.)

422
00:29:05,774 --> 00:29:07,366
(I don't want to be lower than this.)

423
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:09,726
(I know we're too different from each other.)

424
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,086
You only love yourself.

425
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:14,646
You're selfish. When you couldn't divorce, you tried to kill me.

426
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,606
What are you talking about?

427
00:29:17,645 --> 00:29:18,766
Come here.

428
00:29:19,486 --> 00:29:23,006
Since you couldn't face me, you tried to kill me off.

429
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:26,326
This is the evidence.

430
00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:29,386
I kept it to remind me of how much you hated me.

431
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:32,606
When the incident happened,

432
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:34,926
you immediately signed a refusal of medical care.

433
00:29:35,285 --> 00:29:36,926
You wanted my doctor to leave me to death.

434
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:40,166
You're scared that I would expose your shame?

435
00:29:42,806 --> 00:29:43,926
What's this?

436
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,526
I've never seen this before.

437
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:47,886
Are you also saying that this was done by your dad?

438
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,286
Just admit to me that you tried to kill me

439
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:54,726
because you hated living with me.

440
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,877
You left me waiting for my death

441
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,486
to go back to being the lady Saikhim.

442
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,166
But I was fortunate and I survived.

443
00:30:03,726 --> 00:30:05,366
I knew how my wife betrayed me

444
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,726
when I was in a coma.

445
00:30:08,221 --> 00:30:09,927
You have to divorce me

446
00:30:10,063 --> 00:30:12,566
because you're afraid that your boyfriend can't accept your past deeds

447
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:14,886
that contradicts your image of an angel.

448
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:17,854
When you lied to me that you went to work in a forest

449
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:19,806
while you're doing illegal work,

450
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:21,942
- you betrayed me. - I was deceived.

451
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:25,846
Your dad told the police to arrest Khem to lure me out to help him,

452
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:28,134
so he could put me in jail.

453
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:32,286
Dad told me you sent him photos to blackmail me.

454
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:34,966
You didn't want to take responsibility.

455
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:36,806
You just wanted to blackmail Dad.

456
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,046
Everything that came from your dad

457
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,606
were all lies.

458
00:30:40,942 --> 00:30:41,942
If you believed it,

459
00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:44,766
it meant you believed that I was such a horrible person.

460
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:48,646
- So you killed me and our kid... - I don't know what is true anymore.

461
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:53,646
If you didn't lie to yourself,

462
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:55,926
you must know it in your heart

463
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:58,206
that during these seven years,

464
00:30:58,486 --> 00:31:00,246
how relieved you were when I was dead.

465
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:02,486
No.

466
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,286
There's not even a day that I didn't think of you.

467
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:17,446
I haven't seen you happy for once

468
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:19,366
when you know I was still alive.

469
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,446
I'm disgusting.

470
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:28,166
You're more disgusting than me.

471
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:30,606
You've never felt anything.

472
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:39,726
It's only for a night

473
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:42,286
and you can stay with your man for the rest of your life.

474
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:44,046
It's worth it.

475
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:47,566
I can't do this to him.

476
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:51,726
Trust me. Your skin is too thick to care.

477
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:55,526
If you hate me,

478
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:57,486
why did you bother me?

479
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:07,406
Something like this

480
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:11,846
doesn't need like or love.

481
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,886
Did you forget how we started?

482
00:32:30,077 --> 00:32:32,566
You want me to feel guilty towards Thaen all my life.

483
00:32:33,726 --> 00:32:35,526
You're trying to blackmail me.

484
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:38,846
Even if that doesn't happen,

485
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:40,926
I can still blackmail you.

486
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:43,246
Do you think you're high and mighty?

487
00:32:46,686 --> 00:32:49,926
Although I'm bad, I'm not that horrible.

488
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:09,606
You said you wanted to divorce.

489
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:11,646
Why are you hesitating?

490
00:33:12,886 --> 00:33:14,046
What are you scared of?

491
00:33:14,527 --> 00:33:15,846
We aren't children anymore.

492
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:18,806
If you feel guilty,

493
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:21,606
you must feel guilty towards me, not him.

494
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,446
If we haven't gotten a divorce,

495
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,766
we aren't doing anything wrong.

496
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,046
(Claire)

497
00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:40,566
You're the one who let this chance go. I can't help it now.

498
00:33:41,495 --> 00:33:43,086
You aren't divorcing me.

499
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,926
You just want to mock me.

500
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,810
He probably has an important errand.

501
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:08,526
Carl isn't like this, Mom.

502
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:16,646
It takes more time than this to get to know someone.

503
00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:19,846
Long-distance relationships are always like this.

504
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:24,406
I think you shouldn't tie yourself down

505
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:27,286
until you get to know this man well enough.

506
00:35:20,062 --> 00:35:21,206
I'm leaving.

507
00:35:33,877 --> 00:35:35,846
Lita is pretty heavy.

508
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:40,286
She's heavily drunk, and she's heavy herself.

509
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,606
- Slowly. - Watch your head.

510
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:47,126
Here. The address is as I sent to you.

511
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:52,126
Tell us when you've arrived at your home.

512
00:35:53,606 --> 00:35:54,606
Let's go.

513
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:57,286
She'll be home soon.

514
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:01,926
Can I really trust them?

515
00:36:20,966 --> 00:36:23,246
Miss. Miss, you're home.

516
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:24,566
Miss.

517
00:36:25,038 --> 00:36:26,206
You're home.

518
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:35,413
Excuse me.

519
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,846
I'll handle this myself.

520
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:39,806
Lita, wake up.

521
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,166
You're home.

522
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:50,720
Lita.

523
00:36:55,502 --> 00:36:56,566
Here.

524
00:36:56,661 --> 00:36:57,861
Is she your girlfriend?

525
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,148
Yes.

526
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:02,435
I'll leave her to you then.

527
00:37:02,558 --> 00:37:03,686
Yes.

528
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,686
Lita, wake up.

529
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,406
Lita.

530
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,246
Lita.

531
00:37:16,813 --> 00:37:18,206
Open your eyes, Lita.

532
00:37:18,662 --> 00:37:20,246
Why are you this wasted?

533
00:37:22,965 --> 00:37:26,056
- Let's go inside. - How did I get here?

534
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:32,019
I'm sorry.

535
00:37:32,246 --> 00:37:34,606
I didn't mean to.

536
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,806
Thaen, don't be mad at me.

537
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,566
We're home, Lita.

538
00:37:44,486 --> 00:37:45,646
Are you sure?

539
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:52,406
Thaen, you're the best.

540
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:55,070
How could I not love you when you're this nice?

541
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:58,246
What did you say?

542
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:01,806
Even when you're so nice,

543
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:04,326
Khim shouldn't have done this to you.

544
00:38:05,518 --> 00:38:08,606
I don't want you to become anyone else's man.

545
00:38:15,453 --> 00:38:16,646
Lita.

546
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:18,406
Lita, what are you doing?

547
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,446
Let's go.

548
00:38:21,404 --> 00:38:23,046
Lita, let's go inside.

549
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:39,526
(In the letter you sent me to ask for our divorce,)

550
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,646
(you told me)

551
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:44,006
(that you couldn't stand living with a poor man like me.)

552
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:49,326
(You only love yourself.)

553
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:52,606
(You're selfish. When you couldn't divorce, you tried to kill me.)

554
00:38:53,037 --> 00:38:54,246
It's your doing, right?

555
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,966
Kla. Kla!

556
00:38:56,223 --> 00:38:57,846
You framed me.

557
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,526
Don't believe him, Khim.

558
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,286
I didn't do anything wrong.

559
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:03,062
You can't arrest me.

560
00:39:03,782 --> 00:39:05,126
He wants to separate us.

561
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:06,977
I've promised Khim.

562
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:08,806
How could I break my promise?

563
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:10,324
Don't cause trouble.

564
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:11,846
- It's not your business! - Stop.

565
00:39:12,446 --> 00:39:13,686
Are you crazy?

566
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:18,486
(When the incident happened, you signed a refusal of medical care.)

567
00:39:18,726 --> 00:39:20,286
(You wanted my doctor to leave me to die.)

568
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:23,253
Are you scared that I would expose your shame?

569
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:25,246
Just admit to me

570
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,086
that you tried to kill me

571
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:29,526
because you hated living with me.

572
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:32,206
What the heck is going on?

573
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:34,006
What have I done?

574
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:46,526
If you feel guilty,

575
00:39:46,853 --> 00:39:48,166
you must feel guilty towards me,

576
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:49,446
not him.

577
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:50,846
If we haven't gotten a divorce,

578
00:39:51,606 --> 00:39:53,126
we aren't doing anything wrong.

579
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:08,206
How much do you hate me for you to do this to me?

580
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:10,318
I want to see you who can't love anyone again.

581
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:14,926
A selfish woman like you doesn't deserve love.

582
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:17,726
Ask yourself.

583
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:20,206
What did you do to your child when you were a mother?

584
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,086
What?

585
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:05,366
You can't love anyone because you only love yourself.

586
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:07,166
That's why you have no one left.

587
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:10,646
Even your dad who you think is possessive of you,

588
00:41:11,006 --> 00:41:12,566
is he sincere with you?

589
00:41:12,877 --> 00:41:14,606
He's the one who took your mom away from you

590
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,166
for only one reason. She's not worthy.

591
00:41:18,086 --> 00:41:19,486
You can see it today

592
00:41:19,902 --> 00:41:21,806
that you are the one who isn't worthy of us.

593
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:25,846
I didn't mean to.

594
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:28,686
I didn't mean to do that.

595
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,286
I didn't mean to betray you.

596
00:42:15,846 --> 00:42:17,086
Ms. Khim.

597
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:19,526
Ms. Khim.

598
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:22,926
Ms. Khim. Ms. Khim.

599
00:42:43,181 --> 00:42:44,466
Ms. Khim.

600
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,726
Ms. Khim, is something the matter?

601
00:42:49,086 --> 00:42:50,286
Ms. Khim.

602
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:02,246
Seven years ago...

603
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:05,526
Were you the one who put Kla in jail?

604
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,326
What is it this time?

605
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:13,326
When he hung himself in the prison,

606
00:43:14,366 --> 00:43:15,926
you faked my signature

607
00:43:16,206 --> 00:43:18,206
to stop his medical care.

608
00:43:18,837 --> 00:43:22,366
You used me to kill him. How could you do that?

609
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,286
I know everything.

610
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:34,046
I understand now why he said I killed him.

611
00:43:34,694 --> 00:43:36,766
You were trying to separate him from me.

612
00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:38,406
If I didn't do that,

613
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:41,566
you would probably be farming on the mountain by now.

614
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:43,646
Do you want that?

615
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:56,406
Even if my life was ruined,

616
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:58,742
it's still my life at least.

617
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,563
Even if your life was ruined? Really?

618
00:44:03,765 --> 00:44:05,846
During these seven years,

619
00:44:06,366 --> 00:44:08,286
you have this good and luxurious life

620
00:44:08,414 --> 00:44:10,786
that everyone is jealous of. Really?

621
00:44:11,564 --> 00:44:13,486
Is it my own fault now?

622
00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:20,166
Let me ask you.

623
00:44:21,108 --> 00:44:22,246
During all this time,

624
00:44:22,438 --> 00:44:24,806
how is your life not happy?

625
00:44:26,726 --> 00:44:30,206
Two days ago, you said you wanted to get married.

626
00:44:31,006 --> 00:44:32,406
Don't blame it on me.

627
00:44:33,348 --> 00:44:35,348
Even if you can exchange your life now

628
00:44:35,574 --> 00:44:37,086
with your past when you were

629
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:38,574
living with a poor husband,

630
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:39,733
I can assure you

631
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,190
that you won't exchange it.

632
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:47,486
No one knows what I want more than myself.

633
00:44:47,806 --> 00:44:49,046
It's a shame then.

634
00:44:49,878 --> 00:44:51,846
Then, don't marry Thaenthai.

635
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:53,406
If you love him that much,

636
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,086
don't divorce him.

637
00:45:03,046 --> 00:45:05,406
Is there anyone left that I can love?

638
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:08,646
Since you did that much to him.

639
00:45:09,037 --> 00:45:10,446
You're complaining to me like this.

640
00:45:11,286 --> 00:45:12,566
Were you heartbroken?

641
00:45:14,677 --> 00:45:16,566
You took everything from me.

642
00:45:16,772 --> 00:45:17,853
Both Mom,

643
00:45:18,013 --> 00:45:19,286
and Kla.

644
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:21,246
Whenever I love someone,

645
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:23,826
you always took them out of my life.

646
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:26,246
It's like you don't want me to have a love like everyone else.

647
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:27,542
Those people,

648
00:45:27,694 --> 00:45:29,366
are they worth your love?

649
00:45:31,444 --> 00:45:33,444
Don't try to teach me, Dad.

650
00:45:34,478 --> 00:45:36,166
Do you know how to love someone?

651
00:45:36,422 --> 00:45:37,846
If you really loved me,

652
00:45:38,088 --> 00:45:39,326
you wouldn't lie

653
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:40,926
or control my life.

654
00:45:41,174 --> 00:45:43,606
You wouldn't take your disappointment out on me.

655
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:46,206
You wouldn't let me become a murderer.

656
00:45:47,334 --> 00:45:48,486
Can you stop?

657
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:50,886
Do you want to try it?

658
00:45:51,725 --> 00:45:52,886
Do you want to?

659
00:45:54,966 --> 00:45:57,326
If you don't have me as your dad in your life,

660
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,846
how would you live?

661
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:02,886
Sure.

662
00:46:04,126 --> 00:46:06,286
If you don't have me,

663
00:46:06,966 --> 00:46:08,206
you're the one

664
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,486
who'll have no one left.

665
00:46:11,606 --> 00:46:12,886
Even if you go back to him,

666
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:16,446
there's no way he'll feel the same as you.

667
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,246
Khim.

668
00:46:33,006 --> 00:46:34,046
Khim!

669
00:46:35,005 --> 00:46:36,120
Khim!

670
00:46:59,726 --> 00:47:00,886
Is she your girlfriend?

671
00:47:03,146 --> 00:47:04,146
Yes.

672
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:05,530
I'll leave her to you then.

673
00:47:05,646 --> 00:47:06,766
Yes.

674
00:47:14,926 --> 00:47:16,846
I didn't mean to.

675
00:47:17,175 --> 00:47:19,686
Don't be mad at me, Thaen.

676
00:47:20,933 --> 00:47:23,326
Thaen, you're the best.

677
00:47:23,653 --> 00:47:26,126
How could I not love you when you're this nice?

678
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:39,926
Where did I keep it?

679
00:47:48,124 --> 00:47:49,566
How did I get back last night?

680
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:05,577
What?

681
00:48:20,518 --> 00:48:21,686
This way, please.

682
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:26,406
What's this?

683
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:28,446
I should be the one asking you that.

684
00:48:29,222 --> 00:48:30,406
What's this?

685
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,166
How could you do this to Saikhim?

686
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:36,206
Did you ask someone to follow me?

687
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,566
It's you

688
00:48:38,526 --> 00:48:41,046
who gave evidence to Kaokla to condemn me.

689
00:48:41,992 --> 00:48:43,526
You're challenging me.

690
00:48:44,646 --> 00:48:47,246
I don't want to get involved in your revenge game.

691
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:49,086
Why did you drag me in here?

692
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,446
I'll give you the last chance to prove yourself.

693
00:48:53,543 --> 00:48:55,846
Destroy Saikhim's wedding.

694
00:48:57,614 --> 00:48:59,406
I'll prepare a trap for Kaokla.

695
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,726
Send Saikhim to suck up their matrimonial properties.

696
00:49:03,366 --> 00:49:04,926
She won't get married,

697
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:08,286
that will be good for a traitorous best friend like you.

698
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:09,846
Last night,

699
00:49:10,142 --> 00:49:11,142
I was drunk.

700
00:49:11,223 --> 00:49:12,623
There's nothing between us.

701
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,326
I haven't thought about stealing my friend's boyfriend.

702
00:49:15,571 --> 00:49:16,626
Is that so?

703
00:49:21,406 --> 00:49:22,486
I don't think so.

704
00:49:23,366 --> 00:49:24,726
From these photos,

705
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:27,326
you were the one who seduced Thaenthai.

706
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,446
What if I don't do as you said?

707
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,806
These photos will be in Saikhim's hand.

708
00:49:37,293 --> 00:49:38,526
I don't know

709
00:49:38,765 --> 00:49:41,486
whether she can continue to have you as her friend.

710
00:49:43,206 --> 00:49:45,086
I'll confess to Khim myself

711
00:49:45,446 --> 00:49:47,046
about what happened last night.

712
00:49:47,341 --> 00:49:48,486
And so what?

713
00:49:48,812 --> 00:49:50,206
I want to know

714
00:49:53,086 --> 00:49:54,686
how you could face Thaenthai.

715
00:49:55,517 --> 00:49:56,646
Do you dare?

716
00:49:58,142 --> 00:50:00,086
Since it's come to this,

717
00:50:01,309 --> 00:50:05,806
go to the end then. Make Thaenthai give up on Saikhim.

718
00:50:06,493 --> 00:50:08,086
You'll get Thaenthai.

719
00:50:08,646 --> 00:50:09,646
Win-win.

720
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,406
Thaen doesn't love me.

721
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,446
He loves Saikhim.

722
00:50:13,606 --> 00:50:14,886
And so what?

723
00:50:16,149 --> 00:50:17,963
No matter how nice Thaenthai is,

724
00:50:18,087 --> 00:50:20,286
he isn't good enough for Saikhim.

725
00:50:20,678 --> 00:50:22,966
Khim should get someone better than this.

726
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:26,166
I'll give you two weeks.

727
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,806
Destroy Saikhim's wedding.

728
00:50:31,157 --> 00:50:33,686
If not, Saikhim will get these photos.

729
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:37,326
But Kaokla doesn't love Saikhim anymore.

730
00:50:37,566 --> 00:50:39,366
Why would you want Khim to go back?

731
00:50:41,645 --> 00:50:42,766
Love?

732
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:45,526
Can we eat love?

733
00:50:46,605 --> 00:50:48,166
Those stupid love

734
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,366
only exist in soap operas.

735
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:07,106
Mr. Songsin.

736
00:51:08,285 --> 00:51:10,086
I don't care if you hate me.

737
00:51:10,222 --> 00:51:12,183
But why would you destroy Khim's life?

738
00:51:12,365 --> 00:51:13,966
Are you still a father?

739
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:17,246
No. You don't have a heart. Heartless.

740
00:51:17,446 --> 00:51:18,725
How can you be a father?

741
00:51:18,806 --> 00:51:20,166
Please calm down.

742
00:51:20,406 --> 00:51:21,886
Mr. Songsin.

743
00:51:38,206 --> 00:51:39,446
Where have you been?

744
00:51:39,685 --> 00:51:41,205
Why did you turn off your phone?

745
00:51:41,988 --> 00:51:43,126
How did you get here?

746
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,526
I have something important to talk about with you.

747
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:47,446
About last night?

748
00:51:52,886 --> 00:51:55,606
Last night, I went to talk about my divorce with him.

749
00:51:55,889 --> 00:51:59,806
But Kaokla said I was the one who killed our child.

750
00:51:59,966 --> 00:52:01,726
Do you remember that when he was in jail,

751
00:52:02,006 --> 00:52:05,078
I asked you to tell him that I had a miscarriage?

752
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:08,486
A divorce?

753
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:12,566
He said he doesn't want anything to do with you.

754
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,366
He doesn't care anymore.

755
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:16,966
He doesn't want to explain anything.

756
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,166
No matter how you think of him,

757
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:22,766
he doesn't care now. He doesn't love you anymore.

758
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:30,526
I want to know why he said I wanted a divorce first.

759
00:52:31,461 --> 00:52:35,166
Why did he say I was the one who killed our child?

760
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:37,526
Did he tell you that?

761
00:52:39,749 --> 00:52:41,749
When I wrote the letter to him,

762
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:45,046
I said I would even wait for him.

763
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:48,246
He's the one who broke up with me first.

764
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:49,966
Do you remember it?

765
00:52:52,206 --> 00:52:54,326
Your letter didn't reach him.

766
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:00,566
What do you mean?

767
00:53:02,086 --> 00:53:03,606
The letter you wrote

768
00:53:03,926 --> 00:53:05,646
was swapped before that.

769
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:09,366
I learned later that your dad took the real letter.

770
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,166
The letter he read

771
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,397
was the one that your dad wrote.

772
00:53:14,726 --> 00:53:16,446
Why didn't you tell me?

773
00:53:17,181 --> 00:53:18,886
I also learned about this later.

774
00:53:19,189 --> 00:53:22,246
The one Kaokla read wasn't the one I had in my hand.

775
00:53:23,382 --> 00:53:24,566
You knew...

776
00:53:25,398 --> 00:53:27,046
Why didn't you tell me?

777
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:29,566
I want you to give up on that man.

778
00:53:34,446 --> 00:53:35,846
When he said

779
00:53:36,606 --> 00:53:38,006
he has stopped loving me...

780
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:40,646
He didn't say it.

781
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:44,366
I said it to make you give up on him.

782
00:53:46,686 --> 00:53:47,766
Why?

783
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,646
Your dad...

784
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:52,926
Your dad would send me to study with you in England.

785
00:53:54,726 --> 00:53:56,357
If I could separate you and him...

786
00:54:04,983 --> 00:54:07,446
Do you know what you have done?

787
00:54:08,606 --> 00:54:11,366
Khim, Kaokla isn't suitable for you.

788
00:54:12,846 --> 00:54:15,286
I didn't want your future to be ruined because of him.

789
00:54:17,806 --> 00:54:19,486
Are we still friends?

790
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,166
Why did you betray me like that?

791
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,830
Khim.

792
00:54:25,926 --> 00:54:27,806
We shouldn't fight because of this man.

793
00:54:28,462 --> 00:54:29,486
Khim.

794
00:54:30,246 --> 00:54:31,366
Khim.

795
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:33,166
- Khim. - Khim.

796
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:34,886
Wait, Lita.

797
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:37,086
What's with Khim?

798
00:54:37,422 --> 00:54:38,686
What did you tell Khim?

799
00:54:39,686 --> 00:54:41,166
Did you talk about last night?

800
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,126
Khim.

801
00:54:46,926 --> 00:54:47,966
Khim.

802
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:49,486
Khim.

803
00:54:51,461 --> 00:54:52,766
What's going on?

804
00:54:53,046 --> 00:54:54,166
Why did you fight?

805
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:57,246
She treated me like I wasn't her friend.

806
00:54:57,526 --> 00:54:59,006
You're talking about last night?

807
00:55:00,222 --> 00:55:01,526
What did she tell you?

808
00:55:02,006 --> 00:55:03,086
Khim.

809
00:55:06,206 --> 00:55:07,686
If she's really my friend,

810
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,564
she wouldn't do anything behind my back.

811
00:55:09,693 --> 00:55:11,693
She wouldn't hurt me like this.

812
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:14,566
After all this time,

813
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:16,726
she's never been sincere with me.

814
00:55:17,749 --> 00:55:18,789
Khim.

815
00:55:19,773 --> 00:55:21,373
Why did you do this, Lita?

816
00:55:21,678 --> 00:55:22,843
Why did you tell Khim?

817
00:55:22,982 --> 00:55:24,086
What are you saying?

818
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,526
Last night. You know that I didn't feel anything for you.

819
00:55:26,855 --> 00:55:29,966
I have a woman whom I love and we're getting married.

820
00:55:30,366 --> 00:55:31,606
Why did you do this?

821
00:56:05,686 --> 00:56:08,262
(Make Thaenthai give up on Saikhim.)

822
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,166
(You'll get Thaenthai.)

823
00:56:10,766 --> 00:56:11,966
(Win-win.)

824
00:56:15,189 --> 00:56:16,966
(Are we still friends?)

825
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:19,406
(Why did you betray me like that?)

826
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:27,326
(Last night. You know that I didn't feel anything for you.)

827
00:56:27,637 --> 00:56:30,366
(I have a woman whom I love and we're getting married.)

828
00:56:46,246 --> 00:56:48,406
I didn't think I would run into you here.

829
00:56:50,126 --> 00:56:53,046
We haven't met each other before, but I know Carl,

830
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,566
your boyfriend.

831
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,166
Are you Carl's friend?

832
00:56:56,926 --> 00:56:59,686
I don't know whether we are friends.

833
00:57:00,013 --> 00:57:04,566
I just want to warn you. I don't want to see you sad.

834
00:57:05,806 --> 00:57:07,206
Why would I be sad?

835
00:57:10,324 --> 00:57:11,446
Well...

836
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:16,606
I don't want you to think about this too much,

837
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:19,582
but this is really a big deal.

838
00:57:19,726 --> 00:57:24,726
You should know. Because it's about Carl's old wife.

839
00:57:26,806 --> 00:57:29,406
Do you know that Carl...

840
00:57:31,086 --> 00:57:32,406
Carl was married?

841
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,046
Carl was married?

842
00:57:34,254 --> 00:57:35,766
Not just "was".

843
00:57:36,189 --> 00:57:38,846
He's still married to her. They haven't divorced.

844
00:57:39,326 --> 00:57:40,526
Impossible.

845
00:57:40,886 --> 00:57:42,286
Why would I lie to you?

846
00:57:42,446 --> 00:57:43,926
I mean you well.

847
00:57:44,326 --> 00:57:46,126
I don't want you to become an idiot.

848
00:57:46,406 --> 00:57:49,726
Carl's old wife is pretty famous and high-class.

849
00:57:49,918 --> 00:57:51,566
Carl is probably deceiving you.

850
00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:54,206
You have fully trusted him all the time, right?

851
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,206
Where were you last night?

852
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,206
Did you forget our appointment?

853
00:58:07,606 --> 00:58:08,966
I had an errand.

854
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:11,286
A conference with an American company.

855
00:58:11,742 --> 00:58:13,406
I was here. I didn't go anywhere.

856
00:58:14,511 --> 00:58:16,166
Didn't you think of calling me?

857
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:20,006
Why do you need to be so serious about this?

858
00:58:31,629 --> 00:58:33,966
Whose is this? Why is it here?

859
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:35,646
What are you hiding from me?

860
00:58:35,886 --> 00:58:37,806
Do you have someone else behind my back?

861
00:58:38,334 --> 00:58:39,886
I just saw it with you.

862
00:58:40,733 --> 00:58:42,486
This is your wife's stuff, right?

863
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:46,086
You're already married and this is your wife's lipstick.

864
00:58:46,286 --> 00:58:47,526
Who told you?

865
00:58:49,046 --> 00:58:50,526
It's your stare.

866
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:52,926
How could you keep something this big from me?

867
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:56,485
I haven't divorced her,

868
00:58:56,926 --> 00:58:58,926
but we're through since a long time ago.

869
00:59:00,678 --> 00:59:02,246
And whose lipstick is this?

870
00:59:03,869 --> 00:59:07,286
You date me to hide from your wife's sight.

871
00:59:07,526 --> 00:59:10,966
It was good for you when I was traveling. That's why

872
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:13,366
Mom warned me to be cautious of you.

873
00:59:13,566 --> 00:59:15,526
I can't believe you lied to me.

874
00:59:16,246 --> 00:59:18,206
Why are you so cruel to me?

875
00:59:24,286 --> 00:59:25,286
Claire.

876
00:59:25,497 --> 00:59:26,497
Claire.

877
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:37,966
Your mom will go back today.

878
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:39,806
I want you to say farewell to her,

879
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:42,206
as we don't know if you'll have a chance to see her again.

880
00:59:47,446 --> 00:59:50,246
We should put off other things for now.

881
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:58,046
I understand that you're having a problem with Carl.

882
00:59:58,526 --> 01:00:01,726
But if you need any help, you can tell me.

883
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:04,446
I'm ready to handle everything.

884
01:00:05,646 --> 01:00:10,046
What I've done to him is worse than this.

885
01:00:10,382 --> 01:00:14,006
I don't know who caused everything to happen,

886
01:00:20,526 --> 01:00:22,646
but I'm on your side, Khim.

887
01:00:27,284 --> 01:00:28,526
Thank you.

888
01:00:31,302 --> 01:00:32,526
I...

889
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,806
I have no one left.

890
01:00:38,126 --> 01:00:40,046
Everyone who is around me...

891
01:00:40,789 --> 01:00:42,166
I feel...

892
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:45,686
I feel like I don't know their real sides.

893
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:50,126
That's good.

894
01:00:50,846 --> 01:00:52,606
You don't have to care about anyone.

895
01:00:53,766 --> 01:00:55,766
You should only care about your feelings.

896
01:00:56,966 --> 01:00:58,446
I understand now

897
01:00:59,366 --> 01:01:01,886
why you had chosen to get out of Dad's life.

898
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:06,686
We can love someone,

899
01:01:06,926 --> 01:01:08,726
but it might not be good to stay with them.

900
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:10,806
If you can understand this,

901
01:01:11,221 --> 01:01:12,766
when you love someone,

902
01:01:13,077 --> 01:01:14,846
you won't force yourself.

903
01:01:15,206 --> 01:01:18,606
But when you don't get to stay with the one you love,

904
01:01:18,845 --> 01:01:21,166
it doesn't mean you have to hate them.

905
01:01:28,899 --> 01:01:30,286
I'm glad

906
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:34,526
that you have a good boyfriend now.

907
01:01:37,446 --> 01:01:38,566
Last night...

908
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:40,366
You didn't go to work last night.

909
01:01:40,686 --> 01:01:42,006
I just learned

910
01:01:42,342 --> 01:01:45,526
that Dad faked some documents and it caused problems for me.

911
01:01:46,126 --> 01:01:47,926
Lita also knew about this.

912
01:01:48,644 --> 01:01:51,406
Lita only confessed that to you?

913
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:54,446
It's already a long time ago.

914
01:01:54,781 --> 01:01:58,726
Lita told me she did it because she wanted to continue studying with us.

915
01:01:58,909 --> 01:02:01,206
(Last night. You know that I didn't feel anything for you.)

916
01:02:01,462 --> 01:02:02,846
(I have a woman whom I love)

917
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:04,526
and we're getting married.

918
01:02:04,631 --> 01:02:05,870
Why did you do this?

919
01:02:18,806 --> 01:02:19,806
Aunt.

920
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,910
Are you going to the airport?

921
01:02:22,017 --> 01:02:24,726
Yes. Claire called me and said she couldn't drive me there.

922
01:02:24,814 --> 01:02:27,326
I don't know if something happened. She suddenly disappeared.

923
01:02:28,926 --> 01:02:33,286
But when she called me, her voice didn't sound good. I'm worried.

924
01:02:35,446 --> 01:02:36,966
Please put the luggage in the car.

925
01:02:37,438 --> 01:02:38,726
That's Claire.

926
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,166
Should we do it like this?

927
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:47,646
We should let Thaen drive you there.

928
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,806
I'll wait for Ms. Claire here.

929
01:02:50,029 --> 01:02:51,966
I'll call you as soon as there's something.

930
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,286
Thanks.

931
01:02:56,646 --> 01:02:57,886
I'm leaving.

932
01:02:59,046 --> 01:03:00,206
Let's go.

933
01:03:19,486 --> 01:03:21,766
I can't let my mom see me like this.

934
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:24,086
She would be too worried and won't go back.

935
01:03:24,294 --> 01:03:25,566
Ms. Claire...

936
01:03:26,446 --> 01:03:28,486
Did something bad happen?

937
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,886
Have you ever been deceived by your close ones?

938
01:03:31,286 --> 01:03:34,526
I was deceived so badly that I couldn't trust anyone anymore.

939
01:03:34,806 --> 01:03:36,046
Yes, I have.

940
01:03:36,509 --> 01:03:37,726
Every time they lied,

941
01:03:37,934 --> 01:03:41,486
they claimed that they meant well, that it was for me.

942
01:03:48,894 --> 01:03:50,406
Carl lied to me.

943
01:03:51,606 --> 01:03:53,366
He's already married.

944
01:03:54,766 --> 01:03:56,446
They were together last night.

945
01:04:02,935 --> 01:04:04,598
How did you know?

946
01:04:05,229 --> 01:04:06,828
I caught his lie.

947
01:04:06,941 --> 01:04:09,326
He also said he wouldn't divorce.

948
01:04:10,846 --> 01:04:12,086
Is that true?

949
01:04:12,597 --> 01:04:14,806
Mom tried to warn me several times.

950
01:04:15,486 --> 01:04:17,486
I didn't think it would be this bad.

951
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:20,486
He said they didn't live together.

952
01:04:21,766 --> 01:04:23,806
Every man says something like that.

953
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,686
Am I that stupid

954
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:28,126
to not realize that he moved here to live with his wife?

955
01:04:32,156 --> 01:04:34,366
What kind of a woman would let that man go?

956
01:04:40,182 --> 01:04:42,526
I think she's trying to keep him.

957
01:05:48,526 --> 01:05:51,406
It's too late if you come here for that.

958
01:05:53,414 --> 01:05:55,766
I want us to talk like adults.

959
01:05:55,982 --> 01:05:58,886
I want to know if we could turn back the time,

960
01:05:59,765 --> 01:06:01,766
do you really want us to stay together?

961
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:04,846
(Even if nothing happened to us back then,)

962
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:07,953
(I think we would still break up before today.)

963
01:06:08,246 --> 01:06:09,566
(Look at you now.)

964
01:06:09,663 --> 01:06:12,006
(If you have to exchange everything you have today)

965
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:14,286
(to go back as Kaokla on that day,)

966
01:06:14,534 --> 01:06:16,886
(you'll surely choose the current you with a future.)

967
01:06:17,157 --> 01:06:19,766
(Admit it that even if we were together,)

968
01:06:20,046 --> 01:06:21,806
(we would break up one day.)

969
01:06:23,206 --> 01:06:24,686
What are you trying to say?

970
01:06:25,406 --> 01:06:26,606
Think about it.

971
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:29,886
We might have never loved each other before.

972
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:33,086
We didn't know each other that much.

973
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:36,166
We just rashly stayed together

974
01:06:38,246 --> 01:06:39,846
to take responsibility for the child

975
01:06:40,886 --> 01:06:43,246
who wasn't intended to be born as our child.

976
01:06:44,374 --> 01:06:46,206
Why won't we forget that?

977
01:06:51,702 --> 01:06:53,486
You should try to become me.

978
01:06:54,726 --> 01:06:56,966
Try to find a way to live.

979
01:06:57,686 --> 01:06:59,366
We'll see if you can forget those days.

980
01:07:00,262 --> 01:07:01,846
(Try living in a prison.)

981
01:07:02,166 --> 01:07:04,766
(Leaving my dad and my sister to starve and gather money to help me.)

982
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:07,486
(I was so ashamed that I couldn't face them)

983
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:09,886
(because they're judged by society because of me.)

984
01:07:10,806 --> 01:07:12,486
You should see those things yourself.

985
01:07:13,086 --> 01:07:15,366
You'll understand why I can't forget those days.

986
01:07:16,086 --> 01:07:18,806
It's not like I love you so much that I couldn't forget you.

987
01:07:20,126 --> 01:07:22,366
I can only remember the pain you caused me.

988
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,206
(Do you know that)

989
01:07:27,516 --> 01:07:29,726
(I was calling the name of my murderer while I was asleep?)

990
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:32,206
(Even when I was almost dead,)

991
01:07:32,517 --> 01:07:33,966
(I still thought of you.)

992
01:07:34,486 --> 01:07:35,726
(While you were)

993
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:38,006
(enjoying your happiness somewhere else.)

994
01:07:38,814 --> 01:07:40,094
When I woke up,

995
01:07:42,078 --> 01:07:43,806
let alone walking and eating,

996
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:47,006
I couldn't even open my eyes.

997
01:07:50,701 --> 01:07:53,006
When I close my eyes, I still see those images every year.

998
01:07:53,261 --> 01:07:54,726
When I'm awake, I can't tell

999
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,406
what the nightmare or the truth is.

1000
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:58,726
(During all these years,)

1001
01:07:59,126 --> 01:08:00,246
(I don't want to sleep)

1002
01:08:00,406 --> 01:08:01,814
(as I'm afraid I can't wake up again.)

1003
01:08:01,902 --> 01:08:02,966
Don't die, Kla!

1004
01:08:03,102 --> 01:08:04,286
Try to live as me.

1005
01:08:04,462 --> 01:08:06,709
Can you endure half of what I've faced?

1006
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,966
I'm sorry.

1007
01:08:10,358 --> 01:08:13,086
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1008
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:15,566
You still dare to teach me to let it go and forget it?

1009
01:08:18,605 --> 01:08:20,812
I didn't know what you've faced.

1010
01:08:20,949 --> 01:08:23,006
Don't you dare sympathize with me.

1011
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:24,686
If I could choose,

1012
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:27,926
I wouldn't go back to change my past.

1013
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:31,726
I would change to make you suffer instead of me.

1014
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,166
If it can be changed,

1015
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,006
I would do it.

1016
01:08:43,669 --> 01:08:45,086
Can you endure it?

1017
01:08:45,892 --> 01:08:48,926
If I knew how much you've suffered,

1018
01:08:49,886 --> 01:08:51,406
I would come back.

1019
01:08:53,926 --> 01:08:57,246
But back then, everyone said you're dead.

1020
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:00,286
(I thought you and our child were gone.)

1021
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:02,726
(I'm the only one who has to endure living.)

1022
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:04,286
Endure?

1023
01:09:05,006 --> 01:09:06,446
You said that?

1024
01:09:07,366 --> 01:09:09,366
With this rosy life of yours?

1025
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:14,726
If I can atone for you,

1026
01:09:15,606 --> 01:09:18,446
how would you want me to atone for you?

1027
01:09:20,269 --> 01:09:23,486
Do we still have any ways left to end things well?

1028
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:25,466
If you want to divorce,

1029
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,086
give my time back.

1030
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,006
(Give the time that you're staying with another man back to me.)

1031
01:09:35,758 --> 01:09:37,758
(Every breath of yours must be about me.)

1032
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:40,446
(Tell me what you want me to do.)

1033
01:09:40,646 --> 01:09:42,366
Before you become another man's wife,

1034
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:44,166
you must compensate me.

1035
01:09:44,615 --> 01:09:45,766
If I do that,

1036
01:09:46,006 --> 01:09:48,566
you'll divorce and let me go, right?

1037
01:09:49,135 --> 01:09:50,526
You have to offer your time.

1038
01:09:50,861 --> 01:09:52,766
You have to come whenever I call you.

1039
01:09:53,086 --> 01:09:55,246
If you stay with me and don't feel anything,

1040
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:58,726
it means we don't have anything left, and I'll divorce you.

1041
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:02,166
You can go marry whomever you want then.

1042
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:04,446
If it's not like what you asked of me last night,

1043
01:10:06,005 --> 01:10:07,366
I can do it.

1044
01:10:10,798 --> 01:10:12,206
Ask your heart first.

1045
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:15,406
Whether you can stay with me and endure it.

1046
01:10:15,941 --> 01:10:17,206
I have no problem.

1047
01:10:22,726 --> 01:10:24,166
What do you want me to do?

1048
01:10:26,447 --> 01:10:27,646
Tell me.

1049
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,486
(From now on, you must live for me.)

1050
01:10:31,829 --> 01:10:33,486
(No matter what I tell you to do,)

1051
01:10:34,006 --> 01:10:37,246
your duty is to do what I say until I'm satisfied.

1052
01:10:38,063 --> 01:10:39,703
(The flowers are here.)

1053
01:10:39,879 --> 01:10:42,206
(Start with making up with Claire for me.)

1054
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:46,126
(You have to fix everything you've caused.)

1055
01:10:46,382 --> 01:10:48,182
(Make Claire reconcile with me.)

1056
01:10:50,325 --> 01:10:52,086
(Can you do this small thing for me?)

1057
01:10:56,677 --> 01:10:58,077
I'm here to check on you.

1058
01:10:59,845 --> 01:11:02,086
I saw that you're restless,

1059
01:11:02,222 --> 01:11:05,926
so I asked someone to check your boyfriend's profile.

1060
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,406
Is it true?

1061
01:11:09,023 --> 01:11:10,622
He was really married.

1062
01:11:12,086 --> 01:11:14,366
But there's something you should know.

1063
01:11:14,606 --> 01:11:15,806
He got married

1064
01:11:16,166 --> 01:11:19,086
only because he impregnated that woman.

1065
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:23,486
He was just a kid who met that woman from a dating app.

1066
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:26,006
He only married her to take responsibility for the child.

1067
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:30,526
(I heard that they only lived together for a short while.)

1068
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:33,206
(Carl went out for work,)

1069
01:11:33,398 --> 01:11:36,768
(and that woman got an abortion and couldn't stand living in poverty.)

1070
01:11:36,895 --> 01:11:38,566
(So they went their separate ways.)

1071
01:11:38,933 --> 01:11:42,166
Since then, they had never seen each other again.

1072
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:46,806
Carl went abroad and used his stepmother's surname.

1073
01:11:47,022 --> 01:11:49,022
That's why those two lost their contacts

1074
01:11:49,149 --> 01:11:52,126
and the divorce is still a problem today.

1075
01:11:53,187 --> 01:11:56,126
But he just went to see his wife yesterday.

1076
01:11:57,015 --> 01:12:01,286
It's probably about the matrimonial properties that they can't agree on.

1077
01:12:01,766 --> 01:12:03,806
Carl didn't tell you

1078
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:07,246
because he's worried that you would be worried about it.

1079
01:12:08,094 --> 01:12:09,286
From what I've seen,

1080
01:12:09,486 --> 01:12:10,686
they...

1081
01:12:11,365 --> 01:12:13,526
They didn't look so attracted to each other.

1082
01:12:14,046 --> 01:12:17,766
They haven't divorced only because of their interests.

1083
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:21,486
They had a child before.

1084
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:25,326
I see.

1085
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,166
What's the matter?

1086
01:12:32,101 --> 01:12:35,204
Carl told me he made this Arsa app

1087
01:12:35,367 --> 01:12:38,886
because he's inspired from the time when he was an intern at a call center.

1088
01:12:39,437 --> 01:12:41,437
A kid was left alone at home.

1089
01:12:41,749 --> 01:12:43,966
He called him to ask him to find his mom.

1090
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:46,806
Carl thought his mom had gone out for work.

1091
01:12:47,766 --> 01:12:50,326
He wanted someone to take care of that child

1092
01:12:50,519 --> 01:12:53,246
to not make him feel lonely or abandoned.

1093
01:12:53,846 --> 01:12:56,606
Carl is probably regretful about his dead child.

1094
01:13:01,566 --> 01:13:03,526
Carl really has an issue when it comes to children.

1095
01:13:03,662 --> 01:13:05,206
Whenever he sees a child,

1096
01:13:05,749 --> 01:13:08,166
he'll always go to help or protect them.

1097
01:13:08,845 --> 01:13:10,086
It's like

1098
01:13:10,167 --> 01:13:12,806
he wants to compensate for his role as a father.

1099
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,350
Can I talk with our kid?

1100
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:19,246
Sure.

1101
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,206
My child,

1102
01:13:22,646 --> 01:13:23,806
it's me, your dad.

1103
01:13:24,086 --> 01:13:25,606
(I'm working in a forest.)

1104
01:13:25,846 --> 01:13:28,806
It's so dark, but there are tons of stars.

1105
01:13:28,966 --> 01:13:29,966
How old are you?

1106
01:13:30,064 --> 01:13:31,206
Seven years old.

1107
01:13:31,904 --> 01:13:33,366
You're as old as my child.

1108
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:35,166
If he had a chance to live,

1109
01:13:35,406 --> 01:13:36,726
he would be as naughty as you.

1110
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:40,446
It probably weighs on his mind

1111
01:13:40,925 --> 01:13:43,206
that he couldn't protect his own child.

1112
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:46,806
You didn't think he would be this nice, did you?

1113
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,126
Actually,

1114
01:13:54,965 --> 01:13:57,126
I feel really bad for him.

1115
01:13:57,606 --> 01:13:59,726
You should give him another chance.

1116
01:14:05,046 --> 01:14:06,766
He's the one who told me

1117
01:14:07,293 --> 01:14:09,606
that I should love him from zero

1118
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:11,766
and I should love him more after that.

1119
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:13,966
Don't start to love him with 100 percent

1120
01:14:15,271 --> 01:14:18,926
because I might be disappointed in him and stop loving him.

1121
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:21,966
He probably knows that his wife is his obstacle,

1122
01:14:23,111 --> 01:14:24,126
but he...

1123
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,501
But he made me fall in love with him

1124
01:14:26,766 --> 01:14:29,086
so much that I can't give up now.

1125
01:14:29,606 --> 01:14:32,326
You don't have to think about that woman so much, Ms. Claire.

1126
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:37,886
Mr. Carl probably stopped loving that woman a long time ago.

1127
01:14:45,989 --> 01:14:47,126
That's true.

1128
01:15:15,926 --> 01:15:17,926
I'm sorry for being nonsensical.

1129
01:15:18,094 --> 01:15:20,486
We should go through this thing together.

1130
01:15:29,246 --> 01:15:31,366
(I hope you'll be satisfied.)

1131
01:15:39,078 --> 01:15:40,606
(I hope you'll be satisfied.)

1132
01:15:59,406 --> 01:16:00,606
The food is here.

1133
01:16:00,735 --> 01:16:02,686
They're all your favorite.

1134
01:16:02,966 --> 01:16:06,486
I can say that the food from this store is really good.

1135
01:16:07,366 --> 01:16:09,406
They're better than what you have had before.

1136
01:16:52,806 --> 01:16:56,686
(We can love someone, but it might not be good to stay with them.)

1137
01:16:57,997 --> 01:16:59,747
(If you can understand this,)

1138
01:16:59,852 --> 01:17:02,686
(when you love someone, you won't force yourself.)

1139
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:05,646
(Even if you can't be with the one you love,)

1140
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:07,086
(it doesn't mean)

1141
01:17:07,693 --> 01:17:09,606
(you have to hate them.)

1142
01:17:40,157 --> 01:17:43,830
I heard your brother launched a crowd-funding for the app.

1143
01:17:45,486 --> 01:17:48,465
We only want to expand our app to reach more people.

1144
01:17:48,606 --> 01:17:51,326
Didn't you want to get away from my company?

1145
01:17:51,526 --> 01:17:53,446
You went to find new investors.

1146
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:57,486
We only wanted to find more partners,

1147
01:17:57,805 --> 01:17:59,726
but we haven't closed a deal with anyone.

1148
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:04,206
These are the documents.

1149
01:18:07,053 --> 01:18:09,126
Don't try to disregard me.

1150
01:18:09,335 --> 01:18:11,566
Even for that historic house,

1151
01:18:11,678 --> 01:18:15,126
your brother flattered them and the deed will be under his name.

1152
01:18:15,389 --> 01:18:18,526
I say that kind of action is a betrayal for me.

1153
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:22,766
That plot of land must be under our company.

1154
01:18:23,126 --> 01:18:25,966
If you betray me, I won't keep you anymore.

1155
01:18:26,206 --> 01:18:29,806
If you guys didn't have me, you wouldn't have what you have today.

1156
01:18:32,086 --> 01:18:34,206
Lady, the doctor is here.

1157
01:18:46,918 --> 01:18:49,206
My son, he's not doing very well.

1158
01:18:49,334 --> 01:18:52,046
He has seizures very often now.

1159
01:18:52,446 --> 01:18:56,406
And he's not taking in and the most important thing is that at the moment,

1160
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:59,142
I'm gonna be traveling abroad and he...

1161
01:19:02,005 --> 01:19:03,645
Excuse me, let's go this way.

1162
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:13,286
Who is the one that couldn't live to this day if we didn't have Kla?

1163
01:19:18,646 --> 01:19:20,686
How long will you prolong his life?

1164
01:19:21,534 --> 01:19:23,766
We're all suffering from that.

1165
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:27,181
Are all the directors here?

1166
01:19:27,286 --> 01:19:30,046
- Yes. - Have you handed out all the documents?

1167
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,966
No. I heard the meeting agendas will be changed today.

1168
01:19:33,126 --> 01:19:34,246
How?

1169
01:19:34,766 --> 01:19:35,926
Who changed it?

1170
01:19:41,238 --> 01:19:43,366
I resigned from my political position.

1171
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:46,206
I'll come back and manage this company

1172
01:19:46,446 --> 01:19:48,646
because Saikhim has to prepare for her wedding.

1173
01:19:51,237 --> 01:19:54,686
I don't think she can fully perform her duty as CEO.

1174
01:20:02,886 --> 01:20:04,206
She wants her freedom.

1175
01:20:04,437 --> 01:20:06,566
She wants to live her life as she wishes.

1176
01:20:06,966 --> 01:20:08,246
I sympathize with her.

1177
01:20:12,398 --> 01:20:13,606
She's a woman.

1178
01:20:14,813 --> 01:20:16,886
She only has one chance to be a bride.

1179
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:22,166
I want her to fully focus on what she has chosen for herself.

1180
01:20:22,692 --> 01:20:24,606
I'll use this opportunity

1181
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:27,046
to announce to everyone that

1182
01:20:27,206 --> 01:20:28,446
from now on,

1183
01:20:28,766 --> 01:20:31,206
I'll come back and do everything here.

1184
01:20:35,661 --> 01:20:37,446
Dad was humiliating me.

1185
01:20:37,686 --> 01:20:40,446
He's upset that you couldn't get a divorce as he wishes.

1186
01:20:40,598 --> 01:20:43,526
Do you want me to ask for matrimonial properties from Kaokla?

1187
01:20:43,686 --> 01:20:44,846
He doesn't want money.

1188
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:47,926
He only wants to stall for time to get back at him.

1189
01:20:48,189 --> 01:20:50,646
He wants to get back at him for his minister position.

1190
01:20:50,966 --> 01:20:52,966
Then, how is this fair to me?

1191
01:20:53,253 --> 01:20:56,126
Why do I have to be everyone's enemy for Dad?

1192
01:20:59,686 --> 01:21:01,486
You won't take my side anyway.

1193
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,246
Forget it.

1194
01:21:03,557 --> 01:21:05,726
Of course, you'll take my dad's side.

1195
01:21:07,318 --> 01:21:09,226
I've probably caused you a lot of trouble.

1196
01:21:23,934 --> 01:21:25,494
(Pick me up at the garage right now.)

1197
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:28,446
(You have to offer your time.)

1198
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:30,886
(You have to come whenever I call you.)

1199
01:21:34,613 --> 01:21:35,646
Khim.

1200
01:21:36,006 --> 01:21:37,286
Khim, we need to talk.

1201
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:42,766
Khim, why didn't you answer my call?

1202
01:21:43,077 --> 01:21:44,166
Are you still mad?

1203
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:46,166
If you still take my dad's side,

1204
01:21:46,606 --> 01:21:48,046
we aren't really friends.

1205
01:21:49,085 --> 01:21:50,966
Why do you have to be that mad?

1206
01:21:51,526 --> 01:21:54,286
Is it because you really want him back?

1207
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:55,806
It's not like that.

1208
01:21:56,293 --> 01:21:57,646
I just feel bad

1209
01:21:58,806 --> 01:22:01,246
that no one is sincere with me.

1210
01:22:02,646 --> 01:22:03,686
Khim.

1211
01:22:05,966 --> 01:22:07,469
I did that

1212
01:22:07,804 --> 01:22:09,806
because I really meant well for you.

1213
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:13,766
I didn't want to see you in pain because of that man.

1214
01:22:14,573 --> 01:22:15,806
You already saw

1215
01:22:16,165 --> 01:22:18,206
what his true nature is.

1216
01:22:18,486 --> 01:22:20,006
When he's rich,

1217
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,606
he forgets his own roots.

1218
01:22:32,174 --> 01:22:34,126
I see. Dad called you to the meeting.

1219
01:22:34,526 --> 01:22:37,446
He probably has a project that he wants to give to you.

1220
01:22:38,557 --> 01:22:40,726
I won't get in the way of my friend's success.

1221
01:23:57,845 --> 01:24:00,246
- Where are you going? - FCT Building.

1222
01:24:11,086 --> 01:24:13,086
I take lightly roasted coffee in the morning.

1223
01:24:13,366 --> 01:24:14,686
Ask me first if you don't know.

1224
01:24:14,886 --> 01:24:16,646
You should care first if you're taking care of me.

1225
01:25:07,294 --> 01:25:09,406
You're only sitting there. Why are you sighing?

1226
01:25:11,563 --> 01:25:12,726
The building is just there.

1227
01:25:12,966 --> 01:25:14,286
Isn't walking there faster?

1228
01:25:14,406 --> 01:25:16,846
Do you think I want to be stuck with you so much?

1229
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:20,126
You look like you'll die when you're with me.

1230
01:25:45,716 --> 01:25:46,749
What's wrong?

1231
01:25:55,038 --> 01:25:57,038
For the rest of today, you have to clean up for me.

1232
01:25:57,166 --> 01:25:58,526
I'm moving in.

1233
01:25:58,646 --> 01:26:00,046
But don't show your face.

1234
01:26:00,246 --> 01:26:01,646
I feel awkward enough.

1235
01:26:01,965 --> 01:26:05,866
You have to do everything before I come back to cut down the time.

1236
01:26:16,598 --> 01:26:19,166
So, you want me to be your maid, right?

1237
01:26:20,934 --> 01:26:22,846
Since we're husband and wife,

1238
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:25,686
and you're always having an affair with your lover,

1239
01:26:26,086 --> 01:26:27,886
I have to demand my right back.

1240
01:26:28,181 --> 01:26:31,406
If I sue you for divorce, you might go bankrupt.

1241
01:26:32,191 --> 01:26:33,206
- Honey. - I...

1242
01:26:44,406 --> 01:26:46,646
From now on, your duty is to make my life easier.

1243
01:26:46,926 --> 01:26:49,126
I'll let you handle all the nonsensical stuff.

1244
01:26:49,646 --> 01:26:51,446
I'll only tell you to do unnecessary things

1245
01:26:51,966 --> 01:26:54,166
so I can use my time to focus on something else.

1246
01:26:54,622 --> 01:26:56,446
I don't want to pay attention to you.

1247
01:26:56,726 --> 01:26:58,886
Use your time to bring benefits to me

1248
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:01,006
without bothering me.

1249
01:27:06,606 --> 01:27:07,846
What's this?

1250
01:27:08,054 --> 01:27:10,566
The global warming ignited an old flame?

1251
01:27:13,957 --> 01:27:15,006
I can't help it.

1252
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:18,006
She has to work hard if she wants to divorce.

1253
01:27:22,646 --> 01:27:24,806
You're trying to make her soften up and come back to you.

1254
01:27:24,966 --> 01:27:26,006
Watch your words.

1255
01:27:26,206 --> 01:27:27,886
I'll make her have no one left.

1256
01:27:33,213 --> 01:27:34,366
That Kla,

1257
01:27:34,534 --> 01:27:37,126
he doesn't want to divorce you, so he's stalling for time, right?

1258
01:27:37,326 --> 01:27:38,446
Don't worry.

1259
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:40,166
Time won't make us love each other more.

1260
01:27:40,294 --> 01:27:41,846
You have to come here willingly.

1261
01:27:42,014 --> 01:27:43,638
Every breath of yours must be about me.

1262
01:27:43,798 --> 01:27:45,006
This is why

1263
01:27:45,197 --> 01:27:48,046
I told you there's no way we couldn't break up.

1264
01:27:49,926 --> 01:27:53,286
You have to cut her off if she doesn't love you anymore.

1265
01:27:54,766 --> 01:27:57,086
I hope Carl will do as he says.

1266
01:27:57,214 --> 01:27:59,246
I don't want to be an idiot anymore.

1267
01:28:00,026 --> 01:28:01,026
What's wrong?

1268
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,006
- Give me the car key. - A car is following us.

1269
01:28:08,662 --> 01:28:09,726
No!

1270
01:28:09,814 --> 01:28:11,886
- We have a problem! - What happened, Khem?
