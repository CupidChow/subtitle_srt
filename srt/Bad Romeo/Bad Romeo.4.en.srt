(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

00:00:01,357 --> 00:00:02,634
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,176
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,206
You must return to England immediately.

5
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:46,996
No exception.

6
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:50,846
I'm pregnant...

7
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,326
Can you tell me

8
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:55,286
how should I start?

9
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:56,806
You stay here today.

10
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:59,406
We have an appointment tomorrow at the clinic.

11
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:01,206
Give my controller box back

12
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,526
or else I'll tell Uncle that Saikhim ran away with you.

13
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:06,446
My mom rents this place.

14
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:08,086
I don't think anyone can come here.

15
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,526
Ms. Khim ran away from home yesterday.

16
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:12,806
Can I go search your house?

17
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,046
You asked how I would raise our kid.

18
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,766
Here. I would raise him where I grew up.

19
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,526
We haven't found Ms. Khim.

20
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:37,526
We're trying to track them with a phone's signal.

21
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,246
I think Kaokla wants to use their kid to trap Khim

22
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:43,166
and to challenge us.

23
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:46,766
If we panic as he planned, he would be advantageous.

24
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,006
Do we have any better way?

25
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,766
Uncle, you should try cutting her off.

26
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,246
He's a greedy man.

27
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:01,846
If the woman isn't rich,

28
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,430
Saikhim wouldn't be worth anything to him.

29
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,446
If you can keep your calm

30
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,116
and cut her off for once,

31
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:13,606
Saikhim will realize

32
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,406
that what that man loves

33
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,646
is your money.

34
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,806
Kla. Is it him?

35
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:40,726
It's really you, Kla.

36
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:43,166
Wow. How did you get here?

37
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:45,486
I didn't think it was you when I saw you.

38
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,760
When I take a closer look,

39
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:50,806
it's really you. It's really you.

40
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:53,062
What's with your face?

41
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:56,046
- Where did you get that? - Be gentle.

42
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:02,006
I'm going home and I want to grab a bite around here.

43
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:05,326
If you suddenly return like this, your dad will be shocked.

44
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:08,086
Are you going home? Let's go together.

45
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,086
Someone's with me.

46
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:18,686
Oh, back off.

47
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:22,478
It's you. Are you going to Hong Hean Yoo Sa Bai?

48
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:28,166
I'm Kloyjai, the one who talked on the phone with you.

49
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,166
Then, let's go to the farm.

50
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:34,486
Right. He's my brother, Kaokla.

51
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:36,406
Kla.

52
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,366
She's going to our farm. Drive her there.

53
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,574
- Okay? I'll follow you there. - Okay.

54
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:43,606
See you at the farm.

55
00:05:43,956 --> 00:05:46,134
Have a safe drive. Be careful.

56
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:57,044
Your sister?

57
00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:58,286
Yes.

58
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:01,062
She thought you were a tourist who wants to stay at our farm.

59
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:08,566
You have a farm, a homestay, a sister.

60
00:06:09,718 --> 00:06:11,846
Do you have anything else that I don't know?

61
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:13,646
You'll know when we arrive.

62
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:38,886
I'll take you to my home to see my dad.

63
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:48,286
I'll introduce you to everyone.

64
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:04,566
Wait. How are you going to introduce me?

65
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:08,238
I'll say we're a couple who will have a kid.

66
00:07:08,357 --> 00:07:09,406
Are you crazy?

67
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:12,806
If you introduce me like that, what would they think of me?

68
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:15,446
Do you want me to say we're eloping after a one-night stand?

69
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:18,726
Hey, you can't say that either.

70
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,366
You don't want me to say the truth or lie.

71
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:22,926
What's our relationship then?

72
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,806
- Dad. - Why are you back?

73
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,926
Who's that?

74
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:41,686
- Well... - Hello.

75
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:47,686
Dad.

76
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,206
Dad.

77
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,766
She's the person who'll take a course with us.

78
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:56,166
She's from Bangkok.

79
00:07:57,784 --> 00:07:59,196
- Actually... - Listen, Dad.

80
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:00,566
I told Kla

81
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:03,806
to drive her here from the market. They just ran into each other.

82
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:07,246
It's not his business. Why would you get him involved?

83
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:10,766
Kloy, take her inside first.

84
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:12,406
Yes.

85
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:13,807
Give me that.

86
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,366
Please come this way.

87
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:22,172
This way, please.

88
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:38,666
This way.

89
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:43,926
Turn right here.

90
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,006
Come on.

91
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:52,006
Here we are. We've arrived.

92
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:54,006
This is our school area.

93
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,406
We have some boards for the kids to doodle on.

94
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,846
We have them on the second floor.

95
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,206
You came back like this.

96
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,286
What trouble have you caused again?

97
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:17,006
You said you wouldn't come back here anymore.

98
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:19,686
I impregnated a woman.

99
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:29,966
I knew it!

100
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:33,366
If you didn't have a problem, you wouldn't crawl back here!

101
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,134
I want to look after her here.

102
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:47,726
Someone like you?

103
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,406
Can you look after her?

104
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:52,166
- You won't let me stay? - No.

105
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,326
The kid can stay, but you can't.

106
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,668
Go change yourself

107
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,526
before you can become a father.

108
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:18,046
Please come this way.

109
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:29,446
I'll carry your bag.

110
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:38,406
I thought you wouldn't come.

111
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,246
You haven't answered my call.

112
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:43,446
I'll take you to see around here.

113
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:47,166
Let's go. I'll take you to see a beautiful place.

114
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:52,726
Why are there a lot of children here?

115
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:54,246
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

116
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:58,686
Not only we're an independent school, but we're also a home school.

117
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:06,286
These children don't have parents. They're sent to their grandparents.

118
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:18,006
My dad feels bad, so he let them stay here while the adults are working.

119
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,526
In the evening, they will return home.

120
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:22,486
If they can't look after the kids,

121
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,726
we will look after the kids for them.

122
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,406
I want you to change your mind and give the kid to me.

123
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,286
I can raise one kid.

124
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:31,406
It's like this.

125
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:40,253
Let's go over there.

126
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:42,086
Let's go.

127
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:49,246
This place looks nice.

128
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:51,526
Do you see that house?

129
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,278
It's called an earth house.

130
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:55,846
Earth house?

131
00:11:56,286 --> 00:12:00,326
Dad will teach you how to build earth houses and how to rely on yourself.

132
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:03,646
This place will teach you how to live with nature,

133
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,566
how to spend less money, how to live simply,

134
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,326
and only do necessary things.

135
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:12,646
By the way, what should I call you?

136
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:15,886
- You can call me Khim. - Khim.

137
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:18,686
Khim, you're so talented.

138
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:20,526
You drove a long way here.

139
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:24,606
Don't worry. I can assure you that you'll be safe here.

140
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:29,286
- Let's go. - Oh, right.

141
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:31,726
What about your brother?

142
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:33,077
Kla?

143
00:12:33,174 --> 00:12:35,398
Are you scared? Don't worry.

144
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:38,646
He won't stay here for long. He likes to come and go.

145
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:43,486
Did he grow up here?

146
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:47,086
Yes. But he moved out a long time ago.

147
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:52,059
He might be a little crazy, but please don't mind him.

148
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:54,832
He hasn't met a pretty lady that frequently.

149
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,446
He can't hide his emotion.

150
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:03,646
Oh, right. Today, we'll begin a lesson on food.

151
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:06,766
My dad will take you to pick up vegetables to cook food.

152
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,406
Are you ready?

153
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,966
- Yes. - Let's go.

154
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:13,526
In this world,

155
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:15,366
we can't starve.

156
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:19,486
One way to rely on oneself is to eat what we have.

157
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,566
This is wolffia globosa.

158
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:24,726
Some call it watermeal.

159
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,886
I just took it from a pond.

160
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:39,406
It might look weird, but it has tons of benefits.

161
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:41,526
It's high in protein.

162
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:49,606
Today,

163
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,766
I'll let you try watermeal curry.

164
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:55,926
We'll begin with...

165
00:13:56,998 --> 00:13:59,006
We'll lift it out and let the water drain.

166
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:00,286
Like this.

167
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:05,374
We'll pour all the dirty things out. Pour them out.

168
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:12,606
More importantly, if someone wants your portion of merit,

169
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:15,806
just pray and give them some.

170
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:18,206
Pray and give them some.

171
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:20,580
Pray and give them some.

172
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:22,606
Pray and give them some.

173
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:26,086
If we get a lot of merits, give them this basket.

174
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:49,926
Be careful, Kloy.

175
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:53,686
Wow. You got chewed out by Dad, didn't you?

176
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:55,846
Kla.

177
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:59,046
Who did you impregnate? Dad almost went mad.

178
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:02,086
You're young. Don't be nosy.

179
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,486
Hey, I wasn't nosy. I'm just genuinely curious.

180
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:07,286
Your girlfriend,

181
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:08,926
who is she?

182
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:11,246
Don't tell me it's a dancer.

183
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:13,966
Hey.

184
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:18,246
If it's not a dancer, who would date you?

185
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:22,406
Don't walk away. Talk with me first.

186
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:23,806
Kla.

187
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,326
I want to talk with you.

188
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:38,726
I think we can't stay here.

189
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,326
Your dad couldn't accept it, right?

190
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,566
I know it from his demeanor.

191
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:47,126
We'll stay here tonight.

192
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:48,722
We're leaving tomorrow.

193
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:55,126
Do you have anywhere else?

194
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,926
Just admit that you aren't ready to take care of the kid.

195
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:02,286
If I'm alone, I'll be fine.

196
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,206
I can live anywhere.

197
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:07,166
I don't want to suffer during these eight months.

198
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:10,206
After you give birth, we'll go our separate ways.

199
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:14,286
If you can't live comfortably, your dad will mock me.

200
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:35,390
You ungrateful son.

201
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,686
- Dad. - I can't keep my eye off you.

202
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:39,886
What, Dad?

203
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:41,685
- You... - Dad.

204
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,566
- What are you doing here? - Dad.

205
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,606
- What are you doing? - Dad.

206
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:48,966
- Dad. - What's going on?

207
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:54,606
He assaulted you, right?

208
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,766
- Darn you. - Dad.

209
00:16:57,926 --> 00:16:59,726
- Listen to me, Dad. - What?

210
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,446
Calm down.

211
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:04,006
You...

212
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:06,206
You're a pervert

213
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:07,886
who made a girl pregnant.

214
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:11,621
Please calm down.

215
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,006
Did he assault you?

216
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:14,486
No.

217
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:15,813
Dad, you've misunderstood.

218
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:18,326
- Misunderstood? - Dad.

219
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,950
What are you doing here?

220
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:22,446
Why couldn't I be here? She's my wife.

221
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,086
What?

222
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:26,566
This woman's pregnant with my kid.

223
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:31,046
Are you his wife?

224
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:42,303
Did you kidnap her?

225
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:43,494
Dad.

226
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:45,406
What do you think of me?

227
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:50,926
You're still young.

228
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,006
Did Kla trick you? Did you elope with him?

229
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,886
She's just unlucky to get pregnant with my kid.

230
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,206
Unlucky?

231
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,246
She's already pregnant.

232
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,446
You're saying it's just that?

233
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,166
She's my girlfriend. How is it wrong to have a kid together?

234
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:14,526
We love each other.

235
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:16,566
We want to build a family.

236
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:22,609
Come here.

237
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:26,646
Your parents,

238
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,646
can they accept this?

239
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:32,366
I can raise our kid.

240
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:35,686
We can take responsibility for him. No one has said anything.

241
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,525
You assaulted their daughter.

242
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,846
What kind of parents will be that generous?

243
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,290
Dad.

244
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:47,549
You can just stay still.

245
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:50,046
We won't bother you.

246
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,245
Kla.

247
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:55,646
You're impatient.

248
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,366
Have you ever done anything successfully?

249
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:01,486
I don't believe you can raise a kid.

250
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:10,005
Let's go.

251
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:18,366
Why did you have to lie?

252
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:23,773
If I tell him the truth, my dad will drag me to kneel in front of your dad.

253
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,598
Do you want your kid to be fatherless before he's even born?

254
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:31,286
I don't trust that you can raise our child anymore.

255
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:37,126
But this is the only place where your dad can't find our kid.

256
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:40,598
What about when it's time for me to go home?

257
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:45,205
You can claim that we have broken up then.

258
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,206
Hold on.

259
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,286
If I stay here,

260
00:19:49,486 --> 00:19:51,486
I have to stay as your girlfriend?

261
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:54,366
It's just a facade like what you've seen in dramas.

262
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,886
For seven to eight months. I can't do that.

263
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:01,406
You don't mind keeping your kid,

264
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:03,886
but you mind living with me?

265
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:06,766
I don't hate it.

266
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:09,206
I just feel bad.

267
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:11,006
I didn't ask you to be my lover.

268
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,646
Just be the mother of my kid.

269
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,166
That one, I can't stand it.

270
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:21,846
Then, be my roommate. We share a room.

271
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:25,406
I'm a gentleman who doesn't fall easily for anyone.

272
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,286
We knew that.

273
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:34,206
- Use another excuse. - I'm not your type.

274
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,886
And you're also not my type. Is that better?

275
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,286
Are you done taking a shower?

276
00:21:26,677 --> 00:21:28,197
The water is strong, isn't it?

277
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:30,286
Go take a shower.

278
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:59,806
Hesitating. You're the one who's hesitating.

279
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:03,686
You're the only one who's hesitating.

280
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,566
Hesitating. You're the one who's hesitating.

281
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,526
Can I live here?

282
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:21,366
The light's out.

283
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,326
Don't be surprised.

284
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,445
I forgot to tell you that the light's out sometimes at night.

285
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:30,326
And how could we live here?

286
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:57,693
Like this.

287
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,366
Are you scared of ghosts?

288
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:11,686
No.

289
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,246
Why are you that scared?

290
00:23:25,477 --> 00:23:26,606
Don't.

291
00:23:28,694 --> 00:23:31,126
A prayer book. It can protect you from ghosts.

292
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:35,006
Chant a prayer to calm your mind.

293
00:23:35,226 --> 00:23:38,646
Eliminate your desire and wild delusion.

294
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,326
Calm your mind. Make it innocent and pure.

295
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:44,046
Think of your parents' faces.

296
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:56,166
Did you pull a prank?

297
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:32,806
Is it a good dream?

298
00:27:30,294 --> 00:27:31,526
I'm back.

299
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,166
Oh.

300
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,366
You found it.

301
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:19,566
A lady can't live without this, can she?

302
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:20,901
She has to blow...

303
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,766
Give me that.

304
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,270
I'll handle it.

305
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:41,566
Kloy.

306
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,486
Oh, Khim. Are you awake?

307
00:28:43,726 --> 00:28:45,006
Are you hungry?

308
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:46,766
Do you need any help?

309
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,446
Since you're not a customer,

310
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:50,611
Dad said you don't have to take the course anymore,

311
00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:52,429
but you would just live with us.

312
00:28:53,526 --> 00:28:57,126
Now, those kids and I are preparing our meal.

313
00:28:58,141 --> 00:29:00,426
What's the meal today?

314
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:03,286
Today's meal isn't fried chicken or roasted chicken.

315
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:07,046
We call it a "lucky meal".

316
00:29:08,203 --> 00:29:09,707
"Lucky meal"?

317
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:13,406
Yes. Everyone will gather the ingredients for our meal.

318
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:20,348
Sometimes, we trade our chicken eggs with neighbors

319
00:29:20,523 --> 00:29:22,036
instead of going to the market.

320
00:29:22,256 --> 00:29:25,206
These children will have to talk and bring our items

321
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,766
to barter with them. They'll give us something back.

322
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:33,366
Mostly, they're vegetables or animals they've been raising

323
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:36,926
because Dad taught us to value each of our food.

324
00:29:37,046 --> 00:29:40,406
It's not easy to get your hand on it.

325
00:29:40,717 --> 00:29:42,886
So, we won't waste food.

326
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:54,246
Sometimes, we don't use our eggs to trade with them.

327
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,326
We might have to use our strength.

328
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:58,926
We don't have a convenience store here.

329
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:00,286
We only have a convenient mind.

330
00:30:00,446 --> 00:30:03,246
Eat and share if it's convenient for us.

331
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:05,806
Cashless society?

332
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:09,366
We didn't even have to use any money on some days.

333
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:03,726
This is what we call our "lucky meal".

334
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,270
What we will get to eat is up to our luck.

335
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:10,126
We have to eat only what we can find and have,

336
00:31:10,726 --> 00:31:12,246
not just eat whatever we want.

337
00:31:13,846 --> 00:31:15,566
Kids, go wash your hands.

338
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:21,526
Can you eat it?

339
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:23,526
It's easy.

340
00:31:24,837 --> 00:31:26,046
Line up.

341
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,886
Line up. Go line up.

342
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,726
I got this vegetable.

343
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,726
This is tofu from Uncle Kaew.

344
00:31:51,862 --> 00:31:54,566
Excuse me, haven't you forgotten something?

345
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:56,046
Forgot what?

346
00:31:56,878 --> 00:31:58,286
Forgot to add this.

347
00:31:58,414 --> 00:31:59,566
Add it.

348
00:32:03,446 --> 00:32:04,566
What's this?

349
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:05,846
Do you want it?

350
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,406
Are you letting me have it?

351
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,526
Sure. I'll eat it.

352
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:15,166
Don't...

353
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,206
It's crispy.

354
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:21,646
Can you eat tadpoles?

355
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:24,086
It's a frog's child.

356
00:32:24,846 --> 00:32:25,846
Can you eat it?

357
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:44,686
Go take a look at her.

358
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:46,366
Go.

359
00:32:51,165 --> 00:32:53,525
- Did I just eat a frog? - Yes.

360
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:55,686
A tadpole.

361
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,638
How was it?

362
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:27,286
Do you want to give your kid to me now?

363
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:33,186
I can imagine how he would grow up here.

364
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,486
It's not as bad as you thought, is it?

365
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:38,966
These kids' lives are better than mine,

366
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:41,006
although they don't have parents.

367
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:46,406
My dad can make anyone here happy unconditionally.

368
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:49,806
No need to wait for money or readiness.

369
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:51,766
If we need all of that first,

370
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:54,246
these kids wouldn't be born.

371
00:33:57,006 --> 00:33:58,246
Then...

372
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:03,286
A mother like me isn't necessary for the kid who's going to be born.

373
00:34:09,117 --> 00:34:10,246
You're necessary.

374
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:14,566
You need to accept that our lives aren't always smooth-sailing.

375
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:17,846
Everyone here doesn't have parents.

376
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:21,086
If they need to wait, they don't know how long they have to wait.

377
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:24,886
You don't have to wait for anyone or study well here.

378
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:29,166
They can be happy if they know how to wear clothes or wipe their buttocks.

379
00:34:32,158 --> 00:34:34,486
Happiness with what we have is the best.

380
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:29,126
- Here you are. - Here.

381
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:12,206
(What?)

382
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,406
I want to ask for a chance, Dad.

383
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:21,246
I want to ask for one year for my self-discovery.

384
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:24,326
Don't use that fancy word.

385
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,446
Just say that you don't want to go back to studying.

386
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:31,966
You probably know what the problem that I'm dealing with is.

387
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,686
I want to use this time to solve my own problem.

388
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:38,138
How?

389
00:36:38,277 --> 00:36:39,366
(Tell me.)

390
00:36:45,726 --> 00:36:47,166
For this one year,

391
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,446
I'll keep this kid.

392
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:52,486
(When he's born,)

393
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,606
I'll give my kid to him

394
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:57,286
and go back to studying, Dad.

395
00:36:58,006 --> 00:37:00,006
You'll keep your kid?

396
00:37:01,581 --> 00:37:03,406
What about my dignity?

397
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:06,846
(You value that man more than your future?)

398
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:09,566
Did you get brainwashed again?

399
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:11,246
Dad...

400
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:15,206
Our lives can go wrong sometimes,

401
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:16,966
but it's alright.

402
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:18,326
(Who said it's alright?)

403
00:37:18,462 --> 00:37:22,046
You'll lose your opportunity in your life for this.

404
00:37:22,526 --> 00:37:24,086
(What would you get from that?)

405
00:37:25,957 --> 00:37:30,486
Do you think my life now is really good?

406
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,646
(Isn't it better than this?)

407
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,830
You're far too gone because of a man.

408
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:38,966
What about you who controls my whole life?

409
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,846
How is it different?

410
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:41,966
(It's different.)

411
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,606
Who is that scoundrel?

412
00:37:43,781 --> 00:37:45,526
(He isn't serious with you.)

413
00:37:45,726 --> 00:37:48,366
He wants to use your kid to trap you.

414
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:53,486
(He loves money.)

415
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:55,606
(He doesn't love you.)

416
00:37:56,062 --> 00:37:57,686
If you're stupid enough

417
00:37:58,302 --> 00:37:59,926
to let him leech off of you,

418
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:01,766
(go back to him.)

419
00:38:02,374 --> 00:38:04,086
A stupid child like you,

420
00:38:04,637 --> 00:38:06,637
I won't feel sorry if I don't have one.

421
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,046
(I want to know)

422
00:38:08,742 --> 00:38:10,357
(if you aren't my child,)

423
00:38:10,478 --> 00:38:11,806
will he still want you?

424
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:16,126
So...

425
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:21,406
You still won't forgive me, right?

426
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:22,686
Of course.

427
00:38:24,311 --> 00:38:25,766
If I raise a dog,

428
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:27,606
the dog will be loyal.

429
00:38:28,332 --> 00:38:29,966
If my kid won't be loyal to me,

430
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,581
I just won't have one.

431
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:45,166
You're still the same, Dad.

432
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:47,829
(Do you know that when I was a child,)

433
00:38:48,246 --> 00:38:49,846
I pretended to be asleep

434
00:38:50,646 --> 00:38:53,566
to wait for you to carry me to my bedroom.

435
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:59,526
But you've never carried me to my bed even once.

436
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:01,926
(Let alone carrying me.)

437
00:39:02,846 --> 00:39:06,086
You probably don't want to look at my face anymore.

438
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:12,286
(I understand now)

439
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:16,206
why I haven't been happy after all this time.

440
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,126
Because you...

441
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,606
You set too high of a standard on me.

442
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,126
(That's why my life's so difficult.)

443
00:39:28,798 --> 00:39:30,806
(I have to be a good student.)

444
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:34,246
I have to get into the top five universities.

445
00:39:34,726 --> 00:39:37,126
I have to live proudly to make everyone else jealous.

446
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:39,686
(I have to not make you feel ashamed.)

447
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,846
(It's too difficult, Dad.)

448
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:44,726
I'm tired.

449
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:49,126
I think I can't do that.

450
00:41:50,504 --> 00:41:52,126
(I understand now)

451
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:56,166
(why I haven't been happy after all this time.)

452
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:57,806
(Because you...)

453
00:41:58,237 --> 00:42:01,686
(You set too high of a standard on me.)

454
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:04,696
(That's why my life's so difficult.)

455
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:08,166
(I have to not make you feel ashamed.)

456
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:15,046
(It's too difficult, Dad.)

457
00:42:18,046 --> 00:42:19,326
Everything that

458
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:22,526
I've done for you...

459
00:42:26,662 --> 00:42:28,766
Is it hurting you that much?

460
00:42:31,974 --> 00:42:33,726
Am I that bad?

461
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:50,057
This rectangle is our house. That one is Kloy's house.

462
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:53,126
In my house, everyone has to be on that sheet.

463
00:42:53,261 --> 00:42:55,446
- Yes. - You can't stand on the floor.

464
00:42:55,646 --> 00:42:56,846
You must be on the sheet.

465
00:42:56,957 --> 00:42:58,726
- Are you ready? Then... - I'm ready.

466
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,819
- Go. Quick. - Quick.

467
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:03,751
- Can you stand? - Is everyone on it?

468
00:43:03,871 --> 00:43:06,126
- Yes. - Both teams are good.

469
00:43:06,254 --> 00:43:07,606
It's a tie.

470
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:10,606
Clap your hands. It's a tie.

471
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,246
Let's go.

472
00:43:12,627 --> 00:43:13,966
Let's go home.

473
00:43:14,445 --> 00:43:15,446
- Let's go. - Next...

474
00:43:15,566 --> 00:43:18,326
- Let's go home. - Our house will be half smaller.

475
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:20,593
- Alright? - Dad, let us play too.

476
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:21,926
Okay.

477
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,168
- What do you say? - Sure.

478
00:43:24,295 --> 00:43:26,338
- Kloy, count the people. - Wait.

479
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,366
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

480
00:43:28,452 --> 00:43:29,686
One, two, three, four...

481
00:43:29,806 --> 00:43:31,126
Dad, you can't play.

482
00:43:31,286 --> 00:43:32,806
- I'll be a referee. - Sure.

483
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:35,406
- Okay. Fold the sheet. - Yes.

484
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:38,926
Okay.

485
00:43:39,646 --> 00:43:40,846
For this round,

486
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,846
our houses will be smaller.

487
00:43:43,213 --> 00:43:44,926
There are more people.

488
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:46,765
Everyone must be on that sheet.

489
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:49,286
- Ready? Are you ready? - Yes.

490
00:43:49,566 --> 00:43:50,566
Ready?

491
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:52,246
Go.

492
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,334
Both teams are good.

493
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:06,586
It's a tie again.

494
00:44:17,846 --> 00:44:19,206
Ready?

495
00:45:05,126 --> 00:45:06,366
Can you see it?

496
00:45:06,797 --> 00:45:10,126
No matter how big or small our house is, it won't be an obstacle.

497
00:45:11,469 --> 00:45:12,806
If we love each other,

498
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:14,566
and care for each other,

499
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:16,606
we can always stay together.

500
00:45:22,702 --> 00:45:24,046
Serves you right.

501
00:45:24,942 --> 00:45:26,126
Stop.

502
00:45:26,326 --> 00:45:28,006
You're too aggressive.

503
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,126
Stay still.

504
00:45:35,893 --> 00:45:37,926
Do you still want to show that manly side?

505
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:41,566
I'll carry both the mother and the kid when he's born.

506
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:52,126
When that time comes,

507
00:45:53,486 --> 00:45:55,046
I wouldn't be here anymore.

508
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:00,566
We have a lot of time left.

509
00:46:01,966 --> 00:46:03,806
I can carry you when you're in late pregnancy.

510
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:13,846
You have to raise him well.

511
00:46:15,622 --> 00:46:17,326
Help me with that from today.

512
00:46:18,286 --> 00:46:19,646
This time is also important.

513
00:46:20,086 --> 00:46:21,326
We need you.

514
00:46:25,046 --> 00:46:26,326
You know how to cheer someone up.

515
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,280
You can change your mind to raise him with me.

516
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:09,326
Can you really leave your kid with the dad?

517
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:16,206
I know you aren't heartless.

518
00:47:22,526 --> 00:47:23,926
You're just afraid, aren't you?

519
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:56,486
It's late.

520
00:48:00,286 --> 00:48:02,846
Let's go to bed. We have to wake up early tomorrow.

521
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:33,966
(Hong Hean Yoo Sa Bai)

522
00:48:58,865 --> 00:49:00,806
Khim. Khim.

523
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:03,525
Are you alright?

524
00:49:21,606 --> 00:49:22,806
Here.

525
00:49:23,173 --> 00:49:24,406
Water.

526
00:49:26,886 --> 00:49:28,806
Too much. It's too much, really.

527
00:49:29,654 --> 00:49:32,326
- What's too much? - You're into her too much.

528
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:35,286
You're running around for her.

529
00:49:36,022 --> 00:49:38,510
Stay here and look after those kids.

530
00:49:38,686 --> 00:49:40,686
Think of it as a practice for your parenthood.

531
00:49:43,697 --> 00:49:44,990
Where is Dad?

532
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:47,806
I don't know. Delivering his vegetables, I guess.

533
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,766
Where's the person you told me about?

534
00:51:46,215 --> 00:51:47,494
He's that way.

535
00:52:13,813 --> 00:52:15,446
(Chrysanthemum tea from our farm.)

536
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,019
(When my mom was pregnant with Kloyjai, she liked to drink it.)

537
00:52:18,566 --> 00:52:20,326
(I searched about chrysanthemums.)

538
00:52:20,606 --> 00:52:23,886
(Aside from relieving ulcers, it can relieve dizziness.)

539
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:26,206
(I think it might help with your nausea.)

540
00:52:57,885 --> 00:52:58,981
Please have a seat.

541
00:53:15,686 --> 00:53:16,966
Mr. Songsin.

542
00:53:17,365 --> 00:53:19,126
I want to talk with you about those two.

543
00:53:20,126 --> 00:53:21,406
I'll take responsibility

544
00:53:21,526 --> 00:53:23,526
after I've bothered your daughter,

545
00:53:23,653 --> 00:53:25,006
if you wouldn't mind.

546
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,006
I'm here to ask for Saikhim's hand.

547
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:34,686
Is that the dowry?

548
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,406
Take it back.

549
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:40,886
Do you think your son is suitable for my daughter?

550
00:53:42,269 --> 00:53:44,726
I don't know if he's good enough even if he's reborn.

551
00:53:48,543 --> 00:53:50,606
If you can't love our own daughter,

552
00:53:51,926 --> 00:53:53,366
give her to me.

553
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,646
You can't even raise your own son.

554
00:54:05,126 --> 00:54:07,766
Now, you think you're a better father than me?

555
00:54:08,982 --> 00:54:12,006
In the end, my daughter followed your son's bad example.

556
00:54:12,286 --> 00:54:14,006
Parents' words are sacred.

557
00:54:15,054 --> 00:54:17,246
Whatever you say about your daughter,

558
00:54:17,926 --> 00:54:19,686
she'll become like that.

559
00:54:19,792 --> 00:54:21,246
Don't try to teach me.

560
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:22,606
I'm not teaching you.

561
00:54:23,118 --> 00:54:24,446
I'm only warning you.

562
00:54:24,782 --> 00:54:26,086
From now on,

563
00:54:26,358 --> 00:54:28,166
no matter how their lives will become,

564
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:29,886
I'll make them

565
00:54:30,157 --> 00:54:32,351
feel proud of themselves once again.

566
00:54:32,566 --> 00:54:35,806
At least, they'll be better parents than you.

567
00:54:50,926 --> 00:54:52,166
Here.

568
00:54:52,726 --> 00:54:53,846
You're welcome.

569
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:58,686
Do you want to eat anything? Something that won't make you vomit.

570
00:55:01,461 --> 00:55:02,917
I'm okay now.

571
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:10,046
You want it, right?

572
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:15,646
- Excuse me, I'd like one set. - Yes.

573
00:55:20,766 --> 00:55:22,166
I'll go buy water for you.

574
00:55:26,581 --> 00:55:28,270
Excuse me, two bottles of water, please.

575
00:55:28,382 --> 00:55:29,541
Sure.

576
00:55:31,837 --> 00:55:33,046
That's my dad's car.

577
00:55:48,774 --> 00:55:50,046
Where is he?

578
00:55:52,094 --> 00:55:54,094
I'm the one who's making the delivery today.

579
00:55:54,876 --> 00:55:56,166
Why would Dad come here?

580
00:55:59,686 --> 00:56:02,966
He's probably around here. You should try to call him.

581
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,046
(Sorry. The number that you've dialed...)

582
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,086
His battery is dead, or he has turned off his phone.

583
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:30,886
Where has he been? It's this late, but he hasn't come back.

584
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,686
Dad didn't go to deliver the vegetables. Where is he?

585
00:56:35,406 --> 00:56:37,126
Why did he park the car at the market?

586
00:56:39,645 --> 00:56:40,926
- Kloy. - Yes?

587
00:56:41,134 --> 00:56:42,606
Go get a spare key.

588
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:44,726
I'll go look at the car.

589
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,206
Okay.

590
00:56:55,532 --> 00:56:56,610
Kla.

591
00:56:56,854 --> 00:56:58,566
- Kla. - What?

592
00:57:00,686 --> 00:57:02,846
What's this number? Why would he note it down?

593
00:57:03,526 --> 00:57:04,846
It's a Bangkok phone number.

594
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:07,966
Is he in Bangkok?

595
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:10,286
Let me try to call it.

596
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:15,566
Hello.

597
00:57:16,086 --> 00:57:17,686
Lux Hotel.

598
00:57:20,558 --> 00:57:22,206
He went to see my dad.

599
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,670
How did my dad know your dad?

600
00:57:34,006 --> 00:57:37,606
Dad asked me to make a copy of your ID card, Khim.

601
00:57:37,766 --> 00:57:39,726
He probably found out now.

602
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,366
This is bad.

603
00:57:43,173 --> 00:57:46,446
If both of them meet, something will happen to my dad.

604
00:57:54,027 --> 00:57:55,766
The car is here.

605
00:58:05,326 --> 00:58:06,360
Dad.

606
00:58:12,686 --> 00:58:15,586
- What are you doing here? - We're waiting for you.

607
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:17,686
You went to Bangkok, right?

608
00:58:19,326 --> 00:58:21,086
Why aren't you at school yet?

609
00:58:22,026 --> 00:58:23,126
Go.

610
00:58:33,628 --> 00:58:34,646
Dad.

611
00:58:53,686 --> 00:58:54,886
Uncle.

612
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:57,615
Did you go to see my dad?

613
00:58:57,727 --> 00:58:58,766
Yes.

614
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,206
I wanted to ask for your hand for Kla.

615
00:59:01,902 --> 00:59:02,966
Dad.

616
00:59:03,413 --> 00:59:05,366
He probably looked down on us.

617
00:59:05,558 --> 00:59:07,366
Why did you cause trouble like that?

618
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,926
You kidnapped her, impregnated her,

619
00:59:11,182 --> 00:59:12,806
and took her away from her home, right?

620
00:59:14,477 --> 00:59:15,606
Did he tell you?

621
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:17,798
You didn't date each other as you said.

622
00:59:20,446 --> 00:59:22,446
Did my dad swear at you?

623
00:59:22,886 --> 00:59:24,206
Did he hurt you?

624
00:59:24,701 --> 00:59:26,426
Are you hurt anywhere?

625
00:59:27,437 --> 00:59:29,046
You're still worried about me?

626
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:31,806
He said he doesn't have a daughter to give to me.

627
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,566
He cut off his own daughter

628
00:59:34,846 --> 00:59:36,286
because of you.

629
00:59:38,477 --> 00:59:40,326
He told me he cut you off

630
00:59:40,462 --> 00:59:42,246
because you insisted on keeping the child.

631
00:59:45,998 --> 00:59:47,086
Khim.

632
00:59:47,926 --> 00:59:49,086
Is that true?

633
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,040
Why didn't you tell me that you talked with him?

634
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:57,446
Aside from my own life,

635
00:59:58,244 --> 01:00:01,366
I've never had to be responsible for anyone's life.

636
01:00:01,486 --> 01:00:04,166
If this place can accept the kid,

637
01:00:04,542 --> 01:00:07,166
I would like to leave him here.

638
01:00:07,966 --> 01:00:10,726
I don't want to bother you any more than this.

639
01:00:10,862 --> 01:00:14,726
I believe that everyone can take care of him better than I can.

640
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,846
That's why I decided to keep him.

641
01:00:19,086 --> 01:00:20,406
When you give birth to him,

642
01:00:20,646 --> 01:00:21,926
you will have no home anymore.

643
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,726
Where will you live?

644
01:00:26,093 --> 01:00:29,246
When that time comes, I'll probably have some places to go.

645
01:00:30,221 --> 01:00:33,166
For now, I want some time to adjust myself.

646
01:00:44,293 --> 01:00:45,366
Do you see now?

647
01:00:46,286 --> 01:00:47,486
Can you see it?

648
01:00:47,726 --> 01:00:50,766
The consequence of using your emotion to lead your life.

649
01:00:51,326 --> 01:00:55,166
You only thought of the kid, but you made her lose everyone.

650
01:00:57,206 --> 01:00:58,486
Your thought

651
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:00,686
has hurt her.

652
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:02,246
Do you know that?

653
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,206
Khim. Khim.

654
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:25,046
You don't have to feel guilty about me.

655
01:01:25,886 --> 01:01:28,606
You've already paid me back enough.

656
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,707
It's not that I don't want to take responsibility for you.

657
01:01:32,806 --> 01:01:35,686
I know you can have a better life than staying with me.

658
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:39,246
So, I didn't think about asking you to stay with me.

659
01:01:40,646 --> 01:01:42,446
I don't want to drag you down.

660
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:45,806
If you don't mind,

661
01:01:46,742 --> 01:01:47,966
live here with me.

662
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:52,206
I'm serious.

663
01:01:52,686 --> 01:01:55,166
Not just our kid, I can also look after you.

664
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:59,966
I'm not rich, but I want to promise you with my own words.

665
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:03,766
Your stomach will be full. You will sleep comfortably.

666
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:05,486
More importantly,

667
01:02:05,766 --> 01:02:08,046
you'll feel happy from now on until you die.

668
01:02:18,056 --> 01:02:20,566
You said I wasn't your type.

669
01:02:22,565 --> 01:02:24,126
I don't like young ladies.

670
01:02:25,926 --> 01:02:31,126
But you aren't like that. You don't have your luxurious lifestyle anymore.

671
01:02:32,718 --> 01:02:33,966
So, what do you say?

672
01:02:35,726 --> 01:02:37,286
Can you live here with me?

673
01:02:40,286 --> 01:02:42,646
What do you want me to live as?

674
01:02:42,982 --> 01:02:44,726
As my woman.

675
01:02:46,278 --> 01:02:47,686
And the mother of our kid.

676
01:02:54,862 --> 01:02:58,046
You're so kind. Won't you regret this later?

677
01:02:58,246 --> 01:02:59,446
No.

678
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,846
Everything I've said today,

679
01:03:03,468 --> 01:03:04,806
I won't regret it later.

680
01:03:20,006 --> 01:03:21,326
Let's go home together.

681
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:36,446
What?

682
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,486
We're a couple. Can't we take a photo?

683
01:05:56,918 --> 01:05:58,118
Khim.

684
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,126
Khim. Since it comes to this,

685
01:06:08,938 --> 01:06:10,206
can we...

686
01:06:15,406 --> 01:06:17,002
Kla. Kla.

687
01:06:18,717 --> 01:06:20,366
Dad asked me to sleep with Khim.

688
01:06:20,474 --> 01:06:22,086
Hey, why?

689
01:06:31,406 --> 01:06:33,766
Dad said until you have had your handfasting ceremony,

690
01:06:33,894 --> 01:06:37,212
you couldn't do it together.

691
01:06:41,775 --> 01:06:43,768
- Khim. - Get up.

692
01:06:43,896 --> 01:06:45,886
- Khim, let's go. - No. Stop.

693
01:06:46,008 --> 01:06:50,006
Don't try to run away. Dad will kill you.

694
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,206
Go. Go back to your home.

695
01:07:02,954 --> 01:07:04,126
Khim...

696
01:07:08,262 --> 01:07:09,526
Just go.

697
01:07:16,726 --> 01:07:17,846
Good night, Khim.

698
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,606
Go. Go back to your own home.

699
01:07:38,766 --> 01:07:40,006
What?

700
01:07:42,286 --> 01:07:43,886
He wouldn't go back.

701
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:54,646
You're rich. You're also well educated.

702
01:07:56,725 --> 01:07:58,766
Why is your taste so weird?

703
01:07:59,317 --> 01:08:02,806
A young lady like you shouldn't be my sister-in-law.

704
01:08:28,846 --> 01:08:31,166
(She's a third-wheel.)

705
01:08:37,469 --> 01:08:39,286
(She's a third-wheel.)

706
01:08:50,766 --> 01:08:52,606
(See you in our dream.)

707
01:09:00,584 --> 01:09:01,726
(Sweet dream.)

708
01:09:04,463 --> 01:09:05,646
(Sweet dream.)

709
01:09:45,206 --> 01:09:47,446
(Stop getting involved with my daughter.)

710
01:09:47,765 --> 01:09:49,926
(Don't use your kid to trap a woman.)

711
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:52,031
(You can't even take care of yourself.)

712
01:09:52,246 --> 01:09:54,286
(How would you take care of a woman?)

713
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:56,886
I admit I couldn't give her as much as you could.

714
01:09:57,086 --> 01:09:59,606
Although I can't get her a golden cage,

715
01:09:59,902 --> 01:10:01,246
I'll take her to the horizon.

716
01:10:01,596 --> 01:10:03,246
(Think about it yourself.)

717
01:10:03,493 --> 01:10:07,166
(Between a golden cage and horizon, what would a bird want?)

718
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:10,406
Even if I only have my body, you're no match for me

719
01:10:10,814 --> 01:10:12,814
because you've never given her freedom.

720
01:10:12,941 --> 01:10:14,849
That's why she came to see a scoundrel like me.

721
01:11:12,126 --> 01:11:14,566
We'll add chaff into it.

722
01:11:14,894 --> 01:11:16,886
We have to see whether this chaff

723
01:11:17,453 --> 01:11:18,966
is mixed well with the soil.

724
01:11:19,102 --> 01:11:22,206
Then, scatter chaff all over the soil and continue to step on it

725
01:11:22,406 --> 01:11:25,406
until the soil and chaff mix is well incorporated.

726
01:12:02,976 --> 01:12:06,406
Khim, can this really make people know us more?

727
01:12:07,468 --> 01:12:10,815
We'll upload the video to Facebook and open it for registration.

728
01:12:11,046 --> 01:12:15,495
It'll get the interest of Thai people and foreigners.

729
01:12:15,677 --> 01:12:19,886
But how could we upload it? We don't have the internet here.

730
01:12:20,095 --> 01:12:22,581
If we want to use it, we have to use the school's internet.

731
01:12:22,677 --> 01:12:25,406
Or we have to go to the internet cafe downtown.

732
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:26,846
Really?

733
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,600
Aside from the internet, do you want anything else?

734
01:12:36,117 --> 01:12:37,326
I'll get it for you.

735
01:12:38,558 --> 01:12:39,806
Are you sure?

736
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:42,766
I can do even more than that.

737
01:12:44,628 --> 01:12:45,926
Kla!

738
01:12:46,525 --> 01:12:49,006
- Do you still dare to come back? - Khim, watch out.

739
01:12:51,566 --> 01:12:53,646
Go back to wherever you're from!

740
01:12:53,747 --> 01:12:54,966
Khim, back off.

741
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,430
Kla, enough.

742
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,061
Kla, let's go.

743
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:12,366
Do you want to go see a doctor?

744
01:13:14,684 --> 01:13:15,886
It's alright.

745
01:13:18,509 --> 01:13:19,966
Don't let Dad know about this.

746
01:13:22,686 --> 01:13:24,606
Why did they do that?

747
01:13:27,246 --> 01:13:28,846
Because we hate each other.

748
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:38,046
But don't worry.

749
01:13:38,646 --> 01:13:40,246
They wouldn't dare to come to our home.

750
01:13:47,678 --> 01:13:49,606
I already know who you're talking about.

751
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:52,222
They're Kla's old enemies.

752
01:13:56,038 --> 01:13:58,366
Do you know about Kla's old crime?

753
01:14:00,726 --> 01:14:04,286
That's it. The people downtown are afraid that Kla might come back.

754
01:14:07,414 --> 01:14:10,246
What happened back then?

755
01:14:10,581 --> 01:14:13,526
I heard it's an assault.

756
01:14:15,503 --> 01:14:18,526
Do you think Kla and I look similar?

757
01:14:19,804 --> 01:14:21,846
I knew it. You're wrong though.

758
01:14:22,094 --> 01:14:24,686
Kla and I have different fathers.

759
01:14:24,886 --> 01:14:26,888
Kla has another mother.

760
01:14:27,007 --> 01:14:30,152
When we were children, Kla looked like a foreigner.

761
01:14:30,277 --> 01:14:34,108
They liked to tease him when our dad adopted him.

762
01:14:34,247 --> 01:14:37,806
Some people said Kla was a bastard child.

763
01:14:40,721 --> 01:14:42,806
Go out and practice with it.

764
01:14:43,766 --> 01:14:48,726
You have to be able to use it while you close your eyes.

765
01:14:49,696 --> 01:14:50,696
Hey.

766
01:14:51,173 --> 01:14:52,606
What's up, you spoiled kid?

767
01:14:53,678 --> 01:14:56,126
Don't pay them any attention. Let's go, Kla.

768
01:14:57,454 --> 01:14:59,686
Are you taking him to do a DNA test?

769
01:15:00,277 --> 01:15:01,806
We already knew from his face.

770
01:15:01,982 --> 01:15:04,206
His mother has slept with someone else.

771
01:15:04,358 --> 01:15:06,006
- What did you say? - No, Kla.

772
01:15:07,197 --> 01:15:10,046
Didn't you hear me? I'll say it again.

773
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:12,846
Your mother had an affair.

774
01:15:13,463 --> 01:15:15,046
You're handsome like an angel.

775
01:15:15,206 --> 01:15:17,623
A symbol of your mother's affair.

776
01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:20,606
- Don't, Kla. - How is it your business?

777
01:15:23,366 --> 01:15:24,526
Don't, Kla.

778
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,486
Don't let me see you again.

779
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:44,406
(Kla heavily injured that prick.)

780
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:48,846
(He could be that arrogant because he's a son of a local politician.)

781
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,646
(We're renting his land for our farm.)

782
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:54,126
(He thought he could look down on us.)

783
01:15:55,429 --> 01:16:00,446
(Kla got arrested for attempted murder and was sent to juvenile hall.)

784
01:16:01,214 --> 01:16:04,126
(He couldn't bear seeing his dad get insulted.)

785
01:16:04,774 --> 01:16:08,286
(After that incident, we got chased off from that land.)

786
01:16:08,805 --> 01:16:12,726
(Dad sold all of his properties to pay for his treatment.)

787
01:16:13,038 --> 01:16:14,966
(We had to move here.)

788
01:16:15,398 --> 01:16:18,512
(Dad and Mom were in a tough spot at that time.)

789
01:16:19,606 --> 01:16:20,778
(Mom was sick.)

790
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:22,926
(Mom wouldn't go to the hospital.)

791
01:16:23,365 --> 01:16:24,966
(Kla blamed himself)

792
01:16:25,142 --> 01:16:26,766
(for making our family poor.)

793
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:30,406
(Before Kla's sentence was up,)

794
01:16:31,052 --> 01:16:32,606
(Mom had passed away.)

795
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:35,646
(Mom left Kla to Dad)

796
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,925
(while he's on parole.)

797
01:17:02,006 --> 01:17:03,366
Why did you have to run away?

798
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,526
If you don't study, will you have your future?

799
01:17:08,973 --> 01:17:11,406
It's useless if we're still poor like this.

800
01:17:13,437 --> 01:17:15,566
Are you going to be like what they said about you?

801
01:17:18,446 --> 01:17:19,726
You'll see.

802
01:17:20,309 --> 01:17:21,606
I'll prove them wrong.

803
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:24,686
I won't make you and Mom feel ashamed that you have a son like me.

804
01:17:25,325 --> 01:17:27,748
We won't live like this anymore.

805
01:17:28,046 --> 01:17:30,126
Our future can't end like this, Dad.

806
01:17:35,966 --> 01:17:38,526
(Dad wanted Kla to come back to our home,)

807
01:17:39,244 --> 01:17:40,726
(but Kla didn't want to.)

808
01:17:41,222 --> 01:17:46,286
(Kla went to work in Bangkok and sent some money back to us.)

809
01:17:46,766 --> 01:17:49,806
(He hoped Dad could live without shame.)

810
01:18:05,062 --> 01:18:08,526
(But Dad had never believed Kla would do honest work.)

811
01:18:08,686 --> 01:18:12,166
(He's worried that Kla might get into prison again.)

812
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:16,646
(So, all of the money that Kla had sent to him,)

813
01:18:17,038 --> 01:18:18,566
(Dad had never used it,)

814
01:18:18,853 --> 01:18:20,853
(but he kept it in Kla's account.)

815
01:18:21,214 --> 01:18:24,366
(Dad didn't agree that Kla is using money to try to prove himself.)

816
01:18:24,789 --> 01:18:26,206
(Since then,)

817
01:18:26,885 --> 01:18:28,618
(Kla couldn't face Dad.)

818
01:18:29,518 --> 01:18:32,406
(Dad wanted Kla to continue his study,)

819
01:18:32,788 --> 01:18:35,526
(but Kla doesn't think an academic degree is important.)

820
01:18:35,829 --> 01:18:38,406
(He thought if he had enough money,)

821
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:40,661
(no one could look down on us anymore.)

822
01:18:40,853 --> 01:18:43,726
So, he's making a living off of his garage.

823
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:48,166
Dad and Kla believe in different things.

824
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:53,028
Actually, those two

825
01:18:53,173 --> 01:18:55,646
can sacrifice themselves for others.

826
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:02,166
Dad gave everything up

827
01:19:02,606 --> 01:19:04,206
to save our family.

828
01:19:04,566 --> 01:19:07,166
Kla didn't stay with the family

829
01:19:07,317 --> 01:19:09,166
to improve our standard of living.

830
01:19:12,446 --> 01:19:14,006
If we don't look at their faces,

831
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,915
those two are extremely similar to each other.

832
01:19:17,066 --> 01:19:20,326
Kla got almost everything from Dad.

833
01:19:22,701 --> 01:19:25,046
Especially his devotion for his loved ones.

834
01:19:58,782 --> 01:19:59,782
Khim.

835
01:20:07,029 --> 01:20:08,166
I'm sorry.

836
01:20:08,526 --> 01:20:09,749
They don't have any parts,

837
01:20:09,887 --> 01:20:11,646
so I can't repair your laptop yet.

838
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:14,070
It's alright.

839
01:20:14,223 --> 01:20:15,566
When I stay here,

840
01:20:15,743 --> 01:20:17,166
I won't get to use it.

841
01:20:17,741 --> 01:20:19,046
I'll buy a new one.

842
01:20:29,348 --> 01:20:32,517
While you're staying here, you can use this instead.

843
01:20:42,286 --> 01:20:44,446
Oh, it's with you?

844
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:47,886
You left it with me, so I kept it for you.

845
01:20:49,926 --> 01:20:51,046
Thank you.

846
01:20:51,178 --> 01:20:54,326
This is really important to me.

847
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,600
When I go to a place and I like it,

848
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:59,846
I'll sketch the place and keep it here.

849
01:21:00,261 --> 01:21:04,206
This notebook is like the note that keeps all of my happiness.

850
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:06,006
Everything I love

851
01:21:06,709 --> 01:21:08,086
is in here.

852
01:21:09,446 --> 01:21:10,566
Good.

853
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:13,742
I also have something to keep my happiness.

854
01:21:14,511 --> 01:21:15,511
Where?

855
01:21:15,741 --> 01:21:16,918
Right here.

856
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:19,966
And also here.

857
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:24,070
From now on,

858
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:27,326
you probably have a lot of things to record.

859
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,036
Your big head will become huge from now on.

860
01:21:31,143 --> 01:21:34,046
Your heart will also become happy.

861
01:21:38,846 --> 01:21:39,901
That's good then.

862
01:21:56,453 --> 01:22:00,526
I can't believe that building one whole house can be this easy.

863
01:22:00,814 --> 01:22:03,526
We can save money and not incur any debt from it.

864
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,537
We pay installments for 20 to 30 years to own a house,

865
01:22:06,725 --> 01:22:08,586
or we can also live like this.

866
01:22:27,926 --> 01:22:29,126
Khim, let's step it.

867
01:22:29,471 --> 01:22:30,526
This way.

868
01:22:31,174 --> 01:22:34,246
- Step on this? - Yes, on the chaff. Mix it together.

869
01:22:35,214 --> 01:22:38,446
Yeah. Step it strongly like that.

870
01:22:40,886 --> 01:22:43,601
Just step on it with all your strength.

871
01:22:43,695 --> 01:22:44,846
Slowly.

872
01:22:45,766 --> 01:22:48,046
- Like this. - Are you trying to tease me?

873
01:22:48,257 --> 01:22:49,646
Step on it.

874
01:23:55,086 --> 01:23:56,246
Push it like this.

875
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:00,576
Let's go.

876
01:24:01,633 --> 01:24:04,166
- Lift it. One, two, three. - One, two, three.

877
01:24:12,405 --> 01:24:13,405
Sorry.

878
01:24:14,357 --> 01:24:15,486
That's normal.

879
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:17,459
- Just that? - Yes.

880
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:19,402
- Can I try it? - Sure.

881
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:32,286
Did you just...

882
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:33,966
No.

883
01:24:35,126 --> 01:24:36,461
- You're all dirty. - Clean it off.

884
01:24:36,548 --> 01:24:38,151
I'm cleaning it off.

885
01:24:38,342 --> 01:24:39,509
That's a lot.

886
01:24:39,946 --> 01:24:43,126
- Properly clean it, Khim. - I'll scrub it off.

887
01:24:44,277 --> 01:24:45,606
It's all gone.

888
01:24:45,926 --> 01:24:48,126
- This isn't it. - Huh?

889
01:24:52,348 --> 01:24:53,526
- No. - Khim.

890
01:24:53,749 --> 01:24:55,486
- Where are you going? - Let me go.

891
01:24:56,702 --> 01:24:58,685
- Did you just pull a prank? - Don't come.

892
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,522
No. I'm sorry. I don't want it.

893
01:25:01,749 --> 01:25:02,909
Khim.

894
01:25:03,406 --> 01:25:04,406
Where are you going?

895
01:25:04,959 --> 01:25:06,286
You pulled a prank on me.

896
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,920
Why does this soap smell so nice?

897
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:01,926
Sit down.

898
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:04,926
Vanilla's smell?

899
01:26:10,148 --> 01:26:12,126
It kinda smells like orange.

900
01:26:14,422 --> 01:26:16,566
Yeah. The smell will last for long.

901
01:26:17,476 --> 01:26:18,806
I kinda want to eat it.

902
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:22,406
Hey.

903
01:26:23,138 --> 01:26:27,326
I know what you're thinking. Stop that.

904
01:26:28,816 --> 01:26:29,886
Give me water.

905
01:26:34,293 --> 01:26:35,326
This one?

906
01:26:42,446 --> 01:26:43,806
You can get me back.

907
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,126
Get me back.

908
01:26:47,646 --> 01:26:48,886
Give it to me.

909
01:26:49,853 --> 01:26:51,686
Hit it hard. I don't mind.

910
01:26:55,366 --> 01:26:58,206
(We always think of someone when we hear a song,)

911
01:26:58,686 --> 01:27:00,286
(when we read a book,)

912
01:27:00,726 --> 01:27:02,486
(when we watch a movie.)

913
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:04,486
(The truth is,)

914
01:27:04,806 --> 01:27:07,646
(we might only become their memories one day.)

915
01:27:08,487 --> 01:27:09,926
(Don't be too afraid.)

916
01:27:10,526 --> 01:27:12,926
(Keep every second of happiness to yourself.)

917
01:27:25,222 --> 01:27:27,406
There won't be Saikhim Kidakarn anymore.

918
01:27:27,846 --> 01:27:29,566
There'll only be Saikhim Chayodom.

919
01:27:30,046 --> 01:27:33,406
My love for Khim can't decrease. It can only go through 100 percent.

920
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:37,886
He tricked Saikhim to register their marriage. He wants money.

921
01:27:38,046 --> 01:27:39,246
- Khem. - Kla.

922
01:27:39,366 --> 01:27:41,726
If he's arrested by the police, Saikhim has no place left.

923
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:44,111
Do you want me to take Saikhim back?

924
01:27:44,246 --> 01:27:47,406
What should we do? We can't transfer the money in time.

925
01:27:47,566 --> 01:27:48,886
I would like to talk with you.

926
01:27:49,077 --> 01:27:51,611
The university has received a report.

927
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,646
It concerns the approval of your scholarship.
