1
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:01,093
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,174 --> 00:00:02,331
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,412 --> 00:00:03,531
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:44,886
Do you know

5
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,326
that Kla isn't my real son?

6
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:51,886
His garage was dealing with tax-evading vehicles.

7
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:53,220
If he's arrested by the police,

8
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:54,926
Saikhim has no place left.

9
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:56,566
Please marry me, Khim.

10
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,446
I won't disappoint you

11
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:01,166
for throwing away your future to live with me.

12
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,566
This day is the first day of your life as a husband

13
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,086
and wife legally.

14
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:07,526
To make you get used to it.

15
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,806
If you're embarrassed, you'll be punished.

16
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:11,006
You closed the account?

17
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:12,246
Where is the money?

18
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:14,166
I gave it to Khem to open...

19
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:17,406
I gave him my money because I got a job to go observe a power plant.

20
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:20,246
I'll go to Laos with engineers.

21
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:22,166
I want to get money to pay back for that

22
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,646
before our kid is born.

23
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:25,006
(I've learned that)

24
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:28,766
(love is the most unstable when there's doubt.)

25
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,046
(Love will be stable)

26
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,917
(when there's trust.)

27
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:02,355
Hey, what are you looking at?

28
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,686
How did you come here?

29
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:08,766
I wanted to surprise you.

30
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,646
Surprise?

31
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:14,606
What if I got shocked to death?

32
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:16,806
The ghost of a pregnant lady would be scary.

33
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:20,006
That's not funny.

34
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:25,206
Are you really angry?

35
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,446
We haven't seen each other for a month.

36
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:36,126
I miss you so much.

37
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,606
Why are you making that face?

38
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:23,606
Let me see.

39
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,558
Put it down.

40
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,526
Why aren't you getting fatter?

41
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:38,326
Have you eaten any meal? My child,

42
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:40,126
are you hungry?

43
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,166
Mom didn't eat enough food.

44
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:45,966
Why is your mother like this?

45
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,406
Don't worry.

46
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:51,706
Your dad is back.

47
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:53,086
You won't starve now.

48
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,126
I have a souvenir.

49
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,126
You have a souvenir?

50
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:09,246
To replace your old broken laptop.

51
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:10,886
I have money.

52
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:12,806
I will pay the installments for you.

53
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:15,086
Thank you.

54
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:18,246
I'll use it as much as possible.

55
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,886
I'll have to go back next week.

56
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:30,526
To find a route between the mountain.

57
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:32,726
This time is probably more tiring.

58
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:35,766
Are you going there again?

59
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:38,606
We only have one week.

60
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,966
I'll fatten up both you and our child.

61
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,166
What did you do?

62
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:48,366
Why is your hand so dirty?

63
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:50,326
There are soils on your hand.

64
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:52,463
I've been working.

65
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,206
I'm already back.

66
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:58,366
I'll allow you to be a lady again.

67
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:26,620
- Make it clean. - Yes.

68
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,126
Get her soft hand back.

69
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,806
Make it smoother than my face.

70
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,966
Are you newlyweds?

71
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:35,063
You're so lovey-dovey.

72
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,446
Sorry. My honeymoon phase will be over 10 years.

73
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,799
Over 10 years? Please live to the end of this year first.

74
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:46,166
Give me your hand, please.

75
00:07:57,406 --> 00:07:58,406
What?

76
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,206
Does he have a lover?

77
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:17,486
I'm sorry.

78
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,086
Yes, Oun?

79
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,803
(Ms. Khim, I'm calling you to tell you the news.)

80
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:31,357
I heard that Mr. Sin fall sick.

81
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,446
What's wrong with Dad?

82
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:36,286
Sir just collapsed.

83
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:38,296
It's probably because of his blood pressure.

84
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:41,366
(The doctor said he needs to be careful of a cerebral hemorrhage.)

85
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:44,206
Is Dad alright?

86
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:46,326
He just left the hospital.

87
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:50,446
I heard he'll go to recuperate at his friend's farm near yours.

88
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:53,606
Really?

89
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,246
Ms. Khim,

90
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:57,326
won't you go and visit him?

91
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:04,846
Does Dad really want to see me, Oun?

92
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:18,766
You know it's risky. Why did you accept this job?

93
00:09:19,112 --> 00:09:21,526
How could I do any honest job?

94
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:23,766
When I tried to open my garage, I got scammed.

95
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:25,566
Is it worth it to risk it?

96
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,166
I accepted this job

97
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,126
(Because it's near your home.)

98
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:31,247
(We just have to drive a car through the border.)

99
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:32,966
When the delivery is done,

100
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:35,286
we'll get the money.

101
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:40,086
I can't do it.

102
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,080
I promised Khim I would never do anything bad again.

103
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:44,326
Okay.

104
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:46,886
I can do it myself.

105
00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:50,366
Khem, if you really do have a money problem,

106
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:52,566
I'll try to borrow some money.

107
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,446
(Don't risk yourself.)

108
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,166
It's alright.

109
00:09:57,886 --> 00:09:59,486
I don't want to owe you anymore.

110
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,606
Khem.

111
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:39,886
I've charged the battery for you.

112
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,686
Prepare it before going into the forest so we can contact each other.

113
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,446
I like it when someone is worried about me.

114
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:52,886
Don't complain when I call you all the time.

115
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:06,846
How can I bring this reserve battery with me?

116
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,206
When I'm tired, I get more strength when I think of you.

117
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:13,326
I don't know how I'll get a life force.

118
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:16,766
I want you to stay beside me to charge me up.

119
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:20,726
Then,

120
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,573
I'll charge you up with my energy.

121
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:26,766
What?

122
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:29,646
I just came back. The energy isn't enough.

123
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:31,286
I'm still tired.

124
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:32,846
What should I do?

125
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:36,646
Can I reserve my battery energy?

126
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:24,166
You don't have to send me off.

127
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:25,846
You don't have to travel far.

128
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:27,606
Sending me off here is enough.

129
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:32,886
Take care of yourself.

130
00:12:33,597 --> 00:12:35,686
Dad, don't overwork yourself.

131
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:01,966
Wait.

132
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,513
It's so cute, Khim.

133
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:14,446
Come back quickly.

134
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,046
Take care of yourself, Khim.

135
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:27,646
Take care.

136
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,133
Bye.

137
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:51,246
Do you want to send off your dad?

138
00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:53,766
Kla!

139
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,286
Kla!

140
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:19,606
(Kla, our child is kicking.)

141
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:31,166
Why are there so many police today?

142
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:34,726
Did something happen?

143
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:39,486
I guess they're arresting a smuggler again.

144
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:45,646
Khem.

145
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:15,006
- Go that way first. - What?

146
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:16,725
Aren't you going to the border?

147
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:19,006
I have an errand. Please go that way first.

148
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:32,526
Okay. Please park over there.

149
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:36,406
You can go first.

150
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:45,886
Khem, are you around here?

151
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:47,822
Khem.

152
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,326
- Khem. - Kla.

153
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:54,130
- How did you get here? - What are you doing?

154
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:57,046
The police are here. Don't take the car with you.

155
00:15:57,802 --> 00:16:00,326
A gun. There's a gun here.

156
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:02,726
Stop! Stay still! Don't move!

157
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:07,406
Run, Khem!

158
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,646
Kla...

159
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,366
Don't move!

160
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:11,886
Drop the weapon!

161
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:20,926
What should we do?

162
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:22,247
Give me the gun.

163
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:23,606
Stay still.

164
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:36,206
Don't move.

165
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,406
Drop the weapon slowly.

166
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,566
- Get in the car, Khem! - We're doing that?

167
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,726
No, Kla.

168
00:17:23,012 --> 00:17:24,886
Sir is recuperating here

169
00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:27,126
and I heard you're living here.

170
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,026
I'm here to pick you up to go and meet sir.

171
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:33,686
Does Dad really want to see me?

172
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:39,366
I'm afraid if Dad sees me,

173
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,438
he might lose it.

174
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,336
Do you think we could escape when there are that many of them?

175
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:58,286
Do you want to die in jail?

176
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,246
What should we do?

177
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:02,926
We can't take the car with us.

178
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:27,446
This way. We still have some escape routes.

179
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:32,126
- Kla, the police. - Stop! We're the police!

180
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:34,326
Khem, quick.

181
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,006
They're catching us.

182
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:38,366
Stop!

183
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:48,886
Quick, Kla.

184
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:03,046
Reporting. Requesting reinforcement. The culprits are escaping by boat.

185
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,046
Hurry up.

186
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:35,686
Go, go, go.

187
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:42,686
Kla, the police. There are police there.

188
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,806
Turn around.

189
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,566
It's from my family.

190
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:20,206
Please park the car.

191
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:30,046
Uncle.

192
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:34,180
Is something wrong?

193
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,446
It's Kla.

194
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:37,326
He didn't go to the border.

195
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,046
He caused trouble again.

196
00:21:58,422 --> 00:22:00,126
You can't go in. It's dangerous.

197
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:03,126
You can't go in.

198
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:07,006
- Kla! - Excuse me.

199
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:09,077
- Kla! - You can't go in.

200
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:11,166
Officer, my son is in there.

201
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:13,486
- It's dangerous. - Can I go in there?

202
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:15,406
You can't go in. It's dangerous.

203
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:18,246
We've surrounded the suspects.

204
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:21,566
- They can't get away. - We're done for, Kla.

205
00:22:24,117 --> 00:22:25,301
Turn yourself in.

206
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,606
- Ms. Khim. - It's dangerous inside.

207
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:32,846
Can I go in there?

208
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,469
You can't. It's dangerous.

209
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:54,886
- Khem! - (A culprit got shot.)

210
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:00,926
Put your hands up.

211
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,733
You can't run away.

212
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,726
Use the boat.

213
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:26,846
Uncle...

214
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:36,406
(If he resists, we can't keep him alive.)

215
00:24:00,094 --> 00:24:01,126
Khem.

216
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,206
Khem, wake up.

217
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:09,606
Stop.

218
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:13,917
Don't be a coward.

219
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:18,326
Put your hands up and turn yourself in.

220
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,246
Khem, you can't leave me like this.

221
00:24:23,246 --> 00:24:24,966
(Reporting.)

222
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:27,886
(Our spy is dead.)

223
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:29,846
Spy?

224
00:24:35,581 --> 00:24:37,161
We just want Saikhim back.

225
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:40,606
We want Kaokla to admit that he kidnapped the girl.

226
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:44,886
We'll try to help you with your garage's case.

227
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:50,526
Make Kaokla turn himself in

228
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:52,686
and return the daughter to her dad

229
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:55,206
if you don't want to die in prison.

230
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,022
I'm sorry.

231
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:05,366
Listen, we have all of your items.

232
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:07,326
With this clear-cut evidence,

233
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:08,886
just turn yourself in.

234
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,366
Why did you do it?

235
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,366
Why?

236
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:15,246
I didn't think it would be like this.

237
00:25:15,966 --> 00:25:18,286
I'm sorry.

238
00:25:18,854 --> 00:25:20,966
Don't resist! Don't run away!

239
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:22,926
Why did you do it, Khem?

240
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:30,246
If I can't be good,

241
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:31,926
I'll be horrible now!

242
00:25:36,154 --> 00:25:37,246
No!

243
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:58,526
Go.

244
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:01,326
Please back off.

245
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:03,846
Please back off.

246
00:27:20,246 --> 00:27:21,331
Dad.

247
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:25,326
Are you alright?

248
00:27:28,757 --> 00:27:29,966
How is Kla?

249
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,781
He must pay for what he has done.

250
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:37,606
Is Kla alright?

251
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,981
- I want to see him. - Khim.

252
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,326
You must stay here.

253
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:45,446
Hey, even if he survives,

254
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,926
he won't get away from prison. You too.

255
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,966
You might get arrested

256
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,440
if you don't break up with him.

257
00:27:51,948 --> 00:27:53,686
Kla didn't do anything.

258
00:27:53,886 --> 00:27:56,486
He promised he would turn over a new leaf.

259
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,926
People are used to what they have.

260
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,966
Even if he promised you,

261
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:04,046
do you know what he's doing behind your back?

262
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:10,966
Look.

263
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,901
He sent this and threatened me

264
00:28:15,983 --> 00:28:17,366
that he'll leak this clip.

265
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:19,286
He also said that

266
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:22,766
he wouldn't take responsibility for your kid.

267
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:25,606
That's why he kept a distance from you.

268
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:28,089
That's not true.

269
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:31,695
- That's not true. I have to go see Kla. - Khim.

270
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:34,246
Khim, listen to me.

271
00:28:34,906 --> 00:28:37,046
You didn't even know him well.

272
00:28:37,446 --> 00:28:38,606
You didn't love him.

273
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,166
You've never loved him. You just got tricked.

274
00:28:43,006 --> 00:28:45,006
- That's not true. - Khim.

275
00:28:45,397 --> 00:28:47,436
Khim, you didn't love him. You got tricked.

276
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:49,286
You got tricked. Trust me.

277
00:28:49,565 --> 00:28:50,972
Trust me.

278
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,006
I won't let you go anywhere.

279
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:57,046
He must pay for his crime.

280
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:11,442
Dad.

281
00:29:12,493 --> 00:29:15,406
Khem, your employee, is safe now.

282
00:29:17,476 --> 00:29:18,566
What about Khim?

283
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:20,046
Her dad took her away.

284
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:21,886
I got framed.

285
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,246
They set me up

286
00:29:24,486 --> 00:29:25,806
to take Khim back.

287
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:29,446
The item from the culprit.

288
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:36,406
You got the paycheck. You still claim you've been set up?

289
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:40,806
Take him for interrogation.

290
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,566
Hey, Kla!

291
00:30:26,343 --> 00:30:27,646
- He's running away! - Kla!

292
00:30:27,774 --> 00:30:29,726
- Catch him! - Kla!

293
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:37,882
Stop!

294
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:47,806
Stop! Drop the weapon!

295
00:30:50,157 --> 00:30:51,366
Drop the weapon!

296
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,166
Drop it!

297
00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:05,646
It's your doing, right?

298
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:11,046
Kla! Kla!

299
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:12,886
You framed me!

300
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:14,526
Don't believe him, Khim.

301
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:18,286
I didn't do anything wrong. You can't arrest me.

302
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:20,166
He wants to separate us.

303
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,806
I promised Khim. Why would I break my promise?

304
00:31:24,243 --> 00:31:26,151
- Don't cause troubles. - It's not your business!

305
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,406
Stop right now.

306
00:31:27,797 --> 00:31:29,006
Drop the weapon.

307
00:31:30,732 --> 00:31:32,406
He used Khem to lure me out

308
00:31:32,846 --> 00:31:34,846
and tried to kill him to silence him.

309
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:36,246
Are you crazy?

310
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,526
Put your hands up and turn in yourself.

311
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:43,206
Arrest him. The one who hired me is him.

312
00:31:45,126 --> 00:31:47,726
Did he bribe you to make you stand still like this?

313
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:51,246
This is my last warning. I'll have to take drastic measures now.

314
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:57,126
Don't do anything to him.

315
00:31:57,686 --> 00:31:58,726
Khim.

316
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:01,966
Do you believe in me, that I was framed?

317
00:32:05,054 --> 00:32:06,126
I believe you.

318
00:32:06,255 --> 00:32:07,806
- I believe you. - Come back to me.

319
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,366
Come back to me.

320
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:14,006
- Three. - Khim, watch out.

321
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,485
He's using you as his tool.

322
00:32:24,598 --> 00:32:25,646
I didn't do it.

323
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:27,246
I swear.

324
00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:32,046
He's holding my daughter as his hostage.

325
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:33,926
Khim, do you trust me?

326
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:38,926
Kla, don't do this.

327
00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:42,046
We can help solve the problem together.

328
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:47,726
What are you doing?

329
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:49,166
What are you afraid of?

330
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:51,686
Do you think I'll hurt you?

331
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:54,646
Kla!

332
00:32:55,686 --> 00:32:57,500
- He's going to kill my daughter. - Mr. Sin, no.

333
00:32:57,748 --> 00:32:59,422
They're trying to reconcile.

334
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:02,357
Kla.

335
00:33:02,942 --> 00:33:04,646
Kla, please don't do this.

336
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:06,646
Do I look that horrible to you?

337
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:10,286
It's as painful as when I was stabbed.

338
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:13,246
It came from your stare.

339
00:33:15,469 --> 00:33:17,206
Do you want to know how much it hurts?

340
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:21,566
Kla.

341
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:24,246
Kla, let it go.

342
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:25,926
I beg you.

343
00:33:27,144 --> 00:33:28,526
Let it go, Khim.

344
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,606
Kla, calm down.

345
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,181
Kla.

346
00:33:36,678 --> 00:33:39,893
Kla, calm down. Don't do this, I beg you.

347
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:40,974
Let it go.

348
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:43,086
- Kla, enough. - Khim.

349
00:33:43,364 --> 00:33:45,326
- Mr. Sin, no. - Kla, calm down.

350
00:33:45,454 --> 00:33:46,966
Kla, stop.

351
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,709
- No! - No!

352
00:33:53,086 --> 00:33:54,206
Kloy!

353
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:01,774
Kloy!

354
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,366
Officer, my daughter got shot.

355
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:06,926
Who hurt my sister?

356
00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:08,486
Why did you shoot her?

357
00:34:08,743 --> 00:34:10,726
- Kloy! - Kloy!

358
00:34:10,885 --> 00:34:14,206
Kloy! Why did you hurt her? Let me go!

359
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:16,806
Kloy! Kloy!

360
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:18,966
Let me go.

361
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:22,486
- Why did you hurt her? - Quick!

362
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:24,766
Be strong.

363
00:34:25,677 --> 00:34:27,006
Kloy!

364
00:34:28,606 --> 00:34:29,806
Kloy!

365
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:49,614
You must be satisfied now.

366
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,246
The only thing I've done wrong

367
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,126
is to love a woman like you!

368
00:36:31,846 --> 00:36:35,006
She hasn't eaten or slept. She hasn't said a word.

369
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:37,966
If it continues like this,

370
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:41,086
Ms. Khim's body will be in danger.

371
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:43,126
The doctor said she's stressed.

372
00:36:43,396 --> 00:36:44,926
It only affects her body.

373
00:36:46,886 --> 00:36:49,046
If her mind is better, everything will be better.

374
00:36:54,486 --> 00:36:57,366
But it doesn't look like she can accept it anytime soon.

375
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,366
If this goes on,

376
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:02,966
I don't think Ms. Khim can take it before she gives birth.

377
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:05,326
We must find a way to help her.

378
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,030
I want my old daughter back.

379
00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:19,933
Dad.

380
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,166
Dad.

381
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:25,926
How is Kloy?

382
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,926
She hasn't woken up.

383
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:35,326
Endure it for a bit more.

384
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,806
I'm using our farm's deed to get your bail.

385
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:43,606
You haven't asked me

386
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:45,606
if I have really done it.

387
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:48,206
I've raised you myself.

388
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:51,166
Why wouldn't I know who you are?

389
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,086
Even if you really did it,

390
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,806
it couldn't change the fact that we're father and son.

391
00:38:00,926 --> 00:38:02,486
No matter how you are,

392
00:38:02,998 --> 00:38:04,766
I'll protect you.

393
00:38:08,485 --> 00:38:10,686
Why are you so nice to me, Dad?

394
00:38:14,454 --> 00:38:16,454
I'm not even your real son.

395
00:38:17,173 --> 00:38:19,526
Kloy is the one who you should help.

396
00:38:21,158 --> 00:38:23,646
You shouldn't have paid for my crime.

397
00:38:30,926 --> 00:38:32,206
If you're bad,

398
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,846
you wouldn't be like this.

399
00:38:37,806 --> 00:38:39,206
But you're nice.

400
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:43,646
You're too nice.

401
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:48,646
Even if no one loves you,

402
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:51,046
you still have your dad who loves you

403
00:38:52,126 --> 00:38:54,126
and will stay by your side forever.

404
00:38:57,549 --> 00:38:59,766
If she can't love who you are,

405
00:39:01,596 --> 00:39:02,766
maybe

406
00:39:03,629 --> 00:39:05,206
it's not love.

407
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:14,846
I'm sorry, Dad.

408
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:48,286
(Kla.)

409
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,766
(Kla, don't do this.)

410
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:52,606
(Do I look that horrible to you?)

411
00:39:52,702 --> 00:39:55,966
(He sent it to me and threatened that he'll leak this clip. He also said)

412
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,526
(he wouldn't take responsibility for your kid.)

413
00:40:00,926 --> 00:40:02,526
(It's as painful as when I was stabbed.)

414
00:40:03,606 --> 00:40:05,366
(It came from your stare.)

415
00:40:05,726 --> 00:40:07,326
(Do you want to know how much it hurts?)

416
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:19,686
- Kla. - You must be satisfied now.

417
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:21,406
The only thing I've done wrong

418
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:23,206
is to love a woman like you!

419
00:40:31,717 --> 00:40:33,246
If you want to entrust your life to me,

420
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:35,006
we must trust each other.

421
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,726
That's how we will survive.

422
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:43,646
Is the kid alright?

423
00:40:43,766 --> 00:40:45,966
I want you to change your mind and give the kid to me.

424
00:40:47,726 --> 00:40:49,126
I can raise one kid.

425
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,646
Can you show it to me?

426
00:40:52,046 --> 00:40:54,046
How would you raise him?

427
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,846
If you can raise him,

428
00:40:56,668 --> 00:40:58,406
I'll give him to you.

429
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,046
Get in.

430
00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:11,606
Kla.

431
00:41:27,788 --> 00:41:29,788
I'm sorry.

432
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,766
I'm sorry I betrayed you.

433
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:38,366
They used me to bait you out.

434
00:41:39,742 --> 00:41:41,326
They said

435
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:43,806
if you return Saikhim to them,

436
00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:48,126
they would clear off our crime.

437
00:41:52,566 --> 00:41:53,966
They just want to get me back.

438
00:41:54,502 --> 00:41:56,502
If possible, they might want to kill me.

439
00:41:57,326 --> 00:41:59,326
You got in trouble because of me.

440
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,206
No.

441
00:42:01,495 --> 00:42:05,606
Kla, punch me. Kla.

442
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:07,526
Punch me.

443
00:42:07,676 --> 00:42:09,566
Punch me, Kla.

444
00:42:10,686 --> 00:42:14,886
Punch me as much as you want. Punch me.

445
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:17,166
Kla.

446
00:42:17,845 --> 00:42:19,006
Kla.

447
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,846
Kla.

448
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:23,526
Kla, kick me.

449
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,406
Kick me.

450
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:30,846
You scoundrel!

451
00:42:32,614 --> 00:42:34,926
Do you want to become like before again?

452
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,966
Khem.

453
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:40,086
My dad and Kloy have nothing to do with this.

454
00:42:41,822 --> 00:42:44,126
Why did we drag them and get them involved with our crime?

455
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:46,286
I'm horrible.

456
00:42:46,853 --> 00:42:47,960
What do you want me to do?

457
00:42:48,055 --> 00:42:49,566
They didn't do anything.

458
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:54,006
We can't drag them and ruin their lives like this.

459
00:42:54,429 --> 00:42:55,486
Do you know

460
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:57,086
that because of me,

461
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,646
how tough my dad's and sister's lives are?

462
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,766
How could I face them now? Tell me, Khem!

463
00:43:06,524 --> 00:43:08,726
Can't our lives be better?

464
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:12,526
(Seven years ago)

465
00:43:12,905 --> 00:43:14,006
Hey.

466
00:43:16,464 --> 00:43:18,126
You're arrogant on your first day.

467
00:43:21,805 --> 00:43:23,006
Go.

468
00:43:23,782 --> 00:43:25,446
Respect your seniors.

469
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:29,766
Don't be arrogant.

470
00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:37,226
Hey.

471
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:41,166
What are you looking at? Do you want it again?

472
00:43:46,566 --> 00:43:47,686
Everyone.

473
00:43:49,142 --> 00:43:50,286
If you're hungry,

474
00:43:50,997 --> 00:43:52,997
you can eat my feet.

475
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,126
You're arrogant.

476
00:44:00,622 --> 00:44:02,046
What are you looking at?

477
00:44:02,246 --> 00:44:05,406
- Here they come. - Fight.

478
00:44:06,347 --> 00:44:07,589
What's wrong with you?

479
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:09,966
Hey, if you don't want to eat, I'll eat it.

480
00:44:18,326 --> 00:44:19,446
If you're haughty,

481
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,526
you won't get to eat for a week

482
00:44:22,205 --> 00:44:23,966
unless you beg those pricks.

483
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:29,446
Hey, he's eating it like a dog.

484
00:44:29,552 --> 00:44:31,406
Such a low-life being.

485
00:44:32,174 --> 00:44:33,606
Be haughty all you want

486
00:44:34,012 --> 00:44:35,286
if you don't mind being starved.

487
00:44:35,421 --> 00:44:38,286
This is so small compared to what you'll see after this.

488
00:44:38,607 --> 00:44:40,166
If you want to be a dog,

489
00:44:41,006 --> 00:44:44,406
you have to be a mad dog like me whom no one would bother.

490
00:44:49,966 --> 00:44:50,966
Wow.

491
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,926
Are you mad?

492
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:56,446
Come closer to me.

493
00:45:01,446 --> 00:45:02,566
Hey.

494
00:45:05,646 --> 00:45:06,846
You.

495
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:08,166
Don't.

496
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:10,046
I didn't mean it like this.

497
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:14,086
Hey, stop.

498
00:45:21,502 --> 00:45:25,006
Remember. Having food is already good enough.

499
00:45:25,414 --> 00:45:26,886
As a juvenile criminal,

500
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:29,245
this is the best we can get.

501
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:32,326
Don't try to ask for more than your worth.

502
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:40,606
I've almost become good.

503
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:42,926
Why...

504
00:45:43,613 --> 00:45:45,966
Why do I have to be stuck here?

505
00:45:46,813 --> 00:45:48,646
I'm sorry, Kla.

506
00:45:52,637 --> 00:45:53,806
Kla.

507
00:45:55,414 --> 00:45:57,206
I'm sorry.

508
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:38,846
Please help my child.

509
00:46:39,038 --> 00:46:41,926
We'll get a doctor now. Don't worry, Ms. Khim.

510
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,526
Don't worry.

511
00:46:55,126 --> 00:46:57,462
Ms. Saikhim, can you tell me where it hurts?

512
00:46:57,925 --> 00:46:59,926
You can use your hand if you can't say it.

513
00:47:05,758 --> 00:47:07,166
- How is Khim? - Sir.

514
00:47:07,509 --> 00:47:08,909
Ms. Khim has internal bleeding.

515
00:47:09,007 --> 00:47:11,007
The doctor said she has a threatened abortion.

516
00:47:11,182 --> 00:47:13,366
Her HCG is extremely low.

517
00:47:13,494 --> 00:47:15,246
The only way to save the child

518
00:47:15,422 --> 00:47:17,526
is to give her hormones.

519
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:18,766
How is she?

520
00:47:19,717 --> 00:47:21,446
She is still bleeding.

521
00:47:21,677 --> 00:47:24,166
We still can see the child's life signal.

522
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,612
If we give her hormones, we might save the child.

523
00:47:26,693 --> 00:47:28,446
What about the mother?

524
00:47:29,518 --> 00:47:31,446
It's concerning if she's still bleeding.

525
00:47:31,566 --> 00:47:34,486
It's possible she might get septicemia.

526
00:47:34,654 --> 00:47:36,206
My daughter is still young.

527
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,726
Do anything it takes to save her.

528
00:47:39,206 --> 00:47:41,926
If you have to choose, I choose my daughter.

529
00:47:43,135 --> 00:47:44,326
What about the child?

530
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:45,806
Everyone loves their own child.

531
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:48,726
Is there anyone more important than Saikhim right now?

532
00:47:48,926 --> 00:47:50,726
Would Ms. Khim allow it?

533
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,406
The child might only have this much good karma.

534
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:56,046
Please try your best, Doctor.

535
00:47:56,381 --> 00:47:58,726
If it's not possible, we have to accept it.

536
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:02,766
We have to restore Saikhim's future.

537
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:04,646
In 10 years later,

538
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:07,246
she will be glad that she gets through today.

539
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:11,614
Can I count on you?

540
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,740
Yes.

541
00:48:47,286 --> 00:48:49,286
(Do you know that when I was a child,)

542
00:48:49,486 --> 00:48:51,246
(I pretended to be asleep)

543
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:55,046
to wait for you to carry me to my bedroom.

544
00:48:55,606 --> 00:48:59,166
But you've never carried me to my bed even once.

545
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,406
(Let alone carrying me.)

546
00:49:20,446 --> 00:49:23,566
(You probably don't want to look at my face anymore.)

547
00:49:58,006 --> 00:50:00,806
I'm sorry, Dad.

548
00:50:01,558 --> 00:50:02,806
It's alright.

549
00:50:04,446 --> 00:50:05,725
My good girl.

550
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,990
(After the arrest of the car smuggling suspect)

551
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,900
(near the border several days ago,)

552
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:37,646
(the court claimed the suspect had tried to escape)

553
00:50:37,886 --> 00:50:40,766
(and he's involved in the vehicles' tax-evasion case.)

554
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:44,486
(The court denied his bail and ordered him to stay in jail.)

555
00:50:44,646 --> 00:50:48,626
(The DSI will cooperate with the customs department...)

556
00:50:50,861 --> 00:50:51,926
Khim.

557
00:50:52,646 --> 00:50:54,006
Are you awake?

558
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:55,806
How are you?

559
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,326
Khim.

560
00:50:57,533 --> 00:50:58,774
It's over.

561
00:50:58,965 --> 00:51:00,526
There's nothing to be worried about.

562
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:08,406
That child

563
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,046
has left us.

564
00:51:13,678 --> 00:51:15,006
Don't blame yourself, Khim.

565
00:51:16,878 --> 00:51:18,726
It's not your fault.

566
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:21,846
You already did your best as a mother.

567
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:31,411
Well...

568
00:51:31,766 --> 00:51:33,126
Your dad...

569
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,839
He's afraid that you can't accept the situation.

570
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,406
He asked me to accompany you.

571
00:51:37,686 --> 00:51:39,366
Since you're already awake,

572
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:41,606
I'll go tell a nurse.

573
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:44,086
I'll be back.

574
00:51:46,614 --> 00:51:47,766
Wait.

575
00:51:50,645 --> 00:51:52,966
Lita, can you help me with something?

576
00:51:56,256 --> 00:51:58,256
I want to talk with Kla.

577
00:51:59,846 --> 00:52:03,686
I don't want to believe that he's been lying to me.

578
00:52:30,966 --> 00:52:33,126
Khim has already woken up

579
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:35,454
and she said she is really hungry.

580
00:52:35,567 --> 00:52:36,645
Really?

581
00:52:36,726 --> 00:52:39,467
I'm glad. I'll order a meal for her.

582
00:52:39,555 --> 00:52:40,566
Okay.

583
00:52:46,014 --> 00:52:47,846
Saikhim is lucky

584
00:52:48,526 --> 00:52:51,486
to have a friend like you. Uncle Sin must be so generous

585
00:52:51,765 --> 00:52:53,326
for still allowing you to be her friend.

586
00:52:53,526 --> 00:52:56,646
Haven't you heard? A friend is a family that we can choose.

587
00:52:56,921 --> 00:52:58,166
It's normal

588
00:52:58,366 --> 00:53:01,486
that Khim would be closer to an outsider than her relatives.

589
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:04,966
Really? I thought you wanted to upgrade yourself to be our relative.

590
00:53:10,126 --> 00:53:11,206
I'm Prompt.

591
00:53:11,765 --> 00:53:12,766
Prompt what?

592
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,246
Promptpat.

593
00:53:38,766 --> 00:53:42,086
Ounruen, I'll go have lunch downstairs.

594
00:53:42,814 --> 00:53:43,894
Sure.

595
00:53:44,086 --> 00:53:45,206
I'll go with you.

596
00:53:52,246 --> 00:53:53,566
One more bite?

597
00:53:56,846 --> 00:53:58,326
You won't eat it, Khim?

598
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,326
Khim.

599
00:54:01,157 --> 00:54:02,326
Are you full?

600
00:54:06,484 --> 00:54:07,606
Is she done?

601
00:54:07,773 --> 00:54:09,046
I'll clean them up.

602
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,526
She almost ate all of them.

603
00:54:11,629 --> 00:54:13,206
I'll clean them for you.

604
00:54:14,157 --> 00:54:15,246
It's alright, Oun.

605
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:16,603
I can clean them up.

606
00:54:16,684 --> 00:54:18,406
Thank you.

607
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:19,646
Sure.

608
00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:21,669
Do you want to have lunch?

609
00:54:24,526 --> 00:54:25,686
Okay.

610
00:54:34,883 --> 00:54:35,978
What are you doing?

611
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:45,566
It's her dinner.

612
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:48,086
Khim asked me to get it.

613
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:55,221
Please.

614
00:55:10,991 --> 00:55:12,246
(List of patient's meals.)

615
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:26,886
I'll stay in England with Khim for a while. Handle your work here.

616
00:55:28,013 --> 00:55:29,606
Don't worry about your work.

617
00:55:30,382 --> 00:55:31,646
You should worry about this.

618
00:55:33,566 --> 00:55:35,606
My people at the prison said

619
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:38,421
a stranger went to visit Kaokla.

620
00:55:39,515 --> 00:55:41,353
Do you know who it was?

621
00:55:48,366 --> 00:55:51,606
Hello, I would like to visit Mr. Kaokla Chayodom.

622
00:55:51,711 --> 00:55:52,966
Please let me check your handbag.

623
00:55:56,704 --> 00:55:57,726
I knew it.

624
00:55:58,046 --> 00:56:00,206
That girl would betray us.

625
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:10,486
I'm here to give you news.

626
00:56:11,437 --> 00:56:13,646
You wouldn't want to hear it that much.

627
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:16,606
Your kid isn't here anymore.

628
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,406
Is this good news or bad news?

629
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:23,966
But Khim wanted to talk with you.

630
00:56:24,127 --> 00:56:25,846
She wrote you a letter.

631
00:56:27,165 --> 00:56:30,566
She wanted to hear the truth from your own mouth.

632
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:37,246
(I had a miscarriage a few days ago.)

633
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,966
(I can't let him be born with a father like you.)

634
00:56:41,886 --> 00:56:43,726
(Since you ashamed us,)

635
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:47,446
(I don't want him to be born ashamed.)

636
00:56:49,223 --> 00:56:51,606
(I want my own life back.)

637
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:54,326
(For the time we had,)

638
00:56:54,846 --> 00:56:58,206
(think of it as paying off our hatred from our past lives.)

639
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,206
(I don't want to be any lower than this.)

640
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:10,286
(I know we're too different from each other.)

641
00:57:12,038 --> 00:57:14,326
(If you're still a man,)

642
00:57:14,622 --> 00:57:16,206
(sign a divorce with me.)

643
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,246
(I don't want us to be connected anymore.)

644
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:21,326
(After you sign,)

645
00:57:21,565 --> 00:57:23,446
(we'll go our separate ways.)

646
00:57:24,134 --> 00:57:26,366
(I didn't ask too much of you, right?)

647
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,046
She probably wanted to chase me away.

648
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:52,646
Khim is worried about you.

649
00:57:53,006 --> 00:57:54,606
Worry that I might not be dead!

650
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:57,206
Hey, I'm just her messenger.

651
00:57:57,477 --> 00:57:59,126
Just write what you want to tell her.

652
00:57:59,388 --> 00:58:02,046
Tell her if she wants a divorce, she must come here.

653
00:58:02,886 --> 00:58:04,526
I'm in jail because of her.

654
00:58:04,877 --> 00:58:06,877
Why would I want to throw my life here?

655
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,006
If she loves herself,

656
00:58:09,284 --> 00:58:11,206
she didn't have to do this much.

657
00:58:11,934 --> 00:58:13,601
Go live her life wherever she wants.

658
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:16,486
But don't treat my life like it's worthless!

659
00:58:52,126 --> 00:58:53,526
What are you trying to conspire?

660
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:01,306
I let you come and go in this house

661
00:59:01,415 --> 00:59:03,606
because I want Saikhim to have someone to vent her feelings.

662
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:07,326
But you betrayed me to help them to reconcile.

663
00:59:08,768 --> 00:59:10,502
This means that yesterday's letter...

664
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:11,878
It wasn't a real one.

665
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:17,646
Officer, take her there.

666
00:59:18,053 --> 00:59:19,206
Yes.

667
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:28,766
Tell her if she wants a divorce, she must come here.

668
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:31,766
That's why he was talking about a divorce.

669
00:59:32,325 --> 00:59:34,326
You swapped the letters.

670
00:59:34,669 --> 00:59:35,886
You already saw

671
00:59:36,038 --> 00:59:38,406
that he isn't worthy of Saikhim.

672
00:59:38,646 --> 00:59:40,086
Why would you bring it up again?

673
00:59:40,935 --> 00:59:42,606
Why are you doing this?

674
00:59:43,453 --> 00:59:45,766
If you really want the best for Saikhim,

675
00:59:46,692 --> 00:59:50,326
you should protect Saikhim from that prick.

676
00:59:59,006 --> 01:00:00,246
You're the only one

677
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:02,166
who knows everything about Saikhim.

678
01:00:03,006 --> 01:00:06,766
If you promise me you would keep everything a secret

679
01:00:06,965 --> 01:00:10,006
and keep that man out of Saikhim's life,

680
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:12,326
I promise that

681
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:15,486
I'll send you to study in England with Saikhim.

682
01:00:29,189 --> 01:00:30,526
I know you feel awkward.

683
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,166
It's like you're betraying your friend.

684
01:00:33,726 --> 01:00:35,089
You already know

685
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:38,086
that he isn't worthy of Saikhim at all.

686
01:00:40,133 --> 01:00:42,686
A good friend should want the best for their friend.

687
01:00:43,441 --> 01:00:44,441
Isn't that right?

688
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,286
(Prove to me)

689
01:00:46,829 --> 01:00:49,006
(that you are Saikhim's true friend.)

690
01:00:50,357 --> 01:00:52,486
I hope you'll enjoy your new life.

691
01:00:52,741 --> 01:00:54,646
The map and the key.

692
01:00:54,933 --> 01:00:55,933
Here.

693
01:00:56,174 --> 01:00:58,926
(This phone is a surprise gift from me.)

694
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:01,486
(Right. I've made a profile for you in a dating app)

695
01:01:01,654 --> 01:01:03,886
(and chose five men around there.)

696
01:01:05,926 --> 01:01:08,526
Why did something like this happen to me?

697
01:01:10,246 --> 01:01:12,086
I shouldn't have let this happen.

698
01:01:12,246 --> 01:01:13,886
What should I do, Lita?

699
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,134
How could I let this happen?

700
01:01:16,247 --> 01:01:18,366
It's not your fault, Khim.

701
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:24,166
It's my fault. I brought those men into your life.

702
01:01:29,938 --> 01:01:31,406
Although you impregnated her,

703
01:01:31,957 --> 01:01:33,846
it doesn't mean you own her.

704
01:01:34,046 --> 01:01:35,646
We're in the modern age.

705
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:39,086
Don't use your kid as an excuse to drag her down.

706
01:01:40,766 --> 01:01:42,086
If I weren't careless,

707
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:44,542
you wouldn't get to do it with Saikhim.

708
01:01:45,725 --> 01:01:46,966
Remember.

709
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:50,086
Don't try to play with fire.

710
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:56,766
(If you promise me that you would keep that man out of Saikhim's life,)

711
01:01:57,166 --> 01:01:58,286
(I promise that)

712
01:01:59,013 --> 01:02:01,366
(I'll send you to study in England with Saikhim.)

713
01:02:21,078 --> 01:02:22,326
He said

714
01:02:23,149 --> 01:02:24,406
he wants a divorce.

715
01:02:30,678 --> 01:02:31,886
Really?

716
01:02:33,766 --> 01:02:35,366
A divorce?

717
01:02:38,398 --> 01:02:40,806
He said he doesn't want anything to do with you.

718
01:02:42,646 --> 01:02:44,086
He doesn't care anymore.

719
01:02:49,564 --> 01:02:51,486
He doesn't want to explain anything.

720
01:02:53,749 --> 01:02:55,606
No matter how you think of him,

721
01:02:57,238 --> 01:02:58,726
he doesn't care now.

722
01:03:19,933 --> 01:03:21,726
(Everything happened because of us.)

723
01:03:22,926 --> 01:03:24,486
(Let it end with us.)

724
01:03:24,886 --> 01:03:26,856
(Since no one wants the kid to be born,)

725
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:28,566
(let it end here.)

726
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:35,510
Let's go.

727
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:37,886
Watch out!

728
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:41,966
(It's my fault)

729
01:03:42,502 --> 01:03:43,926
(for thinking that money isn't important.)

730
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,726
(Mr. Lawyer, I don't know if this much money can help Kla.)

731
01:03:47,382 --> 01:03:48,566
(Look at me now.)

732
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:50,806
(I don't even have money to defend him.)

733
01:03:51,204 --> 01:03:53,646
(Please use this money to get Kla back.)

734
01:04:12,494 --> 01:04:13,766
The prosecutor

735
01:04:14,077 --> 01:04:15,166
has found that

736
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,246
the money was transferred to the account.

737
01:04:17,822 --> 01:04:20,246
This money can be the evidence

738
01:04:20,726 --> 01:04:22,886
which proves you're in the wrong.

739
01:04:23,286 --> 01:04:24,766
We'll be done for this time.

740
01:06:13,046 --> 01:06:15,971
(After the arrest of the car smuggling suspect)

741
01:06:16,086 --> 01:06:18,206
(near the border several days ago,)

742
01:06:18,326 --> 01:06:20,926
(the court claimed the suspect had tried to escape)

743
01:06:21,046 --> 01:06:24,166
(and he's involved in the vehicles' tax-evasion case.)

744
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:27,766
(The court denied his bail and ordered him to stay in jail.)

745
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:39,566
Your dad said he sold his farm

746
01:06:39,869 --> 01:06:41,156
to try to defend your case.

747
01:06:41,381 --> 01:06:43,606
He said this is his last bet.

748
01:06:45,966 --> 01:06:47,606
What would he get from helping me?

749
01:06:49,045 --> 01:06:51,685
That money should be used for Kloy's future.

750
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:55,246
He said we can get the money again if we are still alive.

751
01:06:55,941 --> 01:06:59,332
He only has one son. He has to take you back with him.

752
01:07:04,526 --> 01:07:05,766
I give up.

753
01:07:08,406 --> 01:07:09,806
Don't fight it anymore.

754
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:14,406
This money is more important for my sister.

755
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:16,166
If Dad is still like this,

756
01:07:17,766 --> 01:07:19,126
in this entire life,

757
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:23,006
I don't know how I could pay him back.

758
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:36,926
(Dad.)

759
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:39,046
(Don't try to help me anymore.)

760
01:07:40,254 --> 01:07:41,566
(Since Mom died,)

761
01:07:42,606 --> 01:07:44,366
(you've been tired because of me.)

762
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:46,446
(From now on,)

763
01:07:46,926 --> 01:07:49,286
(let me perform my duty as your son.)

764
01:07:51,862 --> 01:07:53,686
(I want you to live comfortably.)

765
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,286
(I want you to have money.)

766
01:07:55,966 --> 01:07:58,326
(I want you to face everyone without shame.)

767
01:07:59,006 --> 01:08:00,366
(Keep your farm.)

768
01:08:00,894 --> 01:08:03,166
(Don't lose it for your outsider son.)

769
01:08:03,758 --> 01:08:05,046
(This money)

770
01:08:05,806 --> 01:08:07,606
(is my way of paying you back.)

771
01:08:08,222 --> 01:08:09,686
(Please use it for Kloy.)

772
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:12,318
Kloy!

773
01:08:14,009 --> 01:08:15,063
Kloy.

774
01:08:26,086 --> 01:08:27,366
(If she survives,)

775
01:08:27,739 --> 01:08:29,486
(please make her get a good education.)

776
01:08:30,126 --> 01:08:31,726
(I hope she will get a degree.)

777
01:08:32,573 --> 01:08:34,566
(Use this money to buy a new car.)

778
01:08:44,006 --> 01:08:45,046
(Since I was born,)

779
01:08:45,725 --> 01:08:47,725
(I've never made you proud.)

780
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:49,846
(This might be the last time)

781
01:08:50,566 --> 01:08:52,006
(that I could do something for you.)

782
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,966
(I don't know what will happen after this.)

783
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,520
(If there's truly a next life,)

784
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:04,646
(I want to be born as your son again.)

785
01:09:05,734 --> 01:09:06,846
(When it comes,)

786
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:09,494
(we might be real father and son.)

787
01:10:00,846 --> 01:10:02,286
I would never love you less.

788
01:10:02,742 --> 01:10:04,486
It can only go through 100 percent.

789
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:06,686
If your love for me is gone,

790
01:10:07,886 --> 01:10:09,166
how would it be?

791
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:11,526
I would never stop loving you.

792
01:10:25,878 --> 01:10:27,486
You must be satisfied now.

793
01:10:27,829 --> 01:10:29,326
The only thing I've done wrong

794
01:10:29,574 --> 01:10:31,006
is to love a woman like you!

795
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:48,006
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

796
01:11:48,369 --> 01:11:50,726
Sleep. I told you to sleep.

797
01:12:32,124 --> 01:12:33,846
Hey, Kla.

798
01:12:34,156 --> 01:12:35,166
Look at that.

799
01:12:37,056 --> 01:12:38,646
Who said a prisoner is worthless?

800
01:12:38,957 --> 01:12:41,726
At least, they can make money here and send it to his family.

801
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:46,006
I heard there's an order coming in here.

802
01:12:46,326 --> 01:12:48,566
Secretly selling organs for money.

803
01:12:48,934 --> 01:12:50,326
If they're compatible,

804
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:51,726
they'll gladly pay the money.

805
01:12:51,926 --> 01:12:53,446
They don't care if we're criminals.

806
01:13:01,389 --> 01:13:02,581
Kla.

807
01:13:10,066 --> 01:13:11,486
Come back.

808
01:13:12,449 --> 01:13:13,686
Kla...

809
01:13:51,486 --> 01:13:53,926
Kaokla hung himself in the prison.

810
01:13:54,686 --> 01:13:56,086
He committed suicide to run away.

811
01:13:56,966 --> 01:13:58,566
I didn't think he would be that coward.

812
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,846
He acted like he knows we were preparing for his divorce.

813
01:14:13,008 --> 01:14:14,326
What happened?

814
01:14:18,246 --> 01:14:20,286
Something happened to Kaokla, right?

815
01:14:23,566 --> 01:14:25,006
What happened?

816
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,486
Dad.

817
01:14:27,829 --> 01:14:29,090
Dad, please tell me.

818
01:14:29,286 --> 01:14:30,836
What happened, Dad?

819
01:14:31,246 --> 01:14:33,926
Please tell me. I beg you.

820
01:14:34,007 --> 01:14:35,566
I want to know.

821
01:14:35,686 --> 01:14:37,046
Please tell me.

822
01:14:39,702 --> 01:14:42,086
Dad, please tell me.

823
01:14:46,526 --> 01:14:49,406
Kaokla committed suicide in prison.

824
01:14:52,566 --> 01:14:55,606
He's in critical condition. I don't know if he'll survive.

825
01:15:15,846 --> 01:15:17,606
Why is it like this?

826
01:15:20,253 --> 01:15:23,742
- I have to see him. - Khim.

827
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:25,455
Khim, you can't go anywhere.

828
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:27,486
Listen to me, Khim.

829
01:15:27,838 --> 01:15:28,846
Khim.

830
01:15:30,006 --> 01:15:31,086
Khim.

831
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:33,246
Listen to me.

832
01:15:35,438 --> 01:15:36,966
You have to forget him.

833
01:15:38,326 --> 01:15:40,206
You have to forget him.

834
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:44,846
It's better if you can act as if you've never known him.

835
01:15:47,046 --> 01:15:49,006
Begin your life again.

836
01:16:49,966 --> 01:16:53,326
We'll transfer the patient to get a brain scan at another place.

837
01:17:04,926 --> 01:17:06,206
The result is out.

838
01:17:06,446 --> 01:17:08,246
Their lymphocytes were cross-matched.

839
01:17:09,695 --> 01:17:13,446
Our doctors are preparing for the kidney transplant operation.

840
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:30,486
They found this contract in prison.

841
01:17:30,726 --> 01:17:32,086
Someone sent it to us.

842
01:17:37,646 --> 01:17:38,966
What does this mean?

843
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:40,326
Your son

844
01:17:40,473 --> 01:17:42,566
had agreed to donate his organ

845
01:17:42,726 --> 01:17:44,646
for money if someone wants it.

846
01:17:45,184 --> 01:17:46,406
But that's illegal.

847
01:17:46,613 --> 01:17:48,653
I don't know how something this crazy is happening.

848
01:17:49,086 --> 01:17:51,766
Life can't just be exchanged or traded.

849
01:17:51,924 --> 01:17:54,486
It's alright if he survives. But if he doesn't,

850
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:56,486
please think about it.

851
01:17:56,847 --> 01:17:58,406
Do you want him to die for nothing?

852
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:03,486
We'll transfer the patient to get a brain scan at another place.

853
01:18:04,206 --> 01:18:06,286
They said they would take Kla to get a brain scan...

854
01:18:11,741 --> 01:18:12,833
Kla!

855
01:18:19,709 --> 01:18:20,926
Where are you taking him?

856
01:18:36,933 --> 01:18:38,086
How did you come here?

857
01:18:38,437 --> 01:18:41,126
He's the illegitimate son of my husband.

858
01:18:42,566 --> 01:18:43,806
It's you.

859
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:45,726
You tracked us.

860
01:18:46,182 --> 01:18:47,726
You can't take him anywhere.

861
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,705
You've been hiding him for 10 years, but you couldn't take care of him.

862
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:53,030
I'll take him back.

863
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:54,286
He isn't dead.

864
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:56,126
He might wake up.

865
01:18:56,429 --> 01:18:58,429
I don't want him to be dead.

866
01:18:58,581 --> 01:19:01,246
I just want him to save my child's life.

867
01:19:01,678 --> 01:19:03,078
He's also my child.

868
01:19:03,926 --> 01:19:05,366
Do you still have your morals?

869
01:19:05,478 --> 01:19:07,478
He wasn't born to be anyone's substitute.

870
01:19:08,116 --> 01:19:09,846
Even if his life is bad,

871
01:19:10,086 --> 01:19:11,606
he has the right to live it.

872
01:19:12,086 --> 01:19:13,286
Everyone

873
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:15,366
only has one life.

874
01:19:16,686 --> 01:19:19,206
You can't use your money to buy one.

875
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:23,326
He will never wake up again

876
01:19:23,838 --> 01:19:25,406
because his wife

877
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:28,326
has signed the refusal of treatment document.

878
01:19:28,733 --> 01:19:30,320
If anything happens,

879
01:19:30,526 --> 01:19:32,806
he'll be left to die.

880
01:19:32,902 --> 01:19:34,486
No one can save his life.

881
01:19:39,782 --> 01:19:41,142
Those people

882
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:42,966
are trying to kill him.

883
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:50,166
I won't let this chance go.

884
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:54,326
If I don't have him, my child couldn't live either.

885
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:58,966
If someone has to die, we should give another one a chance to live.

886
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:00,989
It's better than letting both of them die.

887
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:23,326
That's Nate, my son.

888
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:26,726
He got into an accident while he went mountain climbing.

889
01:21:27,253 --> 01:21:29,486
He hasn't woken up after that.

890
01:21:31,814 --> 01:21:34,806
We're using a machine to prolong his life.

891
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:38,086
We moved him here to buy more time. To wait for a miracle.

892
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:41,446
Your son is my miracle.

893
01:21:41,838 --> 01:21:43,966
Because three days ago, Nate

894
01:21:44,341 --> 01:21:45,566
suffered kidney failure.

895
01:21:53,669 --> 01:21:55,086
Artery.

896
01:21:59,742 --> 01:22:01,406
Your son's condition is this bad.

897
01:22:01,598 --> 01:22:03,246
Do you think he could survive?

898
01:22:03,596 --> 01:22:05,596
How many days could Kla prolong his life?

899
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:07,486
I would gladly pay for that

900
01:22:07,702 --> 01:22:10,086
because Nate grows up with a horrible disease

901
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:11,781
and lives to this day.

902
01:22:11,886 --> 01:22:13,006
Today, you want his kidney.

903
01:22:13,476 --> 01:22:15,646
Tomorrow, you might need a lung or heart.

904
01:22:17,861 --> 01:22:19,446
I'll tell you one thing.

905
01:22:20,586 --> 01:22:21,646
Kla

906
01:22:22,493 --> 01:22:24,493
is also my miracle.

907
01:22:27,277 --> 01:22:29,086
He committed suicide.

908
01:22:30,574 --> 01:22:31,966
He didn't only want to

909
01:22:32,086 --> 01:22:33,686
give up his kidney.

910
01:22:34,087 --> 01:22:36,326
He wants to support his sister's life

911
01:22:36,686 --> 01:22:38,326
by using his own life.

912
01:22:40,597 --> 01:22:41,997
His heart

913
01:22:43,231 --> 01:22:45,231
should be loved by everyone.

914
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:47,446
It shouldn't be hurt.

915
01:22:49,646 --> 01:22:51,106
The miracle that you claimed

916
01:22:52,557 --> 01:22:54,606
is a heart from a man like him.

917
01:22:55,806 --> 01:22:59,486
He has to live like he didn't exist to get away from a father

918
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:01,886
who didn't treat him as a human being.

919
01:23:02,932 --> 01:23:03,932
He was arrested

920
01:23:04,246 --> 01:23:05,886
because he was mocked that he wasn't my son.

921
01:23:06,262 --> 01:23:08,686
We destroyed his childhood

922
01:23:08,846 --> 01:23:11,366
by forcing our adult's matter on him.

923
01:23:11,766 --> 01:23:13,646
Acting like you're his owner.

924
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:17,726
Since he was born and died,

925
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,406
we've never given him a life to live.

926
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:22,526
Now, you still want to take his life away.

927
01:23:23,446 --> 01:23:24,966
How could you do this to him?

928
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,006
I beg you.

929
01:23:35,109 --> 01:23:36,606
Return Kla's life to me.

930
01:23:56,005 --> 01:23:57,846
- BP has drop. - How much?

931
01:23:58,358 --> 01:23:59,846
It's 50/70.

932
01:24:00,406 --> 01:24:02,486
Prepare the blood. One unit.

933
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:29,606
Perform CPR.

934
01:24:30,046 --> 01:24:31,206
Immediately.

935
01:24:35,406 --> 01:24:37,486
- Has it gone up? - It's dropping.

936
01:25:20,888 --> 01:25:22,406
Khim, what's wrong?

937
01:25:30,127 --> 01:25:31,246
Kla.

938
01:25:31,629 --> 01:25:32,869
You can't die.

939
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:00,230
I'm going.

940
01:26:03,246 --> 01:26:04,406
Kla.

941
01:26:07,806 --> 01:26:08,886
Kla!

942
01:26:09,278 --> 01:26:10,686
Stay strong!

943
01:26:11,196 --> 01:26:12,646
You can't die, Kla!

944
01:26:26,966 --> 01:26:28,326
(I will never stop loving you.)

945
01:26:29,693 --> 01:26:31,046
(My love for you would end)

946
01:26:31,766 --> 01:26:33,606
(only after I die.)

947
01:26:38,646 --> 01:26:40,126
Kla!

948
01:27:21,976 --> 01:27:23,326
Khim, what's wrong?

949
01:27:42,366 --> 01:27:44,206
(Because love is fragile,)

950
01:27:47,421 --> 01:27:50,366
(only love can heal us)

951
01:27:55,326 --> 01:27:57,566
(when there's a farewell.)

952
01:28:22,325 --> 01:28:23,685
(I can only hope that...)

953
01:28:24,452 --> 01:28:26,326
(We would dare to love again.)

954
01:28:39,298 --> 01:28:40,606
Thaen.

955
01:28:40,862 --> 01:28:43,846
Wash your hair first. Dry yourself.

956
01:28:45,502 --> 01:28:47,686
He's already in the past.

957
01:28:47,806 --> 01:28:49,526
Even if he is still alive,

958
01:28:49,766 --> 01:28:51,246
he can't reach you anymore.

959
01:28:51,663 --> 01:28:53,006
And today,

960
01:28:53,316 --> 01:28:55,846
you already have your real hero with you.

961
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:58,246
Please marry me.

962
01:29:01,126 --> 01:29:03,126
Do you know someone in heaven?

963
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:05,310
You can send a letter to him.

964
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:07,460
I don't know if he's still up there.

965
01:29:07,766 --> 01:29:09,407
It's been seven years.

966
01:29:09,726 --> 01:29:12,304
Ms. Khim hasn't contacted me. She's probably still on the island.

967
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:14,006
Why did you let her go alone?

968
01:29:17,726 --> 01:29:18,966
I'll follow you there.
