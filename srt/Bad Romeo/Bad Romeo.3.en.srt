(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,406
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,487 --> 00:00:03,547
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:45,126
The police tried to arrest me.

5
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,526
They said it's abduction.

6
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:50,006
So, you came here to harass me.

7
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:56,686
Are you the police informer?

8
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,366
I want to tell you that you owe me your life.

9
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,486
If I didn't help you,

10
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:04,311
you would already die.

11
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:09,406
No man will be interested in you as long as you don't have my fortune.

12
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:11,606
I think I'm pregnant.

13
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:12,839
What?

14
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:14,566
We should end it here.

15
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:16,846
It's not worth it for me and you.

16
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:20,806
Think of it as we've never met before.

17
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,446
Don't ruin our lives more than this.

18
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:28,726
- Please try to start the car. - Okay.

19
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:46,926
It's done. If there's anything, you can call me.

20
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:48,818
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

21
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:38,654
You can wait here.

22
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:40,446
I'll go in for a second.

23
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:56,606
This is Kaokla. This is Lita.

24
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:58,918
Don't let them near Miss.

25
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:22,366
Hello, I'm Annie Guzheng Angel.

26
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:24,638
Today, I'm really happy

27
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:28,090
because there'll be an interesting activity here.

28
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:30,726
It's called the blind date.

29
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:34,780
This activity is inspired by visually impaired people.

30
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:38,166
I'm also one of the visually impaired people.

31
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:40,926
We want everyone here

32
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:46,197
to experience the difficulties in living our daily lives.

33
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:47,846
Did you get it?

34
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:49,806
It's in here.

35
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:51,566
Ms. Lita.

36
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:55,005
This way, please.

37
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:06,486
After you sit down, please wear a blindfold.

38
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:08,357
- Okay. - This way, please.

39
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:14,827
We want everyone

40
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:17,947
to join this activity. Wear a blindfold.

41
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:21,646
Try to live as a visually impaired person for a day.

42
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:25,006
If you have to live in darkness,

43
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:27,246
if you have to walk in darkness,

44
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,406
how would you feel after today's experience?

45
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:34,687
Alright. Today, what we're going to do is

46
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:36,846
we'll try to go shopping.

47
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:39,246
You might be wondering that when we're blind,

48
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:41,126
how do we go shopping?

49
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:44,602
Aside from going shopping, we'll take you...

50
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:46,166
- The blindfold. - To buy...

51
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,206
- Wear it after you sit down. - Clothes...

52
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:50,006
And fruits.

53
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,111
We'll also take you to a restaurant.

54
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:54,486
And for the exciting part,

55
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:57,465
we'll get on an escalator.

56
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,681
It sounds exciting, right?

57
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,714
If you're ready,

58
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:05,286
let's begin our activity here.

59
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:07,206
Please pair up.

60
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:12,706
- This way. - Khim.

61
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:14,606
Lita.

62
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,886
Saikhim.

63
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:24,126
Lady, please go first.

64
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:29,646
How do you know I'm a lady?

65
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:33,566
I could smell your perfume.

66
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:38,097
This way, please.

67
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:39,766
Yes.

68
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:45,046
Okay. We will begin now.

69
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:48,606
Follow their steps.

70
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:54,346
- We can't follow you. - Khim.

71
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,771
- Saikhim. - Please wait downstairs.

72
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,827
It's fine. We're going up.

73
00:08:00,823 --> 00:08:02,002
Let's go.

74
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:06,726
I think I won't risk it.

75
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:08,086
Don't be scared.

76
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,606
Follow me.

77
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:22,966
You won't die from this.

78
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,046
When I tell you to go, you walk. Alright?

79
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:28,886
Go.

80
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:33,046
Will we survive?

81
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:34,366
Yes.

82
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:36,606
If we trust each other.

83
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,366
You can entrust your life to me.

84
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:50,757
Go.

85
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,406
Go.

86
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:13,486
Our next activity is

87
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:14,682
we'll put on clothes

88
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,985
on our friends while we couldn't see.

89
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:46,528
People might not be the same as their appearances.

90
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:48,256
If we didn't use our eyes,

91
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:51,530
we wouldn't judge people from their appearances.

92
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:56,406
It might make us know their true nature better.

93
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:58,646
Try to ask your partner

94
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,486
to see who they are.

95
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:04,326
Let's try to get to know your partner.

96
00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:08,166
Use your hand to feel them. Talk with them. Try to guess

97
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:10,886
who they are and where they are from.

98
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:12,646
Please try it.

99
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:26,941
Then, I'll go first.

100
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:28,075
Yes.

101
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,686
I think you must be really diligent

102
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:40,726
because your hand feels like it's always being used for work.

103
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:44,006
You can say it's rough.

104
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,366
I don't mind.

105
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:47,966
I wasn't born as rich as you.

106
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:49,606
Who is rich?

107
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:53,806
Let me feel your hand.

108
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:02,006
Your hand is soft like a rich girl.

109
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,886
You probably have never washed a dish.

110
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:07,446
It's like you have grown up in Disneyland.

111
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:10,246
No...

112
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:16,966
I think you probably don't have a girlfriend.

113
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,406
- Why? - Well...

114
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:22,766
You aren't wearing a ring

115
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:26,566
and you're really straightforward.

116
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,406
You might not get to talk with women a lot.

117
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,926
You probably can't find a boyfriend.

118
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,866
Why?

119
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:43,846
No Disney's princess

120
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,566
would drink like that in front of a strange man.

121
00:12:47,214 --> 00:12:48,606
Don't drink like this again.

122
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:50,726
- It isn't good. - The dessert is here.

123
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:56,126
We'll try to have our desserts in front of you

124
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,446
without seeing anything.

125
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:03,926
Please try to get the cutlery first. A fork and knife.

126
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:06,845
The way to check if they're a fork, or a knife,

127
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:09,886
is to make them touch each other.

128
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,486
When you're sure, use the fork

129
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:14,456
to stab at the dessert.

130
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:17,446
Then, use the knife as your assistant.

131
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:19,486
Use the fork to help us feel

132
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:23,126
what is in our dish and where it is.

133
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:36,006
Is someone sick?

134
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,926
Are you alright, Khim?

135
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,846
- I can't stand it. - You can continue your dessert.

136
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,046
Khim, are you having morning sickness?

137
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,606
I'm that obvious...

138
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:08,246
I probably can't hide it for long, Lita.

139
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:16,846
I've done some research.

140
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:20,566
Most people use this pill to solve the problem.

141
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:24,846
It might

142
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:29,246
help us end this matter.

143
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,606
Will it really end, Lita?

144
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:40,766
Now, I'm being kept under watch 24 hours a day.

145
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:42,206
I'm afraid

146
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:44,727
my family will get more suspicious.

147
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:48,806
We'll do this.

148
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:51,926
We'll say we're going back to England.

149
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,846
No.

150
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:58,206
If I go back to England, Oun will go with me.

151
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:00,926
I couldn't hide this from Oun.

152
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:03,246
There must be a way.

153
00:15:06,014 --> 00:15:07,446
It's alright, Khim.

154
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,086
I'll try to help you.

155
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:29,966
Hey, it's our photo from earlier.

156
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:35,286
- He... - That man.

157
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:36,886
He...

158
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:38,966
It has to be intentional.

159
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:41,246
Why did he follow you everywhere?

160
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:55,966
What's this?

161
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:08,126
What's this check?

162
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:22,886
This is bad.

163
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:26,369
Darn it.

164
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:28,486
That man...

165
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:30,446
How did he get here?

166
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:33,046
He probably wants some trouble.

167
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:34,606
He's mocking us.

168
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:39,246
- Let's teach him a lesson. - We'll do that?

169
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:51,606
Excuse me.

170
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:54,886
Someone reported that a man had broken into the women's toilet.

171
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:57,646
How is it related to me? Don't be nonsense.

172
00:16:57,787 --> 00:16:59,446
The victim reported it to me.

173
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,166
I would like to search your body.

174
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:02,766
Hey.

175
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:09,446
Hey.

176
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:13,526
Reporting. I found the item with the suspect.

177
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:15,926
Make it less obvious please.

178
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,326
You're here.

179
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,126
The thief.

180
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:22,846
We had to teach you a lesson so that you won't come here again.

181
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:27,693
I think he should get another charge.

182
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:31,306
Letting an ex-prisoner out here is always like this.

183
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:34,406
Remember his face.

184
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,286
This face

185
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:37,886
is better suited for prison.

186
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:43,286
Take him.

187
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,606
Go.

188
00:17:52,374 --> 00:17:54,206
I won't be in jail alone.

189
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:04,170
Will you admit

190
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:06,166
that you stole this gold necklace?

191
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,646
How is this trivial case so interesting?

192
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:11,126
The case with multi-million property is more interesting.

193
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:14,436
Nonsense.

194
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,686
You don't want to know why I went there?

195
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,926
If I can be the witness testifying for an illegal car's clues,

196
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:26,206
can you hold off this charge against me?

197
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:32,926
(That car was imported without paying the tax.)

198
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:35,846
(They use a fake license plate to drive it into Thailand.)

199
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:37,566
(Although they drive a luxury car,)

200
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,006
(they're doing an illegal thing.)

201
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:42,806
(The tax of each car is around 10 million.)

202
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:46,486
(Think how much money this group hadn't paid.)

203
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:48,806
(It might reach 100 million.)

204
00:18:49,973 --> 00:18:52,126
(We can't judge people from appearances.)

205
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:54,246
(We need to look at the inside.)

206
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,366
(It's like those expensive cars.)

207
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:58,734
(It might look good from the outside,)

208
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:01,526
(but it's just a surface hiding something.)

209
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,246
(It's really as fake as it could be.)

210
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:19,566
If it doesn't have a fake license plate,

211
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:22,806
an expensive and beautiful car is just junk.

212
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,206
It's like humans.

213
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:26,566
If you're terrible, you're as worthless as that junk.

214
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,606
Miss, is something wrong?

215
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:51,846
Where is Dad?

216
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:53,846
Sir is in a meeting at Chiang Mai.

217
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,206
Do you have anything urgent? He'll be back tomorrow.

218
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:03,126
It's fine.

219
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,919
I have to check through this car again

220
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,326
if there's any forging of the VIN number.

221
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:20,046
I'm just a customer.

222
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,366
How would I know what they're selling me?

223
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:24,326
After we checked the car,

224
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:27,166
we would like you to testify again, Mr. Promptpat.

225
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,686
I'll excuse myself.

226
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:31,406
Okay.

227
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:38,686
Why are you careless?

228
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,006
It's just a car. Couldn't you buy it legally?

229
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:44,166
Someone must have framed me and Kim.

230
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:46,246
Don't let the company know this.

231
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:48,486
If so, you must take responsibility.

232
00:20:58,365 --> 00:20:59,886
Act like you know nothing.

233
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,926
Tell the police that you're deceived by Kimhan.

234
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,765
(After the investigation by the DSI,)

235
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:25,886
(luxurious cars of celebrities and rich families)

236
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:27,776
(were called to be checked.)

237
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,112
(They especially targets)

238
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:31,178
(the imported cars from the car showroom)

239
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:34,566
(of Mr. Kimhan Dechacharn, the famous owner.)

240
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,366
(Now, they've found that)

241
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:42,046
(the government lost 300 million baht of tax from 25 tax-avoiding cars.)

242
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:44,243
(The police will check)

243
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:47,446
(the imported cars that are getting through customs.)

244
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,606
(Reported by Saifon Khlongsamut.)

245
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,245
I just want to get that family back.

246
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:56,763
I didn't think I would expose the whole business.

247
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:59,846
It's a big deal now. Will trouble come to us?

248
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:22,406
Although the police get the cars,

249
00:22:22,572 --> 00:22:24,158
if they didn't have the controller box,

250
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:26,006
a car is just a junk.

251
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:29,766
They won't dare to get us back if they know we did the car for them.

252
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,126
If they try to get us back,

253
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:34,646
we don't have to return the controller box to them.

254
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:37,726
Let their car stay as junk forever.

255
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,646
I'm sorry.

256
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:56,126
It's fine. I'm already done.

257
00:22:59,704 --> 00:23:02,966
Prompt didn't mean to cause trouble for our family.

258
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:04,806
Please don't mind it.

259
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:10,046
If you think that Prompt still lacks something,

260
00:23:10,462 --> 00:23:13,606
you can teach him a lesson to be manlier.

261
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,606
I would be glad.

262
00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:19,303
As we...

263
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:22,606
We are the parents of each of our kids,

264
00:23:22,797 --> 00:23:27,493
we should be both of their parents. I think it'll be better.

265
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:31,846
Use your time to look after your kid.

266
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:36,006
Khim only has me and that's enough. I'll go out first.

267
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,669
Dad.

268
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,046
Dad, it's good to see you.

269
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:45,246
I want to talk with you.

270
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:52,166
Sorry.

271
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:55,326
I didn't think you would be here.

272
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:17,606
I'm already grown up.

273
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:21,526
I understand if you want someone new.

274
00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:24,748
You don't have to hide it from me.

275
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:26,286
I'm not a kid anymore.

276
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:29,646
You've already become rotten.

277
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:32,406
You don't have to be shy anymore.

278
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:43,046
Kaokla...

279
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:45,646
He sent the check back to us.

280
00:24:46,229 --> 00:24:48,806
He probably didn't want to blackmail me.

281
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:51,206
You threw money at him like that.

282
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,766
You're looking down on me and him.

283
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:55,886
Haven't you learned anything?

284
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,339
He returned the check

285
00:24:58,446 --> 00:25:01,086
because he wanted to make himself look like a gentleman.

286
00:25:01,237 --> 00:25:02,406
Haven't you realized?

287
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:06,966
I'm not crazy about men so much that I can't discern right from wrong.

288
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:17,686
For all the problems that I've caused,

289
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:21,166
I'm ready to take responsibility for them.

290
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:26,846
I won't let you be embarrassed because of me again.

291
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:29,046
I promise.

292
00:25:56,577 --> 00:25:58,326
Kaokla...

293
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:02,806
Kaokla...

294
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:55,806
Is it you, Ounruen?

295
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,366
It's me.

296
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:04,086
What's wrong?

297
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:06,326
I want to ask you for a favor.

298
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:10,646
A magazine contacted me. They want to take a photoshoot with me and Thaen,

299
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:13,406
but Thaen wouldn't do it.

300
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:16,566
Can you ask him what he's afraid of?

301
00:27:17,526 --> 00:27:20,606
Thaen probably has his own reason.

302
00:27:21,445 --> 00:27:23,206
You don't want to ask him

303
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:24,406
because

304
00:27:25,181 --> 00:27:28,366
you are jealous? Or do you want to keep him for yourself?

305
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:31,126
There is nothing between me and Thaen.

306
00:27:32,046 --> 00:27:36,686
Then, if Thaen and I date each other, you wouldn't mind, right?

307
00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:38,886
Yeah.

308
00:27:40,255 --> 00:27:42,255
It's a relief to hear that.

309
00:27:42,726 --> 00:27:45,486
I can tell Thaen to not worry,

310
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,326
because you've agreed to let me have a chance.

311
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:55,646
Ms. Khim.

312
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:57,246
Ms. Khim.

313
00:27:59,126 --> 00:28:00,206
Yes?

314
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:13,446
It's good that we sisters have a heart-to-heart talk once in a while.

315
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:18,646
I've prepared the table.

316
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:20,366
Your dad is waiting.

317
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:23,886
This is the fate of the only daughter. Your dad will always follow you

318
00:28:24,446 --> 00:28:25,846
on every single step.

319
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:28,966
Please go down. Don't let him wait for long.

320
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,286
Yes, Oun.

321
00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:39,846
After a bird has flew outside,

322
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:42,526
it's hard to keep it locked up again.

323
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,566
Be careful.

324
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:46,686
When it disobeys,

325
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:48,886
it won't be the same again.

326
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:58,726
Have you been waiting?

327
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:00,086
I'm sorry.

328
00:29:00,446 --> 00:29:01,806
I'm a little late.

329
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,246
I'm going to a meeting at our hotel branch in New York next week.

330
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:08,646
What about me?

331
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:10,781
Deal with your car's problem first.

332
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:16,526
The university will start next month.

333
00:29:19,086 --> 00:29:21,246
If you let her study at a faraway university,

334
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,886
will that be alright?

335
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:24,406
Why?

336
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,086
She's in the top five universities. She'll lose her opportunity then.

337
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:31,686
But I don't want to go back now.

338
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:36,766
You've been at our home for a month. You probably forgot about your study.

339
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:38,846
Studying is only a headache.

340
00:29:38,997 --> 00:29:42,206
Having a husband might be better.

341
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:45,246
That's you, Prim.

342
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:50,806
I'm not stupid to fall for any strange men's trick.

343
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,446
You must return to England immediately.

344
00:29:56,726 --> 00:29:58,046
No exception.

345
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:07,366
She's pregnant?

346
00:30:07,494 --> 00:30:11,726
I saw the pregnancy test kit in Khim's room.

347
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:15,046
Uncle Sin was blinded by his pride.

348
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:18,566
He didn't even know how his daughter is right now.

349
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:21,966
I wanted to tell him earlier.

350
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:24,206
So, he would stop comparing me to her.

351
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,406
If she's pregnant,

352
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:29,926
can she really go back to studying?

353
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:33,886
Mom, there's no way she can hide this kind of matter.

354
00:30:34,193 --> 00:30:37,966
I don't know whether her Ounruen

355
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:39,726
knows about this or not.

356
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:44,126
Even if she knows, she will try to keep it a secret.

357
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:47,926
She might use the chance when Mr. Sit isn't here

358
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,926
to clear out all of the evidence.

359
00:30:51,054 --> 00:30:53,766
We can't let this end quietly.

360
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:56,006
It can cause Sin to be crazy.

361
00:30:56,206 --> 00:30:59,686
His daughter is now a wreck. We'll see

362
00:30:59,884 --> 00:31:02,526
if Uncle Sin can still look down on me.

363
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:10,486
(You must return to England immediately. No exception.)

364
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,846
If we trust each other,

365
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:45,046
it won't be hard.

366
00:31:45,782 --> 00:31:47,606
You can entrust your life to me.

367
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,086
Khem.

368
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:03,806
Get a wrench for me.

369
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:11,126
I wanted a wrench. Why did you give me a screwdriver?

370
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:21,966
What are you playing at, Khem?

371
00:32:31,454 --> 00:32:33,166
You said

372
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:38,126
if we trusted each other, it wouldn't be hard.

373
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:41,606
I could entrust my life to you.

374
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:48,166
Were you serious? Or did you just say it to make you look cool?

375
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,646
A man like me will keep my word.

376
00:33:05,654 --> 00:33:08,526
I've already returned the check to my dad.

377
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:11,783
Why did you have to run away?

378
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:13,766
Can't we talk face to face?

379
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:15,469
You said it's over.

380
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:17,446
To not see you again.

381
00:33:19,126 --> 00:33:20,646
We should end it here.

382
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,606
It's not worth it for me and you.

383
00:33:22,726 --> 00:33:25,566
Think of it as we've never met before.

384
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,966
Don't ruin our lives more than this.

385
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:34,046
Honestly, we're almost strangers to one another.

386
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,486
You'll fall if you don't tie your shoe well.

387
00:33:48,253 --> 00:33:50,766
If you're nice to me like this,

388
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:53,446
I might cause you trouble again.

389
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,966
Will you be angry at me

390
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:09,821
if I tell you that

391
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:15,326
I'm pregnant?

392
00:34:27,062 --> 00:34:28,326
You're pregnant?

393
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:35,086
Do you think I'm lying?

394
00:34:35,246 --> 00:34:36,366
No.

395
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,686
I knew it would be like this.

396
00:34:41,774 --> 00:34:43,726
I shouldn't have told you.

397
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:46,446
Wait.

398
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:48,286
Hey.

399
00:34:49,511 --> 00:34:50,726
Hold on.

400
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:58,326
Are you really angry at me?

401
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,166
Why would I be angry?

402
00:35:00,574 --> 00:35:02,446
I should be the one who apologizes.

403
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:04,446
Actually,

404
00:35:04,726 --> 00:35:06,566
you can swear at me or slap me.

405
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:08,086
Slap me hard.

406
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,446
- Here. Like this. - No.

407
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,886
It's not your fault.

408
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:19,846
I have to go back to continue my study.

409
00:35:22,326 --> 00:35:26,726
I can't let this problem affect my life.

410
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:43,966
So,

411
00:35:44,724 --> 00:35:46,406
you don't want to keep the child?

412
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:54,246
If we won't do this,

413
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,286
my dad might kill me and you.

414
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:06,286
We have to stop it. We can't cause trouble for anyone else again.

415
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:10,126
This might be the last time...

416
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,966
Can you tell me

417
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:20,486
how should I start?

418
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:25,766
Start with trusting each other.

419
00:36:27,045 --> 00:36:28,806
We'll get through everything then.

420
00:36:58,566 --> 00:37:00,166
Are you leaving, Dad?

421
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:04,166
What's wrong?

422
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:08,166
I want to go back to England earlier.

423
00:37:09,446 --> 00:37:11,806
I think I'll go back this weekend.

424
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:14,606
What happened? You said you didn't want to go back.

425
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:16,966
(You must use this chance when your dad isn't around.)

426
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:18,566
(Act like you want to go back earlier.)

427
00:37:21,086 --> 00:37:24,086
I want to continue my project, Dad.

428
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:27,326
I feel like I can't concentrate here.

429
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:31,126
(Then, you'll run away to live with me.)

430
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,646
(I'll take you to a clinic.)

431
00:37:33,925 --> 00:37:36,046
(After you've recovered, you'll go back to England.)

432
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:39,606
Whatever you want.

433
00:37:58,006 --> 00:38:02,566
If you didn't want to go back so suddenly, I would go with you.

434
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,446
Since you're already here, Oun,

435
00:38:17,206 --> 00:38:22,566
I want you to be with your family for as long as possible.

436
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:24,486
Stay until you won't miss them anymore.

437
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:28,766
You'll eventually stay with me in England for a long time.

438
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:35,046
It's not a duty for me to stay with you, Ms. Khim.

439
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:36,886
I've raised you.

440
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:38,726
I also love you.

441
00:38:38,957 --> 00:38:40,486
If someone hurts you,

442
00:38:40,757 --> 00:38:42,606
I also feel the pain.

443
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:45,686
It's like I'm the one who gets hurt.

444
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:48,606
You're like my own daughter.

445
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:15,766
(The first step has succeeded.)

446
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:21,406
You look happy while you're using your phone.

447
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,126
If you didn't win a lottery, you must be chatting with a girl.

448
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:26,486
You're smart about other people's business.

449
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,086
Which rich lady are you going to trick again?

450
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,624
If you can't differentiate between sex and love,

451
00:39:32,727 --> 00:39:35,286
you'll never find your true love, Kaokla.

452
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,606
You might even be in jail...

453
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:40,726
- Khem. - Don't, Kla.

454
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:44,446
Kla, calm down. Hey, calm down.

455
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,246
You're smiling.

456
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,886
- Khem! - I'm leaving.

457
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:00,606
Call me when you arrive.

458
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,653
Yes.

459
00:40:03,814 --> 00:40:05,726
- Go check-in for her. - Yes.

460
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,165
It's fine.

461
00:40:09,445 --> 00:40:11,966
- Why? He... - I can do it myself.

462
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:13,886
- Okay. - Really, Oun.

463
00:40:33,928 --> 00:40:36,860
- I'm leaving. - Don't forget to call me.

464
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,366
Yes.

465
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:25,366
What's wrong?

466
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:34,126
Are we doing the right thing?

467
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:37,086
Are you still hesitating now?

468
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,766
I feel like

469
00:41:53,687 --> 00:41:55,886
I'm betraying my family.

470
00:41:58,286 --> 00:42:01,046
I've really become horrible just like my dad said.

471
00:42:06,726 --> 00:42:10,046
If you go back like this, will everything be better?

472
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:36,206
We all make mistakes.

473
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:40,166
When we're wrong,

474
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,126
we want our parents to understand us.

475
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,590
Each of our mistakes

476
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:47,798
will make them love us less and less.

477
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,886
We can't let them know about this if we want them to still love us.

478
00:43:01,486 --> 00:43:03,006
We aren't running away from the problem.

479
00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:05,046
We're fixing the problem.

480
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:09,046
You'll be a good girl like before in three days.

481
00:43:10,246 --> 00:43:12,926
After this problem ends, we won't see each other again.

482
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,446
Your future is more important.

483
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,686
You'll stay here today.

484
00:44:11,886 --> 00:44:14,806
Someone's at my garage. I don't want anyone to know about us.

485
00:44:15,037 --> 00:44:17,486
We have an appointment tomorrow at the clinic.

486
00:44:26,037 --> 00:44:28,606
Can you stay alone? Should I stay with you?

487
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:31,446
See you tomorrow.

488
00:44:40,406 --> 00:44:41,926
Why are you that scared?

489
00:44:42,062 --> 00:44:44,726
Call me if there's anything. My garage is around here.

490
00:45:06,279 --> 00:45:08,366
Khem, what happened?

491
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,126
Someone picked a fight with us.

492
00:45:10,806 --> 00:45:12,726
It might be that car showroom's owner.

493
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,566
They searched everywhere.

494
00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:16,561
They're trying to find something.

495
00:45:17,726 --> 00:45:19,246
Is there anything missing?

496
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,126
- The controller box? - No, Kla.

497
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:25,246
I feel like something's wrong.

498
00:45:25,446 --> 00:45:27,646
So, I hid it in your house before that.

499
00:45:28,581 --> 00:45:30,086
- My house? - Yes.

500
00:45:30,566 --> 00:45:33,406
- I'll go to see if it's still there. - No.

501
00:45:33,846 --> 00:45:36,446
I'll go. You clean this place.

502
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,126
(Saikhim)

503
00:45:43,582 --> 00:45:44,726
What's wrong?

504
00:45:46,022 --> 00:45:47,106
What did you say?

505
00:45:52,846 --> 00:45:54,486
When I entered, it's already like this.

506
00:45:54,996 --> 00:45:56,366
It's a burglar, right?

507
00:46:14,462 --> 00:46:16,806
What's that? What's that box?

508
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:20,006
An item they want to steal.

509
00:46:33,934 --> 00:46:35,046
(What's up?)

510
00:46:35,246 --> 00:46:38,046
You dared to testify to the police

511
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,400
even when you're making a living off of us.

512
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:43,366
(You aren't smart, and you still don't know your place.)

513
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:45,655
You still take Saikhim with you.

514
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:53,354
- What are you saying? - Saikhim isn't on the plane.

515
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,246
You lied to my sister.

516
00:46:55,686 --> 00:46:57,526
(Do you think I don't know your plan?)

517
00:46:58,086 --> 00:47:00,966
You're trying to hold my sister to get rich, right?

518
00:47:02,206 --> 00:47:03,259
What do you want?

519
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,246
Give my controller box back

520
00:47:05,766 --> 00:47:08,766
or else I'll tell Uncle that Saikhim ran away with you.

521
00:47:09,486 --> 00:47:11,846
(Or do you want me to tell him?)

522
00:47:12,493 --> 00:47:14,646
(You want to marry her for money, don't you?)

523
00:47:16,461 --> 00:47:17,546
When do you want it?

524
00:47:17,677 --> 00:47:18,894
By today.

525
00:47:19,422 --> 00:47:21,422
A controller box for a lady.

526
00:47:22,046 --> 00:47:23,486
It's so worth it, isn't it?

527
00:47:24,334 --> 00:47:27,406
Get your thing back and shut your mouth.

528
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:31,086
A scandalous matter like this,

529
00:47:31,286 --> 00:47:32,766
even if I don't say anything,

530
00:47:33,093 --> 00:47:34,766
you'll be caught one day.

531
00:47:35,005 --> 00:47:37,206
(I don't understand how you're so great.)

532
00:47:37,485 --> 00:47:39,486
Why is Saikhim so attracted to you?

533
00:47:40,438 --> 00:47:43,266
See you this evening. Please keep your words.

534
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,366
Is something wrong?

535
00:47:48,509 --> 00:47:51,166
Don't ask anything. You can't stay here today anymore.

536
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,126
Pack your stuff and leave now.

537
00:47:55,245 --> 00:47:56,446
Hurry up.

538
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:06,086
Where are we going?

539
00:48:06,173 --> 00:48:07,406
This place isn't safe.

540
00:48:11,317 --> 00:48:13,206
What do you have in that backpack?

541
00:48:17,173 --> 00:48:18,886
My career's equipment.

542
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:21,326
Don't ask questions. Quick.

543
00:48:23,853 --> 00:48:25,046
No.

544
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:28,446
What is your job?

545
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:30,886
You aren't a mechanic, right?

546
00:48:31,205 --> 00:48:32,606
How is it related to this?

547
00:48:32,687 --> 00:48:34,726
You were in jail before.

548
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:37,326
Is today's incident related to that?

549
00:48:37,526 --> 00:48:39,126
I won't kill you.

550
00:48:40,606 --> 00:48:43,326
I just want to know how much I can trust you.

551
00:48:43,566 --> 00:48:45,046
You're still wary of me?

552
00:48:45,285 --> 00:48:48,246
I don't know what your true nature is.

553
00:48:48,406 --> 00:48:50,046
I don't know whether you're good or bad.

554
00:48:50,301 --> 00:48:51,606
Just forget it.

555
00:48:51,702 --> 00:48:54,366
I'm not bad enough to kill my own child.

556
00:49:00,726 --> 00:49:01,926
I mean...

557
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:04,366
I'm not a murderer or anything.

558
00:49:04,957 --> 00:49:08,446
You didn't really want to help me.

559
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:10,806
Let's go.

560
00:49:13,846 --> 00:49:16,446
If you don't go, you'll get picked up by your brother.

561
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,846
Your brother knows we're together.

562
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:22,126
Knowing you ran away isn't as worse as knowing you're pregnant with my kid.

563
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,566
I bought some time. After we're done with the kid,

564
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:30,086
you'll be clean once again.

565
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:33,206
Let's go.

566
00:49:59,806 --> 00:50:00,981
Khim.

567
00:50:04,022 --> 00:50:05,446
Khim, what's this?

568
00:50:06,486 --> 00:50:08,286
You kidnapped Khim?

569
00:50:09,766 --> 00:50:11,006
Lita.

570
00:50:11,694 --> 00:50:14,686
I lied to my family and ran away together.

571
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:15,846
Huh?

572
00:50:17,454 --> 00:50:19,006
We're trying to solve the problem.

573
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,206
Why are you acting manly at this time?

574
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:24,886
He promised he would help us

575
00:50:25,117 --> 00:50:27,726
with the kid when my dad's overseas.

576
00:50:28,805 --> 00:50:31,166
Can I leave Khim with you for now?

577
00:50:31,676 --> 00:50:32,806
Sure.

578
00:50:33,126 --> 00:50:35,126
Who would want to let Khim stay with a pervert?

579
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:40,326
Khim.

580
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,686
If you're here, your dad can still follow you here.

581
00:50:45,104 --> 00:50:48,246
The foundation knows I'm living here.

582
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:03,889
Hello.

583
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:07,246
- "Anyong-haseyo." - "Anyong-haseyo."

584
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,886
Come here.

585
00:51:09,164 --> 00:51:11,286
- Hey. - What?

586
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:13,046
My friend will stay over at our place.

587
00:51:17,413 --> 00:51:19,206
You have a normal friend like her too?

588
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,006
Mom, I'm a human, not a ghost.

589
00:51:21,164 --> 00:51:22,926
He's handsome.

590
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:25,039
Okay. I allow it.

591
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,500
Please come in.

592
00:51:26,604 --> 00:51:28,726
Please come in.

593
00:51:45,229 --> 00:51:48,686
My mom rents this place. I don't think anyone can come here.

594
00:52:04,925 --> 00:52:06,966
Is he your friend? Not a boyfriend, right?

595
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:10,206
Mom, what are you saying? Look at his face.

596
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:12,086
I don't like that kind of face.

597
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:16,275
You talked about a man who only looked at your breasts. Isn't it him?

598
00:52:16,363 --> 00:52:17,426
Mom!

599
00:52:22,686 --> 00:52:24,046
Don't say it.

600
00:52:24,486 --> 00:52:25,566
Mom.

601
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:31,246
Oh, you're strong and you helped us clean a bit since you arrived.

602
00:52:31,446 --> 00:52:32,646
Let me ask you something.

603
00:52:32,886 --> 00:52:34,166
Do you like Lita?

604
00:52:34,338 --> 00:52:36,846
Mom, what are you saying?

605
00:52:37,135 --> 00:52:40,006
Do you know him? Do you know who his parents are?

606
00:52:40,286 --> 00:52:43,846
I don't know. I only know that he drove here to send you ladies.

607
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,006
He didn't let you come back alone at night.

608
00:52:46,134 --> 00:52:48,286
He's already manly enough for me.

609
00:52:48,486 --> 00:52:50,566
He's nice and he shows it.

610
00:52:50,766 --> 00:52:53,566
If he didn't like you, he wouldn't send you home.

611
00:52:56,262 --> 00:52:58,446
So, are you single?

612
00:52:59,116 --> 00:53:00,286
I'm single.

613
00:53:00,415 --> 00:53:02,366
Single? He already has one kid...

614
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:09,486
You're quick. Like me.

615
00:53:09,638 --> 00:53:12,086
I'm also single with one kid.

616
00:53:12,198 --> 00:53:14,606
See? It's alright.

617
00:53:22,928 --> 00:53:24,214
Hey.

618
00:53:27,406 --> 00:53:29,846
Do you really want to help Saikhim?

619
00:53:30,526 --> 00:53:32,406
Would I do this much if I didn't want to?

620
00:53:32,606 --> 00:53:35,606
You're being nice to Saikhim like this

621
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:38,366
to make her fall for you, right?

622
00:53:39,205 --> 00:53:41,205
My friend is not easy.

623
00:53:41,366 --> 00:53:42,806
Don't use your kid

624
00:53:43,908 --> 00:53:45,566
to try to trap her.

625
00:53:46,094 --> 00:53:47,406
Trap her?

626
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,646
Although you impregnated her,

627
00:53:50,997 --> 00:53:52,806
it doesn't mean you own her.

628
00:53:53,117 --> 00:53:54,806
We're in the modern age.

629
00:53:55,286 --> 00:53:58,326
Don't use your kid as an excuse to drag her down.

630
00:53:59,766 --> 00:54:01,286
If I weren't careless,

631
00:54:01,581 --> 00:54:03,766
you wouldn't get to do it with Saikhim.

632
00:54:04,766 --> 00:54:09,126
Remember. Don't try to play with fire.

633
00:54:11,326 --> 00:54:14,366
I know that. I'm doing this to pay for my sin.

634
00:54:14,806 --> 00:54:16,086
Not only this life,

635
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:18,606
we won't have to pay for our karma in the next life.

636
00:54:19,278 --> 00:54:21,806
You can begin your countdown. It won't be long.

637
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:48,278
We're even.

638
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:50,886
I got my things back. You got my sister.

639
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:54,166
You can't let anyone know this.

640
00:54:54,398 --> 00:54:55,726
You're a man.

641
00:54:56,237 --> 00:54:57,766
Accept your wrongdoing.

642
00:54:57,981 --> 00:55:00,326
In a few days, Saikhim will go back.

643
00:55:01,206 --> 00:55:04,086
My car's price is lowered. We're talking about humans here.

644
00:55:04,453 --> 00:55:05,886
We don't know how worse she will be.

645
00:55:06,293 --> 00:55:09,486
When that time comes, I don't know if Uncle will want her daughter back.

646
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,686
If you can't keep your promise,

647
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:13,886
you might get another charge.

648
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,140
Even if I don't say anything,

649
00:55:17,246 --> 00:55:20,634
it doesn't mean my uncle won't know. You should be careful.

650
00:55:21,766 --> 00:55:24,086
My uncle won't let you off easily.

651
00:55:51,374 --> 00:55:53,006
Is it because of that girl?

652
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:55,126
You ruin your career,

653
00:55:55,423 --> 00:55:57,350
risk yourself, and were almost imprisoned.

654
00:55:57,526 --> 00:56:00,406
How many times will your life be ruined because of that woman?

655
00:56:06,086 --> 00:56:07,326
Khem.

656
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,086
Where is Ms. Khim right now?

657
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,646
I asked my friend who works in an airline to check it for me.

658
00:56:35,757 --> 00:56:37,566
(She said Khim didn't go back.)

659
00:56:37,766 --> 00:56:41,726
(I asked the immigration. They confirmed that Khim is still in Thailand.)

660
00:56:42,183 --> 00:56:46,406
(Is it possible that Saikhim eloped with her boyfriend?)

661
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:50,126
(When Prompt knew about this, he tried to investigate it.)

662
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,846
What should we do?

663
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:57,286
(This means Khim must really love him.)

664
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:00,237
She has lied to us again.

665
00:57:00,429 --> 00:57:02,126
(Khim...)

666
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:04,806
She thought that man is better than her own dad.

667
00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:09,254
(I don't know if we should tell everyone about this. Earlier,)

668
00:57:09,366 --> 00:57:14,086
I saw Khim buy a pregnancy test kit.

669
00:57:14,997 --> 00:57:17,286
(I don't know if it's about this.)

670
00:57:21,412 --> 00:57:22,412
(I think)

671
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:25,486
we should wait for news from Prompt.

672
00:57:38,197 --> 00:57:40,726
I hope Uncle won't forgive Khim again this time.

673
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,206
They already have a child together.

674
00:57:43,446 --> 00:57:46,246
I think Mr. Sin can't accept it.

675
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:49,366
Mr. Sin loves and is extremely possessive of his daughter

676
00:57:49,709 --> 00:57:53,526
because Saikhim is the symbol that Rarin left behind.

677
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:56,006
Mr. Sin can't endure it anymore

678
00:57:56,398 --> 00:57:58,646
if his beloved got stolen again.

679
00:57:59,243 --> 00:58:00,246
Wow.

680
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:03,006
Aunt Rarin has passed away for over 10 years.

681
00:58:03,206 --> 00:58:04,966
It's a long time ago.

682
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:09,806
She didn't die normally. She committed suicide.

683
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:10,966
What?

684
00:58:11,206 --> 00:58:12,526
Committed suicide?

685
00:58:14,086 --> 00:58:17,206
I thought she was sick.

686
00:58:19,437 --> 00:58:24,006
Back then, you were a child. No one wanted you to know about it.

687
00:58:25,118 --> 00:58:27,566
Saikhim's mom liked a photographer

688
00:58:27,677 --> 00:58:29,526
who took nude photos of her.

689
00:58:29,678 --> 00:58:32,775
When they were leaked, it became a scandal for a while.

690
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:35,015
That's why Mr. Sin couldn't accept it

691
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:37,766
and they started to distrust each other.

692
00:58:37,934 --> 00:58:40,326
Rarin committed suicide to escape from the problem.

693
00:58:40,815 --> 00:58:42,815
I thought she was just having an affair.

694
00:58:42,951 --> 00:58:45,006
I didn't think it would be this bad.

695
00:58:45,295 --> 00:58:49,446
That's why Uncle Sin is so possessive of his daughter.

696
00:58:52,135 --> 00:58:54,126
Mr. Sin hates betrayal.

697
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:58,166
He wouldn't let Rarin touch Saikhim again after that incident.

698
00:58:58,406 --> 00:59:01,286
Rarin was frustrated and overdosed on her pills.

699
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:04,046
When Saikhim ran away to her lover,

700
00:59:04,246 --> 00:59:07,726
it makes Mr. Sin think that Saikhim is trying to keep a distance from him.

701
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:12,006
He couldn't accept that his daughter thinks of that man as more important.

702
00:59:12,222 --> 00:59:16,966
If Khim knows about this, she won't dare to face her dad again.

703
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:20,846
She brought it on herself. She's stupid to let that man trick her.

704
00:59:21,973 --> 00:59:23,446
This incident

705
00:59:23,797 --> 00:59:27,958
might make that father and daughter cut off their relationships.

706
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:31,006
Uncle Sin is probably heartbroken

707
00:59:31,206 --> 00:59:33,006
when he sees his daughter eloping with a man.

708
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,819
Uncle Sin is so unfortunate.

709
00:59:35,926 --> 00:59:39,366
No woman around him loves him at all.

710
00:59:39,862 --> 00:59:43,606
Who could stay with a heartless man like him?

711
00:59:44,086 --> 00:59:45,566
That's good though.

712
00:59:46,126 --> 00:59:48,806
He can't see your and Prompt's worth.

713
00:59:53,781 --> 00:59:56,166
I just cleaned Ms. Khim's room.

714
00:59:56,533 --> 01:00:00,446
I just learned that Ms. Khim was hiding these things.

715
01:00:00,606 --> 01:00:03,926
(When I count it, it's been over a month since that day.)

716
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:07,086
I'm worried. I'm afraid...

717
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,654
That scoundrel tries to use a kid to trap Saikhim.

718
01:00:12,925 --> 01:00:16,366
If it's true, what should we do?

719
01:00:33,816 --> 01:00:35,406
You're still wary of me?

720
01:00:35,641 --> 01:00:38,606
I don't know what your true nature is.

721
01:00:38,742 --> 01:00:40,486
I don't know whether you're good or bad.

722
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,973
Just forget it.

723
01:00:42,102 --> 01:00:44,486
I'm not bad enough to kill my own child.

724
01:01:30,341 --> 01:01:33,606
(Although you impregnated her, it doesn't mean you own her.)

725
01:01:34,061 --> 01:01:35,686
(We're in the modern age.)

726
01:01:36,315 --> 01:01:39,086
(Don't use your kid as an excuse to drag her down.)

727
01:01:39,573 --> 01:01:43,086
If I weren't careless, you wouldn't get to do it with Saikhim.

728
01:01:44,566 --> 01:01:45,846
Remember.

729
01:01:46,982 --> 01:01:49,446
Don't try to play with fire.

730
01:01:51,061 --> 01:01:53,526
Even if I want to take responsibility for you and your kid,

731
01:01:54,486 --> 01:01:59,686
I'm not worth enough to make you entrust your life to me, am I?

732
01:02:38,086 --> 01:02:40,646
(Sajee Salon)

733
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:19,206
So comfortable.

734
01:03:19,373 --> 01:03:22,126
It's so comfortable, isn't it?

735
01:03:22,439 --> 01:03:24,246
I understand why many men like it.

736
01:03:24,422 --> 01:03:27,726
Your hands are like a gift from heaven.

737
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,646
So good.

738
01:03:31,013 --> 01:03:35,006
- I still have my trump card left. - What is it?

739
01:03:37,886 --> 01:03:39,089
I feel weird now.

740
01:03:43,688 --> 01:03:45,645
Hey, stop, Mom.

741
01:04:25,808 --> 01:04:29,126
- How was it? - My friend saw us.

742
01:04:29,486 --> 01:04:32,166
You're awake. Are you hungry?

743
01:04:32,279 --> 01:04:33,998
I'm going to cook breakfast.

744
01:04:34,406 --> 01:04:35,846
- What about you? - I'm hungry.

745
01:04:35,966 --> 01:04:38,166
You're hungry, right? I'll do my best to cook.

746
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:40,646
Tell me what you want to eat.

747
01:04:44,286 --> 01:04:45,926
My mom is excited.

748
01:04:47,246 --> 01:04:48,646
Having a mother

749
01:04:49,606 --> 01:04:51,166
is nice.

750
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:55,526
When she had me while she's still studying, our ages weren't too far apart.

751
01:05:03,086 --> 01:05:05,286
My mom was once a young mother.

752
01:05:05,766 --> 01:05:08,006
She wasn't as careful as you

753
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:10,646
and decided to keep me. She didn't think hard enough,

754
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:12,646
so she gave birth to a woman like me.

755
01:05:40,821 --> 01:05:43,606
Wow. I thought you wouldn't come.

756
01:05:43,766 --> 01:05:44,965
I won't drag this on.

757
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:48,886
Did you sleep in your car to watch over Saikhim?

758
01:05:50,526 --> 01:05:51,926
Has Khim woke up?

759
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:04,526
What are you doing?

760
01:06:06,389 --> 01:06:07,766
Did you take the pill?

761
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:11,206
What did you eat? Spit it out.

762
01:06:11,657 --> 01:06:12,886
Spit it out first.

763
01:06:51,366 --> 01:06:52,606
What are you doing?

764
01:07:06,526 --> 01:07:08,926
- It's a candy. - That's right.

765
01:07:09,517 --> 01:07:12,966
I didn't know. I thought you already took that pill.

766
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:16,606
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

767
01:07:17,207 --> 01:07:18,712
You didn't mean to?

768
01:07:18,852 --> 01:07:21,686
You kissed Khim so passionately.

769
01:07:26,446 --> 01:07:28,086
- Khim. - Khim.

770
01:07:29,773 --> 01:07:31,486
Why are you so horny?

771
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:36,166
- Khim. - Stop, you pervert.

772
01:07:36,278 --> 01:07:38,406
- No, Khim. - Get out. Get out of here.

773
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,646
- Mom, it can't reach him. - Here.

774
01:07:40,904 --> 01:07:43,646
Mom, shake it more. Get out of here.

775
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:58,206
Is he crazy?

776
01:07:59,628 --> 01:08:01,246
Why did he do that?

777
01:08:03,006 --> 01:08:04,486
Why didn't he ask me first?

778
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,726
What have I done?

779
01:08:45,878 --> 01:08:47,126
It's over.

780
01:08:47,798 --> 01:08:49,406
How could I face her?

781
01:08:54,086 --> 01:08:55,766
(Lita)

782
01:09:01,811 --> 01:09:04,886
(Who are you? You have no right to break into my house.)

783
01:09:05,004 --> 01:09:06,639
(Get out of here.)

784
01:09:07,046 --> 01:09:08,241
(Kaokla)

785
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,686
I'm here to see Ms. Saikhim.

786
01:09:10,374 --> 01:09:13,886
Saikhim? How could she be here?

787
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:16,006
Ms. Khim ran away from home yesterday.

788
01:09:16,766 --> 01:09:18,686
Can I go search your house?

789
01:09:21,798 --> 01:09:25,006
You can't. We told you she's not here.

790
01:09:25,087 --> 01:09:26,486
You have no right to come in.

791
01:09:26,646 --> 01:09:28,246
Sir is worried about her.

792
01:09:28,446 --> 01:09:30,526
If we have proof that you've been in contact,

793
01:09:30,694 --> 01:09:32,846
we might find Saikhim easier.

794
01:09:33,126 --> 01:09:36,366
How could we know where Saikhim is?

795
01:09:36,766 --> 01:09:39,286
If you come into our house

796
01:09:39,526 --> 01:09:43,406
and my belongings got damaged, you must take responsibility.

797
01:09:54,526 --> 01:09:55,846
Where is Saikhim?

798
01:09:57,278 --> 01:09:58,446
How would I know?

799
01:09:58,606 --> 01:10:00,766
I know that you took Saikhim away.

800
01:10:00,983 --> 01:10:02,983
(Can you take care of her?)

801
01:10:03,102 --> 01:10:05,086
You dared to take my daughter away from me.

802
01:10:05,526 --> 01:10:06,766
I have to ask you that.

803
01:10:07,156 --> 01:10:10,246
(If you could take care of her, why would she want to run away from you?)

804
01:10:10,685 --> 01:10:12,966
Stop getting involved with my daughter.

805
01:10:14,013 --> 01:10:16,013
Don't use your kid to trap a woman.

806
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:18,166
(You can't even take care of yourself.)

807
01:10:18,451 --> 01:10:20,486
How would you take care of a woman?

808
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,560
I admit that I couldn't give her as much as you could.

809
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:27,166
Although I can't get her a golden cage,

810
01:10:27,494 --> 01:10:28,926
I'll take her to the horizon.

811
01:10:29,246 --> 01:10:30,806
(Think about it yourself.)

812
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:34,686
(Between a golden cage and a horizon, what would a bird want?)

813
01:10:34,934 --> 01:10:37,886
Even if I only have my body, you're no match for me

814
01:10:38,055 --> 01:10:39,750
because you've never given her freedom.

815
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:41,721
That's why she came to see a scoundrel like me.

816
01:10:54,669 --> 01:10:56,246
Report it the police now.

817
01:10:56,806 --> 01:10:57,806
- Yes. - Now.

818
01:10:58,077 --> 01:11:01,446
- Wait. - You can't go up there.

819
01:11:01,582 --> 01:11:02,926
Don't come here.

820
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:05,686
- I told you that you can't go up. - Get out.

821
01:11:05,846 --> 01:11:07,606
We didn't allow you to go up there.

822
01:11:07,758 --> 01:11:10,126
Don't you have any manners?

823
01:11:10,261 --> 01:11:12,126
We didn't allow you to come in.

824
01:11:12,366 --> 01:11:13,766
Stop.

825
01:11:35,766 --> 01:11:37,726
I won't let you open it.

826
01:11:40,118 --> 01:11:41,646
Don't open it.

827
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:50,146
Close it.

828
01:11:55,254 --> 01:11:58,439
I told you she's not here. You can only see my underwear.

829
01:11:58,567 --> 01:12:01,526
Are you satisfied now? She's not here.

830
01:12:07,576 --> 01:12:09,459
I told you she's not up there.

831
01:12:09,573 --> 01:12:11,366
I told you she's not here.

832
01:12:15,295 --> 01:12:18,413
- Mr. Sansern, she's not up there. - You can't go in there.

833
01:12:18,528 --> 01:12:19,876
We didn't allow you to come in.

834
01:12:20,029 --> 01:12:21,166
You have no right.

835
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:23,483
Who do you think you are?

836
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:25,446
Why aren't you respecting the law?

837
01:12:32,405 --> 01:12:35,966
If Ms. Saikhim isn't here, you don't have to be afraid.

838
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:39,246
If you're truly her friend, you should cooperate with us

839
01:12:39,454 --> 01:12:41,446
so that I can find her as soon as possible.

840
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:45,686
Because you're rude like this, she didn't want to be with you.

841
01:12:45,806 --> 01:12:47,726
It's normal if she wants to run away.

842
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:50,366
Mr. Sansern.

843
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:06,846
Kaokla.

844
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:12,566
Get back in there.

845
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:16,166
Someone is in the house.

846
01:13:16,406 --> 01:13:17,726
Stay still.

847
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:27,766
See? She's not here.

848
01:13:33,302 --> 01:13:34,566
Mr. Sansern.

849
01:13:46,814 --> 01:13:49,366
I told you she's not here.

850
01:13:51,363 --> 01:13:52,566
See? Jeez.

851
01:13:52,918 --> 01:13:56,126
You're wasting our strength. I told you she's not here.

852
01:14:02,519 --> 01:14:04,765
I told you she's not here, but you didn't listen.

853
01:14:04,872 --> 01:14:07,526
- Where are you going? - You already searched our house.

854
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:09,686
- You already searched for her. - Yeah.

855
01:14:10,773 --> 01:14:12,086
Don't move.

856
01:14:17,206 --> 01:14:18,446
Give me your handbag.

857
01:14:36,686 --> 01:14:39,886
Hey, I told you she's not here. You won't believe me.

858
01:14:43,318 --> 01:14:44,581
Has Kaokla contacted you?

859
01:14:44,766 --> 01:14:45,846
Kaokla?

860
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:47,726
Who?

861
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:50,286
He's the one who incited Miss to run away.

862
01:14:50,822 --> 01:14:52,726
They've ran away together twice.

863
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:58,817
You already know they're together,

864
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:00,446
why are you here?

865
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:02,686
Your daughter might have had help them escape.

866
01:15:03,604 --> 01:15:06,846
Everything unusual usually comes from your daughter.

867
01:15:08,127 --> 01:15:09,286
Is that true?

868
01:15:11,823 --> 01:15:14,726
But I really have no idea this time, Mom.

869
01:15:17,526 --> 01:15:18,766
I swear.

870
01:15:22,845 --> 01:15:25,046
Calm down. Don't be scared.

871
01:15:25,886 --> 01:15:27,206
Walk here slowly.

872
01:15:29,478 --> 01:15:30,646
Give me your hand.

873
01:15:36,718 --> 01:15:38,006
Look at me.

874
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:46,166
Slowly.

875
01:15:48,686 --> 01:15:50,252
After I count, walk to me.

876
01:15:53,246 --> 01:15:55,885
One, two, three.

877
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,569
We've searched thoroughly, but haven't found anything.

878
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:14,686
I knew it.

879
01:16:14,814 --> 01:16:16,166
What about these clothes?

880
01:16:17,285 --> 01:16:18,686
We haven't found them either.

881
01:16:20,935 --> 01:16:22,751
Mom, we haven't had any customers today.

882
01:16:22,832 --> 01:16:25,040
Yeah. If it's like this,

883
01:16:25,133 --> 01:16:27,966
no customers will come here. Let me give you a face massage.

884
01:16:28,078 --> 01:16:30,206
I'll massage your face like this.

885
01:16:30,366 --> 01:16:34,039
- Let's give you a face massage. - That's enough.

886
01:16:35,778 --> 01:16:36,926
Enough.

887
01:16:43,422 --> 01:16:45,206
Consider it our compensation.

888
01:16:45,366 --> 01:16:47,366
If you know anything about those two, call me.

889
01:16:47,949 --> 01:16:49,726
- Just this? - You don't want it?

890
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:53,713
Wait. I want it, of course.

891
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:56,846
Do you want more face massages?

892
01:16:57,046 --> 01:17:00,197
Face massage? Do you want some more?

893
01:17:00,301 --> 01:17:01,766
Goodbye.

894
01:17:09,051 --> 01:17:10,051
Slowly.

895
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:12,206
Are you alright?

896
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,046
If you want to entrust your life to me,

897
01:17:17,411 --> 01:17:18,730
we must trust each other.

898
01:17:18,902 --> 01:17:20,606
That's when we will survive.

899
01:17:25,806 --> 01:17:27,166
Us three...

900
01:17:44,886 --> 01:17:46,366
Can we survive?

901
01:17:48,366 --> 01:17:49,846
It depends on you.

902
01:17:50,334 --> 01:17:51,926
If you want him to stay or not.

903
01:17:52,851 --> 01:17:55,446
But if he's with me, he would be safe.

904
01:17:57,133 --> 01:17:59,566
- Are you sure? - Yes.

905
01:18:01,854 --> 01:18:05,046
I didn't even die when you pushed me into the sea.

906
01:18:07,446 --> 01:18:08,646
Hey.

907
01:18:09,526 --> 01:18:12,886
I helped you to not let you get caught.

908
01:18:23,483 --> 01:18:26,486
If I died that day, how would you be right now?

909
01:18:30,118 --> 01:18:31,118
I...

910
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:37,366
I would probably be hanging around there or laying around here.

911
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:41,886
If the three of us survive today,

912
01:18:42,989 --> 01:18:44,606
can I ask you one thing?

913
01:18:45,894 --> 01:18:47,166
What do you want?

914
01:18:49,286 --> 01:18:50,486
Can I...

915
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:03,686
How are you?

916
01:19:06,796 --> 01:19:08,046
Is the baby alright?

917
01:19:13,846 --> 01:19:14,966
Be careful.

918
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:26,286
The doctor said the patient is safe after the x-ray examination.

919
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:28,886
There are only external bruises and wounds.

920
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:31,166
You can leave after his wounds are dressed.

921
01:19:31,254 --> 01:19:32,333
Thank you.

922
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:49,046
Since we knew each other,

923
01:19:49,901 --> 01:19:51,901
you got hurt because of me countless of times.

924
01:19:52,462 --> 01:19:54,126
I also ruin your life.

925
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,720
Your dad probably knows about your kid now.

926
01:20:00,422 --> 01:20:01,886
It's time for the appointment.

927
01:20:02,446 --> 01:20:03,766
Let's go there.

928
01:20:05,766 --> 01:20:07,366
The baby already survived.

929
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,046
How could I kill him?

930
01:20:17,286 --> 01:20:18,646
It's not just his life.

931
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:20,406
Your life is also important.

932
01:20:20,743 --> 01:20:22,446
I'm worried about your future.

933
01:20:23,038 --> 01:20:25,006
For me, I have nothing to lose.

934
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:28,686
When we were escaping,

935
01:20:29,717 --> 01:20:32,726
you said you wanted to ask me for one thing.

936
01:20:35,686 --> 01:20:37,366
If the three of us survive,

937
01:20:37,998 --> 01:20:39,358
can I ask you one thing?

938
01:20:40,606 --> 01:20:41,766
What do you want?

939
01:20:46,446 --> 01:20:47,766
What do you want?

940
01:20:49,037 --> 01:20:51,486
Can I do anything to pay you back?

941
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,406
I want you to change your mind and give the kid to me.

942
01:21:00,158 --> 01:21:01,726
I can raise one kid.

943
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:07,846
I know it's impossible.

944
01:21:08,937 --> 01:21:11,166
I have to destroy your life for his life.

945
01:21:12,397 --> 01:21:13,806
It's too selfish.

946
01:21:15,749 --> 01:21:17,286
Those eight to nine months,

947
01:21:17,853 --> 01:21:19,566
it isn't worth it.

948
01:21:55,093 --> 01:21:56,806
He would be safe if he is with me.

949
01:21:58,412 --> 01:21:59,566
Is the baby alright?

950
01:22:00,129 --> 01:22:01,206
Be careful.

951
01:22:36,981 --> 01:22:38,086
Let's go.

952
01:22:43,046 --> 01:22:44,166
Wait.

953
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:54,566
Can you show it to me?

954
01:22:56,053 --> 01:22:57,926
How would you raise him?

955
01:23:00,518 --> 01:23:02,206
If you can raise him,

956
01:23:02,886 --> 01:23:04,726
I'll give him to you.

957
01:23:08,014 --> 01:23:10,166
Are you sure you want to keep the kid?

958
01:23:10,606 --> 01:23:13,446
Honestly, I think he's good for nothing.

959
01:23:13,806 --> 01:23:16,566
(Don't you think it's better if you come back here?)

960
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:22,206
Thank you for your worry, Lita.

961
01:23:22,486 --> 01:23:25,446
But I can look after myself.

962
01:23:26,413 --> 01:23:27,646
Khim.

963
01:23:27,959 --> 01:23:30,166
Our lives have more than that.

964
01:23:30,366 --> 01:23:32,126
Come back and let us help.

965
01:23:32,445 --> 01:23:34,686
There might be a better way than this.

966
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:38,926
I can't go back to fix anything now.

967
01:23:39,486 --> 01:23:43,166
I'll move on even if there's a cliff in front of me.

968
01:24:40,133 --> 01:24:41,766
(I didn't think a lady like her)

969
01:24:42,358 --> 01:24:44,806
(would risk herself with a man with no future like me.)

970
01:24:46,062 --> 01:24:48,406
(Even a wise man can make a mistake.)

971
01:24:49,892 --> 01:24:52,446
(I admit I lost to her because of that silly thing.)

972
01:26:33,973 --> 01:26:35,886
You asked how I would raise our kid.

973
01:26:36,717 --> 01:26:40,046
Here. I would raise him where I grew up.

974
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:49,046
Don't worry. He won't become like me.

975
01:26:52,733 --> 01:26:54,926
I assure you that I can raise him well enough.

976
01:26:55,646 --> 01:26:58,606
I'll prove to him that he's lucky to be born in this world.

977
01:26:58,934 --> 01:27:00,926
At least, he'll get to live a wild life.

978
01:27:01,406 --> 01:27:03,446
He won't feel like it's a waste.

979
01:27:11,021 --> 01:27:13,246
He also won't starve like you.

980
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:20,286
Hey, I wasn't that starving.

981
01:27:21,573 --> 01:27:23,006
Stop acting.

982
01:27:23,742 --> 01:27:25,446
Why are you still embarrassed now?

983
01:27:33,766 --> 01:27:35,566
Don't act like I'm a stranger.

984
01:27:37,999 --> 01:27:40,190
Since when are we close?

985
01:27:41,693 --> 01:27:43,166
Such high pride.

986
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:46,366
We're still too far apart.

987
01:27:47,869 --> 01:27:49,126
Like this.

988
01:27:49,494 --> 01:27:50,886
Is this far enough?

989
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:52,726
Is this enough?

990
01:27:55,006 --> 01:27:57,726
(I want to turn my life around because of you.)

991
01:28:17,221 --> 01:28:19,566
I think Kaokla wants to use their kid to trap Khim

992
01:28:19,813 --> 01:28:22,366
- and to challenge us. - Did you kidnap her?

993
01:28:22,486 --> 01:28:23,966
What do you think of me, Dad?

994
01:28:24,222 --> 01:28:25,726
You're impatient.

995
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:28,286
Have you ever done anything successfully?

996
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:30,846
- What are you doing here? - Dad.

997
01:28:31,766 --> 01:28:32,926
What are you doing?

998
01:28:33,086 --> 01:28:34,726
You use emotion to lead your life.

999
01:28:34,925 --> 01:28:36,206
What about the consequence?

1000
01:28:37,382 --> 01:28:38,646
So, what do you say?

1001
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:40,886
Can you live here with me?

1002
01:28:41,286 --> 01:28:43,206
What do you want me to live as?

1003
01:28:43,406 --> 01:28:44,686
Why are you that scared?

1004
01:28:47,926 --> 01:28:49,686
- Don't. - I'll take responsibility

1005
01:28:49,894 --> 01:28:53,238
after I've bothered your daughter, if you wouldn't mind.

1006
01:28:53,655 --> 01:28:55,486
I'm here to ask for Saikhim's hand.

1007
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,583
Kla!
