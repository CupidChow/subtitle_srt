1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,230
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,317 --> 00:00:02,356
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,454 --> 00:00:03,634
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,446
If we could rewind the time to fix our relationship,

5
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:26,166
what would you change?

6
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:12,006
No.

7
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:33,030
(The beginning of love)

8
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:34,354
(Someone said)

9
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,406
(we would find the right one on the right day.)

10
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,646
(But we don't know when it will be.)

11
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:44,446
(More importantly, we can't tell that)

12
00:01:44,694 --> 00:01:46,966
(they'll be our right one forever.)

13
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,726
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

14
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,686
Khim.

15
00:02:58,926 --> 00:02:59,926
Lita.

16
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:03,166
We'll meet at the top.

17
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:05,086
I'll run over there.

18
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,286
Excuse me.

19
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:10,966
Excuse me.

20
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,006
Excuse me.

21
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:15,758
Hey.

22
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,806
I miss you so much.

23
00:03:30,718 --> 00:03:32,957
How are you? How are you doing?

24
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:35,609
Sorry. I didn't think the flight would be delayed this long.

25
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,406
It's alright. Look at me.

26
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:40,926
- Wow. - Do I look good?

27
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:42,078
Yes.

28
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:50,446
I hope you'll enjoy your new life.

29
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:57,846
The map and the key. Here.

30
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:01,806
You'll soon learn that being Lita is boring.

31
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:06,766
Lita, don't let anyone suspect us.

32
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:09,046
I promise.

33
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:13,325
I won't let anyone suspect where Ms. Saikhim is.

34
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:22,206
Smile.

35
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:26,806
One, two, three.

36
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:32,406
I hope you'll enjoy your new life.

37
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:33,806
You too, Lita.

38
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:36,566
This exchange of our lives,

39
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:40,126
it might profit us both.

40
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:44,246
Of course. I'll use this card

41
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:46,726
as much as I could.

42
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,486
Kla.

43
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:22,286
What should we have?

44
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:27,846
I don't know. Let's go take a look.

45
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:31,886
Why would you be gone for that long?

46
00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:34,726
I'll be working on several flights this time.

47
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:38,086
You can't be complacent. You must take care of our kid.

48
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:41,646
You're worried about our kid. Aren't you worried I would have someone else?

49
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,526
If you dare.

50
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:48,446
Who would I hug when you're gone for several days?

51
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:51,525
You wouldn't understand when you've never been left behind.

52
00:05:58,901 --> 00:05:59,993
Fine.

53
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,126
I promise I'll be a good boy.

54
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:05,126
Let me be spoiled when you get back.

55
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,646
Alright.

56
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:24,566
Hello, welcome home, my darling. How are you?

57
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:26,807
Are you tired today?

58
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:28,302
- Yes. - Let's go.

59
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:35,286
Can this thing heal your tiredness, Noey?

60
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:38,366
Are you giving it to me?

61
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:41,486
I'll add some upgrades to make it faster.

62
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:45,698
This car will be yours soon after.

63
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:48,217
- Thank you so much. - Let's go.

64
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:50,086
- Thank you. - Let's try it.

65
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,926
(To make your ten days worthwhile,)

66
00:06:57,078 --> 00:06:59,438
(you'll start by getting rid of your missy behavior.)

67
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:12,326
Lita has a cat?

68
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:13,966
Bombay.

69
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:16,477
Bombay.

70
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:18,486
Bombay.

71
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:24,006
Meow.

72
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,486
Bombay, come back to me.

73
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:39,886
(This phone is a surprise gift from me.)

74
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,503
(Right. I've made a profile for you in a dating app)

75
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,206
(and chose five men around there.)

76
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:50,606
(Don't get disgusted.)

77
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:53,306
(I chose only the non-playboy ones for you.)

78
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:57,006
(Stop hiding in your shell and try to go out with the men I chose for you.)

79
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:59,886
(If you want to live a good life, you need a boyfriend.)

80
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,646
(I flirted with them to give you a head start.)

81
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:03,549
(The rest is up to you.)

82
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,486
(If a woman isn't flirting, it's like she doesn't have a life.)

83
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:08,246
(Find a lover,)

84
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,486
(so your life won't be this boring.)

85
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:35,406
(I don't know why,)

86
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:37,046
(but I miss you all day long.)

87
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:39,926
(We're close by, but our hearts are closer.)

88
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,206
(If you're lonely, you can chat with me.)

89
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:47,886
Lita, what have you done?

90
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:50,166
Khim.

91
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:53,486
Don't look at me like that. I'm embarrassed.

92
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:56,246
Did losing my cat make you that happy?

93
00:09:57,934 --> 00:10:00,246
- Before finding a wife, find my cat first. - Hey.

94
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:07,206
Khim, are you hurt? What...

95
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:11,787
You're using my photo to chat with a girl again, Khem?

96
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:13,806
Your face is so attractive.

97
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:17,286
I'm hot when I use your photo. Look, a lot of girls are chatting with me.

98
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:20,126
You haven't learned anything, have you?

99
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,760
If you put your hand on a minor, I'll be in jail instead of you.

100
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:27,006
We're only chatting. Don't say that or Khim will lose her reputation.

101
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:28,406
Stop.

102
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,566
This app is for finding a sexual partner.

103
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,326
See? All of them.

104
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:37,846
Khim isn't that kind of girl. Kla.

105
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:40,406
Give me my phone back. I was talking to her.

106
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,547
You're finding your true love among strangers.

107
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:44,646
Would you meet anyone who'll be serious with you?

108
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:47,419
They're only looking for a one-night stand.

109
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:50,126
How could they be serious? They just want to score with men.

110
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:52,110
Stop dreaming, Khem.

111
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,114
If you can't differentiate between sex and love,

112
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:56,606
you'll never find your true love in this life.

113
00:10:57,886 --> 00:11:00,206
- Is it that bad? - Yes.

114
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:04,166
Oh, meow. Come here. Come on.

115
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:07,846
Kla.

116
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,446
Everyone would run away when they saw my face.

117
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,966
My face isn't as good as yours.

118
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:15,686
You have to find someone who truly loves who you are.

119
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:18,086
If you want to find a sincere girl,

120
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:20,326
you should stop using this fraudulent app.

121
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:23,566
Go and find a good woman who helps you to make a living like mine.

122
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,790
You always praise your girlfriend when you have a chance.

123
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:29,686
My phone is always avoiding me.

124
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,046
Stop, Khem.

125
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:35,326
If you're determined, you'll meet a sincere woman like Yaemsom.

126
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:41,166
No, Kla. Kla.

127
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,709
- What? - Kla.

128
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:44,806
How could I talk with her now?

129
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:21,366
- Noodles are here. - Noodles are here.

130
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:23,886
- Let's go, everyone. - Let's go.

131
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:26,726
Noodles are here.

132
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:30,686
Everyone can have vegetables?

133
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:32,726
- Yes. - No.

134
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:34,606
- I want the same. - Sure.

135
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,625
- What are you having? - Noodles with fried wonton.

136
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,665
- I want one, please. - Of course.

137
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:49,806
Does anyone want some more?

138
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:51,606
- Me. - Me.

139
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:53,046
Everyone.

140
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:55,292
Excuse me, we would like five more.

141
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,399
- Sure. Please wait for a moment. - Yes.

142
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,806
Right. Someone just said they wanted to show me something.

143
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:02,686
- All of us. - Yes.

144
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,366
Really? Let me see.

145
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:07,544
One, two, three.

146
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,206
Oppa Gangnam Style.

147
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:13,406
One, two, three.

148
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:16,229
Oppa Gangnam Style.

149
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,886
Sexy ladies.

150
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,806
The train is here. Let's go.

151
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:34,886
- Where are you going? - We're going home.

152
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,566
We're going home.

153
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:38,846
You haven't eaten all of them.

154
00:13:39,462 --> 00:13:40,806
Come back.

155
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:43,206
Those kids ride the free train.

156
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,926
When they see it coming, they rush to get on it.

157
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:47,486
Really?

158
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:52,046
- Then, I'll pay for all of them. - Yes.

159
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,846
Are you done?

160
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:00,566
Wait.

161
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,722
- Take this noodle. - Thank you.

162
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:05,046
- Get on the train. - Thank you.

163
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:11,646
- Bye. - Bye.

164
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,646
She's an emo girl.

165
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,206
It's 16 baht.

166
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:49,366
I'm sorry.

167
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,486
- I don't want it anymore. - It's alright.

168
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:04,046
She couldn't even pay 16 baht. Is she trying to scam Khem?

169
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:40,046
Be careful.

170
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:54,646
Be careful.

171
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,926
Motorcycles like to get on the footpath around here.

172
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,966
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

173
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:30,001
I would like one roti, please.

174
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:31,486
Sure. Here you are.

175
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,846
Thank you.

176
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:37,766
- May. - Yes?

177
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:39,926
- The same thing. - Sure.

178
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,806
You're so generous.

179
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:45,126
Can I get one too?

180
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,806
- Of course. Here you are. - Thank you.

181
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:52,166
Would you like some rotis?

182
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:06,446
Would you like some roti? Rotis for happiness.

183
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:08,566
They're free.

184
00:18:15,446 --> 00:18:16,446
Here.

185
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:18,886
You should take two, so you won't get hungry.

186
00:18:19,518 --> 00:18:22,726
Someone paid me to let anyone take it for free.

187
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:24,126
That man.

188
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:27,366
He used to starve before.

189
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:30,093
He understands what it's like when you don't have anything to eat.

190
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,646
When he has enough, he shares some with others.

191
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:00,046
This car just came in.

192
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:02,086
He wants us to upgrade everything.

193
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:07,264
He said he wants to give it to his wife as a wedding gift. He's rich.

194
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:09,038
- Khem. - Yes?

195
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,646
Did he forget his stuff?

196
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,006
It's probably his wife's luggage.

197
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,086
- I'll call him. - Hold on.

198
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,640
Why does it look like Yaemsom's?

199
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:20,526
It's the same one as this morning.

200
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,216
It really is.

201
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,566
Are you crazy?

202
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,926
How could it be your girlfriend's luggage?

203
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:32,166
You said she was going on a flight.

204
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:34,686
Yeah. She must have been on a plane by now.

205
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,306
Wait for the flight to land.

206
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:39,406
You should try to call her and ask if her luggage got swapped.

207
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:07,686
(As a successful businessman,)

208
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:10,566
(do you have anything to say to the new generation?)

209
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:11,891
(For me,)

210
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:13,806
(success doesn't have any shortcuts.)

211
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:16,486
(If you want it, you must work hard for it.)

212
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:18,926
(Mr. Songsin, you've been working this hard.)

213
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,766
(How could you manage to make some time for your family?)

214
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:23,486
(I have a daughter.)

215
00:20:24,438 --> 00:20:25,846
(I gave everything to her.)

216
00:20:26,086 --> 00:20:28,726
(I heard Saikhim is a good girl.)

217
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:31,006
(She's great at everything, isn't she?)

218
00:20:31,342 --> 00:20:32,446
(Yes.)

219
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:34,846
(No matter what I ask her to do,)

220
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:37,566
(she's never disappointed me even once.)

221
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:56,526
Dad.

222
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:24,246
Hello, Dad.

223
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:25,806
What are you doing?

224
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:28,406
I just came back home.

225
00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:30,726
Are you sure you can live alone?

226
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:36,886
I can live alone.

227
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:39,846
(You don't have to worry about me. I can live by myself.)

228
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:41,526
If you're scared, tell me.

229
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:43,606
I'll find someone to accompany you.

230
00:21:44,364 --> 00:21:46,566
I've already grown up, Dad.

231
00:21:46,797 --> 00:21:48,366
Why can't I live alone?

232
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:51,766
Don't make Oun feel guilty that she went back home first.

233
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:55,326
She rarely asks to go home.

234
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:57,046
If you can think of others,

235
00:21:57,318 --> 00:21:59,446
you've really grown up, Khim.

236
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:03,846
What did you say?

237
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:09,406
If you praise me that much, of course, I'm embarrassed.

238
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:12,126
See you at home in 10 days.

239
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:18,446
Kla, have you seen this?

240
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:20,724
She has arrived? She hasn't answered my call.

241
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:22,086
She isn't at the hotel yet.

242
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,566
No. Look at it carefully.

243
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:26,684
- Look at what? - Kla.

244
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,366
Your girlfriend didn't go alone.

245
00:22:29,717 --> 00:22:31,726
Did you see who she went with? In the glasses.

246
00:22:33,742 --> 00:22:35,726
- Who is he? - Kla.

247
00:22:35,862 --> 00:22:38,150
He's the owner of this Mini Cooper.

248
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:43,046
I'm sure your girlfriend didn't go anywhere, so her luggage is here.

249
00:22:43,432 --> 00:22:45,432
She just went to see her new man.

250
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:47,166
You're being deceived, Kla.

251
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,406
If you don't believe me,

252
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:53,926
should we go to the house?

253
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,006
She might be there.

254
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:06,326
No. Can I stay alive for 10 days?

255
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:19,366
What?

256
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,000
- How did you get here? - How did you get here?

257
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,766
This is my girlfriend's house. Who are you?

258
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,766
Girlfriend?

259
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:30,646
You're my friend's boyfriend?

260
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:33,726
Your friend? Do you know Yaemsom?

261
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:35,296
I don't know Yaemsom.

262
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:38,086
I only know my friend, Lita.

263
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:44,006
- Who's this? - The house owner.

264
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,446
Why does my girlfriend's house have her photo?

265
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:48,406
Because she's the owner of this house.

266
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,806
Yaem.

267
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:52,406
- Yaem, are you here? - Hey.

268
00:23:58,501 --> 00:23:59,646
Yaem.

269
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,046
How did you get here?

270
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:14,846
Did you follow me from that app?

271
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:17,846
That should be my question. Why did you bother my girlfriend?

272
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:21,686
Are you trying to get close to me by getting close to my girlfriend?

273
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,846
No.

274
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,806
I don't know how you and Lita know each other.

275
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:30,206
Whose is this?

276
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:32,326
- Ouch. - It's mine.

277
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:33,566
Don't look at it.

278
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:36,326
You're trespassing and now you assaulted me?

279
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:39,646
I didn't trespass. This is my friend's home.

280
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:43,526
How could an emo girl be my girlfriend's friend?

281
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:46,686
What is an emo girl?

282
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:49,646
- Hey. - Stop.

283
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:52,006
- What are you doing? - What am I doing?

284
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,446
This.

285
00:24:56,084 --> 00:24:57,885
Why is Yaemsom's stuff here?

286
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:00,726
If it's not her house,

287
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:02,366
why are her photos here?

288
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:04,326
Why is my photo here?

289
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,486
I'm the one who's paying for this house in installments.

290
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:14,926
But I don't know who this woman is.

291
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:20,896
- Lita's house? - I don't know.

292
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:24,046
I don't know anything. I want to see my girlfriend now.

293
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:26,005
This is a scam.

294
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,286
I don't care.

295
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,886
But please get out of my house.

296
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:33,526
I'm suspicious of you. That's why you're here.

297
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:35,566
Get out.

298
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,566
Get all of your stuff out.

299
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:42,806
Leave the key and don't come back.

300
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,846
Go back to your parents.

301
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:30,486
It's only been a day.

302
00:26:31,158 --> 00:26:33,286
Why am I so weak-willed?

303
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:44,606
I have to survive.

304
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:48,286
Here.

305
00:26:48,438 --> 00:26:49,726
Thank you.

306
00:26:51,086 --> 00:26:52,566
(Pawnshop)

307
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:06,334
(Pawnshop)

308
00:27:06,597 --> 00:27:07,966
I see. She needs money.

309
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:10,166
That's why she's been deceiving men.

310
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:13,646
(Sorry.)

311
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:17,022
(The number that you've dialed cannot be connected at this time)

312
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:20,166
Why hasn't she answered my call yet?

313
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:24,566
Oh, wow.

314
00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:26,460
(Sorry.)

315
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:29,406
(The number that you've dialed cannot be connected at this time)

316
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:32,566
I'm rich!

317
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:38,646
Princess.

318
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:42,646
What's this house?

319
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:45,446
A personal sauna room?

320
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:49,446
(Sorry. The number that you've dialed cannot be connected at this time)

321
00:27:49,746 --> 00:27:52,896
Wow. I can't stand it.

322
00:27:54,102 --> 00:27:56,166
For only 10 days.

323
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:08,566
Who?

324
00:28:34,118 --> 00:28:35,366
Hello.

325
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:38,366
Are you Khim? It's me, Thaenthai.

326
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:40,213
Which Thaen?

327
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:42,646
Khim has never talked about him.

328
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,686
(Saikhim)

329
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,166
Hello, Saikhim.

330
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:54,046
You call me at the right time.

331
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:56,396
Someone is ringing your doorbell.

332
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,864
Lita, explain to me right now.

333
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:01,686
The house that you let me stay in, whose house is it?

334
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:04,062
(How is it? Can you hear me, Khim?)

335
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,939
(Suddenly, the owner came in and said it was his house.)

336
00:29:07,086 --> 00:29:09,926
Lita, I was chased out of that house.

337
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:12,966
Tell me what the truth is.

338
00:29:13,846 --> 00:29:15,046
Well...

339
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:17,566
I rented a house for you.

340
00:29:19,486 --> 00:29:20,686
Lita.

341
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:24,166
We've agreed to exchange our houses.

342
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,726
Khim, can I come inside?

343
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:29,086
(Hello?)

344
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:31,686
Khim.

345
00:29:32,877 --> 00:29:34,486
- (Lita.) - Hey.

346
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:36,766
I wanted to treat you nicely, Saikhim.

347
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:39,926
A rich girl like you wants to live in my house?

348
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:43,526
I've paid rent for that house. You have to stay there.

349
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:47,366
Khim, are you alone?

350
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:49,813
Whose voice is that?

351
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:52,446
I also want to ask you.

352
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,606
Who is this Thaenthai?

353
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,726
(Who is he? He wants to see you.)

354
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,286
Lita,

355
00:29:58,702 --> 00:30:01,886
you can't go out. You can't let him know you're there.

356
00:30:03,806 --> 00:30:06,406
Okay. I'll chase him away.

357
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:14,526
Ms. Saikhim isn't home.

358
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:16,486
She's still at school.

359
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:18,846
(And who's speaking?)

360
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:20,399
What should I do?

361
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,646
Lita, don't say anything. Just be quiet.

362
00:30:24,473 --> 00:30:26,286
Why am I so unlucky?

363
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:30,286
What? I think I'm the more unlucky one.

364
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,406
Because I was the one who got scammed.

365
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:38,486
Thaen is calling me. I'll hang up now.

366
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,846
Hello, Thaen.

367
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,886
Khim, I came to see you at your house.

368
00:30:50,086 --> 00:30:51,166
(You aren't home?)

369
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:53,966
Oh, well...

370
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:58,006
I'm at the university's library, Thaen.

371
00:30:58,364 --> 00:30:59,766
Is something the matter?

372
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:03,246
Uncle said you're living alone, so he asked me to visit you.

373
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:04,886
(Do you want to go out for a drive?)

374
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:06,646
Uncle said

375
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:08,846
you didn't have to go back to Thailand.

376
00:31:10,926 --> 00:31:14,486
Oh, I think that should be for next time.

377
00:31:14,678 --> 00:31:18,326
I want to do research in Thailand.

378
00:31:19,374 --> 00:31:21,646
Then, should we go back together?

379
00:31:24,852 --> 00:31:26,686
I don't know

380
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:28,446
when I'll get to go back.

381
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:31,366
Thaen, you don't have to wait for me.

382
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:32,726
Then...

383
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,977
Okay.

384
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:36,366
If there's anything urgent, call me.

385
00:31:36,606 --> 00:31:38,086
So, your dad won't be worried.

386
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:39,446
Yes.

387
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,446
Thank you, Thaen.

388
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:47,806
Wait.

389
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:49,886
Is Saikhim hiding her boyfriend?

390
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:52,646
Why is he so handsome?

391
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:10,727
(Saikhim)

392
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:21,606
I'm sorry, Khim.

393
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,445
Please give me some time.

394
00:32:27,807 --> 00:32:31,766
(Sorry. The number that you've dialed cannot be connected at this time)

395
00:32:39,806 --> 00:32:42,526
Is she trying to escape like this?

396
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:53,726
There's an interview about the Shanghai investment project at 4 pm.

397
00:32:53,982 --> 00:32:56,526
At night, you have dinner with the governor.

398
00:32:58,661 --> 00:32:59,766
Sir.

399
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:04,286
The bank said Miss's credit card was used in Thailand.

400
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:07,046
Did Khim know this?

401
00:33:07,534 --> 00:33:08,966
She probably hasn't woken up.

402
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:11,046
I told them to freeze it.

403
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:13,766
I think it's hacked online.

404
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:16,406
Make a new one.

405
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:18,606
I want Khim to stay in England for this term.

406
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:20,046
Yes.

407
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,086
It's a shame

408
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:27,926
that Khim couldn't come back in time for this.

409
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:30,326
I heard you allowed Thaenthai

410
00:33:30,486 --> 00:33:32,326
to take Khim to travel in Scotland.

411
00:33:34,286 --> 00:33:35,406
What's wrong?

412
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,070
I'm just wondering. When Oun

413
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:41,086
took a leave to her home this time, was it a coincidence

414
00:33:41,677 --> 00:33:43,257
or did she left to open a way for someone.

415
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:48,126
Mind your own business.

416
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:55,086
If you want to go out for a dinner, you can carry this one.

417
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:56,606
Like this.

418
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:57,886
What are you doing?

419
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:02,846
The handbag's brand sent me a handbag to review, Uncle Sin.

420
00:34:03,198 --> 00:34:07,341
This one was held by Prim first. It's sent to her before anyone else.

421
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:09,206
Every handbag that Prim has,

422
00:34:09,452 --> 00:34:11,366
everyone will buy it.

423
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,680
You should do something for money,

424
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,526
not just something for your pride.

425
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:32,566
Prompt.

426
00:34:33,646 --> 00:34:35,646
What did you do to upset him?

427
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:37,526
He took it out on your sister.

428
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:41,166
I just realized Uncle Sin's scheme.

429
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:44,846
Isn't it strange, Mom?

430
00:34:45,446 --> 00:34:47,286
That Uncle suddenly let Khim date a man.

431
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,749
A man?

432
00:34:48,932 --> 00:34:50,446
Which man, Prompt?

433
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:52,791
Uncle Sin is usually worried about Khim.

434
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,566
It's Thaenthai, the son of the bank's owner.

435
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:59,086
Thaenthai and Saikhim?

436
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:02,326
Uncle Sin is trying to gather money to do something.

437
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:04,046
Don't you think so, Mom?

438
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,326
Using his own daughter.

439
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:08,846
This project can't be normal.

440
00:35:09,313 --> 00:35:12,566
A spoiled girl like Khim isn't Thaen's type at all.

441
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:14,326
Uncle Sin is too much.

442
00:35:14,806 --> 00:35:17,926
Yeah. It's another thing if it's Prim, my daughter.

443
00:35:18,126 --> 00:35:20,606
Mr. Sin is making a mistake this time.

444
00:35:21,406 --> 00:35:22,566
I don't understand

445
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:26,766
why Uncle Sin always tries to brag about Khim in front of me.

446
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:29,886
Who would want to be a nerd like her?

447
00:35:31,326 --> 00:35:34,326
I think you have to show Uncle Sin

448
00:35:34,454 --> 00:35:36,826
how bad his daughter is.

449
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:38,686
Although she looks innocent,

450
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:40,631
she wants to take money from us.

451
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:43,486
If your dad wasn't dead,

452
00:35:44,046 --> 00:35:46,366
the blessing wouldn't fall to her hand.

453
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:49,206
I'll show him

454
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:52,006
that I have my own good points.

455
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:54,806
Uncle Sin is underestimating me

456
00:35:55,406 --> 00:35:57,446
like he's overestimating his daughter.

457
00:35:58,126 --> 00:36:02,726
Saikhim is only good in the classroom. If she wasn't a kid of some bigshot,

458
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:05,166
no one would remember her name.

459
00:36:06,566 --> 00:36:07,726
That's right.

460
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:15,766
Where is it?

461
00:36:21,627 --> 00:36:24,037
I probably left it at his home.

462
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:04,966
(I'm sure your girlfriend didn't go anywhere, so her luggage is here.)

463
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:07,324
(She just went to see her new man.)

464
00:37:07,462 --> 00:37:09,006
(You're being deceived, Kla.)

465
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:22,806
Excuse me.

466
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,006
I'm here to see Saikhim.

467
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:44,646
I'm not sure whether Khim is already out or not.

468
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,726
Khim. Khim.

469
00:37:50,317 --> 00:37:53,966
She probably went to see her professor. She has a presentation today.

470
00:37:54,102 --> 00:37:59,646
What should we do? Are you going to wait here or...

471
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:02,886
Should I call Saikhim?

472
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,326
Who are you?

473
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:21,644
I forgot to introduce myself.

474
00:38:21,742 --> 00:38:23,286
Please have a seat.

475
00:38:32,006 --> 00:38:35,846
I am Saikhim's friend from Thailand. I'm...

476
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,486
I'm Maenta.

477
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:42,850
I want to take a trip here.

478
00:38:42,961 --> 00:38:46,006
So, I asked Khim to let me stay with her.

479
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:50,046
And you're...

480
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,333
I'm Thaenthai.

481
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,320
I'm studying for a master's degree here. I'm Saikhim's senior.

482
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:55,606
I see.

483
00:38:55,973 --> 00:38:57,726
You're Thaenthai.

484
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,446
I knew it.

485
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:01,057
Do you know me?

486
00:39:01,245 --> 00:39:02,846
Of course.

487
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:06,406
Saikhim told me about you.

488
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:10,486
She said you're studying here together.

489
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:15,886
Do you want some drinks? I'll get it for you.

490
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:30,327
What should I do? What should I do?

491
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:38,775
Kla.

492
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:40,686
Kla.

493
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,086
They're getting married today.

494
00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:46,566
Yaemsom is leaving you to get married.

495
00:39:49,366 --> 00:39:51,166
She said her name is Yaemsom.

496
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:54,286
When she's with that man, her name is Noeysod.

497
00:39:55,766 --> 00:39:59,686
This means she has a secret account when she says she's on a flight.

498
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:02,126
She's living a life that you didn't know about.

499
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:04,446
This isn't just two-faced anymore.

500
00:40:04,726 --> 00:40:07,686
She has two lives that she can swap at any time.

501
00:40:08,446 --> 00:40:10,126
What the heck is this?

502
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:16,886
This world is tough. Let's go ruin the wedding.

503
00:40:43,806 --> 00:40:45,086
There's a little problem.

504
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,366
The bank said Ms. Khim's credit card might not be hacked

505
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:51,286
because the card was used to buy goods in Thailand.

506
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:54,246
How is this possible? Khim hasn't come back.

507
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:59,366
Ms. Khim may be in Thailand right now.

508
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:03,366
Miss might take the chance when Oun took her leave

509
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,076
and comes back to Thailand earlier.

510
00:41:05,181 --> 00:41:07,206
I'll tell our people to find her.

511
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:09,326
Call Thaenthai right now.

512
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:12,526
Would you like some tea?

513
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:16,318
Oun isn't here?

514
00:41:16,534 --> 00:41:19,446
Oun went back to her home for her grandson's ordination.

515
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:22,886
You said you knew Khim. Since when have you two been friends?

516
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:24,166
Since high school.

517
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,646
You're still studying?

518
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:27,926
Yes. At Silpakorn University.

519
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:30,166
Have you met Saikhim frequently?

520
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:32,726
We've known each other since grade 10.

521
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:39,486
Is that possible?

522
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,886
Miss doesn't have a close friend with that name.

523
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,046
I'll tell the police to go there as soon as possible.

524
00:41:54,886 --> 00:41:56,686
Where is Saikhim right now?

525
00:41:57,135 --> 00:41:59,286
I hope it's not a kidnapping.

526
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:05,486
This woman is Lita.

527
00:42:05,662 --> 00:42:07,046
(She just got a tourist visa)

528
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:08,886
and have been here for a few days.

529
00:42:09,086 --> 00:42:10,486
Where is Saikhim now?

530
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:16,366
She's in Thailand. She said she was going home.

531
00:42:17,749 --> 00:42:20,446
This means Saikhim was at your house last night.

532
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:24,057
We just want to travel

533
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:25,922
(to change our mood. That's all.)

534
00:42:26,093 --> 00:42:27,606
We didn't do anything bad.

535
00:42:27,703 --> 00:42:29,246
If you want to travel,

536
00:42:29,558 --> 00:42:31,246
why did you have to lie?

537
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:35,486
(If Saikhim tries to ask for your permission,)

538
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:38,246
you won't allow it. Isn't that right?

539
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:55,767
Lita.

540
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:00,606
She's finally calling me.

541
00:43:01,726 --> 00:43:05,486
Khim, your family knows that you're in Thailand.

542
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,966
(You lost your credit card, right?)

543
00:43:09,245 --> 00:43:11,606
(Go back to your home. Everything's over.)

544
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:50,403
You can't be calm anymore.

545
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:55,886
Do you see how worried I am for you? I did an investigation for you.

546
00:44:02,094 --> 00:44:03,326
Which way?

547
00:44:03,653 --> 00:44:04,846
Let's go.

548
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:16,126
Here. Do you believe me now?

549
00:44:21,341 --> 00:44:23,446
They're all photos of them.

550
00:44:23,973 --> 00:44:25,766
This wedding is so big.

551
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:28,005
Your girlfriend is such a greedy woman.

552
00:44:28,757 --> 00:44:30,366
She didn't care about you at all.

553
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:32,086
She thinks you're stupid,

554
00:44:32,405 --> 00:44:35,006
so she has been deceiving you like this.

555
00:44:36,414 --> 00:44:37,686
Look at this.

556
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:44,686
This is too much.

557
00:44:44,901 --> 00:44:46,686
They treat you like you're worthless.

558
00:44:46,966 --> 00:44:48,846
You can't stay calm like this.

559
00:44:53,606 --> 00:44:54,646
You.

560
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,566
Can I go get my stuff at your girlfriend's house?

561
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,926
I left something in your couple's house.

562
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,085
Can I go there?

563
00:45:05,474 --> 00:45:06,474
There's nothing.

564
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:08,926
Nothing? Of course, there is.

565
00:45:09,093 --> 00:45:11,406
Nothing is left anymore! My girlfriend and my couple's house.

566
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:14,526
There's nothing true.

567
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:18,110
Who is my girlfriend? I didn't even know her real name!

568
00:45:18,231 --> 00:45:19,366
Kla.

569
00:45:20,286 --> 00:45:21,846
I only know that she's awful.

570
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:23,606
Adulterous!

571
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:25,486
Selfish!

572
00:45:25,966 --> 00:45:27,326
Shameless!

573
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:29,564
- Where is she? Call her here! - Kla.

574
00:45:29,647 --> 00:45:31,326
Hey, what's wrong with you?

575
00:45:31,453 --> 00:45:33,246
Calm down.

576
00:45:33,646 --> 00:45:34,806
Calm down?

577
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:36,837
Take a look at it yourself.

578
00:45:38,213 --> 00:45:40,213
I've told you to call the bride now.

579
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:43,973
I've told you to call the bride now,

580
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:46,006
do it if you don't want this place to get messier.

581
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,006
Don't you hear me? Go.

582
00:45:55,645 --> 00:45:57,966
- Is she your girlfriend? - Yes.

583
00:45:58,566 --> 00:46:00,206
She left me to get married.

584
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:02,246
Are you satisfied now?

585
00:46:03,117 --> 00:46:05,726
- I'm stupid. I can't read people. - Kla.

586
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:08,286
- That's why I was deceived by a woman! - Kla.

587
00:46:08,486 --> 00:46:09,686
Darn it!

588
00:46:10,846 --> 00:46:12,846
Laugh at me if you want!

589
00:46:28,735 --> 00:46:30,006
Hey.

590
00:46:31,101 --> 00:46:33,246
- Please stop. - Stop?

591
00:46:33,525 --> 00:46:34,566
Please stop.

592
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:36,486
Kla, be careful!

593
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:50,486
Don't hurt him.

594
00:46:51,254 --> 00:46:53,366
He's only here to ask for his belongings back.

595
00:47:00,966 --> 00:47:02,006
You...

596
00:47:03,677 --> 00:47:05,446
You should go back.

597
00:47:05,966 --> 00:47:07,726
Please don't get into trouble here.

598
00:47:12,117 --> 00:47:13,406
I know

599
00:47:15,534 --> 00:47:17,126
that you're a good man.

600
00:47:18,497 --> 00:47:19,647
Be careful.

601
00:47:27,741 --> 00:47:30,286
You're just too upset.

602
00:47:35,317 --> 00:47:36,366
Hey...

603
00:47:39,165 --> 00:47:40,366
You.

604
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:50,566
You've already gone through a much worse situation.

605
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:54,886
You didn't survive to hurt anyone.

606
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,846
What can't kill us

607
00:48:02,677 --> 00:48:05,406
will make us stronger.

608
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:09,926
Believe me.

609
00:48:21,086 --> 00:48:22,326
Let's go.

610
00:48:30,486 --> 00:48:33,201
I've arrived. Make-up for the bride on the fourth floor, right?

611
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:34,789
I'm going there.

612
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,046
Who is he?

613
00:48:44,366 --> 00:48:47,049
I've arrived. Make-up for the bride on the fourth floor, right?

614
00:48:47,165 --> 00:48:48,526
I'm going there.

615
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:03,751
I have some ideas

616
00:49:03,862 --> 00:49:05,566
why Saikhim rushed back to Thailand.

617
00:49:11,766 --> 00:49:13,886
Saikhim is using a dating app

618
00:49:14,254 --> 00:49:16,254
to come back and see the man from the app.

619
00:49:17,014 --> 00:49:18,726
I've contacted the company.

620
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:21,606
They sent us the list of men that Saikhim has talked with.

621
00:49:25,846 --> 00:49:27,006
Here you are.

622
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,846
The men who can make Saikhim come back.

623
00:49:38,494 --> 00:49:39,590
It's strange

624
00:49:39,765 --> 00:49:42,206
that this matter was overlooked by Mr. Sansern.

625
00:49:52,486 --> 00:49:53,926
It's that man.

626
00:50:15,223 --> 00:50:16,766
Is Dad still here?

627
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:19,246
He's waiting to chew you out.

628
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:29,221
Dad.

629
00:50:29,382 --> 00:50:30,686
Where have you been?

630
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:33,726
I just went out to stay at my friend's home.

631
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:42,366
Since when did you know how to lie to me?

632
00:50:44,326 --> 00:50:47,926
I just want to live a life that I didn't get to live.

633
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:50,166
By going out with men?

634
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:52,286
No.

635
00:50:52,621 --> 00:50:55,446
I didn't come back to see anyone, I swear.

636
00:50:55,596 --> 00:50:56,806
Can you swear

637
00:50:56,926 --> 00:50:58,766
that you don't know these men?

638
00:50:58,877 --> 00:51:00,686
Can you?

639
00:51:07,406 --> 00:51:09,566
Why are you fooling around like this?

640
00:51:10,294 --> 00:51:12,294
Don't misunderstand me.

641
00:51:12,701 --> 00:51:14,286
Look at you now.

642
00:51:17,086 --> 00:51:19,086
You're soaked in alcohol.

643
00:51:19,726 --> 00:51:23,606
You even brought a man to go on a rampage here. How could you do that?

644
00:51:23,794 --> 00:51:25,446
You haven't asked

645
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:27,526
what I've encountered.

646
00:51:28,053 --> 00:51:29,886
What did I do wrong?

647
00:51:30,142 --> 00:51:32,406
Why did you believe that I've become like this?

648
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:34,846
If you aren't obsessed with men like your mom,

649
00:51:36,966 --> 00:51:40,206
you wouldn't dare to go against my order like this.

650
00:51:40,845 --> 00:51:42,246
You already know

651
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,406
that I hate a woman like your mom.

652
00:51:45,846 --> 00:51:47,406
But I'm not my mom.

653
00:51:47,987 --> 00:51:49,526
Don't argue with me.

654
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,606
You don't love me anymore?

655
00:51:55,557 --> 00:51:57,086
Do you make me love you?

656
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:02,406
Because I have to do everything you want.

657
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,526
That's why I'm frustrated.

658
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,246
When I want to do something I like,

659
00:52:07,565 --> 00:52:09,006
you can't stand it.

660
00:52:10,013 --> 00:52:12,726
I've never disobeyed you, Dad.

661
00:52:14,182 --> 00:52:17,606
I tried to do everything to make you feel good.

662
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:21,046
But you still don't trust me.

663
00:52:24,237 --> 00:52:27,326
I can't be a daughter who can always do as you wish.

664
00:52:42,012 --> 00:52:43,166
Kla!

665
00:52:44,046 --> 00:52:47,126
You said you're on a flight. I see. Your flight is here.

666
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,846
Aren't you great?

667
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:52,486
Why are you scared?

668
00:52:53,368 --> 00:52:54,906
Who are you?

669
00:52:55,034 --> 00:52:56,686
I'm your bride's boyfriend.

670
00:52:58,591 --> 00:52:59,846
That's not true.

671
00:52:59,982 --> 00:53:01,726
For her last flight,

672
00:53:02,156 --> 00:53:03,846
she came to live as my girlfriend.

673
00:53:04,126 --> 00:53:06,286
But for this flight,

674
00:53:06,582 --> 00:53:09,086
she came here and became your bride.

675
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,646
What are you saying?

676
00:53:11,949 --> 00:53:14,486
This woman is intentionally deceiving me and you.

677
00:53:15,364 --> 00:53:16,813
Why do you ask me to wait?

678
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,486
Who is it that has to wait?

679
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:21,686
It's me who I have to wait for you to have your future.

680
00:53:22,686 --> 00:53:25,726
I still go out with you because I pity you.

681
00:53:26,486 --> 00:53:29,726
If you didn't have me, you would still be stuck in hell.

682
00:53:29,825 --> 00:53:31,326
Wait.

683
00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:34,606
Don't tell me you really dated him.

684
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:37,566
I want to leave him every day.

685
00:53:37,766 --> 00:53:40,766
I didn't want to do that because I didn't want to do any sin.

686
00:53:40,974 --> 00:53:42,246
Just say that you like money.

687
00:53:42,365 --> 00:53:45,086
Can you make me live comfortably like him?

688
00:53:46,566 --> 00:53:48,006
Get out of here.

689
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:50,508
Sure. I'll get out.

690
00:53:50,614 --> 00:53:52,166
But let me leave something for you!

691
00:53:53,655 --> 00:53:56,606
Leaving my trace on you as a warning for an adulterous man.

692
00:53:59,646 --> 00:54:01,026
Kla, be careful!

693
00:54:02,566 --> 00:54:04,126
Don't hurt my bro.

694
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:07,886
Kla, let's go. Quick.

695
00:54:12,884 --> 00:54:13,966
Khem.

696
00:54:24,526 --> 00:54:25,926
Kla, that way.

697
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:28,246
Stop.

698
00:56:41,581 --> 00:56:43,686
- Let me go with you. - No.

699
00:56:51,926 --> 00:56:53,286
My coat is over there.

700
00:56:57,672 --> 00:56:58,826
Ms. Khim.

701
00:57:03,478 --> 00:57:04,878
Can you really drive?

702
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:10,877
(I just want to live a life that I didn't get to live.)

703
00:57:11,006 --> 00:57:12,606
By going out with men?

704
00:57:12,806 --> 00:57:15,126
Why are you fooling around like this?

705
00:57:21,006 --> 00:57:22,446
Why are you driving so fast?

706
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,750
Stop.

707
00:57:28,064 --> 00:57:29,965
If you aren't obsessed with men like your mom,

708
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:33,286
you wouldn't dare to go against my order like this.

709
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:40,166
There's a motorcycle.

710
00:57:41,782 --> 00:57:42,966
Be careful!

711
00:57:46,446 --> 00:57:48,006
You almost ran over him.

712
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,126
Can you swear?

713
00:57:52,726 --> 00:57:55,065
- Are you alright? - (Don't argue with me.)

714
00:57:57,526 --> 00:57:58,686
Hey.

715
00:58:01,891 --> 00:58:03,126
Turn the car.

716
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,702
Enough. Park here.

717
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:17,726
Wow...

718
00:58:40,346 --> 00:58:42,606
I'm sorry.

719
00:58:43,966 --> 00:58:45,806
Why did you drive if you don't know how to?

720
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,646
I...

721
00:58:49,711 --> 00:58:51,206
I just want to escape.

722
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:53,326
Do you want to escape or do you want to die?

723
00:58:59,145 --> 00:59:01,926
Are you hurt anywhere?

724
00:59:02,181 --> 00:59:05,566
My heart hurts. I shouldn't put my life in a spoiled child's hand like you.

725
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:17,326
I'm sorry.

726
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,006
I'll pay for your car's repair.

727
00:59:24,446 --> 00:59:25,646
Can you pay it?

728
00:59:25,932 --> 00:59:28,086
Do you know how much this car is worth?

729
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:32,286
I'll pay for it.

730
00:59:32,598 --> 00:59:36,628
You can run your mouth, but where would you get the money?

731
00:59:38,854 --> 00:59:40,406
I can get the money.

732
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:43,566
Can you wait for me?

733
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:06,646
Meet me at the garage, Khem.

734
01:00:14,459 --> 01:00:15,686
You...

735
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,966
Please give me some time to gather the money.

736
01:00:18,078 --> 01:00:19,593
I don't want even one baht from you.

737
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:22,166
Stop using your body to get the money.

738
01:00:27,348 --> 01:00:29,006
Pack all your stuff in my house.

739
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:30,949
Just go wherever you want.

740
01:00:56,926 --> 01:00:58,326
Wake up, Saikhim.

741
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,726
Prepare for your study.

742
01:01:04,886 --> 01:01:06,806
You haven't finished this practice.

743
01:01:07,573 --> 01:01:09,366
I told you to not make the same mistake.

744
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,246
Are you sure you're correct?

745
01:01:11,758 --> 01:01:14,166
Hold out your hand or you won't remember it.

746
01:01:18,661 --> 01:01:21,972
Khim, tomorrow is a holiday. Do you want to go out?

747
01:01:22,126 --> 01:01:23,846
I want to go to an amusement park.

748
01:01:23,982 --> 01:01:25,766
Let's go greet your dad.

749
01:01:30,686 --> 01:01:33,406
Try again. Bend the knee too. It'll be prettier.

750
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,358
I'll ask a teacher to teach you art tomorrow.

751
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:39,286
You'll learn ballet in the evening.

752
01:01:47,854 --> 01:01:49,854
You'll learn how to ride a horse tomorrow morning.

753
01:01:50,037 --> 01:01:51,566
Learn how to play piano in the evening.

754
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:55,166
After he teaches you English, I told him to teach French.

755
01:01:55,526 --> 01:01:58,606
You're smart. You can't let this go on.

756
01:02:02,238 --> 01:02:04,406
I don't want you to study with boys.

757
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:06,846
You'll transfer to an all-girls school next term.

758
01:02:07,045 --> 01:02:08,846
Prepare to study in England.

759
01:02:09,007 --> 01:02:10,686
I've picked universities for you.

760
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,826
You'll like it. Try reading it.

761
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,089
It's Ms. Saikhim.

762
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:42,046
- What's wrong? - Dad.

763
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:45,206
Can you trust me once?

764
01:02:45,886 --> 01:02:47,846
If you help me this time,

765
01:02:48,062 --> 01:02:50,566
I'll go back to your home immediately.

766
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:52,501
Help with what?

767
01:02:52,726 --> 01:02:54,246
(To prove)

768
01:02:54,406 --> 01:02:56,726
if you're still worried about me.

769
01:02:57,968 --> 01:03:00,166
(If you really love me,)

770
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:03,686
can you transfer 1,000,000 baht to me?

771
01:03:04,854 --> 01:03:07,446
You're getting tricked by a man, right?

772
01:03:15,638 --> 01:03:16,700
Investigate him.

773
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:19,686
Find out who this man is.

774
01:03:27,286 --> 01:03:31,007
(Don't keep a photo of this woman in this house.)

775
01:04:19,406 --> 01:04:21,206
Girl,

776
01:04:22,028 --> 01:04:23,406
do you want to go with me?

777
01:04:27,611 --> 01:04:29,366
Where are we going?

778
01:04:40,061 --> 01:04:41,319
Don't hurt him.

779
01:04:41,486 --> 01:04:43,326
He's only here to ask for his belongings back.

780
01:04:46,118 --> 01:04:47,516
How much do you want?

781
01:04:47,966 --> 01:04:50,121
How much? What do you mean?

782
01:04:50,255 --> 01:04:52,206
This much. Is that enough?

783
01:05:16,966 --> 01:05:19,166
- Come here. - Hey.

784
01:05:19,604 --> 01:05:22,486
We're making a deal here. Why did you get in between us?

785
01:05:23,205 --> 01:05:24,646
How much did he give you?

786
01:05:26,944 --> 01:05:29,046
Do you think money can buy everyone?

787
01:05:30,582 --> 01:05:33,366
What's wrong with you? You scoundrel.

788
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:37,246
Don't hurt him. We're together.

789
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,730
You're a prostitute

790
01:05:43,869 --> 01:05:48,577
who's selling your body to treat a man while you're a lowly pimp.

791
01:05:48,829 --> 01:05:52,686
Both of the trash are lumped together. What a match made in heaven.

792
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:56,046
Trash.

793
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:09,926
I told you to not sell your body.

794
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:12,293
Why did you have to do that for me?

795
01:06:12,694 --> 01:06:15,846
Even if you get several million, it's still not worth it.

796
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:25,726
Are you waiting for them?

797
01:06:25,966 --> 01:06:27,086
Get in.

798
01:07:01,575 --> 01:07:03,686
Can you trust me once?

799
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:05,766
I promise that

800
01:07:05,894 --> 01:07:08,046
I'll go back to you immediately.

801
01:07:08,373 --> 01:07:09,686
You're at fault.

802
01:07:10,085 --> 01:07:11,686
You don't have any right to negotiate.

803
01:07:12,332 --> 01:07:15,246
(You really don't love me anymore.)

804
01:07:17,526 --> 01:07:18,806
In the end,

805
01:07:20,726 --> 01:07:24,126
I'm worth less than that money, right?

806
01:07:25,006 --> 01:07:27,246
(If you're worried about me,)

807
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:29,926
(please prove it by transferring)

808
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:32,846
(the money to me by tonight.)

809
01:08:35,566 --> 01:08:36,806
Miss.

810
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:40,286
We should stop now for today. I'll take my daughter home.

811
01:08:40,406 --> 01:08:41,566
Of course.

812
01:08:44,725 --> 01:08:46,128
Kla, be careful!

813
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,806
(Sansern)

814
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:06,966
(I've found out now that his name is Klaokla Chayodom.)

815
01:09:07,606 --> 01:09:09,126
(I know his address.)

816
01:09:09,557 --> 01:09:11,886
(Do you want me to pick up Miss right now?)

817
01:09:12,086 --> 01:09:13,206
No.

818
01:09:14,662 --> 01:09:16,206
I want to test her.

819
01:09:17,262 --> 01:09:20,366
Between me and that man,

820
01:09:21,607 --> 01:09:23,246
who will Saikhim choose?

821
01:10:53,661 --> 01:10:56,326
Leave that key here and leave.

822
01:11:01,726 --> 01:11:05,086
I still can't get the money for your car's repair.

823
01:11:06,046 --> 01:11:08,119
Can I ask you to wait? But...

824
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,966
I told you to not pay it.

825
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,886
How could you get the money?

826
01:11:15,989 --> 01:11:17,989
I know that I'm worthless.

827
01:11:18,636 --> 01:11:21,086
Your car is still more valuable than me.

828
01:11:21,773 --> 01:11:24,219
How could anyone see your worth if you're like this?

829
01:11:25,429 --> 01:11:28,926
If you still want this kind of love, your wish will never come true.

830
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:32,321
Look at me, who had known her for 10 years.

831
01:11:32,908 --> 01:11:34,710
I still didn't even know her heart.

832
01:11:35,253 --> 01:11:37,046
Let alone a stranger.

833
01:11:38,046 --> 01:11:40,406
No one is sincere anymore!

834
01:11:42,446 --> 01:11:44,646
I didn't hope I would get love from anyone

835
01:11:45,062 --> 01:11:47,686
when even my dad can't give me his love.

836
01:11:49,406 --> 01:11:53,846
They said love from our parents could be given unconditionally.

837
01:11:55,005 --> 01:11:56,806
It's not always true.

838
01:11:57,085 --> 01:11:58,406
What are you saying?

839
01:12:00,933 --> 01:12:02,766
If we want to love someone

840
01:12:03,046 --> 01:12:05,286
and we have to try this hard,

841
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:07,406
don't you think it's too much?

842
01:12:08,814 --> 01:12:11,206
I've tried my best to be good all this time.

843
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:14,326
I only made one mistake.

844
01:12:15,246 --> 01:12:17,446
Why couldn't he forgive me?

845
01:12:17,931 --> 01:12:20,126
This isn't love at all.

846
01:12:20,765 --> 01:12:23,406
He really cares about money more than his daughter.

847
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:27,406
I'm really worthless like he said.

848
01:12:53,429 --> 01:12:54,646
Do you like it?

849
01:12:56,917 --> 01:12:58,446
Do you like doing this?

850
01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:06,326
Do you feel better?

851
01:13:10,863 --> 01:13:13,286
I'm sorry for saying these things.

852
01:13:13,518 --> 01:13:14,766
It's fine.

853
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,326
If it makes you feel better.

854
01:13:18,614 --> 01:13:20,326
Don't be shy. We don't know each other.

855
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:54,966
That's kind of nice.

856
01:14:00,134 --> 01:14:01,966
We're nice, but we can't get anything.

857
01:14:02,566 --> 01:14:04,446
Let's drink to forget about today.

858
01:14:12,846 --> 01:14:17,366
If I drink it, can I really forget everything?

859
01:14:18,686 --> 01:14:21,046
It'll make this bad day be over faster.

860
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:47,006
Easy. Don't drink it too quickly.

861
01:14:49,726 --> 01:14:50,966
Slowly.

862
01:16:13,975 --> 01:16:15,886
I'm sorry.

863
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,846
I'll fix you up when I have the money.

864
01:16:36,824 --> 01:16:38,646
Please get well soon.

865
01:16:38,926 --> 01:16:42,366
And please forgive me.

866
01:16:42,822 --> 01:16:44,806
I'm sorry.

867
01:16:48,884 --> 01:16:49,958
What are you doing?

868
01:17:01,966 --> 01:17:03,726
Does it hurt that much?

869
01:17:04,269 --> 01:17:06,624
Right. Here.

870
01:17:06,767 --> 01:17:08,966
I will...

871
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:13,166
I'll apply a plaster for you.

872
01:17:13,853 --> 01:17:15,853
At where you're hurting.

873
01:17:17,872 --> 01:17:19,005
Here.

874
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,606
Apply a plaster on it.

875
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:24,246
Keep it.

876
01:17:24,742 --> 01:17:27,246
So that you'll be cured of your broken heart soon.

877
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:40,326
Is it better?

878
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:43,086
It doesn't hurt, but I'm hungry.

879
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:49,806
There's nothing left.

880
01:17:50,141 --> 01:17:51,686
We will starve.

881
01:18:00,101 --> 01:18:01,446
We won't starve.

882
01:18:01,717 --> 01:18:03,966
We won't starve to death.

883
01:18:04,342 --> 01:18:05,446
What?

884
01:18:19,357 --> 01:18:21,357
Eat this to survive.

885
01:18:21,518 --> 01:18:24,326
The roti that you pay for us.

886
01:18:25,822 --> 01:18:27,166
I'll give it to you.

887
01:18:32,614 --> 01:18:35,606
For the kindness that we gave to someone,

888
01:18:35,973 --> 01:18:37,246
one day,

889
01:18:37,789 --> 01:18:40,086
it'll come back to us.

890
01:18:43,509 --> 01:18:45,046
You're a nice man.

891
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:48,206
You will never starve.

892
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:26,326
A nice man?

893
01:19:26,981 --> 01:19:28,366
How do you know I'm nice?

894
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:35,086
Come here.

895
01:19:39,726 --> 01:19:41,006
Come.

896
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:50,966
The roti lady told me that

897
01:19:51,238 --> 01:19:53,646
you didn't have enough to eat before.

898
01:19:54,846 --> 01:19:56,006
When you have enough,

899
01:19:56,332 --> 01:19:58,886
you want to share some with others.

900
01:19:59,269 --> 01:20:02,126
That's why you pay for the roti beforehand,

901
01:20:02,606 --> 01:20:05,606
in case someone who's in a tough spot pass by.

902
01:20:05,886 --> 01:20:10,326
They'll realize that someone can still see their difficulties.

903
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,766
When I heard that,

904
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:15,566
I was so amazed.

905
01:20:17,158 --> 01:20:19,086
Your heart is so cool.

906
01:20:19,966 --> 01:20:21,126
What?

907
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:23,166
My heart is cool with just that?

908
01:20:24,605 --> 01:20:26,086
It's not just that.

909
01:20:28,141 --> 01:20:29,326
Is there something else?

910
01:20:29,782 --> 01:20:32,246
You've saved my life twice.

911
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:35,046
So, you helped me back?

912
01:20:35,824 --> 01:20:36,845
No.

913
01:20:39,205 --> 01:20:43,206
I know how painful it is to be hurt

914
01:20:44,046 --> 01:20:45,726
by people we love.

915
01:20:48,086 --> 01:20:50,166
Please don't get into trouble here.

916
01:20:51,886 --> 01:20:54,846
I know that you're a good man.

917
01:20:55,086 --> 01:20:58,028
You're just too upset.

918
01:20:59,926 --> 01:21:01,606
You've already

919
01:21:01,806 --> 01:21:03,846
gone through a worse situation.

920
01:21:04,197 --> 01:21:07,006
You didn't survive to hurt anyone.

921
01:21:08,166 --> 01:21:09,926
What can't kill us

922
01:21:10,694 --> 01:21:12,446
will make us stronger.

923
01:21:19,944 --> 01:21:21,366
One day, your girlfriend

924
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:25,526
will realize that she lost a good thing in her life.

925
01:21:26,526 --> 01:21:29,726
You only lost your beloved person.

926
01:21:29,949 --> 01:21:31,150
For her,

927
01:21:31,926 --> 01:21:34,206
she lost someone who loved her.

928
01:21:34,934 --> 01:21:37,966
She'll be the one who will regret it.

929
01:21:49,517 --> 01:21:50,837
It's delicious.

930
01:21:53,254 --> 01:21:54,574
Eat it more then.

931
01:22:00,446 --> 01:22:01,566
Let's share it.

932
01:22:01,814 --> 01:22:04,566
We're in the same boat as well as our stomachs.

933
01:22:06,726 --> 01:22:09,006
You should eat it until you're full.

934
01:22:30,382 --> 01:22:32,526
Your life is worth far more than a car.

935
01:22:33,981 --> 01:22:36,246
Those things can't be compared to your life.

936
01:22:37,006 --> 01:22:39,686
Don't trade yourself with something worthless.

937
01:22:40,006 --> 01:22:41,126
Understand?

938
01:22:47,868 --> 01:22:50,406
Don't let anyone make you feel worthless.

939
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:18,326
No. Don't cry.

940
01:23:20,302 --> 01:23:22,302
The one who dares to make you cry

941
01:23:22,966 --> 01:23:24,446
is really cruel.

942
01:23:40,086 --> 01:23:41,166
Be careful.

943
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:18,086
If he's that good of a man,

944
01:24:18,534 --> 01:24:20,406
would he be in jail when he's a child?

945
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:22,566
Who are you talking about?

946
01:24:24,564 --> 01:24:26,166
The police tried to arrest me.

947
01:24:26,406 --> 01:24:28,526
They said it's abduction.

948
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:31,104
So, you came here to harass me.

949
01:24:36,935 --> 01:24:38,046
How is he so great?

950
01:24:38,246 --> 01:24:39,806
Why did you fall for this man?

951
01:24:40,142 --> 01:24:41,526
How did I raise you?

952
01:24:41,766 --> 01:24:43,283
Why have you become like this?

953
01:24:43,367 --> 01:24:45,126
Saikhim didn't know I was following her.

954
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:51,086
Are you going to let Prompt kill him?

955
01:24:51,182 --> 01:24:52,686
Tell him to stop, Dad.

956
01:24:52,926 --> 01:24:55,606
You didn't feel anything when he humiliated me.
