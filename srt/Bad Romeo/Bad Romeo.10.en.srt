1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:01,134
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,215 --> 00:00:02,366
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:03,563
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:45,486
You watch your man all day long.

5
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,926
Are you afraid that he might get away?

6
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:50,726
I'm afraid he might only come back when it's convenient for him like you.

7
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,806
There's another person who has entered the tiger's nest.

8
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,646
I learned that the maid

9
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:57,206
you hired wasn't normal.

10
00:02:57,438 --> 00:03:00,046
Deal with this father and daughter.

11
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:01,686
If you can't do it,

12
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:03,266
I'll have to do it myself.

13
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:06,586
You'll learn how the betrayal of love tastes one day.

14
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:10,387
Keep this evidence. I'll expose him before the media.

15
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:12,726
I'll make him lose his business in Thailand.

16
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:15,806
Go tell your family. I'm going all-in for this match.

17
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:18,446
Do you think you can win against me with something like that?

18
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:21,646
I'm satisfied enough to teach you a lesson in front of the media.

19
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,926
(Even if I made a time machine)

20
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:28,286
(to travel back in time to see her,)

21
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,646
(even if I had 10 more chances,)

22
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,326
(it's all meaningless)

23
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,646
(if we can't learn how to admit)

24
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:40,606
(our mistakes the first time.)

25
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:45,766
Why did you go to his room?

26
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:49,526
I was just investigating to see what he'll attack us with.

27
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:52,757
You couldn't do anything to him

28
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,606
and you also got exposed. Should I say you deserve it?

29
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:01,686
At least, I find out he wants to build a boutique hotel opposite our hotel.

30
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,006
He's talking with the land's owner.

31
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:05,246
What have you been doing then?

32
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:07,966
You knew he'd overtake us. Why didn't you stop him?

33
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,326
I'm trying.

34
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:13,806
I'm trying to get close to the owner.

35
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,726
You'll fall for his trick again.

36
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:18,846
You've never caught onto him.

37
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:21,446
So, can our condo project be done in time?

38
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,006
Kaokla has already gone to that house.

39
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:28,046
The owner seems to be interested in Kaokla.

40
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:31,246
But I don't know what conditions they have discussed.

41
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Good.

42
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:35,286
If we can't get that land, he can't get that land either.

43
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:37,526
Should we use this?

44
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:41,246
Ten years ago, that land was almost expropriated for an art gallery.

45
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:43,806
If we dig up this project again

46
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:45,486
to expropriate that land,

47
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:47,245
Kaokla has no way to win.

48
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:51,886
Good.

49
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:55,206
We have to get back at him.

50
00:04:57,286 --> 00:05:00,366
I hope no one will allow him to ambush us again.

51
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:27,086
I'm not a modest man. I'll tell you that.

52
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,646
I won't be satisfied with just you.

53
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:31,526
What have I ever done to you?

54
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:33,646
Why are you so grudgeful towards me?

55
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:36,086
I asked myself this question too.

56
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,589
What have I ever done to your family?

57
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:40,726
For everything you've done to me,

58
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,446
I'll give it back to you.

59
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:44,446
It'll get worse

60
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:46,526
if you haven't learned your lesson.

61
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:12,846
You're lucky that you could turn it around just in time.

62
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,646
They used a dirty trick against me.

63
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:17,486
I only did the same back to them.

64
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:22,046
They'll counterattack us by taking that historic house.

65
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:26,126
We have to close the deal for our boutique hotel as quickly as possible.

66
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,886
That place will be our first hotel.

67
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:31,046
It'll become a hot topic.

68
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,726
I want you to see that place with your eyes.

69
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,846
I don't think it's suitable to make it a hotel.

70
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:40,406
You should come with me.

71
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:43,406
I'll take you to see what I want to do with it.

72
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:46,766
But if you disagree, I'm always ready to change my mind.

73
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:52,846
If you're this confident,

74
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:56,486
I want to know what your dream is.

75
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:13,106
If Mr. Sin changes his plan to build an art gallery,

76
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:16,526
Prompt's condo project will be abandoned.

77
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:19,226
Mr. Prompt isn't good at doing big projects.

78
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,526
I want Prompt to prove himself.

79
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:23,126
The art gallery project

80
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:24,606
is just politics.

81
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:26,406
He wants to win against Kaokla.

82
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:28,206
We wouldn't get any benefits.

83
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:41,246
You can take this project back to manage it yourself.

84
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:44,286
You can also gradually teach Prompt.

85
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:47,046
If you only wait for his order like this,

86
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,686
when can our relationship

87
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:50,686
be revealed?

88
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:06,726
The result will come out this evening.

89
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,846
They said this award is a curse.

90
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,526
Whoever receives this award will be single or have to divorce.

91
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:20,286
Then, I can break that curse for you.

92
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:22,606
If you really do get the reward,

93
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:25,446
I'll let you become the head of the family.

94
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:28,406
Don't you think that it'll be Lita instead?

95
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:32,486
Lita?

96
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:35,686
If she knows that she has to be single,

97
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:37,566
I don't know whether she would still want it.

98
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:47,646
Congratulations on the Woman of the Year award.

99
00:08:47,846 --> 00:08:49,846
Woman of the Year? Me?

100
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,406
Yes. It's you.

101
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,126
Are you lying?

102
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:02,766
Hello.

103
00:09:02,902 --> 00:09:06,086
We would like to interview you to give it out to the media.

104
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:07,646
We'll go prepare for it first.

105
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:08,766
Sure.

106
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:12,606
It does hurt.

107
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:25,206
Your dream must have come true now.

108
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:26,966
What dream?

109
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:29,926
It's the first time you have won against Saikhim.

110
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,846
You'll be even better

111
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:34,646
if you become the director of the new art gallery.

112
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:43,846
What's this?

113
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:46,326
The application letter for the new director of the art gallery

114
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:49,286
that needs a new director.

115
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:52,897
The award today

116
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:54,166
will open up your way

117
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,966
to become the new director of the art gallery gracefully.

118
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,446
I bought this award to upgrade you

119
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:04,726
even though this award should be given to Saikhim.

120
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,073
See?

121
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:09,886
I'm so generous.

122
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:11,766
You should be grateful.

123
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:13,326
Bought the award?

124
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:15,566
What do you mean?

125
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:18,686
Kaokla wants to build a hotel opposite my hotel.

126
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,606
I want to borrow your hand to get rid of him

127
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:24,566
by opening up this new art gallery before him.

128
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:28,366
You had gotten rid of him from Saikhim once before.

129
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:31,726
What's wrong with getting rid of him again for this award?

130
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:34,966
Is this the Stupid Woman of the Year award?

131
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:37,046
You thought that when you bought it, didn't you?

132
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:39,566
If you don't want it, don't accept it then.

133
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,326
Let Saikhim go.

134
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:44,006
How could you think like this?

135
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:50,846
Or do you want Kaokla to come back to expose

136
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:54,526
that you swapped the letter and caused them to break up?

137
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:57,566
If you promise me that

138
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,886
you would keep everything a secret

139
00:11:00,157 --> 00:11:03,206
and keep that man out of Saikhim's life,

140
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:04,621
I promise that

141
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:07,166
I'll send you to study in England with Saikhim.

142
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:13,486
The one who's trying to blackmail me

143
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,006
isn't Kaokla.

144
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,406
It's you instead.

145
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:18,606
I'm also not Saikhim

146
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:21,446
who would just let you ruin my life with your stupidity!

147
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,514
If you don't take advantage of this chance,

148
00:11:23,646 --> 00:11:26,246
your life won't be able to improve again.

149
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,486
This award will be going to Saikhim when I disobey you.

150
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:38,206
I don't want it.

151
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,366
I don't care if I can't get it.

152
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:58,486
For the Woman of the Year award for this year,

153
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:01,446
we only choose the woman who's renowned for...

154
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:02,806
Aren't you going in?

155
00:12:03,486 --> 00:12:06,526
Are you afraid that you'll be disappointed if it's not you?

156
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:14,766
Have some sportsmanship. You can't accept that someone is better than you?

157
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,606
Woman of the Year award recipient for this year is

158
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:21,726
Ms. Lita Thongma, a new designer

159
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:25,246
whose work has become well-known internationally.

160
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:31,526
Congratulations.

161
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:34,686
Where are you going?

162
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:36,206
Go accept the award.

163
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,926
It should be Khim's award.

164
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:41,926
You should go first.

165
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,686
Go accept the award.

166
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:51,086
Please. It's your time to take the award. Please come quickly.

167
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:52,446
This way, please.

168
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:55,686
Ms. Lita is here. Please give her a round of applause.

169
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:00,406
Congratulations, Ms. Lita.

170
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:06,126
Congratulations.

171
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,966
Now, we'll take some photos. Please give her another round of applause.

172
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:27,206
She has accepted the award.

173
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,286
Good.

174
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:35,006
Deal with the application later.

175
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:36,206
Yes.

176
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:44,286
Lita, Lita.

177
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:49,166
What's wrong? What happened?

178
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,606
This award is like a symbol of my shame,

179
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:54,606
that I'm not good enough.

180
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,046
Hey.

181
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:57,606
Who would think that?

182
00:13:57,726 --> 00:13:59,166
It's not an award.

183
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,086
It's a punishment for both of us.

184
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:02,686
Punishment?

185
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,206
We didn't do anything wrong.

186
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,414
It's about...

187
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:11,486
It's about the land that you can't give to your dad.

188
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:12,926
You didn't manage to do it for him,

189
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,726
so I got this punishment.

190
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:24,246
- Lita, accept it for now. - No. I don't want it.

191
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,086
- But Mr. Sin told you to accept... - I said I didn't want it!

192
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:29,166
Tell him to go to hell!

193
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:33,326
Lita, please come this way.

194
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,086
Hey, give this to her.

195
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:52,657
That award is supposed to be yours.

196
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:57,326
But suddenly, a sponsor gave a big donation to steal it from you.

197
00:14:57,486 --> 00:15:00,566
That sponsor dared to host the award ceremony

198
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:02,406
to keep and protect the award.

199
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:04,366
How did you know?

200
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,446
Everyone knows it.

201
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:09,446
What did you do to your dad?

202
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:11,766
He didn't care about you like before.

203
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:16,366
Although we're rivals, you're a talented woman.

204
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,726
I don't mind it.

205
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:20,006
I actually want to cooperate with you.

206
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:26,126
Do you know that I want to build a hotel opposite yours?

207
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,566
If you continue staying here and feel uncomfortable,

208
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:33,766
you can work with me.

209
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:36,886
Don't let a man

210
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:39,926
treat you as his puppet.

211
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,806
Where is my dad?

212
00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:07,486
He just went out.

213
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:27,326
(Construction Model for the Art Gallery)

214
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:32,086
It's about the land that you can't give to your dad.

215
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:33,646
You didn't manage to do it for him,

216
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:35,486
so I got this punishment.

217
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:39,326
(I want to build a hotel opposite yours.)

218
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:43,286
If you continue staying here and feel uncomfortable,

219
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:45,486
you can work with me.

220
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:55,486
Kla.

221
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:58,182
Suddenly, there's an art gallery project.

222
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:00,766
They said they want to expropriate that historic house.

223
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:02,886
This can't be a coincidence.

224
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:04,846
Your father-in-law

225
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,686
was the one who dug this up.

226
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:09,206
They want to stop us so badly.

227
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:11,926
What will you do?

228
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:16,086
Let me consult with Kloy first.

229
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,950
Kloy, where are you? Why haven't you come yet?

230
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:26,646
(I don't think I can come now.)

231
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:28,646
Is something wrong?

232
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,846
(I'll call you when my errand is done.)

233
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,286
Khem, what's going on?

234
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:39,140
Why didn't Kloy come here?

235
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:40,566
I'll go take a look.

236
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:50,742
Carl.

237
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:54,366
My mom said she would arrive this evening.

238
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:56,926
Why did you invite her to come here?

239
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:59,526
I want to reveal my relationship to my family.

240
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:01,566
I want everyone to be together.

241
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:04,773
I don't know whether your mom would like me.

242
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,046
I'm not her favorite son.

243
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,566
She isn't that possessive of me.

244
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:10,206
There's nothing to be worried about.

245
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:11,806
You can relax.

246
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:17,366
Wow. It's so pretty.

247
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,646
How did you find this place?

248
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:22,446
I found it when I stayed at the opposite hotel.

249
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:31,766
This place is cool and pleasant.

250
00:18:58,886 --> 00:19:02,326
When there's a flower on you, you're even more beautiful.

251
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:28,086
Clare, this is Asia, my stepmother.

252
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:31,726
- Hello, Ma'am. - Hello.

253
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:34,966
We finally met each other.

254
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:39,757
Please go inside first.

255
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:58,046
- Hello? - I want to ask you something about the house.

256
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:05,006
I've prepared this meal to treat you, Ms. Asia.

257
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,446
Have you tried them?

258
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:07,766
No.

259
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:10,766
But I'm not a picky eater or anything.

260
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:12,446
Carl is the same.

261
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:15,726
He isn't a picky eater.

262
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:19,806
He's not picky, that's why sometimes

263
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:23,406
he eats some bad stuff. As for his taste,

264
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:25,326
I can't teach him to change it.

265
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,366
Mom.

266
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,206
You're here.

267
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:42,046
I'm sorry for being late.

268
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:49,766
Do you frequently come back to visit your family in Thailand?

269
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,926
I haven't really got to come back here.

270
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:57,086
I don't have any home here, so I don't know why I should come back.

271
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,486
Don't you have any relatives left?

272
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:01,886
No.

273
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:06,126
I invited everyone here because I want to do a food tour here.

274
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:08,646
Since you're a great cook,

275
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:11,406
I want to take tourists here to try your dishes

276
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:13,508
with a warm atmosphere like this.

277
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:15,126
Thank you.

278
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:18,846
Please do it. All of the dishes here are delicious.

279
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:20,726
Thanks.

280
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:23,366
This house is pretty because of its liveliness.

281
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,046
I want everyone to come here to feel a warm atmosphere,

282
00:21:27,406 --> 00:21:28,966
just like when we visit our relatives.

283
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:33,086
She's now collecting her recipes to produce a Thai traditional recipe book.

284
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:36,166
I want to invite you to produce the manuscript with us.

285
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,446
Sure.

286
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:43,046
Excuse me, but there are more guests.

287
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:44,517
More guests?

288
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:47,286
They're probably my guests.

289
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:51,926
I have to apologize that I invited my guests here without telling you.

290
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:55,046
When I heard that there'll be a special meal today,

291
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,646
I really wanted to invite them.

292
00:21:57,998 --> 00:22:00,246
- Please wait a moment. - I'll welcome them.

293
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:12,486
Ms. Khim, please come inside. Everyone is waiting.

294
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:19,206
How did you get here?

295
00:22:19,446 --> 00:22:21,406
Your stepmother invited me.

296
00:22:22,813 --> 00:22:24,446
Don't you have any manners?

297
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,262
Why did you come when the owner didn't invite you?

298
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:28,686
I told you

299
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:30,311
that your stepmother has invited me.

300
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:32,086
I was the one who invited her.

301
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:37,006
Don't be rude to my guest.

302
00:22:39,206 --> 00:22:40,326
Please.

303
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,718
She's Ms. Saikhim,

304
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:55,406
the owner of the opposite hotel.

305
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:57,726
Oh, hello.

306
00:22:57,988 --> 00:22:59,806
You're around here, I see.

307
00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:08,526
- Please have a seat. - Let's have dinner, Ms. Khim.

308
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:27,246
This is my mom.

309
00:23:27,462 --> 00:23:30,086
Mom, this is Khim, my role model.

310
00:23:35,886 --> 00:23:37,326
Nice to meet you.

311
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:47,486
She's Ms. Rarin, she came from America. She just arrived today.

312
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:50,926
Rarin?

313
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,806
Ms. Khim, please take your seat right here.

314
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:15,046
When I was a child, I was a picky eater.

315
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:18,566
My mom had to pack up food from our home for me to eat at school.

316
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:21,396
I could only eat my mom's chicken stew.

317
00:24:21,825 --> 00:24:24,366
Do you know what's the only Thai food my mom has ever cooked for me?

318
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:29,526
It's American fried rice that American children wouldn't know.

319
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,006
Isn't that right, Mom?

320
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:38,246
That's good.

321
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:40,086
I don't have a mom.

322
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:43,326
I don't know what a mom's dish tastes like.

323
00:24:44,638 --> 00:24:46,006
When I was sick

324
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,510
and missed dishes from my home,

325
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:51,966
the dishes from my home for me...

326
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:57,566
There wasn't anything like that. I didn't even know what it was.

327
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,646
What are you trying to do?

328
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:33,846
Why did you bring Saikhim here today?

329
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:35,966
You dated Claire

330
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,926
because she has the same mother as Saikhim, right?

331
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:41,646
You know that,

332
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:43,446
so you tried to make them meet each other.

333
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:46,686
Haven't you done everything for today?

334
00:25:46,942 --> 00:25:50,286
The day that Saikhim finds out that her mom has another child.

335
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:53,806
This is a chance for your revenge. Why are you still hesitating?

336
00:25:54,046 --> 00:25:56,726
Even if it is, you have no right to get involved.

337
00:25:58,686 --> 00:26:00,526
You said you didn't care.

338
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:03,406
Then, what have you planned all this for?

339
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:07,326
You wanted to be bad, so you should crush them now. Crush them to death.

340
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:10,166
Stop being flippant.

341
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:25,126
Wow. That looks difficult. Why does it have to be decorated so much?

342
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,006
Girl,

343
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:29,726
old ladies back then,

344
00:26:29,862 --> 00:26:34,309
they had to know how to peel fruits, decorate with leaves,

345
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:37,488
and how to knead and make sweets.

346
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:38,926
When they can do all that,

347
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:42,286
that's when they could call themselves a lady.

348
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:47,206
Actually, it's not difficult. I'll show it to you.

349
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:57,571
- Please try it. - You should try it.

350
00:26:58,686 --> 00:26:59,966
Thank you.

351
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,286
- Here. First. - Teach them.

352
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:07,226
We have to build up the base.

353
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:12,509
- Can you do it? - Yes?

354
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:17,806
- Here. - Oh.

355
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:22,686
- Thank you. You're so great, Mom. - It's not difficult.

356
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:24,526
- When you're done... - Ouch.

357
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,766
Oh, no.

358
00:27:26,966 --> 00:27:28,766
You're bleeding.

359
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:39,166
It's fine.

360
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:42,566
I can take care of it.

361
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:49,606
Oh, my.

362
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:51,926
It might be a deep cut.

363
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:24,686
Does it hurt?

364
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:30,046
It still hurt less than

365
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:32,366
knowing that you're still alive.

366
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:36,006
Everyone said you were dead, Mom.

367
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:37,646
Why...

368
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,966
Your dad forbade us from meeting each other.

369
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,566
He claimed I was already dead.

370
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:51,366
He asked me to get out of your life since that day.

371
00:29:00,286 --> 00:29:02,366
You're still alive

372
00:29:03,197 --> 00:29:04,806
and you also have another child.

373
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:07,286
That's the only thing I can think of.

374
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:09,686
Claire isn't my real daughter.

375
00:29:09,846 --> 00:29:11,686
She's my new husband's daughter.

376
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:13,606
I have to raise her.

377
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,263
I feel a lot better now.

378
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:19,239
Aside from raising your daughter,

379
00:29:19,446 --> 00:29:21,166
you also raised another man's daughter.

380
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:23,006
You were a child, Khim.

381
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,486
You wouldn't understand back then.

382
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:30,726
So, you have to act like you don't know me today, right?

383
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:36,006
Okay. I understand now.

384
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:40,926
I can't even call you my mom.

385
00:29:41,222 --> 00:29:42,366
So, think of it as

386
00:29:42,502 --> 00:29:44,766
we've never met each other.

387
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:46,286
Because

388
00:29:46,406 --> 00:29:49,286
I don't exist in your eyes anyway.

389
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:27,406
Everyone who was dead is alive again.

390
00:30:28,486 --> 00:30:31,046
You came back to mock me, right?

391
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:34,286
This is the same method your dad has used to get rid of people around you.

392
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,566
You can't say that everyone has left you.

393
00:30:36,732 --> 00:30:38,886
You killed everyone without any remorse.

394
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:41,886
Do you want me to feel sad?

395
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:44,526
If that's so,

396
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:46,046
you've succeeded.

397
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:48,526
I'm hurt. Are you satisfied now?

398
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,246
You're hurt because you saw that we're better off without you.

399
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:04,766
I'm hurt because I still remember your old self.

400
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:08,406
The old you who would never hurt me.

401
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,366
Where did you hide him?

402
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:16,086
I want that one back.

403
00:31:20,806 --> 00:31:23,246
How much do you hate me for you to do this to me?

404
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:35,886
I want to see you not being able to love anyone again.

405
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:40,406
A selfish woman like you doesn't deserve love.

406
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:43,286
Ask yourself.

407
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,806
What did you do to your child when you were a mother?

408
00:31:46,496 --> 00:31:47,496
What?

409
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,646
You can't love anyone because you only love yourself.

410
00:31:50,086 --> 00:31:51,566
That's why you have no one left.

411
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:55,046
Even your dad who you think is possessive of you,

412
00:31:55,486 --> 00:31:56,846
is he sincere with you?

413
00:31:57,326 --> 00:31:58,846
He's the one who took your mom away from you

414
00:31:59,326 --> 00:32:01,446
for only one reason. She's not worthy.

415
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:03,846
You can see it today

416
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:06,278
that you are the one who isn't worthy of us.

417
00:32:07,397 --> 00:32:08,486
That's it.

418
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:13,046
That's the thing you want me to remember.

419
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,326
Hey.

420
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:28,426
Are you leaving like this?

421
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:34,206
Where is Ms. Khim?

422
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:36,846
She went back.

423
00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:39,446
Did Carl go to send her off?

424
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:41,246
No. He's on a call.

425
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,366
That's why he took so long.

426
00:32:43,606 --> 00:32:45,190
You should go wait inside.

427
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:46,406
Yes.

428
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:08,884
Khim.

429
00:33:10,877 --> 00:33:12,046
Khim.

430
00:33:30,286 --> 00:33:31,446
Khim.

431
00:33:39,454 --> 00:33:40,526
Khim.

432
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:47,206
Khim.

433
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:50,726
Khim.

434
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:30,514
Ms. Khim.

435
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:32,446
Ms. Khim, why do you look like this?

436
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:34,206
What have you done?

437
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:37,886
Ms. Khim.

438
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:39,366
Ms. Khim, what's going on?

439
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:46,926
You care so much for her. Running after her like that.

440
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:49,781
Are you satisfied now?

441
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:53,046
Don't take it out on me.

442
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:56,046
You were the one who prepared everything for today.

443
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:58,566
She's probably confronting her dad right now.

444
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:00,646
It's all as you planned.

445
00:35:00,886 --> 00:35:02,606
Are you threatening me?

446
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:06,086
You're so soft-hearted.

447
00:35:06,294 --> 00:35:08,486
That's why your life is stuck here.

448
00:35:10,365 --> 00:35:13,046
The one who you should rebel against

449
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:15,366
are those people, not me.

450
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:19,086
Don't try to go against me.

451
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,286
Do you want something in here?

452
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:55,846
Dad, do you know whom I met?

453
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,406
I met my mom.

454
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,926
I met everyone who was dead.

455
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,486
Because actually,

456
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:07,406
they aren't dead.

457
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,806
Can you explain what the heck is going on?

458
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:34,566
I've done something that Saikhim's dad couldn't accept.

459
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,126
He said I didn't deserve to be a mother.

460
00:36:40,517 --> 00:36:42,406
He pressured me

461
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,406
to not be near Saikhim.

462
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:04,806
Look at these photos.

463
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,436
Look.

464
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:14,286
A woman who agreed to take this perverted photoshoot.

465
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:17,206
Does she deserve to be a mother?

466
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:25,041
She's attracted to a photographer

467
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,606
so much that she took this nude photograph.

468
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:29,366
And these photos were leaked.

469
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:31,726
Where could I hide my face?

470
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:34,518
How would my daughter live?

471
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:36,966
She couldn't face anyone.

472
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:39,086
She committed suicide.

473
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:44,286
She was the one who left me and you first.

474
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:54,726
I was young back then.

475
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,726
So, I solved the problem foolishly.

476
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:01,246
I tried to overdose myself in return

477
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,966
after Sin wouldn't forgive me.

478
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:07,806
(I only blamed myself)

479
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:10,406
(and forgot about Khim.)

480
00:38:11,486 --> 00:38:13,726
(I just wanted to run away from the problem.)

481
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:23,966
(He made me feel like I'm so disgusting,)

482
00:38:25,126 --> 00:38:27,086
(that I couldn't be a mother.)

483
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:29,846
(Until I learned that)

484
00:38:30,365 --> 00:38:33,086
(while he thought I was a bad influence,)

485
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:36,526
(he began to find a new mother for Saikhim.)

486
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,030
(He asked someone else to replace me.)

487
00:38:39,446 --> 00:38:41,566
(When I realized that,)

488
00:38:41,894 --> 00:38:44,246
(that my scandal was leaked,)

489
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:46,766
(it might be done intentionally by someone)

490
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:50,401
(to become the third wheel in our family.)

491
00:38:50,573 --> 00:38:53,246
When I offered her to die from your life,

492
00:38:54,926 --> 00:38:56,326
she readily agreed to it

493
00:38:56,886 --> 00:38:58,126
even when you're a child.

494
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,526
She didn't care about you at all.

495
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:03,046
An unloving woman like that,

496
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,486
why would I keep her?

497
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,337
If you have decided to leave,

498
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:08,406
don't come back to your daughter again.

499
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:10,246
(She wanted to be with someone else.)

500
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:12,166
(She wanted a new life.)

501
00:39:13,165 --> 00:39:14,326
(I gave her an ultimatum)

502
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,566
(to not face you ever again. She still did.)

503
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:19,566
(Unbelievable.)

504
00:39:20,685 --> 00:39:22,366
(She's so selfish.)

505
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:27,226
I walked away

506
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:32,166
to make Saikhim believe her mom has been gone since then.

507
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:36,326
(To make Sin be able to face everyone else again.)

508
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:40,567
That's why I can't go back to Khim again.

509
00:39:40,741 --> 00:39:42,446
And Khim was still young.

510
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,620
(She didn't even know what sadness is.)

511
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:52,086
Since

512
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:55,566
she only knows one side of the truth,

513
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,886
I don't know

514
00:39:58,821 --> 00:40:01,206
why I should destroy a child's world

515
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:05,166
when we can live our lives without problems.

516
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:19,686
Why did you hide this from me for this long?

517
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:24,246
You still lie about this important matter to me.

518
00:40:24,526 --> 00:40:28,366
Would there be anything that I can trust from you, Dad?

519
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:30,006
What did Rarin tell you?

520
00:40:31,324 --> 00:40:32,606
Why did she come back?

521
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,686
Mom has another child.

522
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:39,006
Her daughter is Kaokla's girlfriend.

523
00:40:39,254 --> 00:40:40,494
Kaokla again.

524
00:40:43,045 --> 00:40:45,045
He caused us to be paranoid about each other.

525
00:40:45,886 --> 00:40:47,286
Why aren't you blaming him?

526
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:50,046
He only stabbed me with the truth.

527
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:53,766
Even if it's painful, it's still the truth.

528
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:57,406
I suspect that his death and my mom's death

529
00:40:57,566 --> 00:40:59,686
are just your excuse.

530
00:41:00,462 --> 00:41:03,926
You use me as an excuse to eliminate people whom you don't like.

531
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,286
What are you saying?

532
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,286
Kaokla told me

533
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:09,286
that we're the ones who killed him.

534
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:11,926
Why was Kla in prison?

535
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:14,406
Can you explain it to me?

536
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,446
Did you get brainwashed again?

537
00:41:17,246 --> 00:41:18,246
I...

538
00:41:19,205 --> 00:41:20,886
The one who isn't worthy,

539
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:23,286
you wouldn't keep them.

540
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:27,366
Now, I'm not worthy to be your daughter.

541
00:41:27,662 --> 00:41:30,253
You use money to buy the award for Lita,

542
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,273
to use Lita to put me down.

543
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,046
Lita saw you as her rival.

544
00:41:34,206 --> 00:41:35,966
She hasn't thought of you as her friend.

545
00:41:36,646 --> 00:41:39,406
She has done everything to win against you. You know what?

546
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:41,766
If she could steal your boyfriend, she would.

547
00:41:43,006 --> 00:41:46,326
And so what? If I lose against Lita,

548
00:41:47,053 --> 00:41:48,627
are you going to be embarrassed?

549
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:51,686
That's why you would kill me with this.

550
00:42:15,726 --> 00:42:17,406
Mr. Sin might have lied to you

551
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:20,366
because he doesn't want you to hate your own mother.

552
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,086
A lie

553
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:24,606
came from a good intention sometimes.

554
00:42:26,566 --> 00:42:28,846
You're pretending to console me,

555
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,312
but actually, you're laughing in your heart.

556
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,526
Ms. Khim.

557
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,486
He really has good intentions towards you.

558
00:42:37,614 --> 00:42:38,886
Trust me.

559
00:42:39,486 --> 00:42:42,326
Even you didn't tell me the truth, Oun.

560
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:50,526
I really feel bad for Saikhim.

561
00:42:50,757 --> 00:42:52,366
Everyone around her

562
00:42:52,622 --> 00:42:54,806
is all insincere towards her.

563
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:25,326
Khim, what's going on?

564
00:43:31,126 --> 00:43:32,326
What happened?

565
00:43:32,686 --> 00:43:36,166
Can I stay here?

566
00:43:36,606 --> 00:43:37,926
Is something wrong?

567
00:43:39,926 --> 00:43:41,926
You didn't answer my call.

568
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:19,086
(I want to see you not being able to love anyone again.)

569
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:22,046
(A selfish woman like you doesn't deserve love.)

570
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:23,886
(Ask yourself.)

571
00:44:24,118 --> 00:44:26,526
(What did you do to your child when you were a mother?)

572
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:39,806
A woman who agreed to take this perverted photoshoot.

573
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:42,461
Does she deserve to be a mother?

574
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:46,566
She's so attracted to a photographer that she took this nude photograph.

575
00:44:46,877 --> 00:44:49,726
She was the one who left me and you first.

576
00:45:13,605 --> 00:45:15,326
Should we visit your mother?

577
00:45:16,446 --> 00:45:18,246
Try to listen to her side of the story.

578
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:21,414
Don't make a conclusion right now.

579
00:45:25,758 --> 00:45:29,246
People have both good and bad sides.

580
00:45:29,877 --> 00:45:33,446
It doesn't mean that she can't be a parent.

581
00:45:36,006 --> 00:45:38,206
Your dad forbade us from meeting each other.

582
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,606
He claimed I was already dead.

583
00:45:40,846 --> 00:45:44,286
He asked me to get out of your life since that day.

584
00:45:44,462 --> 00:45:46,446
Aside from raising your daughter,

585
00:45:47,223 --> 00:45:48,966
you also raised another man's daughter.

586
00:45:49,094 --> 00:45:50,646
You were a child, Khim.

587
00:45:51,798 --> 00:45:54,346
You wouldn't understand back then.

588
00:46:37,606 --> 00:46:39,726
(You can't love anyone because you only love yourself.)

589
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:41,246
(That's why you have no one left.)

590
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:43,086
Do you want me to feel sad?

591
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:46,206
If that's so,

592
00:46:47,646 --> 00:46:49,006
you've succeeded.

593
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,486
I'm hurt. Are you satisfied now?

594
00:46:52,997 --> 00:46:56,406
(You're hurt because you saw that we're better off without you.)

595
00:46:57,917 --> 00:47:00,606
(I'm hurt because I still remember your old self.)

596
00:47:03,815 --> 00:47:06,046
(The old you who would never hurt me.)

597
00:47:06,886 --> 00:47:08,406
Where did you hide him?

598
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:13,766
I want that one back.

599
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:35,846
(Hong Hean Yoo Sa Bai)

600
00:47:50,126 --> 00:47:52,446
I don't know whether he's dead or sleeping.

601
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:57,846
He must be tired. It's a long drive from there.

602
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:01,166
What about you?

603
00:48:01,686 --> 00:48:03,046
You should think of him.

604
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,486
Dad.

605
00:48:08,141 --> 00:48:09,286
Can't you see?

606
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:13,286
Do you think I can't choose?

607
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:18,006
If you don't like him,

608
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,046
don't hold him back.

609
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,326
Since when did I hold him back?

610
00:48:24,398 --> 00:48:25,486
It's you

611
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:28,486
who ruins his self-confidence. You said he's dirty

612
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:31,646
to not make him hit on other girls, right?

613
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,438
You're sly.

614
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:35,406
I feel bad for Khem.

615
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:37,166
He's naive.

616
00:48:41,214 --> 00:48:43,549
Kloy, please stop the car.

617
00:48:49,342 --> 00:48:51,006
I'm sorry that I didn't look after you.

618
00:48:52,126 --> 00:48:53,206
Watch out.

619
00:48:58,494 --> 00:48:59,606
Kloy.

620
00:49:00,046 --> 00:49:01,166
Kla said

621
00:49:01,282 --> 00:49:02,912
you would drive to your home.

622
00:49:04,046 --> 00:49:05,326
If you're this nice,

623
00:49:05,847 --> 00:49:07,286
did you do something wrong?

624
00:49:08,437 --> 00:49:09,686
I'm being generous.

625
00:49:09,886 --> 00:49:11,286
You should thank me.

626
00:49:11,454 --> 00:49:12,806
You shouldn't be sarcastic.

627
00:49:14,726 --> 00:49:16,566
Is this your redemption?

628
00:49:16,877 --> 00:49:18,669
- I hope you'll do this all the time. - Yes.

629
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:20,966
Please come this way.

630
00:49:23,222 --> 00:49:26,166
(Can you feel something else aside from guilt?)

631
00:49:26,461 --> 00:49:28,406
(She doesn't want only your sympathy.)

632
00:49:35,485 --> 00:49:36,886
Since I was born,

633
00:49:37,254 --> 00:49:39,606
this is already halfway through my life. I haven't done much.

634
00:49:40,101 --> 00:49:42,966
For the rest of my life, I can give it to you.

635
00:49:45,078 --> 00:49:46,430
Living for someone else

636
00:49:46,805 --> 00:49:48,326
might be better for me.

637
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:51,086
It's already disgusting enough.

638
00:49:51,742 --> 00:49:53,766
Who would endure it for the rest of their lives?

639
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:59,766
Who told him to be naive? I can't help it.

640
00:50:02,326 --> 00:50:05,206
And where is the document about transferring the land?

641
00:50:05,766 --> 00:50:07,646
I forgot about it. Let me go get it.

642
00:50:07,806 --> 00:50:09,206
I've prepared it.

643
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:22,126
Here. This is for the land.

644
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:26,206
I found this one after I went through my stuff. It's been seven years.

645
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:28,479
I have no clue if it still has legal consequences.

646
00:50:30,431 --> 00:50:32,446
(Marriage Certificate)

647
00:50:33,582 --> 00:50:34,582
Dad.

648
00:50:35,806 --> 00:50:37,166
What's this?

649
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,406
Since that day,

650
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,206
everyone thought Kla was dead.

651
00:50:41,445 --> 00:50:43,006
But he changed his name and surname.

652
00:50:43,534 --> 00:50:45,534
I don't know that it'll be dragged this long.

653
00:50:46,382 --> 00:50:47,966
Is this going to be a problem?

654
00:50:48,998 --> 00:50:51,386
Call your lawyer right now. Quick.

655
00:50:51,486 --> 00:50:52,686
Sure.

656
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:07,726
Yes. I'm taking someone to make a complaint against the expropriation.

657
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:11,206
Can you please check the document I've sent you

658
00:51:11,366 --> 00:51:13,286
to see if it still has legal consequences?

659
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:18,886
This is important. I want you to look at it now.

660
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:20,207
(Yes.)

661
00:51:21,702 --> 00:51:22,886
Khem.

662
00:51:23,327 --> 00:51:25,327
Khem. Wake up.

663
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:27,486
Pack your stuff and come down right now.

664
00:51:27,582 --> 00:51:28,982
Okay.

665
00:51:30,575 --> 00:51:31,886
You're leaving right now?

666
00:51:32,334 --> 00:51:33,526
- Yes. - What did he say?

667
00:51:34,766 --> 00:51:36,846
I'll go to hear it from him in Bangkok.

668
00:51:36,975 --> 00:51:38,487
This is a life-or-death matter.

669
00:51:38,726 --> 00:51:40,366
I have to go back to handle it for Kla.

670
00:51:40,613 --> 00:51:43,166
About your land transfer, I'll handle it later.

671
00:51:43,286 --> 00:51:44,686
Okay. Sure.

672
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:46,526
What's going on?

673
00:51:48,246 --> 00:51:49,246
Don't waste more time.

674
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:51,886
- Where are we going? - Dad, goodbye.

675
00:51:52,438 --> 00:51:53,479
- Let's go. - Khem.

676
00:51:53,567 --> 00:51:55,806
- Take care of my daughter. - Yes. Where are we going?

677
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,566
Here.

678
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:01,406
I'll tell you one thing.

679
00:52:01,606 --> 00:52:03,326
I suspect that

680
00:52:03,526 --> 00:52:07,006
they want to transfer the land around here

681
00:52:07,142 --> 00:52:09,526
because they want to make an art gallery.

682
00:52:09,686 --> 00:52:13,166
I might not be able to die here.

683
00:52:13,366 --> 00:52:17,166
I might have to stay in a nursing home for the elderly.

684
00:52:17,446 --> 00:52:19,166
They're only threatening you.

685
00:52:19,757 --> 00:52:22,086
Actually, this project was canceled once.

686
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,286
I'm trying to threaten them back.

687
00:52:24,821 --> 00:52:26,181
Don't give up just yet.

688
00:52:26,628 --> 00:52:28,166
They might lose to themselves.

689
00:52:35,206 --> 00:52:37,006
Someone file a complaint

690
00:52:37,126 --> 00:52:40,126
saying that you would use the art gallery to benefit our hotel.

691
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:43,166
They also know that we want to appoint our people as the director.

692
00:52:45,613 --> 00:52:46,846
How is this possible?

693
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:50,326
We haven't announced anything. How could they know?

694
00:52:50,486 --> 00:52:52,046
Lita might betray us.

695
00:52:56,886 --> 00:53:00,846
I think this is from Kaokla. He wants to frame us for corruption.

696
00:53:05,702 --> 00:53:07,526
With this stupid adviser,

697
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,566
it might get you in jail.

698
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,560
Your marriage certificate with still Khim exists.

699
00:53:18,709 --> 00:53:20,886
The lawyer said it still has legal consequences.

700
00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:24,526
You have to divorce her, Kla.

701
00:53:24,638 --> 00:53:26,646
There might be a problem for the business.

702
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:37,886
If you don't divorce, Khim can't marry her boyfriend.

703
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:40,166
Good.

704
00:53:40,781 --> 00:53:42,166
We have an advantage.

705
00:53:43,574 --> 00:53:45,766
You don't look bothered.

706
00:53:46,084 --> 00:53:49,406
Did you already know about this marriage certificate?

707
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,766
I'm waiting to see when Saikhim will notice it.

708
00:53:55,181 --> 00:53:59,166
Kla, don't you think when your girlfriend knows this,

709
00:53:59,532 --> 00:54:00,726
what would happen?

710
00:54:04,789 --> 00:54:06,926
Khim, are you feeling better?

711
00:54:10,245 --> 00:54:11,726
I'm alright now.

712
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:15,221
Thaen, are you free?

713
00:54:15,726 --> 00:54:18,166
I think I'll resign from the bank soon.

714
00:54:18,766 --> 00:54:20,446
I'm in talk with a new place.

715
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:24,486
Will your family's bank

716
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:26,886
let you resign, Thaen?

717
00:54:27,252 --> 00:54:28,659
If I want to grow up,

718
00:54:28,846 --> 00:54:30,086
I have to leave that place.

719
00:54:30,502 --> 00:54:32,502
If not, I'll be controlled by my dad forever.

720
00:54:47,854 --> 00:54:49,446
That's the news about my dad.

721
00:54:55,389 --> 00:54:57,726
This is related to your hotel.

722
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:00,966
He intentionally attacked my dad.

723
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,366
Who?

724
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:14,406
Are you here for your package?

725
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:15,966
Yes.

726
00:55:31,806 --> 00:55:33,046
It's you, right?

727
00:55:33,157 --> 00:55:35,157
You sent someone to claim that there's corruption.

728
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,806
Your dad intends to expropriate the land to keep it to himself.

729
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:41,606
He deserves it as he used his unlawful authority.

730
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,486
If we give this house to you,

731
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:46,206
will you stop your grudge against me?

732
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:47,846
I didn't want to have a grudge against you.

733
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:49,766
Then, drop this complaint.

734
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:51,726
If you want to get back at me,

735
00:55:52,037 --> 00:55:54,037
don't drag anyone else involved.

736
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:56,566
You can take this house if you want it so much.

737
00:55:56,797 --> 00:55:58,446
But stop bothering us.

738
00:55:58,598 --> 00:56:00,006
It would be great if it's that easy.

739
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:02,166
Even if I get this plot of land,

740
00:56:02,438 --> 00:56:04,326
we might have to share its ownership.

741
00:56:14,212 --> 00:56:15,509
We haven't divorced.

742
00:56:15,781 --> 00:56:17,966
We're the same person according to law.

743
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:20,662
Impossible.

744
00:56:20,846 --> 00:56:23,526
Karma sometimes comes back in the shape of marriage.

745
00:56:24,773 --> 00:56:25,966
Then, let's divorce.

746
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,486
I would love to.

747
00:56:27,774 --> 00:56:30,366
But I have to be sure that you wouldn't suck my money from me.

748
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:32,446
Who would want your money?

749
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:34,966
You want this land even though it isn't mine.

750
00:56:35,302 --> 00:56:37,326
How could I trust a trickster like you?

751
00:56:37,797 --> 00:56:38,966
What do you want?

752
00:56:39,669 --> 00:56:41,006
Transfer your share of the hotel

753
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:42,966
if you want to divorce and get married.

754
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:45,726
I'll divorce if you have a better offer.

755
00:56:46,806 --> 00:56:47,846
Dream on.

756
00:56:49,013 --> 00:56:51,406
Then, I guess your groom-to-be will wait for nothing.

757
00:56:52,286 --> 00:56:53,566
He can't marry you in this life.

758
00:56:54,013 --> 00:56:55,566
Let's hope he can marry you in his next life.

759
00:57:04,446 --> 00:57:05,766
When did you come here?

760
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,286
We need to talk.

761
00:57:13,973 --> 00:57:15,446
What did you talk about with Saikhim?

762
00:57:16,446 --> 00:57:18,086
You two have known each other before.

763
00:57:19,446 --> 00:57:20,446
Yes.

764
00:57:21,038 --> 00:57:23,446
What about the marriage you were talking about?

765
00:57:23,886 --> 00:57:25,610
We used to date for a short while.

766
00:57:25,869 --> 00:57:28,446
Date? Or did you two marry?

767
00:57:29,137 --> 00:57:31,406
Does Claire know about this?

768
00:57:32,317 --> 00:57:34,317
It's long in the past. I didn't tell Claire.

769
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:37,566
I've been with Claire longer than I'd been with her.

770
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,486
I didn't have any feelings for her anymore.

771
00:57:39,901 --> 00:57:41,446
Let me tell you something.

772
00:57:42,445 --> 00:57:46,006
Normally, time can heal love,

773
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:49,126
anger, grudge, regret, and sadness.

774
00:57:49,764 --> 00:57:51,766
It'll make them become just a memory.

775
00:57:52,117 --> 00:57:56,326
Like when I forgot my disappointment for Saikhim's dad.

776
00:57:57,797 --> 00:57:59,286
But from what I've seen,

777
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:03,046
I think you're trying to fight against its nature.

778
00:58:03,965 --> 00:58:05,965
You're afraid it'll disappear from your heart.

779
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:07,846
Do you still dare

780
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:11,126
to say that Saikhim doesn't mean anything to you?

781
00:58:14,006 --> 00:58:17,526
If it's not for this coincidence that's bringing everyone together,

782
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:19,686
I would never let my daughter

783
00:58:19,846 --> 00:58:23,006
be stuck in this complex relationship.

784
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:25,646
For both of my daughters.

785
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,651
Legally, if we can prove that the husband and wife

786
00:58:39,774 --> 00:58:42,286
haven't lived together for more than three years,

787
00:58:42,557 --> 00:58:45,366
it can be considered that the marriage is over.

788
00:58:45,574 --> 00:58:48,086
It can be used to sue for divorce.

789
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:49,726
If I don't sue,

790
00:58:49,854 --> 00:58:53,006
is there any easier way to end this matter?

791
00:58:53,149 --> 00:58:54,806
You can agree to divorce.

792
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,164
But both sides must consent to it.

793
00:58:57,493 --> 00:58:58,846
What about our properties?

794
00:58:59,046 --> 00:59:02,526
That's the problem. I don't know whether you can come to an agreement.

795
00:59:06,326 --> 00:59:09,606
This divorce contract indicates that

796
00:59:09,974 --> 00:59:11,974
you won't claim any right in your marriage.

797
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:14,566
Consider all properties that were gained during the marriage

798
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,966
are personal properties of both sides.

799
00:59:18,525 --> 00:59:20,686
You can offer this contract to him first.

800
00:59:20,815 --> 00:59:23,166
If he doesn't have any problem with any of the conditions,

801
00:59:23,806 --> 00:59:25,886
you might not have to file for divorce.

802
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:16,846
I heard you went to consult with the lawyer.

803
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:20,646
This means you had registered your marriage with Saikhim.

804
01:00:21,294 --> 01:00:24,046
You might lose everything because of her.

805
01:00:24,886 --> 01:00:27,406
Our business is also owned by Nate.

806
01:00:28,238 --> 01:00:30,238
I won't let anyone else

807
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:32,966
take the inheritance from my son again.

808
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:40,606
Before you get into the stock market,

809
01:00:41,398 --> 01:00:44,046
you have to end this problem.

810
01:00:44,214 --> 01:00:45,214
Yes.

811
01:00:45,966 --> 01:00:47,940
I won't risk our company.

812
01:00:50,966 --> 01:00:55,086
When your dad secretly dated your mom, he also said that.

813
01:00:55,734 --> 01:00:58,340
A man is usually indecisive.

814
01:00:58,438 --> 01:01:01,006
That's why the problem has become this big today.

815
01:01:01,246 --> 01:01:03,886
You're fortunate that you didn't have a child. If not, she might...

816
01:01:03,982 --> 01:01:06,326
I know that you thought of me as a parasite.

817
01:01:06,718 --> 01:01:08,126
You couldn't accept me.

818
01:01:21,726 --> 01:01:24,244
This is the model of our boutique hotel

819
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:25,906
that the designer sent to me.

820
01:01:26,286 --> 01:01:28,846
If you don't handle your divorce immediately,

821
01:01:29,022 --> 01:01:30,846
I'll take your project back.

822
01:01:31,086 --> 01:01:33,046
Don't let your old wife

823
01:01:33,206 --> 01:01:35,366
use this opportunity to steal it from us.

824
01:01:36,421 --> 01:01:38,926
I assure you that I can handle it.

825
01:01:41,789 --> 01:01:45,246
If you can let a single piece of paper bind you down,

826
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,950
you're just good for nothing.

827
01:02:36,422 --> 01:02:38,406
How was it? What did you get?

828
01:02:41,406 --> 01:02:44,686
Not yet. But she might try to take everything back.

829
01:02:45,046 --> 01:02:46,246
Everything is going in her way.

830
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,646
You have to divorce her now.

831
01:02:49,806 --> 01:02:52,006
So, she won't have any excuse to take your company.

832
01:02:52,494 --> 01:02:54,046
If I have to listen to everything she says,

833
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:57,078
I'll become a soulless man.

834
01:02:57,981 --> 01:02:59,981
I wasn't born to be ordered around by anyone.

835
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,782
I'll never let anyone replace you.

836
01:03:25,811 --> 01:03:27,046
Someone's luck

837
01:03:27,373 --> 01:03:28,926
isn't something you can improve.

838
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:11,046
That means you can't marry Thaen yet.

839
01:04:11,934 --> 01:04:13,420
Not only that,

840
01:04:13,613 --> 01:04:15,806
but I also can't let Thaen know about this.

841
01:04:16,646 --> 01:04:19,006
I have to get a divorce before Thaen suspects anything.

842
01:04:19,598 --> 01:04:21,886
And does your dad know about this?

843
01:04:22,566 --> 01:04:24,166
I can't let him know either.

844
01:04:24,604 --> 01:04:28,326
The only one who knows about this other than us is Oun.

845
01:04:28,628 --> 01:04:30,886
But Oun wouldn't suspect anything.

846
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:33,526
There is no reason for him to not divorce you.

847
01:04:33,844 --> 01:04:35,726
He also wants his own benefits.

848
01:04:38,526 --> 01:04:41,046
I have to take the divorce documents to convince him

849
01:04:41,246 --> 01:04:43,806
before he uses my past to blackmail me.

850
01:04:44,766 --> 01:04:45,926
Seriously.

851
01:04:46,069 --> 01:04:47,526
I'm scared of his mind.

852
01:04:48,414 --> 01:04:51,262
If he could kill me to make him single again,

853
01:04:51,502 --> 01:04:52,846
he would do it.

854
01:04:53,061 --> 01:04:54,846
He wouldn't dare to do that much.

855
01:04:55,006 --> 01:04:57,686
He hates me so much that he can do everything.

856
01:04:58,669 --> 01:05:00,446
He used to love you so much.

857
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:03,046
How could he hate you that much?

858
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:16,854
Did my dad drag you to get you involved in the art gallery?

859
01:05:21,158 --> 01:05:22,825
It's lucky that he got exposed.

860
01:05:22,966 --> 01:05:26,246
I might get criticized that I'm one of your dad's people.

861
01:05:29,886 --> 01:05:31,626
I'm sorry about this.

862
01:05:31,981 --> 01:05:33,566
He has dragged you into this problem.

863
01:05:34,254 --> 01:05:35,726
He's paying for his karma.

864
01:05:36,084 --> 01:05:37,886
He can't take the land

865
01:05:37,974 --> 01:05:39,686
and he is also being investigated.

866
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:42,486
I think he'll lose his position as a minister.

867
01:05:55,126 --> 01:05:56,406
Did you tell anyone

868
01:05:56,855 --> 01:05:59,246
that I put in your name for the art gallery's director position?

869
01:06:00,381 --> 01:06:01,766
The evidence is here.

870
01:06:01,878 --> 01:06:03,246
Take it back if you're scared.

871
01:06:03,486 --> 01:06:04,966
Then, who leaked this?

872
01:06:05,606 --> 01:06:07,293
Kaokla could use this to file a complaint.

873
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:09,166
If you're afraid I'm a spy,

874
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,046
you shouldn't use me in the first place.

875
01:06:12,046 --> 01:06:13,166
Forget about this.

876
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:15,206
If anyone asks you,

877
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:17,846
you must tell them that you don't know anything.

878
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,921
Of course. You've never used your authority

879
01:06:27,331 --> 01:06:28,686
wrongfully before.

880
01:06:29,366 --> 01:06:30,366
Good.

881
01:06:30,966 --> 01:06:32,726
Don't betray me later.

882
01:06:32,926 --> 01:06:35,646
Don't threaten me with Saikhim's letters again.

883
01:06:35,846 --> 01:06:37,406
If not,

884
01:06:37,934 --> 01:06:39,418
I might change my mind

885
01:06:39,527 --> 01:06:41,806
to change my side and tell Kaokla

886
01:06:42,046 --> 01:06:45,266
that you faked the letter and used me

887
01:06:45,399 --> 01:06:46,966
to destroy his love.

888
01:06:49,879 --> 01:06:51,486
If he knows,

889
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,566
he might try to get back at you

890
01:06:54,726 --> 01:06:56,286
even more than this.

891
01:07:02,046 --> 01:07:03,326
I could never

892
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:05,326
teach you manners.

893
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:10,446
You sent me to study, not to fix my personality.

894
01:07:10,646 --> 01:07:13,726
It's difficult to change someone's personality.

895
01:07:25,629 --> 01:07:27,086
Keep an eye on Lita.

896
01:07:27,192 --> 01:07:29,166
- See if she contacts Kaokla. - Yes.

897
01:07:29,622 --> 01:07:31,622
We filed a complaint about the corruption of the gallery.

898
01:07:31,846 --> 01:07:33,846
We need to learn if you're conspiring with them,

899
01:07:33,998 --> 01:07:35,406
or if you're being used.

900
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:39,360
He can't even protect himself.

901
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:41,446
Do you think he can protect you?

902
01:07:51,326 --> 01:07:53,966
I feel like she's disobeying me.

903
01:08:00,526 --> 01:08:02,366
I'm a regular at this boxing gym.

904
01:08:02,685 --> 01:08:04,246
But I haven't had much time lately.

905
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:07,766
I saw that you're stressed about your work and your family.

906
01:08:07,926 --> 01:08:10,206
I want you to vent your stress here.

907
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:13,366
What you want to let out today,

908
01:08:13,486 --> 01:08:14,766
vent it on me.

909
01:08:15,636 --> 01:08:17,589
I'll be the sandbag for your emotion.

910
01:08:18,234 --> 01:08:19,234
Is it too tight?

911
01:08:19,365 --> 01:08:20,526
No.

912
01:08:20,944 --> 01:08:22,825
I will leave this disciple in your care.

913
01:08:22,926 --> 01:08:23,926
Yes.

914
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:28,926
Does she need a warm-up?

915
01:08:33,246 --> 01:08:34,366
Ms. Khim.

916
01:08:35,982 --> 01:08:37,446
She is my mom.

917
01:08:37,982 --> 01:08:40,926
What a coincidence. Are you training for boxing here?

918
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:42,726
I brought her here.

919
01:08:43,318 --> 01:08:45,806
Carl is here to find a volunteer to teach boxing to foreigners

920
01:08:45,966 --> 01:08:48,006
in exchange for teaching languages here.

921
01:08:48,118 --> 01:08:50,086
I want to try it for once.

922
01:08:53,086 --> 01:08:54,286
Hello.

923
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:56,806
I'm Thaenthai, Khim's boyfriend.

924
01:09:00,686 --> 01:09:01,846
This is good.

925
01:09:02,907 --> 01:09:04,486
Now, I have a friend to learn with me.

926
01:09:05,949 --> 01:09:07,829
I don't think she wants a friend.

927
01:09:08,181 --> 01:09:10,181
Her face looks like she wants an opponent.

928
01:09:10,518 --> 01:09:11,966
She looks like she wants to punch someone.

929
01:09:19,063 --> 01:09:21,406
Khim has told me about you.

930
01:09:22,183 --> 01:09:26,086
We're getting married in five or six months.

931
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:28,686
If you don't mind,

932
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:32,566
can I invite you to attend our wedding?

933
01:09:36,774 --> 01:09:37,846
But,

934
01:09:38,126 --> 01:09:41,046
Khim's dad might not welcome me.

935
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:44,541
But I'm happy for you.

936
01:09:45,325 --> 01:09:46,766
Khim probably wants

937
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,126
to create a perfect family

938
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:50,966
that she has never had before.

939
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:53,446
Khim might have shocked at first.

940
01:09:54,237 --> 01:09:57,206
But deep in her heart, I think Khim is happy

941
01:09:57,356 --> 01:09:59,126
to know that you're alive.

942
01:09:59,688 --> 01:10:03,246
I think we should make today as worthwhile as possible.

943
01:10:12,595 --> 01:10:14,110
- On your right, Khim. - Left, Claire.

944
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:17,886
Good job, Claire.

945
01:10:19,566 --> 01:10:20,726
Good job.

946
01:10:24,029 --> 01:10:26,206
I think I want to take a break.

947
01:10:30,486 --> 01:10:32,205
You can receive her punch.

948
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:33,316
Don't be scared.

949
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:34,566
Fight fire with fire.

950
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:40,613
Let's have a duel.

951
01:11:13,446 --> 01:11:14,486
- Khim. - Carl.

952
01:11:14,597 --> 01:11:15,783
- Stop. - Are you alright?

953
01:11:16,076 --> 01:11:17,246
Weak.

954
01:11:19,615 --> 01:11:20,806
What's wrong with you?

955
01:11:21,382 --> 01:11:22,846
You always like to pick a fight.

956
01:11:36,366 --> 01:11:37,446
Khim.

957
01:11:38,006 --> 01:11:39,486
Khim, do you know what you've done?

958
01:11:42,366 --> 01:11:43,966
She's just a sore loser.

959
01:11:47,918 --> 01:11:49,046
Khim.

960
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:52,488
Let's go. You should take some rest.

961
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:55,526
Let's go.

962
01:12:00,782 --> 01:12:01,846
Khim.

963
01:12:02,165 --> 01:12:03,926
You can't surprise him like that.

964
01:12:04,622 --> 01:12:06,846
He sent his girlfriend to beat me up first.

965
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:08,301
Didn't you see?

966
01:12:08,637 --> 01:12:11,726
Okay, Khim. I think you should rest for now.

967
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:13,566
If not, you'll get more upset.

968
01:12:13,902 --> 01:12:14,966
Let's go.

969
01:12:15,406 --> 01:12:16,446
Thaen.

970
01:12:16,662 --> 01:12:19,006
I'm not scared of a coward like him.

971
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:20,806
He's only good with his words.

972
01:12:20,982 --> 01:12:22,046
Khim.

973
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:24,606
Do you realize that every time you see him,

974
01:12:24,861 --> 01:12:26,286
you always get upset?

975
01:12:26,654 --> 01:12:28,134
Didn't you see him?

976
01:12:28,318 --> 01:12:29,726
- He... - Khim.

977
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,006
You have to learn to differentiate.

978
01:12:33,653 --> 01:12:35,886
Okay. If you want to vent your anger,

979
01:12:35,999 --> 01:12:39,206
I think you should vent it out on that sandbag.

980
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:43,299
Let's go.

981
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:49,446
Yes. Of course.

982
01:12:50,376 --> 01:12:52,006
Yes. I found it.

983
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,366
Yes.

984
01:12:56,804 --> 01:12:58,044
That's right.

985
01:12:59,804 --> 01:13:01,566
Please wait a second.

986
01:13:02,246 --> 01:13:03,646
This is an important document.

987
01:13:03,886 --> 01:13:04,886
Why don't you let him read it?

988
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:06,486
Don't flatter yourself.

989
01:13:06,798 --> 01:13:09,006
A lot of things are more important than you.

990
01:13:09,493 --> 01:13:10,677
Tell him to read it.

991
01:13:10,862 --> 01:13:12,326
So, we can set a date for our divorce.

992
01:13:13,572 --> 01:13:14,995
Let him read it.

993
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:18,286
I want the answer by today.

994
01:13:30,799 --> 01:13:32,446
I've sent the evidence to the lawyer.

995
01:13:32,629 --> 01:13:35,886
His only charge will be the unlawful appointment of the director.

996
01:13:36,758 --> 01:13:38,366
This is a huge blow for him.

997
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,646
But I have something better.

998
01:13:44,702 --> 01:13:46,766
The condition for your divorce that your wife offered.

999
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:48,646
Look at it.

1000
01:13:51,246 --> 01:13:53,686
She said she won't ask for any property.

1001
01:14:16,846 --> 01:14:18,726
You want to divorce without asking for money.

1002
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:21,006
Your family is all the same.

1003
01:14:21,174 --> 01:14:22,526
A kiss after a kick.

1004
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:27,046
I'm being fair. I don't want anything from you.

1005
01:14:28,249 --> 01:14:29,766
I only want to divorce.

1006
01:14:30,413 --> 01:14:31,686
I almost feel touched by you.

1007
01:14:32,006 --> 01:14:33,606
If you didn't catch me by surprise earlier,

1008
01:14:33,822 --> 01:14:35,166
I might accept your divorce.

1009
01:14:42,397 --> 01:14:43,806
Are you trying to goad me?

1010
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:45,886
You're mad like your dad.

1011
01:14:46,589 --> 01:14:48,926
Why wouldn't you show this in front of your man?

1012
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:50,726
What do you want? Tell me.

1013
01:14:55,646 --> 01:14:57,206
The farm is around here.

1014
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:59,046
If those two don't want to go,

1015
01:14:59,326 --> 01:15:01,406
I can send you home when we're going back.

1016
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:05,246
Khim.

1017
01:15:05,406 --> 01:15:07,166
I invited her to come to the coconut farm with us.

1018
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:13,846
Doesn't she want to stay with her family?

1019
01:15:16,773 --> 01:15:18,246
I want to go with you.

1020
01:15:19,374 --> 01:15:20,646
Let me come with you.

1021
01:15:52,086 --> 01:15:53,086
Show-off.

1022
01:16:00,126 --> 01:16:01,646
Be careful.

1023
01:16:06,765 --> 01:16:07,886
Thaen.

1024
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:10,769
Wait over there.

1025
01:16:11,086 --> 01:16:12,206
I'll take you here.

1026
01:16:20,878 --> 01:16:22,878
Trust me if you want to entrust your life to me.

1027
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:24,366
We'll survive then.

1028
01:16:24,502 --> 01:16:25,606
Watch out.

1029
01:16:53,878 --> 01:16:55,566
I want you to get to know your mom.

1030
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:58,630
The chance for you to stay with her

1031
01:16:59,006 --> 01:17:00,526
isn't easy to get.

1032
01:17:03,342 --> 01:17:05,547
She might feel awkward

1033
01:17:05,773 --> 01:17:07,286
and she might not want me to know.

1034
01:17:13,966 --> 01:17:16,766
But I want her to know that

1035
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,341
I'm ready to take care of you instead of her.

1036
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:21,446
She can relax then

1037
01:17:21,646 --> 01:17:23,326
if she wants to entrust your life to me.

1038
01:17:24,126 --> 01:17:25,926
She doesn't care about me that much.

1039
01:17:26,526 --> 01:17:27,779
Khim.

1040
01:17:29,414 --> 01:17:31,966
You're the one who doesn't care about her.

1041
01:17:33,293 --> 01:17:34,413
No.

1042
01:17:34,772 --> 01:17:36,246
Don't make that face.

1043
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:38,566
Come here.

1044
01:17:39,046 --> 01:17:40,686
You should smile.

1045
01:17:43,126 --> 01:17:44,686
They look lovey-dovey.

1046
01:17:45,341 --> 01:17:46,406
Thaen.

1047
01:17:47,526 --> 01:17:49,006
They're a show-off.

1048
01:17:49,715 --> 01:17:50,886
What?

1049
01:17:51,974 --> 01:17:53,486
I said the sunlight is strong.

1050
01:17:53,662 --> 01:17:54,942
I'm getting tired.

1051
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:59,046
Come here. Please endure it for a bit more.

1052
01:17:59,206 --> 01:18:00,766
Please do what my mom wants for now.

1053
01:18:03,046 --> 01:18:05,206
- Does it hurt? - Ouch.

1054
01:18:19,433 --> 01:18:21,566
- Try this coconut juice. - Thank you.

1055
01:18:26,181 --> 01:18:28,686
Can I ask you what you love about Ms. Khim?

1056
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,926
What are you asking? They're all embarrassed now.

1057
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:41,966
True love is when we fall in love with the same person over and over.

1058
01:18:42,982 --> 01:18:44,646
I feel like that with Khim.

1059
01:18:47,726 --> 01:18:49,126
What a cute couple.

1060
01:18:59,782 --> 01:19:02,689
Look. She has drunk all of the drink, but she still keeps drinking it.

1061
01:19:02,886 --> 01:19:06,966
I felt like she didn't pretend to keep her appearance when I first met her.

1062
01:19:07,406 --> 01:19:08,766
She looks real to me.

1063
01:19:08,926 --> 01:19:10,566
Whenever I think of that,

1064
01:19:10,742 --> 01:19:12,038
it made me smile.

1065
01:19:17,445 --> 01:19:19,246
No Disney's princess

1066
01:19:19,517 --> 01:19:22,046
would drink like that in front of a strange man.

1067
01:19:22,502 --> 01:19:24,926
Don't drink like this again. It isn't good.

1068
01:19:31,102 --> 01:19:33,606
I think Mr. Carl must feel the same way.

1069
01:19:35,766 --> 01:19:37,046
I don't think like that.

1070
01:19:37,214 --> 01:19:38,366
I don't like a gluttonous woman.

1071
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,900
I wasn't talking about that.

1072
01:19:41,126 --> 01:19:43,612
- I was talking... - I have no clue. I have a bad memory.

1073
01:20:01,172 --> 01:20:02,766
Where did you throw it?

1074
01:20:04,989 --> 01:20:05,989
Khim.

1075
01:20:07,589 --> 01:20:11,126
I know that you have everything.

1076
01:20:11,725 --> 01:20:16,286
But if you're frustrated and can't share something with anyone,

1077
01:20:16,494 --> 01:20:18,286
I want you to think of me.

1078
01:20:20,885 --> 01:20:24,166
Although I'm not the most important person in your life,

1079
01:20:25,126 --> 01:20:28,726
I'm ready to hear your problem, no matter how tough it is.

1080
01:20:29,005 --> 01:20:30,526
I'm ready to help you.

1081
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:41,406
Don't let your dad destroy your feelings.

1082
01:20:41,813 --> 01:20:44,046
If a man gets disappointed once,

1083
01:20:44,646 --> 01:20:46,926
he won't ask for love from anyone.

1084
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:49,686
He'll make everyone else feel hurt

1085
01:20:50,007 --> 01:20:52,886
to protect himself to not getting disappointed again.

1086
01:20:54,686 --> 01:20:55,926
A man like that,

1087
01:20:56,245 --> 01:20:59,246
he'll force us to feel guilty about everything

1088
01:21:00,566 --> 01:21:02,566
until we feel like we're not good enough.

1089
01:21:15,677 --> 01:21:19,302
I don't know what happened between you and him.

1090
01:21:20,686 --> 01:21:23,246
But I think it's good

1091
01:21:24,182 --> 01:21:26,406
that you're trying to keep your distance from him.

1092
01:21:30,154 --> 01:21:32,406
Do you know about our relationship?

1093
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:34,006
Carl...

1094
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:36,126
Carl is similar to your dad.

1095
01:21:37,406 --> 01:21:41,006
I know with a glance that he's hard to stay with. He likes to act tough.

1096
01:21:41,884 --> 01:21:43,766
He wasn't like this back then.

1097
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:46,150
Mr. Sin wasn't like this either.

1098
01:21:47,789 --> 01:21:49,326
But it's because of me.

1099
01:21:50,006 --> 01:21:52,366
Boys, you must be tired now.

1100
01:21:52,564 --> 01:21:55,046
Go take a shower and let's have dinner.

1101
01:21:55,895 --> 01:21:57,046
Yes.

1102
01:22:07,406 --> 01:22:10,006
Khim, I'm sorry

1103
01:22:10,157 --> 01:22:11,157
if...

1104
01:22:11,437 --> 01:22:13,926
I've ever made you feel bad with your dad.

1105
01:22:14,165 --> 01:22:18,806
He might become like this because I've disappointed him.

1106
01:22:49,246 --> 01:22:50,486
Thaen.

1107
01:22:50,845 --> 01:22:52,845
I brought your clothes.

1108
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:00,264
Where do you want me to put them?

1109
01:23:07,988 --> 01:23:11,286
Hey. Let me go. Are you crazy?

1110
01:23:13,663 --> 01:23:15,126
Did you want to flirt with your man?

1111
01:23:15,222 --> 01:23:16,382
I'm sorry.

1112
01:23:16,486 --> 01:23:17,726
You're mistaken.

1113
01:23:19,046 --> 01:23:20,846
What are you doing? Hey.

1114
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:23,646
Don't. No.

1115
01:23:26,683 --> 01:23:27,683
We're even

1116
01:23:27,957 --> 01:23:29,486
for what you did to me in the morning.

1117
01:23:37,469 --> 01:23:38,686
You overdid it.

1118
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:41,486
I'm all bruised.

1119
01:23:43,614 --> 01:23:44,726
Can you see them?

1120
01:23:58,086 --> 01:23:59,086
The wound...

1121
01:23:59,252 --> 01:24:00,406
They're all yours.

1122
01:24:01,557 --> 01:24:02,926
You're still asking me.

1123
01:24:03,381 --> 01:24:04,726
What do you mean?

1124
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:16,446
I'm sorry.

1125
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:19,206
Is Carl inside?

1126
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:29,910
You can relax and take a shower.

1127
01:24:30,067 --> 01:24:32,486
I can wash myself outside.

1128
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:40,846
There's no secret in this world.

1129
01:24:43,309 --> 01:24:44,709
Letting everyone know isn't that bad.

1130
01:24:45,606 --> 01:24:46,806
What did you say?

1131
01:24:56,126 --> 01:24:57,326
It's empty now.

1132
01:24:57,862 --> 01:24:59,326
You can go use it.

1133
01:25:00,566 --> 01:25:02,886
You might see something inside.

1134
01:25:17,382 --> 01:25:18,526
Khim.

1135
01:25:19,718 --> 01:25:21,086
What have you done?

1136
01:25:27,905 --> 01:25:31,326
The weather is too hot, so I just took a shower.

1137
01:25:31,765 --> 01:25:33,646
Why didn't you change first?

1138
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:42,846
Thaen, do you have any clothes left for me to change into?

1139
01:25:43,063 --> 01:25:44,366
Let's go find one.

1140
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,166
- Yes. - Let's go.

1141
01:25:59,334 --> 01:26:02,017
Then, I think we should eat them now.

1142
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:03,326
Yes.

1143
01:26:13,261 --> 01:26:16,086
How is it? Do you like it?

1144
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:20,086
- It's delicious. - This is a feast. There's also a feast for my eyes.

1145
01:26:21,548 --> 01:26:22,548
Pervert.

1146
01:26:23,927 --> 01:26:26,366
I was looking at the scenery. You dirty mind.

1147
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:28,166
Degenerate.

1148
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,886
Everything you said isn't nice to hear.

1149
01:26:34,168 --> 01:26:35,966
You should try this.

1150
01:26:36,086 --> 01:26:37,406
Don't be upset anymore.

1151
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:43,286
What a gluttonous woman.

1152
01:27:04,006 --> 01:27:06,446
- What's wrong? - It's spicy.

1153
01:27:06,527 --> 01:27:07,766
Are you alright?

1154
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:09,086
Is that so?

1155
01:27:09,566 --> 01:27:10,766
I'll bring water for you.

1156
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,686
- Yes. - You can drink this coconut milk curry.

1157
01:27:16,301 --> 01:27:17,406
Drink it for now.

1158
01:27:18,671 --> 01:27:20,470
Can that relieve the spiciness?

1159
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:22,806
Where did you learn it?

1160
01:27:28,222 --> 01:27:29,454
Coconut milk curry.

1161
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:33,406
You can use that to relieve it. Spicy chemicals will dissolve in fat.

1162
01:27:33,797 --> 01:27:35,446
Coconut milk can decrease the spiciness

1163
01:27:35,854 --> 01:27:38,006
and the burning in your mouth.

1164
01:27:38,173 --> 01:27:40,166
Let your wife take it.

1165
01:27:44,282 --> 01:27:46,409
Well...

1166
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:49,126
Well, well, this is bad.

1167
01:27:51,126 --> 01:27:55,046
I think everyone knows that coconut milk can relieve spiciness.

1168
01:27:57,054 --> 01:27:58,726
I also heard about that.

1169
01:27:59,789 --> 01:28:01,406
I also heard about that.

1170
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:04,046
We can find it if we search this on Google.

1171
01:28:04,726 --> 01:28:07,246
It really does help.

1172
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:08,606
See?

1173
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,486
For my daughter,

1174
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:08,646
I don't think 200 million baht is too much.

1175
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:11,126
Although Dad doesn't like it, I'll marry you.

1176
01:29:11,244 --> 01:29:13,526
I'll give you the last chance to prove yourself.

1177
01:29:13,813 --> 01:29:15,726
Destroy Saikhim's wedding.

1178
01:29:15,886 --> 01:29:17,286
This is your wife's stuff, right?

1179
01:29:17,446 --> 01:29:18,679
You're already married.

1180
01:29:18,766 --> 01:29:20,286
I caught his lie.

1181
01:29:20,396 --> 01:29:22,566
He also said he wouldn't divorce.

1182
01:29:22,686 --> 01:29:23,926
I'll divorce.

1183
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:26,966
I can't stand living in this world with this man.

1184
01:29:27,311 --> 01:29:29,311
Your life was almost ruined because of him.

1185
01:29:29,446 --> 01:29:32,006
You should get some marriage properties as compensation at least.

1186
01:29:32,126 --> 01:29:33,406
The new divorce contract

1187
01:29:33,614 --> 01:29:34,926
asking for marriage properties.

1188
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:37,022
She really wants to stoop so low.

1189
01:29:37,317 --> 01:29:38,686
Go call her to see me.

1190
01:29:38,854 --> 01:29:40,289
We have to end it by today.

1191
01:29:40,414 --> 01:29:41,726
It's only for a night

1192
01:29:42,149 --> 01:29:45,046
and you can stay with your man for the rest of your life. It's worth it.
