1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:01,046
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:02,127
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,206 --> 00:00:03,563
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:45,366
I want to see him again.

5
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:48,486
Are you hesitating because he saved your life?

6
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:51,486
I still owe him my life anyway.

7
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:53,366
Can you stay here for two more days?

8
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:54,806
Sure.

9
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:56,752
So, we can go deal with our divorce together.

10
00:02:56,869 --> 00:03:00,646
If you could choose, you probably didn't want me in your life.

11
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:03,486
If we could go back to become strangers again,

12
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,286
that would be nice.

13
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,806
After you're done with our divorce here,

14
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,726
submit it to Bangkok.

15
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:11,806
I'll wait to divorce over there.

16
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:14,966
Then, I would like to atone for my sin.

17
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:16,622
When we divorce,

18
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:17,966
I won't marry again.

19
00:03:18,102 --> 00:03:19,406
You're lying again.

20
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:21,572
You should make Claire become my bride.

21
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,806
I'll sign the document on that day.

22
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,326
(She's the one I used to love.)

23
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:28,206
(She's the one I tried to hate.)

24
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:30,606
(But even if I tried,)

25
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,246
(I couldn't hate her in the end.)

26
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:34,566
(As my mom said,)

27
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:37,166
(we could love someone,)

28
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,646
(but it might not be good to stay with them.)

29
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:42,486
(It's unfortunate that he was that person.)

30
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:50,126
I've unlocked every room.

31
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:51,566
You can look at all of them.

32
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:53,886
Yes. I'll finish in around half an hour.

33
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:55,566
When you're finished,

34
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:56,966
I'll come back to lock them up.

35
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:58,286
Thank you.

36
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,830
Oh, you're finally here.

37
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:12,326
I thought you might have given up, so the groom's name is still blank.

38
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:13,926
I can let Khim write it later

39
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:16,606
in case the groom suddenly changes.

40
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:21,486
I'm joking. I thought it would be funny.

41
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,406
I heard you gave your all

42
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,766
and gave everything for this event.

43
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,326
You also try to date a rich man for money.

44
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,846
Everyone wants the best thing for themselves.

45
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:39,326
Are you trying to upgrade yourself?

46
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:42,726
You got close to Promptpat to make him find clients for you.

47
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,766
I don't know who's actually deceiving whom.

48
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:54,494
Hello. Have you been waiting?

49
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:59,046
Wow. It's so pretty.

50
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:02,326
I knew I could recommend you to them.

51
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:05,646
When it's done, the real thing must come out better than this draft.

52
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:07,046
How was it?

53
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,966
Do you think your rich friends will like it?

54
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:12,806
I feel really good for him.

55
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,566
It's as pretty as the designer.

56
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:16,726
I'm telling if you work with me,

57
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:18,366
I like people who can pay a lot,

58
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:20,446
not those people who are only nice.

59
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,526
Those who are weak should go home.

60
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,606
We'll talk if you have money.

61
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:26,006
I like it.

62
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:27,366
These designs.

63
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,526
It's pretty good.

64
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:34,126
What was she thinking? How could she stay with a pervert?

65
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:36,486
Did she think he'll give her money for nothing?

66
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:47,166
Uh, hello?

67
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,109
Please check it for me.

68
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,486
Thank you.

69
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:54,086
You're still here? I thought you would quickly go to see Khim.

70
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:55,646
I'm still on a call.

71
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:00,486
Hey.

72
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,046
Is your work done for today?

73
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:06,526
No. There are more things left to check, so they can be fixed by tomorrow.

74
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:17,646
Do you think you'll be full just by being with a man?

75
00:06:19,765 --> 00:06:20,925
Let's go have a meal.

76
00:06:27,782 --> 00:06:29,686
It's your compensation for helping with my wedding.

77
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,326
Don't worry.

78
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,086
Really? Then, I'll order fancy foods.

79
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:36,446
What should I eat?

80
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:39,686
Grilled prawns? Foie gras? Or lobsters?

81
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:41,526
Eat them if you can.

82
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:43,726
Wait here for a moment.

83
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:46,086
I forgot my handbag inside. I'll be back.

84
00:06:52,214 --> 00:06:53,606
Khim is calling you.

85
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,246
We can go there together next time.

86
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:58,246
You should go see Khim. Don't keep her waiting.

87
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:25,646
How are you, Khim?

88
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:27,246
Are you feeling better?

89
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,846
I'm a lot better now.

90
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:33,286
And whose house is this?

91
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:38,086
This is a place where I come to rest.

92
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,806
You should come in.

93
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:49,126
Khim.

94
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,366
We should get married.

95
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,686
I asked for your hand from Uncle Sin,

96
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,126
and he already agreed to it.

97
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,326
And about...

98
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,486
Just forget it.

99
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,486
From now on, if you need something,

100
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:04,446
you must tell me everything.

101
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:05,857
I...

102
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:10,646
I just want to end my problem before telling you.

103
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:14,566
But it's really unexpected for me

104
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:16,676
that this will become such a big deal.

105
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,366
Do you know

106
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:21,566
that someone doesn't want to see us live happily?

107
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,966
We should live our lives happily to make them jealous.

108
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:36,966
Let's build a family with me.

109
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:40,686
Come on. Quick.

110
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,646
The food is here.

111
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:45,778
- Here. Quick. - Here you are.

112
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:48,686
Thanks. Thanks.

113
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,686
- Here you are. - Come on.

114
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:53,206
Take back this tray.

115
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:54,446
Place them slowly.

116
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:57,189
They look delicious.

117
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,166
Please eat a lot. We would like to treat you all today.

118
00:09:01,318 --> 00:09:03,046
Please visit us again if you like them.

119
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,280
Of course.

120
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:07,286
Here. Please eat them.

121
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:14,646
Uh, let me excuse myself for a moment.

122
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:22,446
(I called them, but no one came to open it.)

123
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:24,166
The front door is locked.

124
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:26,726
No one has answered my call either.

125
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,406
You can leave the food there.

126
00:09:28,717 --> 00:09:29,862
I'll call her myself.

127
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:31,326
Yes. Okay.

128
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:42,686
Help. Is anyone here?

129
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,526
(Thaenthai)

130
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,486
Is there anyone here? Help.

131
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,446
Did she fall unconscious from being hungry?

132
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:02,006
Help.

133
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:06,246
Khim, I have an urgent errand. I need to leave now.

134
00:10:06,342 --> 00:10:08,126
Is something the matter?

135
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:10,766
I'll call you about it later when I'm done.

136
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:13,206
- I'll excuse myself. - Yes.

137
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:14,806
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

138
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,526
Help. Is anyone here?

139
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:26,166
Help.

140
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:28,686
Help! Help!

141
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:30,964
- What's wrong? - I can't go out.

142
00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:33,278
I'm stuck here. Can you call someone for me?

143
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:36,126
Call someone? What's the number?

144
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,246
Zero, six, four, one, five, zero,

145
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:41,526
And?

146
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,846
- Six, five, seven, two. - Two?

147
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,566
Yes. Call my friend and tell them I'm stuck up here.

148
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:02,206
- What's going on? - Someone is stuck up there and can't come out.

149
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:10,606
- Lita. - Thaen.

150
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,566
Calm down. Don't worry, Lita.

151
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,149
Be careful. Hold on to them, Lita.

152
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:18,099
Lita, be careful.

153
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:22,926
Lita.

154
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:29,086
Close your eyes.

155
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,206
Don't be scared.

156
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:36,846
You're almost here.

157
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,566
I'm on the ground.

158
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:52,166
- Slowly. - I...

159
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,286
Are you alright? You're safe now.

160
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,606
Khim. Khim.

161
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,593
I almost died, Khim.

162
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,966
It's alright. You're safe now.

163
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,686
Are you okay?

164
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:14,886
Thaen.

165
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,726
How did you come here?

166
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:22,046
I just passed by here.

167
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,606
I can't remember anyone's number.

168
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,246
I only remember your number.

169
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,926
It's good that you called me.

170
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:33,886
I was stuck up there.

171
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:36,086
Why did they lock it?

172
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:40,526
Weren't you two together?

173
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:42,109
Well...

174
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:44,046
I...

175
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:48,326
Thaen had an urgent errand, but he passed by here, right?

176
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:50,126
Yes.

177
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:55,926
Drink a lot of water and go home.

178
00:12:57,661 --> 00:12:59,366
Did someone forget something?

179
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,406
I don't know. Probably a wrong delivery.

180
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:04,366
If we don't know whose it is, I'll throw it away.

181
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:15,286
Let's go have a meal.

182
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:19,086
Well...

183
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:21,437
It's your compensation for helping with my wedding.

184
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:23,006
Don't worry.

185
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:25,526
Really?

186
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:27,606
Then, I'll order fancy foods.

187
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,326
Thaen, we should drive Lita home.

188
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:48,366
I don't want her to go home alone.

189
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,086
As you wish, Khim.

190
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:52,846
Come here.

191
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:56,166
Khim, it's alright.

192
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:59,181
I'm alright. I can go back by myself.

193
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:01,206
Lita.

194
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:03,806
You should go back.

195
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,206
Thank you. I'm leaving.

196
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,566
She always acts tough.

197
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:17,686
Let's go.

198
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:37,526
Khim.

199
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:40,206
If you're worried about your divorce,

200
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:42,566
I'll recommend you a trustworthy lawyer.

201
00:14:42,686 --> 00:14:44,486
We already agreed that

202
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:46,486
he would submit our divorce first.

203
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,566
I'll go follow it up later.

204
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:50,366
But if he still plays a trick,

205
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:51,966
you can tell me.

206
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:57,966
- I really like this one. - Understood.

207
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,381
Hello, Ms. Khim.

208
00:15:03,608 --> 00:15:07,486
Claire came here to try on her event clothes. Please wait a moment.

209
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:09,966
- I'll excuse myself for a bit. - Yes.

210
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,646
Ms. Khim, are you alright now?

211
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,326
I'm alright now.

212
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:19,806
We haven't had a chance to talk.

213
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:22,366
I'm sorry for making this become a big deal.

214
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:27,606
Actually, I might be the one who has to apologize to you.

215
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:31,575
- About that... - We should forget it.

216
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:33,486
I don't want to care about it anymore.

217
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:38,126
I don't think I'll have a chance to congratulate you two.

218
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:41,966
Let me wish for your happiness right now.

219
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:44,806
I hope you'll be happy with your marriage life.

220
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:47,766
I don't think I'll have a chance to find true love like this.

221
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:51,806
Please protect it when you have a chance to see it.

222
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:00,166
I'll be back.

223
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:03,566
Ms. Claire, please wait.

224
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:09,286
I'm sorry for lying about the marriage.

225
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:12,406
But when I told you that we're through,

226
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:14,326
it wasn't a lie.

227
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,846
We're only connected via the law.

228
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,126
My four months

229
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:23,726
can't be compared with the several years you've loved each other.

230
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:25,286
You said you didn't love each other,

231
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:27,686
but you protected each other

232
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:29,446
and defended each other.

233
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:31,486
That's the one thing that hurt me.

234
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,166
For us,

235
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:35,326
when we start to lie,

236
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,126
we'll repeat it again and again.

237
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:39,286
If it all begins with lying to yourself,

238
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:42,006
you'll have to lie to countless people.

239
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:44,406
Please wait.

240
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,326
For everything I've said,

241
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:50,206
I know well enough

242
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:52,926
that Mr. Carl loves you.

243
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:56,886
When a paper is torn apart or crumpled,

244
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:59,213
it can't be the same again.

245
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:01,246
If there's a line left,

246
00:17:01,726 --> 00:17:03,606
I would rather tear it all apart.

247
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,766
I'll transfer out of my agency and won't come back again.

248
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:10,766
You and Carl

249
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:12,566
will never be in my life anymore.

250
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,726
Do you know about Ms. Claire?

251
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:03,286
She hasn't answered my call since I was at the farm.

252
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:05,926
You said you wanted to marry her quickly.

253
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,406
Why didn't you make up with her?

254
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:11,886
You're afraid you can't help with it?

255
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:13,446
No.

256
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,886
I'm just keeping my promise that I'll make you happy.

257
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:20,486
I learned that Ms. Claire will leave you for America.

258
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:22,646
I came here to tell you that.

259
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,566
So, you could make up with her in time.

260
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:31,526
Do you have a plan?

261
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:33,806
You said you would help me.

262
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:39,166
I can help you find a way to make up with her,

263
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:42,006
but you have to do the rest.

264
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:52,206
Khim, are you sure you're alright now?

265
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:54,606
Did the doctor allow you to come back to work?

266
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,886
If I don't come to work,

267
00:18:57,022 --> 00:18:59,286
I think I'll go crazy.

268
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:02,926
Think of it as preparing yourself to be a bride.

269
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:06,406
Sit down.

270
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,607
Let's choose a band for your wedding today.

271
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:13,566
I've prepared a list of available bands. Take a look.

272
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,326
- Here. - Thank you.

273
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:21,719
- Khim. - What?

274
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:24,646
Who is that woman?

275
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:28,566
A VIP guest.

276
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:32,526
She had moved overseas to live with her husband for 40 years.

277
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:35,966
But every year, they'll come back to Thailand together.

278
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:38,366
Her husband just passed away.

279
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:41,246
At first, we thought she wouldn't come back.

280
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:44,726
But in the end, she came back by herself.

281
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:49,366
We thought we shouldn't talk about her husband.

282
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,966
That's why you're taking good care of her.

283
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:56,854
We're trying to make her forget.

284
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,366
We don't want her to think of her husband.

285
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,086
Dying also makes the one who's alive suffer.

286
00:20:09,526 --> 00:20:10,926
Back then,

287
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:16,486
I also thought that it's painful that we're separated by death.

288
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:19,046
But now,

289
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,606
it's worse when we're separated even if we're all alive.

290
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,142
From strangers

291
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:26,326
to acquaintances,

292
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:28,166
to lovers.

293
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:33,686
But when everything will end by becoming strangers again,

294
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:37,646
it's so tough.

295
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:44,046
It's tough when you have to see him live happily with someone else.

296
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:51,366
What do I have to do to not feel anything?

297
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:55,806
It's your fault

298
00:20:55,957 --> 00:20:57,957
for trying to be his friend.

299
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,246
It's best if you just hate each other.

300
00:21:05,326 --> 00:21:08,583
Being friends with your ex is like living in hell.

301
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,766
Your so-called friend zone doesn't really exist.

302
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:15,406
Don't help him

303
00:21:15,997 --> 00:21:17,206
with his wedding.

304
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,477
But you should tell him

305
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:22,486
that you two should go your separate ways for the best.

306
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:29,806
You said you would keep your promise.

307
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:32,726
How would I know how to make up with your girlfriend?

308
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:35,886
This is something between the two of you.

309
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:39,246
I would never know what your girlfriend would like.

310
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:41,846
For example, when you fall in love with each other,

311
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,428
the place you like to go to,

312
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:46,686
or the song you like. This is something delicate.

313
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:48,526
I would never know that.

314
00:21:49,086 --> 00:21:50,406
You can ask me if you want to know.

315
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:53,006
You can't give up when you don't know anything.

316
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,886
I'll tell you our story.

317
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:01,645
We first met each other overseas.

318
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,326
Someone set up a blind date for us.

319
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:11,966
I don't want to know.

320
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:13,766
You said you wanted to see me happy.

321
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:17,286
But you don't want to listen to a nice story.

322
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:29,126
I let Claire choose the restaurant on that day.

323
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:32,286
Everything was going well except for one thing. Do you know what it is?

324
00:22:33,294 --> 00:22:34,526
I don't know.

325
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:35,766
My arm was broken.

326
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:42,366
And Claire chose a Japanese restaurant.

327
00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:44,206
How could I eat them?

328
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,246
I couldn't even lift up the chopsticks.

329
00:22:46,692 --> 00:22:48,006
I thought that was bad.

330
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:50,302
Why would I have to be this embarrassed?

331
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:52,766
Do you know what Claire did?

332
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,006
Here. I'll feed you.

333
00:23:03,366 --> 00:23:04,566
Is it hot?

334
00:23:09,157 --> 00:23:10,326
Is it better?

335
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:18,566
This is the first date that I've used my body the most.

336
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:20,766
This is my favorite one.

337
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:22,286
Please close your eyes.

338
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:23,766
Sure.

339
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,886
You should close your eyes and taste it.

340
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:29,806
Please guess what this is.

341
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:33,646
Don't open your eyes. Open your mouth.

342
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:40,766
What is it?

343
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,566
Delicious, right?

344
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,726
It's all noodles.

345
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:51,846
Because of that,

346
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:53,486
we didn't need to put on a mask.

347
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:57,166
I like that she wasn't acting or being stiff.

348
00:23:57,415 --> 00:23:59,415
I've fallen in love with her since then.

349
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:03,246
I've never seen someone that energetic.

350
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,733
When I'm with her,

351
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:06,726
everything can become fun.

352
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,206
That was probably the best date I've ever had.

353
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:15,286
A woman is sexy when she's playful like that.

354
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:25,526
You've probably never had that.

355
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,006
Never what?

356
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:30,206
I've never been sexy or playful or what?

357
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:31,806
What I meant was,

358
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,926
have you ever spoiled your boyfriend like this?

359
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,886
Eat it more then.

360
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:49,886
Let's share it.

361
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:53,046
We're in the same boat as well as our stomachs.

362
00:24:55,142 --> 00:24:56,166
You should eat it

363
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:57,446
until you're full.

364
00:24:58,126 --> 00:24:59,526
Why would I have never done that?

365
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,006
Stop being stiff

366
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,366
or else, a man won't feel anything when he's with you.

367
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:11,046
I'm not playful or sexy like your girlfriend.

368
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:30,043
Open your mouth.

369
00:25:31,016 --> 00:25:33,166
- Open what? - Try it.

370
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,806
I'll feed you.

371
00:25:34,957 --> 00:25:37,406
- No. - Such a boring woman like you,

372
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:39,214
can I really rely on you?

373
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:40,886
That's why I told you

374
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:43,206
that I was sorry.

375
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:45,126
I couldn't help you.

376
00:26:10,518 --> 00:26:11,646
How was it?

377
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:14,086
Does it taste better?

378
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:25,726
You don't need to act tough.

379
00:26:50,853 --> 00:26:52,046
You can't take that?

380
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:53,849
Why are you scared?

381
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,646
What's with him?

382
00:27:14,286 --> 00:27:15,446
The sauce is spicy.

383
00:27:15,846 --> 00:27:17,046
It'll burn your hand.

384
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:49,086
Let me see.

385
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:51,046
Is it better?

386
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,406
What are you doing? Trying to take advantage of me?

387
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:12,198
You caught on.

388
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,766
When we're together again,

389
00:28:18,494 --> 00:28:19,766
don't cross the line.

390
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:25,086
Think about it again

391
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:27,606
whether you can make up with her without me.

392
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,966
Actually, I just realized that there was one thing I still had with her.

393
00:28:33,477 --> 00:28:35,566
Claire likes my accommodation on the island,

394
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:37,646
but we haven't had a chance to go together.

395
00:28:38,606 --> 00:28:40,366
If I sell it to your boyfriend,

396
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:42,326
I can't go there.

397
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:44,726
Sell it to Thaen?

398
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,526
Here.

399
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:56,326
The six-star resort project that he wants to do with your dad.

400
00:28:57,909 --> 00:28:59,126
No way.

401
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:01,566
I want to sell it to him,

402
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:04,886
but Claire really likes this place, so I want to give it to her as a gift.

403
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:06,566
Do you think

404
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:08,886
- I should let Claire decide... - We'll talk later.

405
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:21,442
Thaen.

406
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:23,846
Did my dad invite you to do a project with us?

407
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:26,646
I only helped him find a new partner.

408
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,326
I didn't really help him.

409
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:36,046
I was thinking of taking you to get to know him.

410
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:37,606
All these times,

411
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:40,486
Dad has objected to our wedding.

412
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,086
Did he allow our wedding to happen because of this?

413
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:47,566
It's unrelated, Khim.

414
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:53,526
Is this the dowry that Dad is trying to take from you?

415
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,006
Dad wants to use this project to fight against Carl.

416
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:59,246
Dad wants to humiliate him.

417
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:00,646
And if that's the case,

418
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:02,126
how is it wrong?

419
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:04,886
Are you worried about him or what?

420
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,006
Thaen, don't you think that he's selling me for money?

421
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,926
So, our wedding

422
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:12,806
has become about interests.

423
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,806
But it's better than waiting for matrimonial properties from Carl.

424
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:17,366
If it's like that,

425
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,486
they'll say you're leeching off him.

426
00:30:20,046 --> 00:30:22,086
Are you also trying to win against him?

427
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:25,526
Since when did Carl become your rival?

428
00:30:25,838 --> 00:30:27,046
It's a men's problem.

429
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:28,886
You wouldn't understand.

430
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:36,286
You feel humiliated

431
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:38,246
because of my past, don't you?

432
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:40,806
Khim.

433
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,886
I think we shouldn't fight because of him.

434
00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:48,926
It's not because of him or because of anything.

435
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:50,446
Deep in your heart,

436
00:30:50,742 --> 00:30:51,846
it was me

437
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:53,806
who made you feel embarrassed.

438
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:55,646
Isn't that right?

439
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:10,357
Claire likes my accommodation on the island,

440
00:31:10,646 --> 00:31:12,606
but we haven't had a chance to go together.

441
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:15,406
If I sell it to your boyfriend,

442
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:17,166
I can't go there.

443
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:19,206
Sell it to Thaen?

444
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,686
Do you really want to use this extra time

445
00:31:28,238 --> 00:31:30,686
to gain her affection back after they break up?

446
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:34,206
I don't think love is easy as that.

447
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:35,574
What are you saying?

448
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,966
This isn't extra time.

449
00:31:38,293 --> 00:31:40,166
You're stalling for time.

450
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,326
You're changing your tactic at the last minute.

451
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:44,698
If she doesn't love you anymore,

452
00:31:44,877 --> 00:31:46,806
don't think that she'll come back.

453
00:31:47,517 --> 00:31:48,837
It'll be for nothing.

454
00:31:49,132 --> 00:31:50,206
Since it's come to this,

455
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,806
I'll score a golden goal for you.

456
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:55,126
Wow. Don't try to act tough with me.

457
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:58,366
I'm being serious. How many goals do you want?

458
00:32:03,157 --> 00:32:04,206
Khim.

459
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,246
Khim.

460
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:08,206
Khim, listen to me.

461
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:10,886
I've never been disgusted with you.

462
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,486
It's your right even if you're disgusted with me.

463
00:32:14,206 --> 00:32:16,526
I can't force your feelings.

464
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:19,046
I only want to continue your dream project.

465
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:22,764
I'll never let Uncle take this project away.

466
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:25,326
It'll only be yours.

467
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,726
I promise.

468
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,286
What can you do?

469
00:32:28,668 --> 00:32:30,886
You still don't even realize

470
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:32,566
that you're being used by Dad.

471
00:33:10,452 --> 00:33:12,086
Lifting.

472
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:14,686
Treading.

473
00:33:15,218 --> 00:33:16,886
Lifting.

474
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:18,846
Treading.

475
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:23,406
What's with her?

476
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:27,246
She said she's tired of this world. She probably met a new man.

477
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:30,326
I heard he's really religious.

478
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:32,486
Treading.

479
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:34,486
I'll excuse myself.

480
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:46,246
Lifting.

481
00:34:01,982 --> 00:34:03,926
So, are you trying to protect Khim

482
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:07,166
or working with Khim's dad to get back at her?

483
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:08,886
Who was the one who told me

484
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:11,366
that we have to play dirty when it's necessary?

485
00:34:12,598 --> 00:34:15,686
But this, you're using money to buy a woman.

486
00:34:20,814 --> 00:34:23,846
Or am I really too far gone?

487
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:26,446
Do you believe in karma?

488
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:31,566
It'll only take you to meet the one who's not destined for you.

489
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,646
Are you saying that I'm not good enough for Khim?

490
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:54,726
Pull yourself together

491
00:34:55,318 --> 00:34:57,486
and stop being obsessed with this.

492
00:34:57,686 --> 00:35:01,126
You've dated each other for this long. It's all up to you

493
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:03,286
whether you can keep her.

494
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:06,966
If you aren't compatible, it's hard for you to stay together.

495
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:08,766
Meeting and separation

496
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:10,886
are normal.

497
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:17,806
Where are you going?

498
00:35:21,734 --> 00:35:23,046
Wait, Lita.

499
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:30,686
- Where are you going? - I'm going to recover my heart.

500
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:33,046
Why?

501
00:35:36,494 --> 00:35:37,646
It's broken.

502
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:43,286
How many days are you going?

503
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:47,646
Who are you going with?

504
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:57,286
We'll see each other again when the time comes.

505
00:35:58,661 --> 00:36:00,566
Take care of yourself, Thaen.

506
00:36:39,246 --> 00:36:40,366
Lita.

507
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:43,526
Why did you take their stuff with you?

508
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:44,926
This?

509
00:36:46,207 --> 00:36:48,566
We sometimes need to play dirty.

510
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:24,246
(Lita)

511
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,326
Are you trying to go for seclusion?

512
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:41,966
Are you here to give me the invitation card?

513
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,806
I thought you wouldn't invite me at first.

514
00:37:50,326 --> 00:37:52,606
I'm jealous to see someone getting married.

515
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:55,326
Listen, you should visit me when you're free,

516
00:37:55,494 --> 00:37:56,991
I'll give you a face massage.

517
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,206
I assure you that your face will be smooth during the wedding.

518
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:03,806
Are you trying to find Lita?

519
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,606
Oh, she hasn't come back from the temple?

520
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,246
She won't come back this week.

521
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:09,766
Haven't you talked on the phone?

522
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:11,006
Well...

523
00:38:11,246 --> 00:38:12,606
I'm coming to give you the card,

524
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:14,806
so I thought I would run into her.

525
00:38:14,934 --> 00:38:18,326
She's been busy with her work recently. I haven't seen her for some time.

526
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:27,366
Hern. Do you remember him? You've met him before.

527
00:38:27,512 --> 00:38:28,702
I remember him.

528
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,086
Hello.

529
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:33,966
- I'll go back to fix the faucet. - Sure.

530
00:38:35,726 --> 00:38:38,526
Hern came here to fix the water pipe.

531
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:42,614
I'm starting to favor him when he's done this much.

532
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:49,093
Ms. Sajee, someone is calling. Can you answer it for me?

533
00:38:49,206 --> 00:38:50,926
I'm still busy here.

534
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:54,886
Where is it?

535
00:38:57,846 --> 00:38:59,357
It's here.

536
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:01,086
I couldn't find it.

537
00:39:02,194 --> 00:39:05,446
- It's Lita. - Tell her that I haven't finished yet.

538
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:07,766
Hello?

539
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:09,446
It's your mom.

540
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:11,366
(Did he come to fix it?)

541
00:39:12,494 --> 00:39:15,006
He immediately came when he knew about it.

542
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,958
He's afraid I would lose my customers.

543
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,846
You have to treat him to a meal.

544
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,766
Not only treating him,

545
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:25,319
I think I'll give him my daughter.

546
00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:31,406
Hey.

547
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:34,166
Don't be too impatient or the prey will realize the truth.

548
00:39:35,095 --> 00:39:37,966
I thought I'll let you marry at the same time as Khim.

549
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:42,326
Thaenthai came here to give me the wedding card.

550
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,646
- Thaen is at the salon? - (Yes.)

551
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:48,926
Oh, he has already gone back.

552
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:53,686
I think he's afraid people will see him coming to visit another woman.

553
00:39:53,798 --> 00:39:56,046
(He's already disappeared. It's strange.)

554
00:39:56,348 --> 00:39:59,446
He doesn't love her, but he's trying to keep her with him.

555
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,886
(A man who believes that he can choose anyone,)

556
00:40:02,022 --> 00:40:03,246
I think

557
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:05,446
he's actually a playboy.

558
00:40:06,557 --> 00:40:07,806
Don't you think so?

559
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:27,126
What's wrong?

560
00:40:27,982 --> 00:40:29,046
I found out that

561
00:40:29,246 --> 00:40:31,606
Ms. Claire's flight is next Tuesday.

562
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:33,133
(We don't have time.)

563
00:40:33,317 --> 00:40:35,317
You have to hold off your girlfriend.

564
00:40:36,676 --> 00:40:38,095
What can you do in three days?

565
00:40:38,221 --> 00:40:39,886
Tell me what your plan is.

566
00:40:40,966 --> 00:40:44,286
I'll set it so that you can make up with her on the island as you asked.

567
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:46,326
(I've prepared Ms. Claire's work.)

568
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,126
This is your last chance for your wish to come true.

569
00:40:49,966 --> 00:40:53,046
You only need to bring your body and follow my plan.

570
00:41:00,086 --> 00:41:02,726
(I'll tell Ms. Claire that she'll give a review for an item.)

571
00:41:03,149 --> 00:41:04,606
(You'll standby at the house.)

572
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:07,286
(The staff will find a chance to let you surprise her.)

573
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:10,126
(You'll make up with her at that time.)

574
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:14,006
(You can talk about your pasts or anything.)

575
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:16,686
(But this is the most that I can help you with.)

576
00:41:17,037 --> 00:41:19,726
(For the rest, you have to open her heart by yourself.)

577
00:41:20,006 --> 00:41:21,526
(If you really love her,)

578
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:24,126
(you have to show your sincerity to her.)

579
00:41:24,454 --> 00:41:27,766
(So, you must be yourself.)

580
00:41:29,063 --> 00:41:31,446
(Can you really see me become another woman's man?)

581
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:50,286
(I don't know if heaven really exists,)

582
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:52,966
(but I want to send it anyway.)

583
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,566
(I want you to know)

584
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:57,766
(that I can still remember you.)

585
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:03,126
(Seven years)

586
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,486
(up there,)

587
00:42:06,726 --> 00:42:09,086
(it might just be a second.)

588
00:42:13,606 --> 00:42:15,006
(They say)

589
00:42:15,854 --> 00:42:18,686
(some people live in our hearts more than we live together.)

590
00:42:19,486 --> 00:42:21,926
(I just understood it today.)

591
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,486
(Those four months)

592
00:42:25,366 --> 00:42:27,406
(have changed my life till today.)

593
00:42:28,726 --> 00:42:30,946
(I want to ask you)

594
00:42:35,246 --> 00:42:37,606
(if there's one thing that we can change in our lives,)

595
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:41,006
(would you change it so that we haven't met each other?)

596
00:42:44,926 --> 00:42:48,566
(I want to know if your answer will be the same as mine.)

597
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,686
How is he?

598
00:43:23,973 --> 00:43:25,046
Is everything alright?

599
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:26,606
Kla wants a ring.

600
00:43:26,775 --> 00:43:29,086
- What ring? - A wedding ring.

601
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:32,166
Kla will propose to Claire at this place today.

602
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:35,406
How is it related to me?

603
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:37,766
You still ask me that?

604
00:43:37,926 --> 00:43:40,606
Is it not your duty to get everything?

605
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:41,806
Wait.

606
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:44,286
A wedding ring is the groom's duty.

607
00:43:44,509 --> 00:43:46,686
I don't know. Go handle it for him.

608
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:50,486
Are you crazy? He wants me to choose a wedding ring?

609
00:43:50,646 --> 00:43:51,806
Yes.

610
00:43:53,302 --> 00:43:55,566
It'll be over if he doesn't have a ring.

611
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:58,646
(You have to find a wedding ring for Kla.)

612
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,006
If you don't give him that,

613
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:02,735
it'll mean that you want to ruin his wedding.

614
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:05,566
(I'll stall for time)

615
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:06,966
(The helicopter will pick you up.)

616
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:09,006
If this plan is ruined because of your carelessness,

617
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:10,646
you have to take responsibility.

618
00:44:17,327 --> 00:44:18,926
How was it? Will she come?

619
00:44:19,669 --> 00:44:22,606
I'm curious what Kla will do this time.

620
00:44:23,246 --> 00:44:25,486
He is probably planning

621
00:44:25,686 --> 00:44:27,206
to make Khim see something painful.

622
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:31,966
This is probably the best way to get back at her.

623
00:44:46,966 --> 00:44:48,886
Hey, just take it.

624
00:44:49,126 --> 00:44:51,046
Just give it to Kla yourself.

625
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:53,886
You said you're in a hurry. It's almost evening.

626
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:57,126
If you stall for more time, Ms. Claire will get suspicious. Take it.

627
00:44:57,207 --> 00:44:59,566
If you're in a hurry, go give it to Kla over there.

628
00:45:02,647 --> 00:45:03,942
That's Ms. Claire.

629
00:45:04,892 --> 00:45:05,944
What are they doing?

630
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:08,246
Kla has a way to read Claire's mind

631
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,661
by making Claire write what her wish is on that sky lantern.

632
00:45:10,926 --> 00:45:12,846
He'll use her wish

633
00:45:13,532 --> 00:45:15,086
to propose to her.

634
00:45:15,614 --> 00:45:16,886
Romantic, right?

635
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:19,966
It feels like destiny,

636
00:45:20,446 --> 00:45:23,166
but Kla has come up with everything.

637
00:45:23,981 --> 00:45:26,513
You'll get nothing from making a wish with that sky lantern.

638
00:45:26,918 --> 00:45:27,966
Loser.

639
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:30,446
It can't be compared to a man on the ground called Kaokla.

640
00:45:30,982 --> 00:45:32,486
He cheated his death once.

641
00:45:59,181 --> 00:46:00,326
You're here.

642
00:46:02,428 --> 00:46:03,766
Your plan is so complex.

643
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:06,286
If you can come up with this,

644
00:46:06,581 --> 00:46:07,846
why didn't you do it yourself?

645
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:09,526
Something like this needs a heart.

646
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:12,806
You cut corners with this plan because you're jealous of Claire, right?

647
00:46:13,766 --> 00:46:15,006
I'm not jealous.

648
00:46:15,229 --> 00:46:16,686
I can only come up with this much.

649
00:46:16,964 --> 00:46:18,293
If you're so good,

650
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,846
you should do it yourself. You didn't have to use me.

651
00:46:22,926 --> 00:46:24,326
Is this your style?

652
00:46:29,526 --> 00:46:31,986
I was in a hurry. I had to get what I could.

653
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:33,526
If I'm dumped today,

654
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,206
I don't need to pay, right?

655
00:46:38,646 --> 00:46:40,326
When we were married,

656
00:46:40,566 --> 00:46:42,366
you hadn't done this much.

657
00:46:42,757 --> 00:46:45,646
If you do this much, Claire must feel touched.

658
00:46:45,981 --> 00:46:48,046
Other women might not be as easy as you.

659
00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:52,966
I don't care. If I'm dumped today, you have to postpone your wedding.

660
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:54,446
Why?

661
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:57,006
Who was the one who said she would wait for my happiness?

662
00:46:57,757 --> 00:46:59,246
You have to wait for the result with me.

663
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:02,046
No.

664
00:47:02,494 --> 00:47:03,886
If your wish comes true,

665
00:47:04,061 --> 00:47:05,606
you'll never see me again.

666
00:47:05,964 --> 00:47:07,766
Since you want to see me happy,

667
00:47:08,365 --> 00:47:10,446
you should stay with me until the end.

668
00:47:10,773 --> 00:47:12,407
We've shared our suffering.

669
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:14,286
We should share happiness too.

670
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,526
I have my appointment.

671
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:20,366
What kind of friends would leave her friend at this moment?

672
00:47:20,606 --> 00:47:22,926
Please show your dignity as my ex-girlfriend.

673
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:44,886
Do you have to be this serious?

674
00:47:47,402 --> 00:47:50,486
We're done for today. Thank you so much.

675
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:51,894
Thank you.

676
00:47:55,293 --> 00:47:57,886
- Let's go back. - It's pretty.

677
00:47:59,074 --> 00:48:00,074
Yes.

678
00:48:07,057 --> 00:48:09,446
- I'm leaving. - Yes. Goodbye.

679
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:20,006
Claire is still lonely. We need to make her feel lonelier.

680
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:21,886
Give me your phone.

681
00:48:34,951 --> 00:48:38,246
(I want you to be here with me.)

682
00:48:49,744 --> 00:48:55,526
(I want you to be here with me.)

683
00:49:03,118 --> 00:49:04,126
We've succeeded.

684
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,006
Claire is thinking of you, Kla.

685
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:17,246
You're really serious.

686
00:49:18,245 --> 00:49:20,286
If you really did your homework,

687
00:49:20,597 --> 00:49:22,706
you would know what kind of a woman Claire is.

688
00:49:23,038 --> 00:49:24,726
You know me well.

689
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,326
Go to the bridge.

690
00:49:41,157 --> 00:49:43,446
Ms. Claire, the boat is ready.

691
00:49:48,366 --> 00:49:49,886
If it's this much,

692
00:49:50,486 --> 00:49:52,486
I can never come up with anything like this.

693
00:49:52,837 --> 00:49:53,966
Of course.

694
00:50:04,638 --> 00:50:06,526
Being alone.

695
00:50:06,726 --> 00:50:11,921
It's meaningless what you will do.

696
00:53:44,526 --> 00:53:45,726
Kla will go in.

697
00:54:07,342 --> 00:54:10,206
I could finally take you here as I promised.

698
00:54:13,276 --> 00:54:16,166
He wouldn't do this much if he doesn't love her.

699
00:54:17,526 --> 00:54:20,126
Kla finally found someone good.

700
00:54:29,037 --> 00:54:30,046
Hey.

701
00:54:30,158 --> 00:54:31,686
Are they all under your order?

702
00:54:32,948 --> 00:54:35,646
They're all from Arsa. We haven't paid any money.

703
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:37,526
To make someone's wish become true,

704
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:39,309
anyone would want to help with it.

705
00:54:40,156 --> 00:54:42,406
I'm happy for both of them.

706
00:54:42,711 --> 00:54:44,366
When the right one

707
00:54:44,678 --> 00:54:46,846
comes in at the right time,

708
00:54:47,486 --> 00:54:49,326
that's what they call soulmates.

709
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:55,046
We can meet a fake soulmate whenever we want.

710
00:54:55,413 --> 00:54:56,813
But true soulmates,

711
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:59,726
we can only meet them at the right time.

712
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:07,526
Is this your island?

713
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:10,686
It's really pretty.

714
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,566
I'm sorry that it took me this long.

715
00:55:13,172 --> 00:55:15,486
I should have brought you here way earlier.

716
00:55:20,686 --> 00:55:22,686
No matter how pretty this place is,

717
00:55:23,446 --> 00:55:25,126
it can't stop me anymore.

718
00:55:25,486 --> 00:55:27,406
Are you really going back?

719
00:55:27,926 --> 00:55:30,006
I've been wondering for the past several days.

720
00:55:30,406 --> 00:55:32,846
Which one will receive more love from a man?

721
00:55:33,046 --> 00:55:34,886
His first love or his last love.

722
00:55:35,326 --> 00:55:37,086
Can you answer me?

723
00:55:37,684 --> 00:55:39,086
For you,

724
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:41,006
who is more important?

725
00:55:51,846 --> 00:55:53,086
I'm sorry

726
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,646
for making you sad.

727
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,846
If you don't leave your past,

728
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:00,806
you'll never get to start from one with anyone.

729
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:03,566
I thought you would make me forget her.

730
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,766
I tried, but I couldn't do it.

731
00:56:07,486 --> 00:56:09,126
Then, you should go back.

732
00:56:09,806 --> 00:56:11,726
You shouldn't date me to mock her.

733
00:56:18,246 --> 00:56:20,046
You saw me as a tool.

734
00:56:20,302 --> 00:56:21,886
You didn't want to keep me.

735
00:56:22,294 --> 00:56:23,486
I realize now

736
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:25,886
that I wasn't your first love

737
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:28,006
or even your last love.

738
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:32,046
Because you only have Ms. Khim as your only love all this time.

739
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,286
You've never forgotten about her.

740
00:56:36,134 --> 00:56:37,446
She hurt me.

741
00:56:38,326 --> 00:56:40,686
I thought time would cure everything.

742
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:43,326
I thought my heart had already stopped beating.

743
00:56:44,726 --> 00:56:46,606
I only realized it's still beating

744
00:56:47,456 --> 00:56:49,006
when I met her again.

745
00:56:51,206 --> 00:56:54,166
No woman has ever made my heart beat as strongly as her.

746
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:06,806
You didn't want to forget her.

747
00:57:08,205 --> 00:57:10,686
You're the one who didn't want her to marry again.

748
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:12,829
Even if you didn't get her back,

749
00:57:13,461 --> 00:57:15,526
you would never let her go to anyone.

750
00:57:17,966 --> 00:57:19,086
You're...

751
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:21,406
You're selfish.

752
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,726
I know that.

753
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:25,446
That's why I tried to end everything.

754
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:40,166
He's kneeling. Did he give her the ring?

755
00:57:53,328 --> 00:57:54,606
I'm sorry, Claire.

756
00:57:56,558 --> 00:57:57,806
Of course.

757
00:57:58,486 --> 00:58:01,086
You can't live for your revenge forever.

758
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:05,766
Thank you for showing at least some sincerity to me,

759
00:58:07,886 --> 00:58:09,886
even though this is the final day.

760
00:58:12,446 --> 00:58:14,526
I hope your wish will come true

761
00:58:15,966 --> 00:58:18,406
to make you know how to love again.

762
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:26,222
Goodbye.

763
00:58:37,031 --> 00:58:38,646
I'm sorry, Claire.

764
00:59:41,614 --> 00:59:42,934
Why is it like this?

765
00:59:47,438 --> 00:59:48,686
Kla, what happened?

766
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:50,646
- Where is Khim? - She's already left.

767
00:59:51,029 --> 00:59:53,406
How could she leave? I told you to keep her here.

768
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:58,386
Khem.

769
00:59:59,174 --> 01:00:00,366
Crying?

770
01:00:00,741 --> 01:00:02,086
Don't let her go back.

771
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:03,526
I'm going there.

772
01:00:04,365 --> 01:00:06,525
Kla, Khim is at the helipad.

773
01:00:11,966 --> 01:00:13,086
Khem.

774
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,366
She couldn't accept it when she saw you were going to marry.

775
01:00:16,526 --> 01:00:18,366
Where could she be on this small island?

776
01:00:18,678 --> 01:00:20,206
She's probably gone back.

777
01:00:21,366 --> 01:00:22,486
Wait!

778
01:00:23,629 --> 01:00:25,466
Don't go! Khim!

779
01:00:34,246 --> 01:00:35,446
Khim.

780
01:00:40,686 --> 01:00:42,126
What are you doing here?

781
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:44,406
Why are you crying?

782
01:00:45,158 --> 01:00:46,446
Don't come near me.

783
01:00:47,197 --> 01:00:48,646
Isn't it because you're heartbroken?

784
01:00:49,269 --> 01:00:50,446
No.

785
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,646
You can't accept it?

786
01:00:55,566 --> 01:00:57,446
I told you I wasn't crying.

787
01:00:59,453 --> 01:01:01,006
Why did you have to hide it then?

788
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:04,366
Look at me.

789
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:15,046
Tell me if it hurts.

790
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:18,526
It doesn't hurt.

791
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:21,046
I wasn't hurt. I'm just too happy.

792
01:01:21,397 --> 01:01:22,686
Stop acting tough.

793
01:01:24,246 --> 01:01:25,646
Just say that you're jealous.

794
01:01:26,918 --> 01:01:28,366
We still can talk now.

795
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:32,646
Tell me if you don't want it to end.

796
01:01:36,733 --> 01:01:38,366
We can still go back.

797
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,646
If we still love each other,

798
01:01:41,957 --> 01:01:43,446
we can start again.

799
01:01:49,366 --> 01:01:50,406
Enough.

800
01:01:51,246 --> 01:01:52,846
What are you saying?

801
01:01:54,334 --> 01:01:56,446
What about Claire? What are you playing at?

802
01:01:56,566 --> 01:01:59,446
Playing what? Why did you have to lie to yourself?

803
01:02:01,405 --> 01:02:02,926
Why didn't you say that it hurt?

804
01:02:03,685 --> 01:02:04,845
Say it.

805
01:02:05,116 --> 01:02:07,166
Say it. Say it out.

806
01:02:08,446 --> 01:02:09,606
Yes.

807
01:02:10,502 --> 01:02:11,686
It hurts.

808
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,286
I lost. I regret it.

809
01:02:14,392 --> 01:02:17,366
I don't know why I'm crying. I can't stop myself.

810
01:02:24,646 --> 01:02:26,246
If you're already satisfied,

811
01:02:26,398 --> 01:02:28,006
you should stop.

812
01:02:30,526 --> 01:02:32,126
If you're happy now,

813
01:02:32,606 --> 01:02:33,966
don't come to mock me again.

814
01:02:43,406 --> 01:02:45,406
If you still want to be my friend,

815
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:49,446
you have to stop playing with my feelings.

816
01:02:51,126 --> 01:02:53,366
Or else, we couldn't even be friends.

817
01:03:14,006 --> 01:03:17,166
You can't accept this because we still love each other, Khim!

818
01:03:41,646 --> 01:03:42,886
Khim.

819
01:03:44,526 --> 01:03:46,046
Who made you cry?

820
01:03:46,646 --> 01:03:47,966
Is it Kaokla again?

821
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,719
It's over, Lita.

822
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:10,206
He's getting married.

823
01:04:11,901 --> 01:04:15,526
I thought I could accept it, but I couldn't breathe.

824
01:04:19,653 --> 01:04:22,006
I feel like when I thought he was dead.

825
01:04:22,903 --> 01:04:24,366
But this time,

826
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:27,486
it's like we're dying even though we can still see each other's faces.

827
01:04:28,126 --> 01:04:29,566
So...

828
01:04:29,822 --> 01:04:31,686
Do you still love him?

829
01:04:46,677 --> 01:04:47,926
Do you know

830
01:04:49,174 --> 01:04:52,886
what's the difference between lovers and ex-lovers?

831
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:55,566
When we're in love,

832
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:58,926
we'll only think of the good things we've done together.

833
01:05:00,046 --> 01:05:01,526
When the love is gone,

834
01:05:03,757 --> 01:05:05,986
we'll only see each other's flaws

835
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,206
and try to blame each other.

836
01:05:13,255 --> 01:05:15,486
You should ask yourself

837
01:05:15,919 --> 01:05:17,566
how you see him.

838
01:05:23,438 --> 01:05:25,366
(Carl really has an issue when it comes to children.)

839
01:05:26,126 --> 01:05:27,726
(Whenever he sees a child,)

840
01:05:28,526 --> 01:05:30,886
(he'll always go to help or protect them.)

841
01:05:31,366 --> 01:05:34,766
(It's like he wants to compensate for his role as a father.)

842
01:05:36,846 --> 01:05:37,966
Khim.

843
01:05:39,766 --> 01:05:41,126
Wake up, Khim.

844
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,726
You can't run away from me like this.

845
01:05:44,064 --> 01:05:45,206
Khim, can you hear me?

846
01:05:45,366 --> 01:05:46,686
I've been waiting.

847
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:49,486
You can't leave me like this, Khim.

848
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:57,566
I tried to force myself to do that, but I couldn't do it.

849
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:03,086
I can only see his good attributes.

850
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,006
Even if he was mean,

851
01:06:11,126 --> 01:06:14,606
it might be because I made him become like that.

852
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:49,726
What did you tell Khim to do?

853
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:57,126
What did she tell you?

854
01:06:57,437 --> 01:06:59,206
You're getting married to another woman.

855
01:06:59,678 --> 01:07:02,366
Why didn't you let her go? Why do you act like you're her friend?

856
01:07:02,653 --> 01:07:04,726
The one who wanted that first was her.

857
01:07:05,301 --> 01:07:06,526
She hasn't realized

858
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:08,701
that she can't act like a friend.

859
01:07:11,046 --> 01:07:12,886
Stop your psychological warfare.

860
01:07:13,046 --> 01:07:15,566
We've gone through some bad stuff just like you.

861
01:07:17,405 --> 01:07:18,565
For Khim,

862
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:21,486
she didn't even need to atone for her sin

863
01:07:22,782 --> 01:07:25,126
because she's never abandoned you.

864
01:07:26,397 --> 01:07:29,166
That breakup letter was faked by someone.

865
01:07:30,766 --> 01:07:32,566
That refusal of medical care,

866
01:07:32,686 --> 01:07:34,206
Khim didn't sign that either.

867
01:07:35,714 --> 01:07:38,846
Why does Khim have to atone for this karma?

868
01:07:40,086 --> 01:07:41,286
It's me

869
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:44,106
who caused you two to break up.

870
01:07:44,918 --> 01:07:46,366
Why don't you take it out on me?

871
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:50,126
(Khim has never wanted to divorce you.)

872
01:07:50,926 --> 01:07:53,086
(She wanted to wait for you to come out of prison.)

873
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:57,126
(But Khim's dad wanted to get rid of you from her life.)

874
01:07:57,571 --> 01:07:59,366
(I admitted that back then,)

875
01:07:59,694 --> 01:08:01,806
(I thought you weren't suitable for her at all.)

876
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:04,126
(So, I worked together with Khim's dad.)

877
01:08:04,335 --> 01:08:06,218
(When she thought you didn't love her...)

878
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:12,286
(When you were in a coma,)

879
01:08:12,813 --> 01:08:15,806
(Khim's dad was the one who faked Khim's signature)

880
01:08:16,485 --> 01:08:18,926
(to stop the doctor from saving your life.)

881
01:08:22,086 --> 01:08:25,166
(Khim just learned about that when you showed her the document.)

882
01:08:25,742 --> 01:08:28,046
(Khim has never wanted to eliminate you.)

883
01:08:29,509 --> 01:08:32,446
(She's only atoned for what her dad has done.)

884
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,886
(She's really sad)

885
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:41,406
(when she knows she's dead to you.)

886
01:08:47,646 --> 01:08:49,566
(Khim is also the victim.)

887
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:52,766
(But she has never asked anyone to atone for her.)

888
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:56,006
(She also blamed herself)

889
01:08:56,836 --> 01:08:58,318
(that she ruined everything)

890
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,934
(even when everything)

891
01:09:01,854 --> 01:09:03,566
was all my fault.

892
01:09:04,118 --> 01:09:05,846
Khim has never told you

893
01:09:06,126 --> 01:09:07,526
that I did it, right?

894
01:09:07,846 --> 01:09:09,577
Where is the real letter?

895
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:10,926
I don't know.

896
01:09:12,612 --> 01:09:14,366
But Khim thought Prompt took it.

897
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,206
Khim has never stopped loving you.

898
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:21,646
If this can be the last chance

899
01:09:22,182 --> 01:09:24,446
to make you and Khim love each other again,

900
01:09:24,997 --> 01:09:26,126
grab it.

901
01:09:27,046 --> 01:09:29,406
But if you're getting married soon,

902
01:09:29,813 --> 01:09:31,486
please let Saikhim go.

903
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,526
Don't torture her

904
01:09:33,726 --> 01:09:35,606
with the marriage certificate again.

905
01:09:45,086 --> 01:09:46,544
Tell me if you don't want it to end.

906
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:52,446
We can still go back.

907
01:09:53,286 --> 01:09:54,566
If we still love each other,

908
01:09:54,822 --> 01:09:56,206
we can start again.

909
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:06,406
Why did you have to lie to yourself?

910
01:10:08,077 --> 01:10:09,526
Why didn't you say that it hurt?

911
01:10:10,565 --> 01:10:11,846
Say it.

912
01:10:12,332 --> 01:10:13,446
Say it.

913
01:10:14,525 --> 01:10:15,526
Yes.

914
01:10:16,406 --> 01:10:17,646
It hurts.

915
01:10:17,886 --> 01:10:20,226
I lost. I regret it.

916
01:10:20,446 --> 01:10:23,486
I don't know why I'm crying. I can't stop myself.

917
01:10:30,742 --> 01:10:34,006
If you're already satisfied, you should stop.

918
01:10:36,662 --> 01:10:38,406
If you're happy now,

919
01:10:38,732 --> 01:10:40,246
don't come to mock me again.

920
01:11:07,572 --> 01:11:09,566
(Everyone is paying attention to this news.)

921
01:11:09,694 --> 01:11:12,046
(The startup company, Minimalist,)

922
01:11:12,173 --> 01:11:14,726
(announced that they would separate itself from Argo.)

923
01:11:14,878 --> 01:11:18,366
(That might affect Argo's entering of the share market.)

924
01:11:32,566 --> 01:11:33,766
If he isn't here anymore,

925
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:37,486
would you come back?

926
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:39,966
You can take your company back.

927
01:11:41,446 --> 01:11:42,926
I only want Nate.

928
01:11:43,403 --> 01:11:44,566
I don't want the inheritance.

929
01:11:44,821 --> 01:11:47,446
But you're the last heir of our family.

930
01:11:49,246 --> 01:11:50,966
I've never seen you as my family.

931
01:11:52,206 --> 01:11:54,524
I only saw him as my family.

932
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:58,590
I'll use the remaining time with him.

933
01:11:59,063 --> 01:12:02,006
If he wants to leave, I'll let him go.

934
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,486
But it has to be his own decision.

935
01:12:05,086 --> 01:12:07,646
As for you, we aren't related.

936
01:12:08,766 --> 01:12:10,526
I'm only your legal stepson.

937
01:12:11,109 --> 01:12:12,446
We'll go our separate ways.

938
01:12:12,821 --> 01:12:15,246
I know you can live without relying on me.

939
01:12:37,428 --> 01:12:38,568
Thank you.

940
01:12:48,726 --> 01:12:49,886
What's this?

941
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,006
Why are those two together?

942
01:13:15,286 --> 01:13:16,446
I'm sorry.

943
01:13:21,086 --> 01:13:22,446
What are you doing?

944
01:13:22,956 --> 01:13:25,517
I saw Ms. Asia talking with your wife's relative.

945
01:13:26,126 --> 01:13:27,286
Come here if you don't believe me.

946
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:31,326
Where have they gone?

947
01:13:33,256 --> 01:13:35,256
They realized that you were watching them.

948
01:13:35,566 --> 01:13:37,086
Something is up, isn't it?

949
01:13:37,861 --> 01:13:39,181
Why else would they run away?

950
01:13:49,726 --> 01:13:51,446
We haven't had a chance to talk

951
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:54,366
since the last time we met each other.

952
01:13:54,773 --> 01:13:57,766
I heard a lot of things had happened.

953
01:14:01,206 --> 01:14:04,126
And both of them still haven't divorced.

954
01:14:04,546 --> 01:14:06,086
The last accident

955
01:14:06,278 --> 01:14:08,646
made them sympathize with each other.

956
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:12,646
I'm worried Carl will deceive you again and again.

957
01:14:18,471 --> 01:14:20,846
Thank you for worrying about me.

958
01:14:21,112 --> 01:14:23,406
If you want to get rid of both of them,

959
01:14:24,613 --> 01:14:26,005
you have to use other people.

960
01:14:27,205 --> 01:14:28,726
I don't like to fight,

961
01:14:29,037 --> 01:14:30,237
especially with you.

962
01:14:31,046 --> 01:14:32,166
What do you mean?

963
01:14:32,269 --> 01:14:35,061
Do you think I don't know you're doing this because you're jealous?

964
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:36,966
You adopted him as your son,

965
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:39,086
but you tied him down so he can't have anyone.

966
01:14:39,622 --> 01:14:41,165
When did I do that?

967
01:14:41,254 --> 01:14:43,526
What kind of a mother would take a selfie on her bed for her son?

968
01:14:43,702 --> 01:14:45,126
Carl didn't think of you like that.

969
01:14:45,502 --> 01:14:47,046
He's really uncomfortable.

970
01:14:47,205 --> 01:14:48,637
Are you sure?

971
01:14:49,142 --> 01:14:51,806
Have you seen us being together even once?

972
01:14:52,566 --> 01:14:55,286
Carl was being considerate. He didn't want to make you feel ashamed.

973
01:14:55,606 --> 01:14:58,206
I didn't have to be jealous of you and Carl.

974
01:14:58,406 --> 01:15:00,406
I should be jealous of Saikhim.

975
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,406
Bringing another woman to mock you

976
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:04,526
isn't as satisfying as

977
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:07,006
bringing your sister to mock you.

978
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:08,926
What are you saying?

979
01:15:09,012 --> 01:15:10,926
He intentionally got close to you

980
01:15:11,126 --> 01:15:12,806
to use you to get back at Saikhim

981
01:15:13,286 --> 01:15:16,206
because you and Saikhim have the same mother.

982
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,590
No.

983
01:15:20,678 --> 01:15:22,726
You can try asking your mom

984
01:15:23,166 --> 01:15:24,446
who Saikhim

985
01:15:24,751 --> 01:15:26,526
is to you.

986
01:15:52,037 --> 01:15:54,037
Claire went out to stay over at her friend's house.

987
01:15:54,406 --> 01:15:55,766
She was upset

988
01:15:55,998 --> 01:15:57,846
that I hid the fact about Khim.

989
01:16:01,206 --> 01:16:02,566
I came here

990
01:16:03,253 --> 01:16:05,126
to apologize to you.

991
01:16:05,326 --> 01:16:07,286
Do you think an apology

992
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:09,606
would make me forgive you?

993
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:11,966
I know an apology won't be enough.

994
01:16:12,676 --> 01:16:15,046
I want you to know that I really feel guilty.

995
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:20,566
If Claire chooses you, I don't think I can force her.

996
01:16:21,054 --> 01:16:22,686
Hasn't Claire told you?

997
01:16:23,028 --> 01:16:24,246
What?

998
01:16:24,398 --> 01:16:25,846
I don't want to marry Claire.

999
01:16:28,325 --> 01:16:30,086
I called her to talk about Khim.

1000
01:16:30,806 --> 01:16:32,846
The one I want to marry is Khim.

1001
01:16:34,733 --> 01:16:37,926
I know how bad everything I've done is.

1002
01:16:38,933 --> 01:16:40,766
I want you to give me a chance.

1003
01:16:41,445 --> 01:16:42,966
The one whom you should ask that

1004
01:16:43,086 --> 01:16:44,086
is Khim,

1005
01:16:44,221 --> 01:16:45,446
not me.

1006
01:16:49,486 --> 01:16:51,406
I don't think I can forgive you.

1007
01:16:52,822 --> 01:16:55,686
Both Khim and Claire are my daughters.

1008
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:59,206
If you can prove to me that you really love Khim,

1009
01:16:59,646 --> 01:17:01,406
I'll be open-minded.

1010
01:17:02,237 --> 01:17:03,806
I'll prove it to you.

1011
01:17:14,518 --> 01:17:16,486
We're going to be filed for bankruptcy?

1012
01:17:23,486 --> 01:17:24,526
Yes.

1013
01:17:24,725 --> 01:17:28,366
If we don't repay our debt as our debtor demands,

1014
01:17:28,542 --> 01:17:30,886
we can be filed for bankruptcy.

1015
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:34,122
How much time do we have?

1016
01:17:34,258 --> 01:17:36,061
We still have some time, Ms. Khim.

1017
01:17:36,246 --> 01:17:37,972
But we have to quickly negotiate

1018
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:41,606
with the debtor to repay or settle some of our debts

1019
01:17:41,806 --> 01:17:43,406
before we'll get filed for bankruptcy.

1020
01:17:43,597 --> 01:17:48,266
Is it possible to pay for the principal and pay the interest later?

1021
01:17:48,469 --> 01:17:51,566
I'll try to negotiate with the debtor, Ms. Khim.

1022
01:17:54,366 --> 01:17:55,446
Hey, Jake.

1023
01:17:55,622 --> 01:17:57,766
Is there any emergency?

1024
01:17:58,397 --> 01:18:00,246
Is it great over there?

1025
01:18:01,006 --> 01:18:04,646
Thaen, I'm really sorry, but I can't help your girlfriend's hotel anymore.

1026
01:18:05,006 --> 01:18:06,326
What happened?

1027
01:18:06,926 --> 01:18:08,206
Why did you change your mind?

1028
01:18:08,334 --> 01:18:11,286
Your girlfriend's hotel doesn't pass the assessment of quality.

1029
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:13,726
I have to cancel our agreement.

1030
01:18:14,934 --> 01:18:17,046
Wait, I will talk with her.

1031
01:18:17,286 --> 01:18:18,686
It's too late, Thaen.

1032
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:20,406
We have made the decision.

1033
01:18:20,606 --> 01:18:22,486
I really can't help you this time.

1034
01:18:22,813 --> 01:18:24,406
Jake, please...

1035
01:18:27,086 --> 01:18:28,966
You said you wanted to prove yourself to me.

1036
01:18:32,829 --> 01:18:34,806
I'm sorry, Uncle Sin.

1037
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:37,246
You acted rudely towards our guests.

1038
01:18:37,694 --> 01:18:39,694
That's why our hotel didn't pass the assessment.

1039
01:18:39,813 --> 01:18:41,246
How would I know that

1040
01:18:41,647 --> 01:18:44,246
that guest was the hotel inspector from our chain?

1041
01:18:44,382 --> 01:18:45,926
Stop making an excuse.

1042
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,166
The assessment results

1043
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:52,966
are being sent globally.

1044
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:55,806
Our hotel might get revoked the right to use the brand's name

1045
01:18:55,942 --> 01:18:57,686
because we didn't meet enough standards.

1046
01:19:04,846 --> 01:19:05,966
You must resign.

1047
01:19:13,638 --> 01:19:14,686
Uncle Sin.

1048
01:19:15,093 --> 01:19:16,526
Are you trying to chase me away?

1049
01:19:16,821 --> 01:19:18,846
You must take responsibility for what you did.

1050
01:19:19,812 --> 01:19:20,926
Scram.

1051
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:27,886
Darn it!

1052
01:19:30,444 --> 01:19:32,973
You should wait for Mr. Sin's mood to improve first.

1053
01:19:33,054 --> 01:19:35,366
No! I don't care if you can endure it!

1054
01:19:35,638 --> 01:19:37,326
I won't be his slave anymore!

1055
01:19:38,926 --> 01:19:40,566
- Stop making a deci... - Shut up!

1056
01:19:40,941 --> 01:19:42,206
I'm not like you.

1057
01:19:42,318 --> 01:19:43,726
You're a spineless man.

1058
01:19:43,807 --> 01:19:45,046
You only know how to bow.

1059
01:19:45,166 --> 01:19:46,726
I mean you well.

1060
01:19:46,997 --> 01:19:48,685
Feel free to flatter Uncle Sin.

1061
01:19:48,861 --> 01:19:51,286
There's no way he'll care about you.

1062
01:20:02,351 --> 01:20:04,606
Mr. Thaenthai, please come in.

1063
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:18,006
- What's wrong? - Jake changed his mind and won't invest with us.

1064
01:20:20,469 --> 01:20:22,469
The fact that our hotel didn't pass the assessment test

1065
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:24,086
must have reached them by now.

1066
01:20:24,365 --> 01:20:25,686
But don't worry.

1067
01:20:25,966 --> 01:20:27,486
I'll find a new investor quickly.

1068
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:29,486
Can you do that?

1069
01:20:31,886 --> 01:20:33,286
Can you do that?

1070
01:20:34,294 --> 01:20:36,134
Don't say it if you can't do it.

1071
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:38,846
If you can't do it,

1072
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:40,886
I won't give you my daughter.

1073
01:20:49,086 --> 01:20:50,406
Is there any news while I wasn't here?

1074
01:20:50,837 --> 01:20:53,086
Saikhim's hotel's situation is getting worse.

1075
01:20:54,509 --> 01:20:55,526
How bad?

1076
01:20:55,654 --> 01:20:57,046
If it continues like this,

1077
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,086
they might get bankrupt.

1078
01:20:59,549 --> 01:21:02,046
- How is Khim? - She's probably busy.

1079
01:21:03,622 --> 01:21:05,806
(Aside from negotiating with the debtor...)

1080
01:21:06,054 --> 01:21:08,966
This is all the details of our company's debt.

1081
01:21:09,749 --> 01:21:12,046
We haven't repaid them for a long time.

1082
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:25,126
(They even have to find new investors.)

1083
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:30,006
The person who made an appointment with you is here.

1084
01:21:35,086 --> 01:21:36,526
That's why she has been quiet.

1085
01:22:01,414 --> 01:22:03,046
Is your life that bad?

1086
01:22:04,437 --> 01:22:07,446
I heard you're fired because you treated your guests rudely.

1087
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:10,366
How is this your business?

1088
01:22:10,477 --> 01:22:12,446
Since you're leaving your company,

1089
01:22:13,108 --> 01:22:14,686
don't you want to leave them with something?

1090
01:22:16,613 --> 01:22:18,086
If you're interested,

1091
01:22:18,494 --> 01:22:20,726
I'll make your uncle lose his place in the company.

1092
01:22:30,898 --> 01:22:32,406
A son-in-law like you

1093
01:22:32,957 --> 01:22:34,566
is suitable for my uncle.

1094
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,646
I'll crush my father-in-law

1095
01:22:37,301 --> 01:22:39,006
if you give something back to me.

1096
01:22:39,917 --> 01:22:40,933
What's that?

1097
01:22:41,037 --> 01:22:42,926
The letter that Khim wrote for me when I was in prison.

1098
01:22:43,518 --> 01:22:45,166
I want that letter back.

1099
01:22:45,446 --> 01:22:47,606
I want everything your uncle took from me back.

1100
01:22:48,286 --> 01:22:49,726
If I can get Saikhim back,

1101
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:51,966
you'll get your money.

1102
01:23:00,558 --> 01:23:01,686
What are you doing?

1103
01:23:02,029 --> 01:23:03,406
Since Uncle Sin has fired me,

1104
01:23:03,686 --> 01:23:06,006
I would never stay here to let him control me.

1105
01:23:08,671 --> 01:23:10,326
Prompt. Prompt.

1106
01:23:10,517 --> 01:23:14,646
Mom, I have a way to get back at Uncle Sin. I'll go all in.

1107
01:23:15,006 --> 01:23:16,846
Prompt, what are you doing?

1108
01:23:16,972 --> 01:23:18,446
Don't fall out with the company.

1109
01:23:18,622 --> 01:23:20,665
That's the inheritance that your dad has given to you.

1110
01:23:21,181 --> 01:23:22,366
Mom!

1111
01:23:22,518 --> 01:23:25,006
Do you still think you'll get that when it has come to this?

1112
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:26,806
Do you think we'll get anything?

1113
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:28,774
Everything we've received

1114
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:30,926
is only leftover from him.

1115
01:23:31,413 --> 01:23:35,366
We'll see if Uncle can fight against Kla when he doesn't have me anymore.

1116
01:23:39,246 --> 01:23:40,646
What are you trying to do?

1117
01:23:41,622 --> 01:23:44,166
I'll let the son-in-law and father-in-law fight against each other.

1118
01:23:44,653 --> 01:23:45,886
I'll use him

1119
01:23:45,974 --> 01:23:47,486
to get rid of Uncle Sin.

1120
01:23:48,975 --> 01:23:51,486
Prompt, don't tell me

1121
01:23:51,662 --> 01:23:53,662
you'll let him into our company.

1122
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:55,566
Both the company

1123
01:23:55,806 --> 01:23:58,726
and the family. I'll take everything from Uncle Sin.

1124
01:24:00,023 --> 01:24:03,246
But for now, I have to find that letter.

1125
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:07,926
Prompt. Prompt.

1126
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:09,966
- Prompt, stop. - Mom.

1127
01:24:10,126 --> 01:24:12,046
- Enough. - These are for 100 million baht.

1128
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:13,446
I have to find it.

1129
01:24:13,606 --> 01:24:14,966
Prompt, please stop.

1130
01:24:15,262 --> 01:24:17,262
Uncle Sin will catch you.

1131
01:24:17,438 --> 01:24:18,686
If I knew this,

1132
01:24:18,886 --> 01:24:20,246
I would keep it myself.

1133
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:23,246
Darn it. Where is it?

1134
01:24:29,326 --> 01:24:30,726
Is this the one Mr. Prompt wants?

1135
01:24:34,526 --> 01:24:37,606
Mr. Sin asked me to destroy this letter after that incident.

1136
01:24:38,846 --> 01:24:41,606
But I thought it was important to Ms. Khim, so I kept it.

1137
01:24:41,924 --> 01:24:43,486
Why would he want it?

1138
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:46,406
You don't need to know.

1139
01:24:47,086 --> 01:24:49,046
You only need to protect Prompt.

1140
01:24:51,133 --> 01:24:52,246
Wait.

1141
01:24:52,566 --> 01:24:53,766
You must promise me

1142
01:24:54,021 --> 01:24:56,566
that you won't use this to make them fall out with each other.

1143
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:01,486
Why do you have to care about those two?

1144
01:25:02,285 --> 01:25:06,006
You've never protected me and my kids.

1145
01:25:06,959 --> 01:25:08,566
If you don't tell me why you want it,

1146
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,806
that means you don't trust me.

1147
01:25:13,357 --> 01:25:16,326
You let Prompt get chased away like a dog.

1148
01:25:16,526 --> 01:25:18,286
How could I trust you?

1149
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:22,166
Hey, give the letter back. Give it back.

1150
01:25:22,542 --> 01:25:23,726
Pijika.

1151
01:25:35,389 --> 01:25:38,686
Promptpat sent this to us. He said he did what we agreed on.

1152
01:25:39,886 --> 01:25:41,286
You must keep your promise.

1153
01:25:42,385 --> 01:25:43,574
(Kaokla)

1154
01:25:43,862 --> 01:25:44,926
What's this?

1155
01:25:45,437 --> 01:25:46,726
Handle it for me.

1156
01:25:52,501 --> 01:25:55,846
(I don't know why everything has become like this.)

1157
01:25:56,386 --> 01:26:01,246
(Everything happened so quickly. I don't know how we reached this point.)

1158
01:26:02,358 --> 01:26:05,406
(I only pulled myself together when I knew our child was gone.)

1159
01:26:09,558 --> 01:26:12,326
(I'm sorry for not being able to take care of him.)

1160
01:26:13,382 --> 01:26:16,486
(He might not want to be born with parents like us.)

1161
01:26:18,189 --> 01:26:21,446
(I want to know when this has happened.)

1162
01:26:22,806 --> 01:26:24,686
(When did we make a mistake?)

1163
01:26:25,606 --> 01:26:28,406
(Dad said you didn't want to take responsibility for me.)

1164
01:26:28,622 --> 01:26:30,622
(You only married me to mock him.)

1165
01:26:30,807 --> 01:26:33,886
(You kept all evidence to blackmail me)

1166
01:26:34,174 --> 01:26:37,446
(and you would abandon me and leave me at the farm.)

1167
01:26:38,086 --> 01:26:41,566
(I'm not mad at you that you went back to do illegal work.)

1168
01:26:42,526 --> 01:26:44,086
(I just want to know)

1169
01:26:44,486 --> 01:26:46,766
(if you really wanted to betray me.)

1170
01:26:46,925 --> 01:26:48,086
(So,)

1171
01:26:48,598 --> 01:26:51,126
(did I imagine everything by myself?)

1172
01:26:52,389 --> 01:26:53,726
(What happened between us,)

1173
01:26:54,422 --> 01:26:56,846
(can it be called love?)

1174
01:26:57,686 --> 01:26:58,966
(If it's true,)

1175
01:27:00,117 --> 01:27:01,997
(I'm ready to wait for you.)

1176
01:27:03,326 --> 01:27:06,846
(No matter how many days, months, or years,)

1177
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:09,206
(I can wait for you.)

1178
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:46,126
What will you do now?

1179
01:27:48,926 --> 01:27:51,486
I'll take my revenge against the one who separated me and Khim.

1180
01:27:55,846 --> 01:27:57,526
Kaokla secretly bought our hotel's share.

1181
01:27:57,889 --> 01:28:00,726
- Surprise. - You're really a devil.

1182
01:28:00,957 --> 01:28:02,806
Don't forget that I'm the one who saved your hotel.

1183
01:28:03,246 --> 01:28:05,526
I don't know what your plan is.

1184
01:28:05,726 --> 01:28:07,886
But don't think that you can take our hotel away from us.

1185
01:28:07,975 --> 01:28:09,566
If I can get our hotel back,

1186
01:28:09,709 --> 01:28:11,566
- will you trust me? - No way.

1187
01:28:11,779 --> 01:28:14,446
You'll never get our hotel back.

1188
01:28:14,646 --> 01:28:16,086
You chase everyone away from you.

1189
01:28:16,605 --> 01:28:18,166
You might be left with no one.

1190
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:23,686
Kla became a suspect in the car bomb case.

1191
01:28:23,846 --> 01:28:25,606
Don't you want to defend him at all?

1192
01:28:26,199 --> 01:28:28,206
I'll warn you one last time.

1193
01:28:28,812 --> 01:28:30,326
Don't bother my woman.

1194
01:28:30,526 --> 01:28:34,406
It might be the time for me to choose only one person.
