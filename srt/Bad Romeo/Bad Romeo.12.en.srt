1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:01,086
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,293
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,374 --> 00:00:03,551
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:45,260
I know everything.

5
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:47,762
I understand now why he said I killed him.

6
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:50,216
I'll give you the last chance to prove yourself.

7
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:52,286
Ruin Saikhim's wedding.

8
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:54,326
I'll prepare a trap for Kaokla.

9
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:57,113
Send Saikhim to suck up their matrimonial properties.

10
00:02:57,224 --> 00:02:58,846
Are we still friends?

11
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:01,195
Why did you betray me like that?

12
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:02,686
I'll marry Thaen.

13
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:05,686
I'll never let this matter get in the way of our wedding.

14
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,075
I'm here for our divorce.

15
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,566
You said you didn't want anything.

16
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:10,629
What is this document demanding several million baht?

17
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:14,368
Just for a night and you can stay with your man for the rest of your life.

18
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,307
He's already married.

19
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:18,006
They were together last night.

20
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:19,806
Before you become another man's wife,

21
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:21,086
you must compensate me.

22
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:23,463
Tell me what you want me to do.

23
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:26,446
(There are two types of people who can be friends with their ex.)

24
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:28,086
(First,)

25
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:30,726
(they actually have never loved each other.)

26
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:32,486
(If it's not that,)

27
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:34,702
(they still love each other.)

28
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:44,326
Is someone living here?

29
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:49,006
The owner wants to decorate this place,

30
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,206
so he wants it to be cleaned up first.

31
00:03:52,446 --> 00:03:53,686
Yes.

32
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:21,886
(When I close my eyes, I still see those images every year.)

33
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,581
(When I'm awake, I can't tell)

34
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:25,286
what the nightmare or the truth is.

35
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,086
During all these years,

36
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:28,486
I don't want to sleep

37
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:30,566
as I'm afraid I can't wake up again.

38
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:32,366
Can you endure half

39
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:34,726
of what I've faced?

40
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,566
I would like you to take these clothes to the washing machine.

41
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,766
And...

42
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:54,806
Please bring them back here.

43
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:55,966
Yes.

44
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:57,286
Thank you.

45
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:27,166
He's back?

46
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,246
Is someone here?

47
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:12,926
Is anyone here?

48
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:12,006
Who?

49
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,237
You said you don't like her, but you still let her come and go here.

50
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,422
Is she your darling while she's your enemy?

51
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:08,658
She's not doing this for free. She's doing it to atone for me.

52
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:10,326
She's not doing it for free?

53
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:12,806
She's being punished for having an affair then?

54
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:16,606
Gosh. What's wrong with this husband and wife?

55
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:18,086
What are you saying?

56
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:20,926
You're happy that you can take revenge against her, right?

57
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:25,886
You're keeping her with you to not let her marry, Kla.

58
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:29,277
Do I look in love that much?

59
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:31,206
You're...

60
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:34,326
It's like the so-called bondage, you know?

61
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:36,425
A man likes to torture.

62
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,595
A woman is like a masochist.

63
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:40,446
She always let him punish her.

64
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:46,566
Stop your nonsense. I'm not a pervert.

65
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:49,194
I'm kidding. Calm down.

66
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:54,526
- What's that? - This?

67
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,526
I don't know. I saw it was over there.

68
00:08:57,852 --> 00:08:59,852
Is this what Khim bought for you?

69
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,526
This is cheating.

70
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:07,966
Who told you to use this fabric softener?

71
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:11,318
It smells nice though.

72
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:12,646
Wash them again.

73
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:14,806
Don't use any fabric softener.

74
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,438
A manly man doesn't like something soft.

75
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,046
And throw this machine away.

76
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,446
What is it again?

77
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:44,526
Don't tell me you don't like technology.

78
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,726
You said you would compensate for my lost time.

79
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,985
But you're trying to save your time.

80
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:51,647
Using your money to fix everything is cheating.

81
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:54,126
Who could clean...

82
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:56,846
Do you want me to not count your time from using that machine?

83
00:09:57,237 --> 00:09:58,846
You have to come here willingly.

84
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:00,606
You can't just cut corners.

85
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,606
Every breath of yours must be about me.

86
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:05,492
Always think of my face when you're sleeping.

87
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:07,606
You could only compensate me like that.

88
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:09,686
Don't show your face here if you can't do it.

89
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:12,286
I've told you that you couldn't compensate me.

90
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:23,646
You promised that you would get a divorce if I could stand it.

91
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:28,406
Why did you let this fridge stay empty then?

92
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,126
Do you let your guests starve when they're at your hotel?

93
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:36,006
Fill up the fridge and ask for my money later.

94
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:46,046
Wait.

95
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:49,726
Keep this key with you.

96
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:52,686
Don't bother me when you come and go here.

97
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:54,286
You must avoid me.

98
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:26,813
Khim.

99
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:28,606
You're here. Have you been waiting?

100
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:30,126
Thaen.

101
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:33,646
Why did you come here so early?

102
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:36,806
Wow. This...

103
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:39,466
Why are you buying this much?

104
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:45,086
I thought you like dark roast coffee.

105
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:50,926
I want to try a new thing.

106
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:55,326
Then, we should buy groceries for our home.

107
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:59,846
Since you're free now,

108
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,046
you should use this time to prepare to become my bride.

109
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:08,606
So, we only have less than a day to see each other

110
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:10,046
before you leave again.

111
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:11,686
It's alright.

112
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:13,126
Of course, I have to send you off.

113
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:20,846
I'll call you back.

114
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,126
I'm here to stock up on your groceries.

115
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:11,942
This is for your breakfast.

116
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:48,326
Tissue paper, shampoo, toothpaste.

117
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:52,846
Those are mine. You don't need to pay.

118
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:54,949
Is this razor yours too?

119
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:00,846
You used this time to buy groceries for your boyfriend.

120
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:03,406
You were gone for five hours.

121
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:05,086
Three hours were used for your man.

122
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:08,166
Using only two hours buying nonsensical groceries for me.

123
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:10,700
How much time did you offer me in a day?

124
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:12,993
I only have five months before my wedding.

125
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:14,526
I can only give you this much.

126
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:19,526
I can add some extra time.

127
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:22,086
You can divorce after your marriage.

128
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:26,246
If we can have a sharing economy, we can share our wives then.

129
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,046
I want to try it once.

130
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:30,726
Since you're the best at two-timing.

131
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:44,726
This is why

132
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,726
I told you there's no way we couldn't break up.

133
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,766
You're rude.

134
00:14:50,242 --> 00:14:51,726
I was so fortunate

135
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:54,526
that I could escape from someone like you.

136
00:15:04,926 --> 00:15:06,366
I'll clean up early in the morning.

137
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:08,669
Don't eat it before that.

138
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:29,606
(Give the time that you're staying with another man back to me.)

139
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,246
(Every breath of yours must be about me.)

140
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:45,806
You have to come here willingly.

141
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:47,446
You can't just cut corners.

142
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:49,286
Every breath of yours must be about me.

143
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,686
Always think of my face when you're sleeping.

144
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,606
You could only compensate me like that.

145
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,766
Don't show your face here if you can't do it.

146
00:15:56,117 --> 00:15:58,446
I've told you that you couldn't compensate me.

147
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:08,846
(Carl really has an issue when it comes to children.)

148
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:11,206
(Whenever he sees a child,)

149
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:14,326
(he'll always go to help or protect them.)

150
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:18,246
(It's like he wants to compensate for his role as a father.)

151
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:29,406
What were you thinking about?

152
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:31,822
Nothing.

153
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:33,086
Are you full?

154
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:37,806
I was praying for merit for you. I thought you were full from that.

155
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:43,126
His alms bowl is still empty. He might not be full.

156
00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:45,446
Go wait to offer food to him over there.

157
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:54,446
If you make merit, I'll let you go early today.

158
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:36,086
What's going on?

159
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,966
Why are there a lot of ingredients?

160
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:40,166
Carl...

161
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:43,246
It's a food tour. They reserved a spot with us.

162
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,446
They would like to have lunch here.

163
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:47,846
But their flight was delayed.

164
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:50,486
They just called us to cancel it.

165
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:56,053
We don't only compete for convenience nowadays.

166
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:59,166
The guest's satisfaction might be related to communication.

167
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:01,886
(One new message.)

168
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:04,686
The customer service system

169
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,286
must include the guest during all of their journeys.

170
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:10,126
Even when they're outside of our hotel.

171
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:17,686
Excuse me.

172
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:25,966
What? I'm in a meeting.

173
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,406
Can't you come here to have a meeting instead?

174
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,126
Find someone else.

175
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,406
If you come here to help,

176
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:39,246
I'll give you one free day.

177
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,486
Wait over there.

178
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:44,086
I'm going.

179
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,125
- We're good now. - Yes.

180
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:51,550
We're good now.

181
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:56,126
It's already noon. Should we have the meeting outside in the afternoon?

182
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:58,766
We haven't done team-building for quite a while.

183
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:03,246
Please pack up your stuff and I'll take you outside.

184
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:04,846
Let's go.

185
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:17,126
Khim.

186
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:19,046
Is it a break?

187
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:20,726
Yes.

188
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:22,200
How did you get here?

189
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:23,686
Did you forget?

190
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,046
We have an appointment with the catering staff at the hotel.

191
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,230
She's cheating again.

192
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:59,286
Compensate? He wanted you to be his maid to compensate him?

193
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,926
He'll divorce if I can do that.

194
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:05,726
This is double dating now.

195
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:08,486
He purposefully wants you to deceive Thaen.

196
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:11,486
That's why I want your help.

197
00:21:11,781 --> 00:21:13,246
You're good at this kind of thing.

198
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:17,006
Wow. You're saying I'm playing both sides?

199
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,446
That hurts.

200
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:23,206
Do you want to prove yourself?

201
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:25,446
Yes.

202
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,526
Then...

203
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:29,966
Please go to see Thaen for me.

204
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:33,446
But Kla...

205
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:36,806
He doesn't want to divorce you, so he's stalling for time, right?

206
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,486
Don't worry.

207
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:40,646
Time won't make us love each other more.

208
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:50,886
You said you wanted a free day. What's this about?

209
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:53,286
I know my duty.

210
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,886
Don't try to always find fault with me.

211
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:02,446
Here you are.

212
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:08,086
Hello.

213
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:12,186
We're so fortunate that you and your team are free today.

214
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:16,366
I was looking for a place to hold an activity for my team.

215
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,566
At first,

216
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:20,467
Lady and I

217
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,846
thought that no one would come here.

218
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:26,286
Then, let's help each other.

219
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:35,966
I'm nearly done.

220
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:37,323
I'm going there.

221
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:39,206
Have you talked with your wife?

222
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:45,486
I haven't had a chance to see her.

223
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,006
What's the matter?

224
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,606
I'm curious how you would end the thing with her

225
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:51,086
if you're still avoiding each other.

226
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,926
I'll contact her as soon as I can.

227
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:55,646
Do you want me to help you talk with her?

228
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,566
It might be easier for me as I'm a woman.

229
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:00,846
I'll consider that as my last option.

230
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,566
Let me try my way first.

231
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:05,606
I'll give you time before I come back.

232
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:08,126
(If you aren't divorced when I'm back,)

233
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:10,326
(you won't see me again.)

234
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,166
He didn't admit

235
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:22,406
that he intentionally deceived you, right?

236
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,493
He got married

237
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:35,846
only because he impregnated that woman.

238
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:40,126
He was just a kid who met that woman from a dating app.

239
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:42,806
He only married her to take responsibility for the child.

240
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:51,446
They always see each other,

241
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:53,366
but they're hiding it.

242
00:23:56,581 --> 00:23:57,926
He's Carl.

243
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,070
Carl?

244
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,486
Carl Raman, half-Thai, half-Kazakhstan.

245
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:04,486
Carl came from his Thai name, Kaokla.

246
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:06,766
Nice to meet you,

247
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:08,126
Mr. Carl.

248
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,796
You're already married

249
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:15,486
and this is your wife's lipstick.

250
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:16,966
Who told you that?

251
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,831
It's your stare.

252
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,326
How could you keep something this big from me?

253
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:26,646
Making me steal someone else's man. Why would you do this?

254
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,646
What do they see me as? Why did they have to do this?

255
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:33,326
Ms. Khim is getting married. Why...

256
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:35,486
The wedding might not take place

257
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,126
if they change their minds to live together again.

258
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:41,486
If back then

259
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:43,886
I knew that he registered his marriage,

260
00:24:44,246 --> 00:24:46,606
I might have warned you before.

261
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:48,646
Do they still love each other?

262
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,486
They might keep it that way to make your wish come true.

263
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:53,046
Who knows?

264
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:56,246
They might even be together right now.

265
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:13,046
The side. Please pound it at the side.

266
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,286
What's the matter, Ms. Claire?

267
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:25,726
I haven't had a chance to see her.

268
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:27,366
What's the matter?

269
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:31,046
I gave him my ultimatum that if he doesn't divorce,

270
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:32,934
I'll break up with him.

271
00:25:35,587 --> 00:25:36,846
Excuse me.

272
00:25:39,086 --> 00:25:40,846
Did he promise he would divorce?

273
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:44,646
If that woman still wants something, she won't let him go easily.

274
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:47,606
(If she doesn't love him, she should go away.)

275
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:51,286
I don't know why that woman is so selfish.

276
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:02,286
I want your wish to come true.

277
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:05,486
I know how much he is worth to you.

278
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,246
You two really match each other.

279
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:13,126
(I hope Carl will do as he says.)

280
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:15,541
(I don't want to be an idiot anymore.)

281
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,926
If you have a chance, please admonish him for me.

282
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:20,566
Maybe...

283
00:26:21,332 --> 00:26:23,566
This will let us see his true nature

284
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:25,526
whether this man

285
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:28,126
is really worthy of your love.

286
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:42,566
What's wrong?

287
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:45,966
Ms. Khim.

288
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:48,046
The stove is ready.

289
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:04,086
Ms. Khim said the organizer would prepare everything.

290
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:05,766
She said that?

291
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,086
But she didn't tell me.

292
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:11,846
It's me, the wedding planner for this wedding.

293
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,246
Are you done talking?

294
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:14,726
- You? - Yes.

295
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:17,265
Khim told me to decide it myself

296
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:18,766
because we

297
00:27:18,877 --> 00:27:21,526
have the same taste. We like similar things.

298
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:28,577
Hey.

299
00:27:28,837 --> 00:27:30,486
Are you sure that Khim told you that?

300
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,806
We need to talk.

301
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:37,486
Ouch.

302
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,077
Hey. What are you trying to do?

303
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:46,326
Tell me if you're planning something.

304
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:50,486
I only want to help with her wedding as her bridesmaid. It's normal.

305
00:27:50,806 --> 00:27:53,606
I hope you'll really think of yourself as a bridesmaid.

306
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:55,486
Why?

307
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,160
Are you afraid that I'll be your bride instead?

308
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:02,726
I'm afraid you'll destroy our wedding.

309
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:04,846
I don't trust you.

310
00:28:08,494 --> 00:28:12,086
What about you? Your dad didn't let you marry Saikhim.

311
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:13,726
You didn't tell Khim about that.

312
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:16,326
The one who'll destroy this wedding

313
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:18,766
is only you.

314
00:28:19,142 --> 00:28:23,398
If you're still running away from the problem, Khim will be in trouble.

315
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,566
(Sajee)

316
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:36,885
- Yes? - Officer.

317
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:40,046
I'm a victim of an assault. She slapped me.

318
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,846
- Yes. - I will take action against her today.

319
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,207
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

320
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:46,446
Have you been waiting?

321
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:49,526
I thought I would have to sleep here tonight.

322
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,806
Are you hurt anywhere?

323
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:55,126
My heart hurts more than my body. I got swarmed by them.

324
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:57,566
Please wait a moment.

325
00:28:58,438 --> 00:28:59,726
- Yes. - Please get her.

326
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:02,886
Officer, I'm here to bail out that woman.

327
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,746
- Yes. - When you go out,

328
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:06,886
stop seducing someone else's husband again.

329
00:29:07,726 --> 00:29:08,774
Seduce what?

330
00:29:08,878 --> 00:29:12,570
I'm here as a victim. Your husband tried to assault me.

331
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:14,566
You're the one who seduced my husband.

332
00:29:14,726 --> 00:29:16,726
Is that a salon or a brothel?

333
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,526
Why is there a massage service?

334
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:22,397
I only gave him a neck massage, but your husband went wild himself.

335
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:24,326
My husband is religious.

336
00:29:24,478 --> 00:29:26,926
He's not starving for affection like you.

337
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:29,446
Since I already have to pay the fine,

338
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:31,326
let me slap you again.

339
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:34,370
- No. Stop. - Please stop.

340
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:36,766
- Please stop. - Let her go, please.

341
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,040
- Please stop. - Calm down.

342
00:29:39,126 --> 00:29:40,731
I'll slap you.

343
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:43,806
- I have to get her again. - Please calm down now.

344
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,356
I'll never let you go.

345
00:29:46,437 --> 00:29:47,486
Calm down.

346
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,886
If Lita knows this, she'll order me to close down my salon.

347
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:53,286
Lita really hates to be ashamed.

348
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,606
Ma'am.

349
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:57,286
But I don't think you can open your salon now.

350
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:14,166
What?

351
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:18,006
- Watch out! - No!

352
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:26,293
What a close one.

353
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:34,246
Blood.

354
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:38,486
Does it hurt?

355
00:30:39,926 --> 00:30:41,126
It's alright.

356
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:03,606
Thank you. I'll close it temporarily.

357
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,470
I'll call the repairman later.

358
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:07,166
You don't have to.

359
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,657
You got hurt and now you have to repair my home.

360
00:31:09,773 --> 00:31:11,606
It's nothing much.

361
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:15,766
It's dangerous when you're alone with an unknown repairman.

362
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:20,926
That's true.

363
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:23,486
I was afraid about that.

364
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,206
If they can do this much,

365
00:31:26,613 --> 00:31:28,446
I don't know when they'll come again.

366
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:33,926
Should I stay with you?

367
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,326
If I'm here,

368
00:31:36,926 --> 00:31:38,646
they won't dare to come to you.

369
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,166
Really?

370
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:49,246
If my home has a man,

371
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:51,446
it'll give me a lot of relief.

372
00:31:56,677 --> 00:31:58,606
Thank you so much.

373
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:01,526
Yes.

374
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:13,966
Lita is calling.

375
00:32:15,163 --> 00:32:17,015
Don't let her know we're together.

376
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:21,366
Lita will be embarrassed if she knows I got into a fight.

377
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:23,366
Yes.

378
00:32:27,443 --> 00:32:30,046
Hello? What's up, my daughter?

379
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:34,446
Of course, I can stay here.

380
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:37,048
Yes. There are tons of customers.

381
00:32:55,815 --> 00:32:57,369
You can send me off here.

382
00:32:58,886 --> 00:33:00,846
Do you remember what I asked of you?

383
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:04,046
I have to divorce her before you come back.

384
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:06,326
You're always decisive when it's about your work.

385
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,806
If you really want to divorce,

386
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:10,646
no one can stop you.

387
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:12,486
I'll try.

388
00:33:12,902 --> 00:33:15,726
If you're still calm, it means you don't think that I'm important.

389
00:33:16,397 --> 00:33:18,566
You have to respect me more than this.

390
00:33:18,806 --> 00:33:22,126
If she doesn't love you anymore, you have to cut her off completely.

391
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,766
I'll handle everything.

392
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:27,886
Don't think about it too much.

393
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:32,686
I hope we don't have to say farewell.

394
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,748
Good luck.

395
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:53,926
The car is over there.

396
00:34:16,126 --> 00:34:17,406
A car is following us.

397
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:18,926
Whose car?

398
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,366
You haven't noticed that a car is following us?

399
00:34:22,846 --> 00:34:24,446
What should I do?

400
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:26,606
Turn right here.

401
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:29,646
Just turn right.

402
00:34:43,606 --> 00:34:45,046
Are they following us?

403
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:50,326
If they want to follow you, they don't need to drive a car.

404
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:53,465
If they want to know where you're going,

405
00:34:53,582 --> 00:34:56,606
they can just track what you set in your GPS.

406
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:00,086
Here.

407
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:05,926
You set my garage as the destination.

408
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:09,046
Everyone knows when you come and go there.

409
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,606
Is this true?

410
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:16,067
I always change my accommodation

411
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:17,966
to not let anyone track me.

412
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,519
But you can't hide a secret.

413
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:23,926
Do you know how dangerous this information can be?

414
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:26,142
Especially for an IT guy like me.

415
00:35:26,534 --> 00:35:29,598
I've never had to live in hiding. I wouldn't know this.

416
00:35:29,742 --> 00:35:32,086
You should be careful when you're double dating.

417
00:35:32,366 --> 00:35:33,926
Since you're a newbie,

418
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:35,526
you'll get used to it soon.

419
00:35:46,726 --> 00:35:47,926
Change the car.

420
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:51,590
Take this car to the garage.

421
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:53,166
I'll trade it back after I'm done.

422
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:54,926
You're afraid you'll be caught having an affair?

423
00:35:56,691 --> 00:35:59,106
Oh. The workout clothes are in the car.

424
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,504
You're still saying you don't feel anything when you two are this close?

425
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,526
I like the design that Lita gave to me.

426
00:36:28,806 --> 00:36:30,526
We can just use that, Thaen.

427
00:36:30,885 --> 00:36:32,286
Do you not like it?

428
00:36:34,956 --> 00:36:36,046
Yes.

429
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,646
Actually...

430
00:36:44,214 --> 00:36:47,926
We can send it to the printing house. I don't mind it.

431
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:51,846
And we'll talk about it later.

432
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:58,366
Is my order ready?

433
00:37:04,445 --> 00:37:05,806
You only run this much?

434
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:07,326
I thought you are tougher.

435
00:37:07,629 --> 00:37:09,549
My earrings were gone while I was running.

436
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:16,326
They're probably around here.

437
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,326
Help me find them.

438
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:29,478
They're here?

439
00:37:37,853 --> 00:37:39,006
Around there.

440
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:50,966
Is it good?

441
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:00,286
Is it refreshing?

442
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,606
Do you feel cool now?

443
00:38:20,526 --> 00:38:23,566
Serves you right. Karma came around quickly.

444
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:25,926
I told him I would like electrolyte drinks.

445
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:28,446
I thought he only added some salt to it.

446
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:30,046
Good. We're even now.

447
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:31,446
Wait.

448
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:34,846
What I got and what you got can't even be compared.

449
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,686
I'm all wet now.

450
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:39,926
Where did I keep my earrings?

451
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:42,726
If you cared about me, you would know it.

452
00:38:43,268 --> 00:38:45,006
Who would know about your ears?

453
00:38:45,286 --> 00:38:47,046
I'm not that nosy.

454
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,646
You should remember every detail, so you won't miss it again.

455
00:38:56,846 --> 00:38:58,366
Why do we have to come here?

456
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:01,531
Did you order this?

457
00:39:01,646 --> 00:39:02,806
- Yes. - Here you are.

458
00:39:04,086 --> 00:39:05,512
- Your money. - Is there no problem?

459
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:06,646
Yes.

460
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,406
Change your clothes.

461
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:15,166
Why do I have to change my clothes? You asked me to drive for you.

462
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:16,606
I'm making you my secretary.

463
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:18,366
Please don't make me ashamed.

464
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:26,966
Look and remember.

465
00:39:27,149 --> 00:39:28,433
If we really care,

466
00:39:28,527 --> 00:39:30,886
we have to know everything, even the underwear.

467
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,286
I'm done.

468
00:39:53,494 --> 00:39:54,966
You said you're here for work.

469
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:56,646
We're going there.

470
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,406
What are you doing?

471
00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:23,006
Aside from the food tour, a lot of people

472
00:40:23,326 --> 00:40:26,246
want me to take them to herbal liquor stores,

473
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,046
so I'm here to take a look around first.

474
00:40:29,538 --> 00:40:30,646
Sit down.

475
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:33,526
(You want to trick foreigners into coming here.)

476
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,206
(Foreigners aren't just only interested in Thai royal cuisines.)

477
00:40:36,446 --> 00:40:38,726
(They also want to see some traditional things.)

478
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:40,918
(I want you to be a representative of women.)

479
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:42,565
(I want to know what they like.)

480
00:40:56,173 --> 00:40:57,326
No.

481
00:40:58,646 --> 00:40:59,926
Don't try to take advantage of me.

482
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:01,966
There are tons of people here.

483
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:03,686
You're so stingy.

484
00:41:05,037 --> 00:41:06,366
I wasn't trying to hug you.

485
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:41,886
Are you alright?

486
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:43,406
Give me the key.

487
00:41:48,853 --> 00:41:49,926
Are you alright?

488
00:41:53,635 --> 00:41:54,686
I'm alright.

489
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,286
You came here as my driver,

490
00:42:05,414 --> 00:42:07,206
but you go back as a lady.

491
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:23,126
Hey, you can wear it.

492
00:42:23,461 --> 00:42:24,833
If you can't wear it,

493
00:42:24,926 --> 00:42:26,326
you'll have to wear this hippo one.

494
00:42:28,874 --> 00:42:31,646
These clothes are secondhand clothes

495
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:34,486
that Lita sold online when she was in college.

496
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:37,206
Here.

497
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:40,366
She is the seller and the model.

498
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:42,086
Look.

499
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,694
I wanted her to learn how to make money

500
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:47,806
so she wouldn't become spoiled like her rich friends.

501
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:51,326
Here. Khim also went to help her sell them.

502
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:53,886
Khim is such a good girl.

503
00:42:54,126 --> 00:42:55,646
She doesn't care about her status.

504
00:42:55,847 --> 00:42:58,926
She might be the only one who is friends with Lita.

505
00:42:59,237 --> 00:43:00,966
If we didn't have that family,

506
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,166
Lita wouldn't receive this high education.

507
00:43:24,574 --> 00:43:26,886
- (Please stop.) - (You.)

508
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:28,886
- (Ma'am, please stop.) - (Separate them.)

509
00:43:28,997 --> 00:43:30,166
Mom?

510
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:41,686
Mom.

511
00:43:43,565 --> 00:43:45,486
Why didn't you tell me about that?

512
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:47,046
Why did you hide it from me?

513
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:48,486
It's nothing.

514
00:43:48,701 --> 00:43:49,956
I can handle it.

515
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,486
Calm down. Calm down first.

516
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:57,086
If Berm didn't send the clip to me, I wouldn't know you were assaulted.

517
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:59,239
But I'm alright now.

518
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,086
Calm down, Lita.

519
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,645
And whose is this?

520
00:44:14,397 --> 00:44:15,886
Who did you bring home this time?

521
00:44:18,373 --> 00:44:21,646
Thaenthai used his money to bail me out.

522
00:44:21,774 --> 00:44:22,805
Mom!

523
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,046
He said he wouldn't tell anyone.

524
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,757
If you want to be mad

525
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:30,006
that I made you feel humiliated in front of a man,

526
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:31,806
you can be mad at me.

527
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:33,398
But at that time,

528
00:44:33,726 --> 00:44:37,286
I didn't know who I would ask for help.

529
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:42,926
Me.

530
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:44,806
Your daughter.

531
00:44:47,214 --> 00:44:50,606
Why do you think I would be more worried about myself than you?

532
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:55,686
I don't care what they would think of us.

533
00:44:56,325 --> 00:44:58,520
No one can hurt my mom.

534
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:01,541
How could they hurt my mom?

535
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:13,006
You don't have to be afraid.

536
00:45:13,446 --> 00:45:15,606
I'm already this old.

537
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:17,566
Of course, I won't die easily.

538
00:45:25,126 --> 00:45:26,566
If I was ashamed,

539
00:45:26,885 --> 00:45:31,246
I would never give birth to you back then.

540
00:45:50,406 --> 00:45:51,726
(Khim's boyfriend,)

541
00:45:52,606 --> 00:45:54,366
(he's so nice to me.)

542
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:58,566
(So nice that I don't know how to repay him back.)

543
00:46:01,246 --> 00:46:03,806
(If there's anything we can help for him and Khim,)

544
00:46:03,966 --> 00:46:05,406
(we have to help them.)

545
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:07,526
No matter how nice Thaenthai is,

546
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:09,846
he isn't good enough for Saikhim.

547
00:46:09,927 --> 00:46:12,286
Khim should get someone better than this.

548
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:14,029
I'll give you two weeks.

549
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:16,246
Destroy Saikhim's wedding.

550
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:52,789
How did you get here?

551
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:54,527
Well...

552
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,726
Well...

553
00:46:57,157 --> 00:46:59,498
I found out about my mom, so I rushed here.

554
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:02,341
What were you trying to do?

555
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,160
You took my photo while I was sleeping?

556
00:47:05,446 --> 00:47:06,446
No.

557
00:47:06,766 --> 00:47:08,046
Delete it.

558
00:47:08,174 --> 00:47:09,486
I told you to delete it.

559
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,206
Delete it.

560
00:47:13,678 --> 00:47:17,686
See? You really took it. Why would you take it?

561
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,046
What's this?

562
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:29,606
What does this photo mean?

563
00:47:30,926 --> 00:47:32,286
When did you take this photo?

564
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:33,469
I didn't...

565
00:47:34,246 --> 00:47:35,966
Are you trying to betray Saikhim again?

566
00:47:41,846 --> 00:47:42,926
Thaen.

567
00:47:43,846 --> 00:47:44,846
Thaen.

568
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,326
Thaen, listen to me.

569
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,606
Thaen.

570
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,046
I didn't take that photo.

571
00:47:50,302 --> 00:47:51,486
Who took it then?

572
00:47:52,534 --> 00:47:53,725
It's...

573
00:47:55,533 --> 00:47:57,966
Someone is following us.

574
00:47:58,446 --> 00:48:00,486
Does it always have to be that kind of photo?

575
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,006
Why did you keep that?

576
00:48:04,606 --> 00:48:07,206
I didn't keep it to blackmail you.

577
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:09,366
I'm not sure about that.

578
00:48:09,996 --> 00:48:12,326
Don't tell me you want me to stay here because...

579
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:16,326
Stop your misunderstanding, please. I beg you.

580
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,966
I promise.

581
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,006
No. I swear

582
00:48:21,596 --> 00:48:22,966
that these photos,

583
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:25,326
Saikhim would never get to see them.

584
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:27,726
I don't know whether I can still trust you.

585
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:31,686
Why do you always have ulterior motives?

586
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,286
I don't know anymore

587
00:48:34,694 --> 00:48:36,766
what your true nature is.

588
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:51,942
Thaen.

589
00:48:53,686 --> 00:48:55,166
If you want to hear the truth,

590
00:48:55,573 --> 00:48:57,286
are you sure you can accept it?

591
00:48:59,846 --> 00:49:00,937
It's...

592
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:14,862
We've arrived.

593
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,120
Khim.

594
00:49:58,551 --> 00:49:59,612
Wake up.

595
00:50:00,261 --> 00:50:01,421
We've arrived.

596
00:50:07,013 --> 00:50:10,086
I haven't arrived at my home.

597
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:14,286
If you want me to send you home,

598
00:50:14,646 --> 00:50:16,606
I'll add more time as I have to serve you.

599
00:50:20,046 --> 00:50:21,406
Back off.

600
00:50:21,806 --> 00:50:23,726
Back off...

601
00:50:28,846 --> 00:50:29,926
Khim.

602
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:38,909
Khim.

603
00:50:40,315 --> 00:50:41,566
You should go wait inside.

604
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:43,446
You can't drive home like this.

605
00:50:44,286 --> 00:50:45,606
I'm alright.

606
00:50:48,806 --> 00:50:50,686
Give me the car key.

607
00:50:55,526 --> 00:50:57,166
I've called Khem.

608
00:50:57,806 --> 00:50:59,526
He will drive you home.

609
00:51:20,206 --> 00:51:21,406
Go inside for now.

610
00:51:26,246 --> 00:51:27,446
Go.

611
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:30,006
Get up, Khim.

612
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:03,766
What's wrong?

613
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:07,286
Give me the car key. Cancel the flight.

614
00:52:07,726 --> 00:52:08,966
Give me the car key!

615
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:12,206
Hey, where are you going?

616
00:52:14,566 --> 00:52:17,086
- A car is following us. - What should I do?

617
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:18,646
Turn right here.

618
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:44,326
Water.

619
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:47,486
Water.

620
00:52:48,646 --> 00:52:50,166
Are you trying to order me around now?

621
00:53:17,566 --> 00:53:18,806
Don't sleep just yet.

622
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,046
Have water first.

623
00:53:32,446 --> 00:53:33,574
Slowly.

624
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:50,806
Are you really drunk or just acting?

625
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:26,086
That's so cute. Did you make it yourself? Teach me.

626
00:54:27,094 --> 00:54:30,446
You only said that I'm cute. Will you say you love me?

627
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,006
You have to be cuter than this.

628
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,726
You can't love me in this life?

629
00:55:42,573 --> 00:55:44,126
You're good at sulking.

630
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,286
You're good at annoying me.

631
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:56,126
Thank goodness I'm good at making up with you.

632
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:10,286
I told you several times. You just didn't listen to me.

633
00:56:25,957 --> 00:56:27,037
What are you doing?

634
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,286
You have to do this.

635
00:56:39,454 --> 00:56:40,726
It has to be like this.

636
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:42,566
So, I can see

637
00:56:42,951 --> 00:56:45,406
if I can still make your heart tremble.

638
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,126
Can you hear it clearly now?

639
00:56:54,045 --> 00:56:55,566
Do you know what the magnitude is then?

640
00:56:55,982 --> 00:56:57,566
I can't stop loving you.

641
00:56:58,469 --> 00:56:59,566
I told you

642
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:02,246
I would stop loving you only when I die.

643
00:57:29,086 --> 00:57:30,486
I love you too.

644
00:59:17,407 --> 00:59:18,566
What time is it?

645
00:59:20,117 --> 00:59:21,286
It's 11 pm.

646
00:59:28,446 --> 00:59:30,406
I'll go home.

647
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,166
The car key.

648
00:59:39,486 --> 00:59:41,646
How would you go back? You're still drunk.

649
00:59:43,189 --> 00:59:44,509
I can drive.

650
00:59:47,229 --> 00:59:50,486
No. Wait here. Khem is coming here.

651
00:59:53,402 --> 00:59:55,086
I can still drive.

652
01:00:40,438 --> 01:00:41,806
Where is he?

653
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,526
Please pull over here.

654
01:01:08,323 --> 01:01:10,086
Hello? We have a problem.

655
01:01:10,206 --> 01:01:11,246
What's going on, Khem?

656
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:13,070
Your wives are chasing each other.

657
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:23,135
Turn around and follow them.

658
01:01:23,406 --> 01:01:24,446
Khem.

659
01:02:00,246 --> 01:02:01,566
This is bad.

660
01:02:02,214 --> 01:02:03,966
She is going to die.

661
01:02:04,548 --> 01:02:07,006
I'm going there. Take a look at her first.

662
01:02:16,206 --> 01:02:18,646
Help. Please help Ms. Khim.

663
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,166
What did you do to her?

664
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:21,886
- Help Ms. Khim. - Khim.

665
01:02:22,062 --> 01:02:23,302
Khim, wake up.

666
01:02:23,568 --> 01:02:24,646
Khim!

667
01:02:24,957 --> 01:02:26,886
Please call the ambulance.

668
01:02:27,606 --> 01:02:29,379
Khim, wake up. Khim.

669
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:30,846
Wake up.

670
01:02:31,469 --> 01:02:32,606
Unlock your car.

671
01:02:37,856 --> 01:02:38,966
Back off.

672
01:02:45,126 --> 01:02:46,806
- Khim. - Ms. Khim.

673
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:48,406
Ms. Khim.

674
01:02:54,806 --> 01:02:56,046
Back off.

675
01:03:08,036 --> 01:03:09,806
Excuse me. Is she dead?

676
01:03:41,366 --> 01:03:42,397
Carl...

677
01:03:45,406 --> 01:03:46,766
No, don't go there.

678
01:03:47,086 --> 01:03:49,286
Don't go there. Please keep calm, alright?

679
01:03:51,062 --> 01:03:53,366
- What do you mean? - Please stay calm.

680
01:03:54,406 --> 01:03:56,246
Khim stopped breathing.

681
01:04:07,366 --> 01:04:08,446
No.

682
01:04:08,742 --> 01:04:09,966
No.

683
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:13,166
Khim.

684
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,359
Khim.

685
01:04:15,806 --> 01:04:17,006
Khim, wake up.

686
01:04:24,693 --> 01:04:25,726
Khim.

687
01:04:26,605 --> 01:04:27,726
This can't be true.

688
01:04:31,206 --> 01:04:32,286
This can't be true.

689
01:04:33,429 --> 01:04:34,486
Khim.

690
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,726
No!

691
01:04:39,321 --> 01:04:40,526
This can't be true.

692
01:04:41,814 --> 01:04:44,006
I didn't do this.

693
01:04:45,209 --> 01:04:46,209
Khem.

694
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:48,126
Take Claire away.

695
01:04:48,526 --> 01:04:49,646
Go!

696
01:04:50,102 --> 01:04:51,806
Come here. Come here.

697
01:04:59,806 --> 01:05:00,966
Khim.

698
01:05:03,406 --> 01:05:04,646
Khim, wake up.

699
01:05:08,686 --> 01:05:09,886
Khim.

700
01:05:11,246 --> 01:05:12,486
Khim, can you hear me?

701
01:05:12,853 --> 01:05:14,206
Wake up, Khim.

702
01:05:15,966 --> 01:05:17,966
You said you would compensate for my lost time.

703
01:05:19,566 --> 01:05:21,566
You can't run away from me like this.

704
01:05:23,414 --> 01:05:24,926
Can you hear me, Khim?

705
01:05:25,326 --> 01:05:26,646
I've been waiting.

706
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:29,366
You can't leave me like this, Khim.

707
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:30,966
Khim, wake up.

708
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,726
Khim.

709
01:05:38,326 --> 01:05:39,446
Khim.

710
01:05:42,573 --> 01:05:44,046
Khim, I beg you.

711
01:05:47,422 --> 01:05:49,046
Don't leave me, Khim.

712
01:05:50,495 --> 01:05:52,196
- Excuse me. - Please stay with me.

713
01:06:23,486 --> 01:06:24,726
Please stop the CPR.

714
01:06:26,966 --> 01:06:28,286
Her vitals are back.

715
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,566
What is your relationship with her?

716
01:06:41,806 --> 01:06:42,886
I'm her husband.

717
01:06:48,886 --> 01:06:50,606
(We met because of a coincidence.)

718
01:06:51,286 --> 01:06:53,166
(We knew each other because of a mistake.)

719
01:06:53,989 --> 01:06:56,206
(We loved each other because we had no one left.)

720
01:06:57,766 --> 01:06:59,846
(We broke up when we loved each other so much.)

721
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:06,106
You must be alright.

722
01:07:09,862 --> 01:07:11,606
- Khim. - Please calm down.

723
01:07:13,246 --> 01:07:16,206
The patient has pulmonary contusion from the impact of the accident.

724
01:07:16,382 --> 01:07:18,666
She's at risk of respiratory failure.

725
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:20,526
We might need to use a respirator

726
01:07:20,646 --> 01:07:22,326
if she can't breathe by herself.

727
01:07:26,245 --> 01:07:28,126
Before you become another man's wife,

728
01:07:28,582 --> 01:07:30,046
you must compensate me.

729
01:07:30,445 --> 01:07:31,766
If I do that,

730
01:07:33,555 --> 01:07:36,126
you'll divorce me and let me go, right?

731
01:07:36,405 --> 01:07:37,725
You have to offer your time.

732
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:40,086
You have to come whenever I call you.

733
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:42,766
If you stay with me and don't feel anything,

734
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:44,886
it means we don't have anything left

735
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:46,526
and I'll divorce you.

736
01:07:47,477 --> 01:07:50,006
You can go marry whomever you want then.

737
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,126
If it's not like what you asked of me last night,

738
01:07:53,901 --> 01:07:55,126
I can do it.

739
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:02,206
Is it good?

740
01:08:04,959 --> 01:08:06,206
Is it refreshing?

741
01:08:13,766 --> 01:08:15,086
No.

742
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:17,726
Don't try to take advantage of me.

743
01:08:18,237 --> 01:08:19,926
There are tons of people here.

744
01:08:20,886 --> 01:08:22,126
You're so stingy.

745
01:08:23,446 --> 01:08:24,806
I wasn't trying to hug you.

746
01:08:32,862 --> 01:08:34,646
If we can have a sharing economy,

747
01:08:35,006 --> 01:08:36,859
we can share our wives then.

748
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,606
I want to try it once.

749
01:08:39,165 --> 01:08:41,166
Since you're the best at two-timing.

750
01:08:44,296 --> 01:08:45,566
This is why

751
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:48,566
I told you there's no way we couldn't break up.

752
01:08:48,973 --> 01:08:50,566
You're rude.

753
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,526
I was so fortunate

754
01:08:52,981 --> 01:08:55,446
that I could escape from someone like you.

755
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:00,486
You can blame or swear at me however you want when you wake up.

756
01:09:01,686 --> 01:09:03,086
Please just be alright.

757
01:09:03,398 --> 01:09:05,398
Nurse, move the patient now.

758
01:09:05,566 --> 01:09:06,926
Her condition isn't good.

759
01:09:13,766 --> 01:09:15,006
You can't come in.

760
01:09:15,294 --> 01:09:17,206
Please wait outside.

761
01:09:17,629 --> 01:09:19,046
You can't come in here yet.

762
01:09:20,246 --> 01:09:21,526
Please.

763
01:09:46,038 --> 01:09:47,398
(Even if we aren't friends,)

764
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,142
(we don't have to be enemies.)

765
01:09:51,693 --> 01:09:54,806
(We're just strangers who shared some memories.)

766
01:10:01,846 --> 01:10:03,126
What do you want, Khim?

767
01:10:09,726 --> 01:10:10,726
Are you hurting?

768
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:12,326
Are you cold?

769
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:14,326
Or are you afraid?

770
01:10:26,062 --> 01:10:27,222
Just forget it.

771
01:10:27,566 --> 01:10:29,006
Why would you talk now?

772
01:10:29,342 --> 01:10:31,646
We should talk later when you're feeling better.

773
01:10:31,789 --> 01:10:33,789
When you wake up, whatever you want to say to me,

774
01:10:34,126 --> 01:10:35,566
I won't interrupt you anymore.

775
01:10:46,614 --> 01:10:48,366
Kla, how is she?

776
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:53,366
Her condition isn't good. What about Claire?

777
01:10:53,606 --> 01:10:56,446
I took her to your home, but she couldn't accept it.

778
01:11:00,725 --> 01:11:02,486
If something happens to Saikhim,

779
01:11:02,646 --> 01:11:05,046
I don't know whether she'll be charged with reckless driving or murder.

780
01:11:06,126 --> 01:11:07,526
Go look after Claire for now.

781
01:11:07,982 --> 01:11:09,438
I'll handle the case myself.

782
01:11:09,806 --> 01:11:10,926
Go.

783
01:11:13,783 --> 01:11:15,526
I heard you were at the scene of the accident.

784
01:11:15,726 --> 01:11:18,446
- Yes. - I want to know the details of the incident.

785
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:27,526
How is my daughter?

786
01:11:28,156 --> 01:11:31,526
Her lung has high carbon dioxide and lacks oxygen.

787
01:11:31,766 --> 01:11:33,726
We have to give her palliative care

788
01:11:33,926 --> 01:11:36,606
to see if her lung will be infected or not.

789
01:11:36,886 --> 01:11:40,006
He said Ms. Khim was fortunate that someone gave her CPR.

790
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:41,966
Ms. Khim regained consciousness.

791
01:11:42,486 --> 01:11:43,861
How did the accident happen?

792
01:11:44,013 --> 01:11:47,015
She might have been driving under the influence.

793
01:11:48,118 --> 01:11:49,286
She was drunk?

794
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:50,486
Impossible.

795
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:52,206
Khim is really careful about this.

796
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:56,086
Anyway, I'll have her stay in the ICU for tonight.

797
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:58,846
If it's necessary, we'll have to intubate her

798
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,486
as I reported to her husband.

799
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:04,726
- Husband? - Wait.

800
01:12:05,381 --> 01:12:06,846
Don't tell me

801
01:12:07,486 --> 01:12:09,006
the one who took Saikhim here...

802
01:12:09,138 --> 01:12:11,566
I had him sign the consent to medical treatment.

803
01:12:11,742 --> 01:12:14,206
You can consult among yourselves first.

804
01:12:14,574 --> 01:12:15,806
I'll excuse myself.

805
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,173
Who is he talking about?

806
01:12:26,646 --> 01:12:28,166
This is Mr. Carl.

807
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,966
Did he misunderstand something?

808
01:12:30,086 --> 01:12:31,366
You should know

809
01:12:32,093 --> 01:12:34,446
that Saikhim and Carl had married each other.

810
01:12:35,214 --> 01:12:38,646
But if they're together tonight, I don't know if it's still "had married".

811
01:12:38,942 --> 01:12:40,030
What do you mean?

812
01:12:40,127 --> 01:12:43,006
It means they're still husband and wife.

813
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:45,126
You almost became her affair partner.

814
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,366
You should know that.

815
01:13:02,645 --> 01:13:04,046
I thought you had gone back.

816
01:13:04,182 --> 01:13:06,406
Your wife is Ms. Khim.

817
01:13:07,086 --> 01:13:09,406
I wouldn't catch you if I didn't stay here.

818
01:13:09,949 --> 01:13:11,949
You took her to stay with you last night.

819
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:17,766
Today, I only wanted to expose Ms. Khim's lie.

820
01:13:17,905 --> 01:13:19,726
Do you know that you almost killed her?

821
01:13:20,397 --> 01:13:22,157
I didn't want it to be like this.

822
01:13:22,287 --> 01:13:24,206
The car suddenly moved forward.

823
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:27,369
Even if I was angry, I didn't kill anyone.

824
01:13:27,505 --> 01:13:29,926
I know that. I didn't blame you.

825
01:13:30,926 --> 01:13:34,606
No. Why did I have to get involved with this kind of problem?

826
01:13:34,741 --> 01:13:36,766
- Calm down, Claire. - Don't touch me.

827
01:13:37,102 --> 01:13:38,886
I didn't do it.

828
01:13:39,766 --> 01:13:41,126
I didn't do it.

829
01:13:41,846 --> 01:13:43,686
Why?

830
01:13:46,092 --> 01:13:47,886
If someone has to take responsibility,

831
01:13:48,486 --> 01:13:49,606
it should be me.

832
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:53,110
All karma should fall on me.

833
01:13:57,886 --> 01:14:00,486
Seven years ago, Ms. Khim eloped with that man.

834
01:14:01,453 --> 01:14:03,046
He wasn't Carl like today.

835
01:14:03,246 --> 01:14:05,406
He was just a poor kid

836
01:14:05,661 --> 01:14:06,966
whose name is Kaokla.

837
01:14:07,286 --> 01:14:08,286
Kaokla?

838
01:14:08,502 --> 01:14:10,286
Do you remember the incident?

839
01:14:11,631 --> 01:14:13,686
(The man who sneaked into your boat.)

840
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:15,966
Have you seen the man who was on the boat with us?

841
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:17,606
I haven't seen him.

842
01:14:17,774 --> 01:14:19,090
He followed us here.

843
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,725
He's probably a con artist.

844
01:14:21,006 --> 01:14:22,206
Really?

845
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,806
Ms. Khim was pregnant with his child.

846
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:27,486
Mr. Sin cut off their relationship for some time.

847
01:14:27,606 --> 01:14:29,286
But in the end, they couldn't stay together.

848
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:30,806
Ms. Khim had a miscarriage

849
01:14:31,293 --> 01:14:32,773
when Kaokla was dead in prison.

850
01:14:33,246 --> 01:14:35,186
We thought that everything was over.

851
01:14:35,502 --> 01:14:37,246
But he's actually alive.

852
01:14:38,013 --> 01:14:42,166
Ms. Khim just learned that Kaokla and Carl are the same people.

853
01:14:45,766 --> 01:14:47,686
(Your dark side will come out one day.)

854
01:14:47,975 --> 01:14:50,966
(You're only good at doing something behind people's backs.)

855
01:14:51,277 --> 01:14:53,606
She's good at using your sympathy to kill you.

856
01:14:54,413 --> 01:14:55,486
What are you saying?

857
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:56,766
You'll see.

858
01:14:57,182 --> 01:14:59,846
I'll expose your lies and deception.

859
01:15:00,207 --> 01:15:03,166
You'll know how horrible she is behind your back.

860
01:15:03,726 --> 01:15:06,926
You'll learn how the betrayal of love tastes one day.

861
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:08,886
Those two are going to divorce,

862
01:15:09,246 --> 01:15:11,086
but there's a problem with the matrimonial properties.

863
01:15:11,804 --> 01:15:13,926
When Ms. Khim accepted your proposal,

864
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:16,766
she didn't know that she was still married.

865
01:15:55,606 --> 01:15:57,086
If something happens to you,

866
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:59,686
I'll get you back in our next lives.

867
01:16:26,006 --> 01:16:27,406
How is Khim?

868
01:16:27,526 --> 01:16:28,846
She still hasn't woken up.

869
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:30,886
Has the doctor come to see her?

870
01:16:39,566 --> 01:16:41,686
Why has Khim been in trouble recently?

871
01:16:42,293 --> 01:16:43,886
You should ask Kla about that.

872
01:16:48,886 --> 01:16:50,766
So, you stopped me last night

873
01:16:50,966 --> 01:16:54,206
because you wanted to let Khim go back to her old husband.

874
01:16:55,981 --> 01:16:58,366
How many things are you hiding from me?

875
01:16:58,686 --> 01:17:00,286
You knew Khim has someone else,

876
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:01,853
but you're helping her hide it from me?

877
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:04,886
And so what? Did Khim's secret make you break up with her?

878
01:17:05,126 --> 01:17:06,606
Do I have that many choices?

879
01:17:06,846 --> 01:17:08,246
I'll be an idiot if I marry her.

880
01:17:08,526 --> 01:17:10,326
I'll be narrow-minded if I can't accept it.

881
01:17:10,837 --> 01:17:13,086
So, who's the selfish one?

882
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:14,356
What?

883
01:17:15,246 --> 01:17:16,646
Do you want Khim to die?

884
01:17:17,327 --> 01:17:18,979
To make everything end well for you.

885
01:17:19,149 --> 01:17:20,726
You'll get sympathy.

886
01:17:20,863 --> 01:17:22,446
You won't have to pretend to be nice.

887
01:17:22,965 --> 01:17:24,246
Do you want it to end like that?

888
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:27,846
Anything is fine for now.

889
01:17:28,734 --> 01:17:30,886
We just need Khim to wake up.

890
01:17:31,126 --> 01:17:33,766
If you love her, should these kinds of words

891
01:17:33,902 --> 01:17:35,646
come out of your mouth?

892
01:17:36,045 --> 01:17:37,806
I beg you, Thaen.

893
01:17:38,014 --> 01:17:40,646
When Khim wakes up, don't be mean to her.

894
01:17:40,806 --> 01:17:42,926
If she knows, it'll be hurtful for her

895
01:17:43,062 --> 01:17:45,246
to know that you aren't even that great.

896
01:17:52,206 --> 01:17:55,966
When someone can think and accept our bad parts

897
01:17:56,286 --> 01:17:58,686
without running away from us or hating us

898
01:17:58,782 --> 01:18:00,526
no matter how horrible we are,

899
01:18:00,701 --> 01:18:03,646
if someone can love us just as we are,

900
01:18:03,742 --> 01:18:05,366
that's called love.

901
01:18:06,047 --> 01:18:09,686
You should ask yourself if you've reached that point with Khim.

902
01:18:13,042 --> 01:18:14,042
Excuse me.

903
01:18:14,366 --> 01:18:15,859
Ms. Saikhim has woken up.

904
01:18:16,005 --> 01:18:17,646
You can go inside now.

905
01:18:25,406 --> 01:18:28,726
The doctor said her oxygen level is normal now.

906
01:18:28,966 --> 01:18:32,166
We'll move her to the special ward to receive further treatment.

907
01:18:32,366 --> 01:18:33,486
Thank you.

908
01:18:35,006 --> 01:18:36,006
Khim.

909
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,279
Are you hurt?

910
01:18:40,135 --> 01:18:43,766
I don't know how I got here.

911
01:18:44,326 --> 01:18:47,766
I only know that I fell unconscious while I was driving.

912
01:18:54,446 --> 01:18:55,886
Khim, you were drinking with Carl...

913
01:19:00,989 --> 01:19:02,189
Before you can get a divorce,

914
01:19:02,539 --> 01:19:04,286
I thought you would be gone first.

915
01:19:06,717 --> 01:19:08,286
I'm sorry.

916
01:19:09,106 --> 01:19:10,406
Take care of yourself.

917
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:12,006
Don't feel pressured about me.

918
01:19:12,134 --> 01:19:13,373
About our wedding,

919
01:19:13,599 --> 01:19:15,126
we can talk about it later.

920
01:19:26,065 --> 01:19:27,666
From the dashcam,

921
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,486
we can obviously see that they were chasing her.

922
01:19:32,031 --> 01:19:35,166
He wanted her to die to get all of the matrimonial properties.

923
01:19:35,445 --> 01:19:38,846
But the CCTV from the street shows that he didn't crash into her

924
01:19:39,134 --> 01:19:41,686
and Kaokla was the one who helped Ms. Khim.

925
01:19:41,862 --> 01:19:43,166
Help with her death, maybe.

926
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:46,083
They're working together.

927
01:19:46,223 --> 01:19:47,406
We're fortunate

928
01:19:48,285 --> 01:19:50,566
that Khim was lucky, so she survived.

929
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:55,366
Take action against him.

930
01:19:56,806 --> 01:20:00,606
If there's evidence of murder, he or his girlfriend

931
01:20:01,149 --> 01:20:02,686
will be prosecuted.

932
01:20:02,956 --> 01:20:04,086
I want to see

933
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:06,446
if he will let a woman admit the guilt.

934
01:20:06,726 --> 01:20:08,526
But if this becomes a scandal,

935
01:20:08,765 --> 01:20:11,049
it might affect Ms. Khim's wedding.

936
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:12,646
Then, let it be ruined.

937
01:20:13,006 --> 01:20:14,846
As long as Kla is still here,

938
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:18,246
do you think he would let Khim be happy?

939
01:20:24,885 --> 01:20:27,046
Sir suspects that this isn't an accident.

940
01:20:29,566 --> 01:20:33,365
I can't remember if there was a car following me.

941
01:20:33,485 --> 01:20:34,885
I can only remember that

942
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:39,486
I was so sleepy that I could fall asleep at any time.

943
01:20:39,758 --> 01:20:41,086
You couldn't remember that

944
01:20:41,174 --> 01:20:42,726
a car cut you off?

945
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:46,366
I can't really tell what happened last night.

946
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:49,190
The police are going to interrogate that side

947
01:20:49,646 --> 01:20:52,366
as we have a witness confirming that it was Ms. Claire.

948
01:20:53,086 --> 01:20:55,006
Sir thought that this accident

949
01:20:55,126 --> 01:20:57,326
can be used to sue him for divorce.

950
01:21:02,846 --> 01:21:04,526
They want to take action against us.

951
01:21:04,797 --> 01:21:06,246
What should I do?

952
01:21:07,126 --> 01:21:08,526
Do we need a lawyer?

953
01:21:08,678 --> 01:21:09,766
Don't worry.

954
01:21:10,046 --> 01:21:11,686
I'll negotiate with them.

955
01:21:11,926 --> 01:21:15,326
Remember. Don't risk her reputation with this matter.

956
01:21:15,534 --> 01:21:19,566
If people know it's about an affair, this will become a scandal.

957
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,326
Let's go.

958
01:21:28,286 --> 01:21:29,726
They've been waiting for a chance.

959
01:21:30,062 --> 01:21:32,306
They'll use this case to get back at us.

960
01:21:54,893 --> 01:21:56,046
How are you?

961
01:21:58,479 --> 01:21:59,646
It's still aching.

962
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:02,246
Claire knew that we were together.

963
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:04,478
When she followed you yesterday,

964
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:06,206
she might have overdone it.

965
01:22:06,981 --> 01:22:08,366
She's also regretful.

966
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,686
She didn't think it would be this bad.

967
01:22:11,183 --> 01:22:12,566
I know that.

968
01:22:12,766 --> 01:22:15,086
The police are building the case.

969
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:18,726
You're here for that, right?

970
01:22:19,414 --> 01:22:21,206
Can you not drag Claire involved?

971
01:22:22,055 --> 01:22:23,446
What do you mean?

972
01:22:23,892 --> 01:22:25,406
If you don't take action against Claire,

973
01:22:26,061 --> 01:22:27,766
I'll divorce you immediately.

974
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:32,206
I'm ready to end our relationship with no conditions.

975
01:22:33,117 --> 01:22:35,206
You won't demand anything from me.

976
01:22:36,038 --> 01:22:37,406
Both the matrimonial properties

977
01:22:37,725 --> 01:22:39,106
and time compensation.

978
01:22:40,046 --> 01:22:42,126
There won't be anything left between us.

979
01:22:43,206 --> 01:22:45,086
You can forget that we once loved each other.

980
01:22:48,285 --> 01:22:50,046
You only need to let Claire go.

981
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:56,286
You probably want to protect your girlfriend.

982
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:57,806
This wouldn't happen

983
01:22:58,071 --> 01:22:59,286
if I didn't lie to her.

984
01:23:03,526 --> 01:23:05,966
What if I was unfortunate and didn't wake up?

985
01:23:07,126 --> 01:23:09,046
You'll take the blame for her?

986
01:23:09,379 --> 01:23:10,886
I can do that.

987
01:23:13,246 --> 01:23:15,126
It's good that I didn't die.

988
01:23:16,813 --> 01:23:19,886
If I died, I wouldn't get to see you begging me like this.

989
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:21,766
I can even do more than this.

990
01:23:27,278 --> 01:23:29,006
I haven't had any meals.

991
01:23:30,716 --> 01:23:32,221
Can you really do everything?

992
01:25:11,726 --> 01:25:13,046
I got pins and needles.

993
01:26:01,726 --> 01:26:03,926
When I see that you can love someone this much,

994
01:26:05,468 --> 01:26:07,166
it's already worth it.

995
01:26:09,918 --> 01:26:11,086
Actions

996
01:26:11,822 --> 01:26:14,286
really can speak louder than words.

997
01:26:25,729 --> 01:26:27,486
This is our divorce contract.

998
01:26:28,446 --> 01:26:29,606
I've signed it.

999
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:31,566
If you sign it,

1000
01:26:31,973 --> 01:26:34,846
I'll submit our divorce at the district office.

1001
01:26:39,166 --> 01:26:42,126
When you feel better, you can come and sign the document.

1002
01:26:44,629 --> 01:26:46,006
This means

1003
01:26:47,437 --> 01:26:49,806
this might be the last time we will see each other.

1004
01:26:59,854 --> 01:27:01,446
Don't act like we haven't been separated.

1005
01:27:02,925 --> 01:27:04,925
We've been separated by death once.

1006
01:27:29,892 --> 01:27:30,909
What's wrong?

1007
01:27:59,366 --> 01:28:00,566
Where does it hurt?

1008
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:06,766
I guess the drugs wore off.

1009
01:28:08,828 --> 01:28:09,886
It hurts.

1010
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,206
Ms. Khim, what's wrong?

1011
01:28:23,342 --> 01:28:25,606
Ms. Khim, what's the matter?

1012
01:28:26,286 --> 01:28:27,526
What's wrong, Khim?

1013
01:28:27,967 --> 01:28:29,326
Are you here to make things worse?

1014
01:28:31,612 --> 01:28:33,966
Ms. Khim, what's wrong?

1015
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:36,366
What did he do to you?

1016
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:37,766
Ms. Khim.

1017
01:28:39,446 --> 01:28:40,606
Khim.

1018
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:20,486
If you don't go to apologize Saikhim,

1019
01:29:20,725 --> 01:29:22,046
I'll make you have no one left.

1020
01:29:22,182 --> 01:29:24,090
Why do I have to apologize to her?

1021
01:29:24,207 --> 01:29:25,733
Since I don't feel guilty.

1022
01:29:25,846 --> 01:29:27,326
Please send the ambulance right now.

1023
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:29,183
The patient is having a seizure.

1024
01:29:29,286 --> 01:29:30,286
Nate.

1025
01:29:30,526 --> 01:29:31,961
He was the one who helped me.

1026
01:29:32,086 --> 01:29:33,926
I thought he hated me.

1027
01:29:34,046 --> 01:29:36,126
Do you know where Kla is?

1028
01:29:36,247 --> 01:29:40,046
If you could choose, you probably didn't want me in your life.

1029
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:42,366
If we could go back to become strangers again,

1030
01:29:42,758 --> 01:29:43,886
that would be nice.

1031
01:29:44,002 --> 01:29:45,446
Why is Khim interested in that man?

1032
01:29:45,606 --> 01:29:48,526
Can you accept if I say she's addicted to "that thing"?

1033
01:29:48,646 --> 01:29:50,006
Get out of Khim's life.

1034
01:29:50,142 --> 01:29:52,246
I hope it'll go well for you when you don't have me.

1035
01:29:52,527 --> 01:29:54,086
You can't blame me anymore.

1036
01:29:54,461 --> 01:29:56,086
If she doesn't want to go on,

1037
01:29:56,446 --> 01:29:58,326
it means she still can't move on from me.
