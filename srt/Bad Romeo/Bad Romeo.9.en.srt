1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,093
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,174 --> 00:00:02,260
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,341 --> 00:00:03,523
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:44,717
They said you're dead.

5
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,126
I'm afraid I'm tenacious.

6
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:47,326
Why did you come here?

7
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:49,006
To watch my enemy die.

8
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,566
What is Prompt doing?

9
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:52,490
He asked his people to investigate Kaokla.

10
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:54,406
Don't go in. It might be his plan.

11
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,413
He made us suspect something.

12
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,326
When we break in, he'll put a charge against us.

13
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:00,366
So, you're a thief.

14
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:02,872
We had to teach you a lesson so you won't come here again.

15
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:06,446
I'll investigate why he wants to buy that house.

16
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:09,325
I'm good at below-the-belt stuff.

17
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:11,526
Should I let you stay here for a night as a test?

18
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:13,046
Please stay over tonight.

19
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,526
There'll be people who lose more than us.

20
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:19,166
I've never wanted to do any sin

21
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:21,762
until I want to curse you to death today!

22
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:27,326
(Technology exists to help make our lives convenient,)

23
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:32,086
(but it could never help our love become easier)

24
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:35,246
(We could see each other easily.)

25
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,366
(Love each other easily.)

26
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:40,934
(But it's harder to feel connected.)

27
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:46,406
You haven't gone back?

28
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,246
Can I go in with you?

29
00:03:58,094 --> 00:04:00,519
Is he really clean? He's just plain dirty.

30
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:04,742
Khim.

31
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:06,007
Khim.

32
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:07,366
Is something wrong?

33
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:09,926
I want to go back for now.

34
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,766
Khim, what...

35
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:29,206
I'll add aroma for you.

36
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:53,526
(Look at what I've found.)

37
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,566
(It looks like Kaokla and Thaenthai are doing business together.)

38
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:13,260
Thaen?

39
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:16,493
It's impossible.

40
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:26,846
Hey.

41
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,686
Hey.

42
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,142
He's quick to fall asleep.

43
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:41,646
(Khim, you're almost married. You should try acting like a wife for once.)

44
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:45,526
(If he's this nice to you, he might be hiding something from you.)

45
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:47,366
(You should try)

46
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:49,406
(to see whether he's hiding anything from you.)

47
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,046
(If you can't find it, don't marry him.)

48
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:10,962
Did you know that Thaenthai invested in Kaokla's business?

49
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:14,086
Thaen hasn't talked about work that much.

50
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:18,486
Doesn't he know that you are fighting with Kla?

51
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:26,504
I can't bother Thaen's work with my personal problem.

52
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:33,566
When we asked him to invest in a hotel with us,

53
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:35,086
he wasn't interested.

54
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:38,126
I think Thaenthai doesn't respect us anymore.

55
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:41,606
He probably doesn't want us to know, so he's been hiding it.

56
00:07:42,023 --> 00:07:44,446
It's like he's taking Khim for granted.

57
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:45,966
He doesn't care about you.

58
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:47,966
We can't blame him one-sidedly.

59
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,406
Khim is also hiding something from him.

60
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:54,486
You shouldn't tell that you're Kaokla's ex-lover.

61
00:07:56,966 --> 00:08:00,446
Would my daughter meet any sincere man?

62
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:02,566
Every man seems to always trick you.

63
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:38,406
Kla.

64
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,926
So, do you want me to accept the bank's offer?

65
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:48,846
Okay.

66
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:51,726
Let's see whether we can make them paranoid of each other.

67
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,520
If they don't only care about benefits,

68
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:54,966
this won't do anything to them.

69
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,333
Impossible.

70
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:58,926
That family wants to catch me. Last time,

71
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:00,966
they invited me to go on a cruise.

72
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:03,166
He's getting married soon.

73
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:05,646
They still made that kind of move.

74
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,566
A woman like Saikhim doesn't deserve good love.

75
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:12,486
She might not have a chance to get married.

76
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:33,966
Khim.

77
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,526
What are you doing here?

78
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,634
I want to see you, Thaen.

79
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,286
You should call me when you want to see me.

80
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:43,886
I almost went out.

81
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:48,606
I just passed by here to run errands.

82
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:54,646
Thaen, are you going out for work?

83
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:57,006
Isn't today a holiday?

84
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:00,006
I have some meetings today.

85
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,246
Is it that urgent?

86
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:06,606
Do you want to stay in my room?

87
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,686
I'll rush back after I'm done with work.

88
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,166
It's alright.

89
00:10:13,397 --> 00:10:15,086
You should go to work.

90
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:21,749
Khim.

91
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:31,726
I'll call you after my work is done.

92
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:33,606
Don't worry.

93
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:37,366
Your work is the most important thing.

94
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:39,766
I can't compare my girlfriend with my work.

95
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,846
I have to for a meeting with Carl's company.

96
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,766
It's my dad's project, Khim.

97
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,486
We don't know whether we will cooperate.

98
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,966
I haven't told you

99
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:01,246
because I see that you're having a problem with him.

100
00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:04,286
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.

101
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,806
Why are you telling me this?

102
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,246
I don't want you to learn this from someone else.

103
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:12,046
I don't want you to be paranoid

104
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:15,326
or feel uncomfortable with words from those who hate us.

105
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:25,164
Thank you, Thaen.

106
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:28,646
There's only you left who is sincere with me.

107
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:55,926
I heard you met with Kidakarn. How was it?

108
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,046
They must be shocked that you're still alive.

109
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:01,597
I don't know. I don't care about them.

110
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:06,606
You came back here to get back at them, didn't you?

111
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:08,406
It's a coincidence.

112
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,406
I've never cared about them.

113
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:15,468
Then, you must be serious with your love this time.

114
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,726
It can make you forget Saikhim.

115
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,966
Saikhim has never meant anything to me after that day.

116
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:27,846
Didn't you have to go to the police station?

117
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:30,406
Didn't you want to get involved with her again?

118
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,046
Don't worry about my old flame.

119
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:36,206
If you don't like it, who would dare to go against you?

120
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:39,086
What if I say I don't like Claire?

121
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:42,406
Would you dare to break up with her?

122
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:51,766
Why would that be difficult?

123
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,846
There's nothing I can't do for you.

124
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,726
I hope it's true.

125
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,246
I'm tired

126
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:31,566
of hypocrites.

127
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:34,006
Claire is a really cute girl.

128
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,197
I'll introduce her to you sometimes.

129
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,206
You must love her so much

130
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:41,566
if you said that.

131
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:46,366
You could say I'm smitten with her.

132
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,406
Can you feel my love?

133
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:58,966
What about the historic house?

134
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:00,606
How's the progress?

135
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:02,806
I met the owner.

136
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,081
And what?

137
00:14:04,492 --> 00:14:08,046
Is it suitable to be our first boutique hotel?

138
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:11,966
It's beautiful, but I think it can be even better than that.

139
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:16,166
It's not as worth as making it a hotel

140
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,886
to compete with our rival.

141
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:22,446
A new hotel on the opposite side of Kidakarn's hotel.

142
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:26,726
Aside from getting money, we can make them feel humiliated.

143
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,326
I haven't thought about this

144
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:30,326
as the owner didn't want to sell it yet.

145
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:33,566
I asked you to work, not to just talk.

146
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,829
Don't you realize that you're doing a business?

147
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:39,806
I'm starting to wonder if you're worried about Saikhim.

148
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:41,103
No.

149
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:43,646
I've never cared about them

150
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:45,926
and have never thought to lower myself to them.

151
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,086
Then, it must be because

152
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:51,246
you only focus on doing your app.

153
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:54,126
That's why you didn't want to do what I asked you to do.

154
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,966
Do you still respect me?

155
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,166
I might have to teach you a lot of lessons

156
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,006
like the first day of your job.

157
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,966
I had to teach you how to tie a tie.

158
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:29,086
Don't you think it's a waste

159
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:34,606
to not get what your dad has left for you?

160
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,726
Don't you want to accept your dad's legacy?

161
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,086
You're born to be his son.

162
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,286
Don't make him lose his dignity.

163
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:12,421
Khem.

164
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,966
What are you wearing?

165
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:17,326
A leash.

166
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,077
Someone tried to put it on me.

167
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:24,381
- What are you doing? - Lady asked me to get rid of your dad's stuff.

168
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:36,006
Right.

169
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:38,286
There's something interesting.

170
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:41,360
There is a document that she intentionally destroyed.

171
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:44,098
I tried to put it together, but I couldn't read it.

172
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:48,286
So, I checked your dad's computer.

173
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,366
And I was right. I found this document.

174
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:55,766
Take these boxes.

175
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:09,326
I have to use a decipher program

176
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:12,926
to learn that this is your dad's will.

177
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,326
She said there wasn't any will.

178
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:16,766
There is.

179
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:19,326
And there is your mom's name.

180
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:28,246
(Your dad intended to give you his inheritance,)

181
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,286
(but Lady intentionally didn't use this will)

182
00:17:31,526 --> 00:17:33,046
(as she's afraid you would get your share.)

183
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:34,726
(Are you sure?)

184
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:37,646
(She adopted you as her son)

185
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:40,192
(to block you from her husband's inheritance.)

186
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:43,366
(She intentionally took your inheritance)

187
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:46,086
(for herself and her real son.)

188
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:48,366
(A kiss after a kick.)

189
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:52,046
(There wouldn't be any woman who can control my life.)

190
00:18:03,326 --> 00:18:04,766
I took all of them.

191
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,285
I volunteered to get rid of them.

192
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:09,326
If that will is real,

193
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:11,686
this woman is more dangerous.

194
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,566
Thaen has admitted

195
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:30,646
that he's partnering up with Kaokla.

196
00:18:32,173 --> 00:18:34,486
He told you and you believed him?

197
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:36,886
The woman that you saw

198
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,726
is Kaokla's sister. Thaen wouldn't think anything of her.

199
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:45,006
What I'm worried about is that Thaen might get tricked by them.

200
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:48,246
Even if he doesn't like her face, he might like her money.

201
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:50,246
We all like money.

202
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,966
You said it like you don't know Thaen well.

203
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,286
So, you would let him off?

204
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,486
Hey.

205
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:02,286
You don't have to act kind just because you're afraid he wouldn't love you.

206
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:07,886
The worse a woman is, the more love a man will have. Understand?

207
00:19:16,182 --> 00:19:19,126
If I'm bad and only attract those kinds of men,

208
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:21,046
I don't want it.

209
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,206
He would never stop bothering.

210
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:34,126
If I get to build a new condo, I'll ask you to design the penthouse.

211
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:35,526
Which condo?

212
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:38,606
Oh, Saikhim hasn't told you?

213
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:41,566
We're building a condo opposite our hotel.

214
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:46,126
I want you to help decorate it

215
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:50,206
to be our house together.

216
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:57,206
You still can't be cured of your delusion.

217
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,566
If you want me to be cured,

218
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,726
someone has to help me fulfill it.

219
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,446
Seriously. Where did you get this kind of confidence?

220
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,206
You'll see.

221
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:19,966
In the end, you can't run away from me.

222
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:23,606
We're compatible because we know each other well.

223
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:41,815
I couldn't believe that you could stand this kind of man.

224
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:43,918
What? Do I look like I could stand him?

225
00:20:44,486 --> 00:20:47,846
Even if he's the only man left, I wouldn't want him.

226
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:49,766
That's a relief then.

227
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,520
Don't fall for him.

228
00:20:58,094 --> 00:20:59,406
Prompt is inside.

229
00:20:59,694 --> 00:21:01,126
We should go somewhere else.

230
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:03,400
He's ready to insult you.

231
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:04,966
Let's go.

232
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:08,806
Even if you can trick Khim today,

233
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,046
it doesn't mean you can trick her forever.

234
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,790
You should mind your problem first.

235
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:19,813
Hey.

236
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,086
That two-faced guy. You don't realize that you've gotten Kaokla's leftover.

237
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,966
Are you still serving her? Look at him.

238
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:51,806
(Dad, I received your vegetables.)

239
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:54,246
Do you want me to do photosynthesis by myself or what?

240
00:21:54,926 --> 00:21:56,446
You sent me too much.

241
00:21:58,286 --> 00:22:00,006
(I sent them to strengthen you.)

242
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:02,374
Consider it your seventh anniversary

243
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:04,326
of your reborn.

244
00:22:04,726 --> 00:22:06,286
(You got a new life.)

245
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:08,286
You have to love your life.

246
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:14,446
Kla!

247
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:16,006
You can't die!

248
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:19,806
Kla!

249
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:21,606
Don't give up!

250
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:23,766
You can't die, Kla!

251
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:32,286
I have to use a decipher program to learn that this is your dad's will.

252
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:34,677
She intentionally took your inheritance

253
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:36,869
for herself and her real son.

254
00:22:39,598 --> 00:22:41,166
(I don't want you to be careless.)

255
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:43,086
You had a chance to wake up.

256
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:47,486
I know that.

257
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,006
(You have to be grateful to your stepmother.)

258
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,006
(She revived you back.)

259
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,246
(If it wasn't for her,)

260
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:54,846
you wouldn't have today.

261
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:58,206
Is she still kind to you?

262
00:22:58,485 --> 00:22:59,766
Don't worry.

263
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:02,166
I won't forget what she did.

264
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,686
I'll pay back twice for everything she's done.

265
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:33,486
(Opening the door.)

266
00:23:38,326 --> 00:23:39,366
Hello?

267
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:41,366
I've checked the computer.

268
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:44,646
Lady called me to tell us to hurry up with the boutique hotel.

269
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:47,766
She said she would find an architect to renovate that house.

270
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:50,126
Boutique hotel?

271
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,486
She sent an example of the design she liked.

272
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:54,046
It's on the computer.

273
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:55,486
I'll get it for you.

274
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:24,726
(Opening the door.)

275
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,486
Hello.

276
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:53,886
Hello.

277
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:55,726
I'm the one who called for a maid.

278
00:24:56,743 --> 00:24:59,246
Can you clean my room when I'm not around?

279
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,966
Yes.

280
00:25:01,072 --> 00:25:03,126
(Probably around three or four hours.)

281
00:25:03,526 --> 00:25:05,126
I'll be back in the evening.

282
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:08,006
Please look after my room and tidy up my clothes.

283
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,446
I'll send you my room number and details.

284
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:13,686
Sure.

285
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:35,366
(Eighth floor B88/3)

286
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:44,286
The owner is an old noble, so you have to visit them yourself.

287
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:47,566
I don't want them to feel like we're there to buy his house.

288
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:50,206
I want them to feel like we're visiting our relatives.

289
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:52,026
I don't want to rush them.

290
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:53,413
Kla.

291
00:25:54,229 --> 00:25:57,166
They might need money and want to sell the house.

292
00:25:59,886 --> 00:26:01,526
If we're that direct with them,

293
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,166
they'll think we're throwing money at them.

294
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:07,006
We won't do it like those greedy Kidakarn.

295
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:10,686
We won't be like those who only want money.

296
00:26:12,966 --> 00:26:14,366
What a bad mouth.

297
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:26,806
I got to talk about a project with your sister.

298
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,766
Kloyjai is new with investment. Please advise her if you can.

299
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:32,686
No problem.

300
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:35,166
I believe that you two are compatible.

301
00:26:40,164 --> 00:26:41,286
Yes.

302
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:14,646
(Welcome.)

303
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:52,982
This is Indian gooseberry.

304
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:55,966
It's a traditional fruit that can cure some diseases.

305
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:58,486
- I want to give you this. - Thank you.

306
00:27:58,598 --> 00:28:02,086
Thank you for giving it to me.

307
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:03,726
My dad has a farm in the countryside.

308
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,526
He made me only eat healthy food.

309
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:08,848
I see. There's also that basket.

310
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:10,966
How could we eat all of them?

311
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:13,646
That opposite hotel

312
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:15,286
just gave us that.

313
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,686
They sent their people to us.

314
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:20,446
They want to buy this land of mine

315
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:22,157
to build a condominium.

316
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:24,006
Come on.

317
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:26,246
- Let's go. - Come inside.

318
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:28,646
Come.

319
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:31,046
To build a condominium?

320
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:34,006
Yes. But let me tell you this.

321
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,846
I don't think I will sell it to them

322
00:28:37,086 --> 00:28:41,566
because I think I want to die in this place.

323
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:43,286
Don't say that.

324
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:48,206
Okay. Since you two are here,

325
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,114
- I think, Chor. - Yes.

326
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,446
You go and make Indian gooseberry chili paste.

327
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,926
Let them try it, alright?

328
00:28:56,157 --> 00:28:57,846
- Yes. - Isn't that good?

329
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,640
Have you ever tried it before?

330
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:01,999
My mouth is watering now.

331
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,766
Good. Then, wait for a moment.

332
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:07,006
- Go make it for them. Quick. - Yes.

333
00:29:23,518 --> 00:29:24,718
Not his real name.

334
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,166
His birthday?

335
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,526
His ID numbers?

336
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:48,446
It's the last chance now.

337
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:59,661
Is he trying to avoid my face? If he's still inside...

338
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:23,406
He isn't here.

339
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:32,206
Then, it's easy for me to seduce him.

340
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:47,406
Don't notify him.

341
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:50,886
Why am I so unlucky?

342
00:31:02,046 --> 00:31:03,286
Someone tried to open my computer.

343
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,126
Your computer is in your room.

344
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:07,846
Who got inside?

345
00:31:19,886 --> 00:31:21,286
Hello.

346
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,166
Are you in my room?

347
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:29,006
I arrived and ran into your girlfriend.

348
00:31:29,246 --> 00:31:31,246
- My girlfriend? - Yes.

349
00:31:31,402 --> 00:31:34,886
A small woman. She looks rich and pretty.

350
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:38,499
She's also wearing a revealing outfit.

351
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:39,926
She's not my girlfriend.

352
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:42,406
It's fine. I'll deal with it myself.

353
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,698
Hello? What's wrong?

354
00:31:54,822 --> 00:31:56,166
What are you doing in my room?

355
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:02,486
You told me that I could come here when I'm hungry.

356
00:32:02,925 --> 00:32:04,446
Aren't you going to keep your word?

357
00:32:04,582 --> 00:32:06,086
When did I tell you that?

358
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:08,966
Why did you touch my computer?

359
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:12,486
No. I just touched it when I placed some of my stuff.

360
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,206
Stop using dirty tricks to get my information.

361
00:32:16,606 --> 00:32:19,046
Is Kidakarn too stupid to fight fairly?

362
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:22,726
(Mark my words. Your condo can't go anywhere.)

363
00:32:22,846 --> 00:32:25,886
Get out of my room and return the keycard.

364
00:32:26,086 --> 00:32:27,646
(If you're still bothering me,)

365
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:30,086
I'll remove your friend's room from the system

366
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,086
as it lacks security.

367
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,206
Fine.

368
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:55,646
They haven't learned.

369
00:32:56,046 --> 00:32:58,126
They still dared to get into your room.

370
00:32:58,526 --> 00:33:00,366
We're fighting against a cornered dog.

371
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,406
It's more aggressive than I thought.

372
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:05,646
We have an advantage from here.

373
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:09,286
It's done.

374
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,686
Come here. Bring it to them.

375
00:33:13,046 --> 00:33:15,646
- Place it on the table. - Can I have a seat?

376
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:18,446
Sure. Please have a seat.

377
00:33:18,726 --> 00:33:20,406
Have a seat.

378
00:33:20,806 --> 00:33:22,926
This is it.

379
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:25,966
Indian gooseberry chili paste.

380
00:33:26,094 --> 00:33:27,126
It looks tasty.

381
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,806
Eat a lot of them.

382
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:33,726
When you're finished, please tell me

383
00:33:33,926 --> 00:33:37,326
whether this recipe is good. If it's good,

384
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,216
I'll record it.

385
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:40,606
Here you are.

386
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:44,549
What's this?

387
00:33:44,837 --> 00:33:47,819
This is my recipe book.

388
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:51,206
You can say it's my family's recipe.

389
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:53,366
Can I look at it?

390
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:54,806
Sure.

391
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:58,126
You can look at it. They're all my recipes.

392
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,966
If you want to make a recipe book,

393
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,406
- I'll help you. - Really?

394
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:08,046
We just have to gradually type them out.

395
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:11,566
Then, we'll check it later to see if we miss anything.

396
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,839
Thank you so much.

397
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,117
But you two,

398
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,726
do you really have time to do it for me?

399
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,966
I'll gladly do it if I get to eat your delicious food from your recipe.

400
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:23,206
Okay. Then, please do that.

401
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,606
Eat all of them.

402
00:34:24,757 --> 00:34:27,126
- So, you'll have the strength to... - That's okay now.

403
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:28,797
- Sure. - Thank you.

404
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:05,406
You watch your man all day long. Are you afraid that he might get away?

405
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:09,726
I'm afraid he might only come back when it's convenient for him like you.

406
00:35:10,718 --> 00:35:12,518
All of your family knows it then.

407
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:16,566
Having clean food does nothing

408
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,966
if your behavior is still like this.

409
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:23,606
What kind of a clean woman likes to break into my room?

410
00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:26,046
Don't use be contradictory.

411
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:30,126
You're using your body to investigate a rival. You're so good, aren't you?

412
00:35:30,622 --> 00:35:32,446
When you come and go out of my room like this,

413
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,926
I'm afraid you'll go into the wrong room someday.

414
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:36,726
What I already spat out,

415
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:38,766
I don't want to waste my mouth with it again.

416
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:41,486
Kla.

417
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:43,206
Who did you call?

418
00:35:44,566 --> 00:35:46,046
Who did I call?

419
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,326
I'm Carl.

420
00:36:16,288 --> 00:36:18,023
(Carl)

421
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:19,846
What do you want again?

422
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,006
What...

423
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:32,366
Is there something wrong?

424
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:34,206
I want to thank you.

425
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,086
I have something else to ask of you.

426
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:39,326
(I have to work in Shanghai all week long.)

427
00:36:39,518 --> 00:36:41,526
Do you normally cook for yourself?

428
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:44,126
What would you like?

429
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:48,126
I have a lot of organic vegetables in my boxes and my fridge.

430
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,486
You can take them if you don't mind.

431
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:52,566
(They're from my dad's farm.)

432
00:36:52,781 --> 00:36:54,086
(It's a waste to throw them away.)

433
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:55,806
I'll give them to you.

434
00:36:56,093 --> 00:36:59,966
In exchange, you have to take care of my mushrooms when I'm away.

435
00:37:07,303 --> 00:37:08,486
Of course.

436
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:09,846
Thank you.

437
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,646
Since you've cleaned my room, I can relax now.

438
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,126
You'll get to relax later.

439
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:46,566
How can I bring this reserve battery with me?

440
00:37:47,326 --> 00:37:50,526
When I'm tired, I get more strength when I think of you.

441
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:52,886
I don't know how I'll get a life force.

442
00:37:53,294 --> 00:37:55,606
I want you to stay beside me to charge me up.

443
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:58,046
Then,

444
00:37:58,573 --> 00:38:00,886
I'll charge you up with my energy.

445
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,229
What?

446
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,190
I just came back. The energy isn't enough.

447
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:07,846
I'm still tired.

448
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:09,526
What should I do?

449
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,846
Can I reserve my battery energy?

450
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:41,543
(I'll leave them to you.)

451
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:48,160
(Enjoy your meal.)

452
00:39:13,244 --> 00:39:14,966
Mr. Carl isn't living alone.

453
00:39:15,325 --> 00:39:16,766
There's a woman with him.

454
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:21,326
It's Saikhim. What was she doing over there?

455
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:34,566
Keep your eye on them.

456
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,246
I have to know what their relationship is.

457
00:39:37,382 --> 00:39:38,518
Okay.

458
00:39:50,189 --> 00:39:54,386
Today, we'll talk about cloud systems for accommodation booking.

459
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,166
Customers can look up the details, price...

460
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:17,206
(No new notification)

461
00:41:16,214 --> 00:41:17,966
I gave my vote to you.

462
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:20,806
You'll get the crown this year.

463
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,482
For Woman of the Year's award,

464
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:25,686
you'll surely get it.

465
00:41:26,638 --> 00:41:29,126
Look at who I'm competing against.

466
00:41:29,941 --> 00:41:31,125
Look.

467
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:35,926
We're competing against each other.

468
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:37,686
How could I win against Khim?

469
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:38,926
Gosh.

470
00:41:39,846 --> 00:41:41,246
Then, just forget it.

471
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:43,166
I don't want this award anymore.

472
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:47,326
Because at least if it's about your boyfriend,

473
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:50,966
I think you can win against Khim in that aspect.

474
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:53,686
Khim's dad is possessive of her.

475
00:41:53,806 --> 00:41:55,486
It's difficult for her to have one.

476
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:58,606
Mom, Khim is getting married soon.

477
00:41:59,758 --> 00:42:01,606
What? Getting married?

478
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,606
It's her second marriage. Meanwhile,

479
00:42:05,758 --> 00:42:08,406
you don't even have a boyfriend.

480
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,366
But don't give up just yet.

481
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,486
The matter of husbands isn't certain.

482
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:19,865
Your soulmate

483
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:22,086
is in front of our door.

484
00:42:22,685 --> 00:42:25,006
- Look at him. - Don't tell me

485
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:26,926
you found someone for me again?

486
00:42:27,246 --> 00:42:29,206
I told you to not force anyone on me.

487
00:42:29,326 --> 00:42:31,526
I didn't call this one for you.

488
00:42:31,669 --> 00:42:34,126
My customer saw that you're a nominee for the Woman of the Year award.

489
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:36,366
She said this man is suitable for you.

490
00:42:36,486 --> 00:42:38,446
So, I invited him to our salon as my customer.

491
00:42:39,525 --> 00:42:41,046
What's this, Mom?

492
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:42,206
Welcome him yourself.

493
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:45,366
I'm tired of your test. Goodbye.

494
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:46,886
Bye.

495
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:48,526
This daughter of mine.

496
00:42:53,606 --> 00:42:55,526
He's so handsome.

497
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,726
Is this Lita's house?

498
00:43:03,621 --> 00:43:06,166
I'm tired of it. Why does she need to bother?

499
00:43:06,414 --> 00:43:09,086
If I have to date a normal man, it's better not to date one.

500
00:43:11,303 --> 00:43:12,638
What's with Mom?

501
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,406
Lita.

502
00:43:15,686 --> 00:43:17,286
A guest is here to see you.

503
00:43:23,942 --> 00:43:26,086
Come down here. Quick.

504
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:29,206
I'll go back.

505
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,926
I shouldn't have come here.

506
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:37,286
Why did he call me so much?

507
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:46,246
I'm sorry that I didn't call you for the appointment before.

508
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,775
Am I bothering you?

509
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,086
No.

510
00:43:50,246 --> 00:43:52,966
You can call me like your mother. Don't mind it.

511
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:54,406
You're...

512
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:55,566
I'm Thaenthai.

513
00:43:56,726 --> 00:43:59,206
Your name is also handsome.

514
00:43:59,856 --> 00:44:00,856
What is your job?

515
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:02,206
I'm working at a bank.

516
00:44:02,486 --> 00:44:03,486
Oh.

517
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:05,926
Here.

518
00:44:07,326 --> 00:44:08,726
(Theanthai Tulanont)

519
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:13,406
That's why you look dignified.

520
00:44:13,646 --> 00:44:16,966
Please come here. Since you're already here.

521
00:44:17,126 --> 00:44:19,126
Come here.

522
00:44:19,238 --> 00:44:20,696
Have a seat.

523
00:44:20,806 --> 00:44:22,806
Please lay down.

524
00:44:22,966 --> 00:44:24,446
Lay down.

525
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,126
We're going to improve your look.

526
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:29,975
When Lita comes down,

527
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:32,566
I'll make Lita scream when she sees you.

528
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,766
Take off your glasses.

529
00:44:35,397 --> 00:44:36,926
Since you work at a bank,

530
00:44:37,229 --> 00:44:39,286
you probably can transfer some money.

531
00:44:39,565 --> 00:44:43,366
- What did you say? - You must be ready to pay up.

532
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,046
- Can I borrow 1,000 baht? - Huh?

533
00:44:48,445 --> 00:44:50,210
Well, I would like you

534
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:54,381
to give some votes to Lita for Woman of the Year award.

535
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:58,108
Lita is afraid she will lose to her close friend who's in the final round.

536
00:44:58,247 --> 00:45:02,406
I have to ask people in my province to vote for her.

537
00:45:10,854 --> 00:45:12,326
- Excuse me. - Yes.

538
00:45:14,622 --> 00:45:15,726
Where are you?

539
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:18,826
Hello?

540
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:22,486
- Hello? - Hello?

541
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:24,646
- Hello? - Hello?

542
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:27,886
- Hello? - Where are you going?

543
00:45:28,086 --> 00:45:29,446
Mom?

544
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:33,446
You.

545
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,686
Why didn't you tell me you were coming? You let her touch you.

546
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:41,086
You almost got a new mother-in-law.

547
00:45:41,246 --> 00:45:42,886
Did you answer my call then?

548
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:45,766
Why did you come here?

549
00:45:47,093 --> 00:45:49,526
- It's about my dad and Khim. - What did you say?

550
00:45:51,007 --> 00:45:52,846
It's about my dad and Khim.

551
00:45:53,193 --> 00:45:55,246
I can't hear you. Say it again.

552
00:45:57,966 --> 00:45:59,566
It's about my dad and Khim.

553
00:46:04,774 --> 00:46:07,606
That your dad wants a richer daughter-in-law than Saikhim?

554
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:09,625
Who would dare?

555
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,606
Don't tell Khim about this.

556
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:14,686
If your dad doesn't go to ask for Saikhim's hand,

557
00:46:14,894 --> 00:46:16,678
Khim will learn of it soon one day.

558
00:46:16,797 --> 00:46:19,406
My dad didn't hate the idea. He only has a bias.

559
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,103
If Khim feels bad about my family,

560
00:46:21,254 --> 00:46:23,254
she will hesitate about our wedding.

561
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:32,206
Do you have hush money?

562
00:46:34,006 --> 00:46:36,166
I'll vote for you with 10,000 baht.

563
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:39,086
You want it right? Woman of the Year's award.

564
00:46:43,038 --> 00:46:44,766
Please help me with my charade.

565
00:46:45,614 --> 00:46:50,126
Help me stop my mom from finding men. If you can chase off a man today,

566
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:51,686
I assure you that

567
00:46:52,446 --> 00:46:56,886
I won't tell anyone about your dad.

568
00:46:57,095 --> 00:46:58,606
Hello.

569
00:47:10,814 --> 00:47:12,205
I have an appointment.

570
00:47:18,526 --> 00:47:19,603
Hello.

571
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:22,717
You can't see him.

572
00:47:28,663 --> 00:47:30,046
Can you see now?

573
00:47:30,246 --> 00:47:31,566
It's that guy.

574
00:47:36,206 --> 00:47:38,206
- Okay. - Good.

575
00:47:44,218 --> 00:47:46,825
I heard you just moved here.

576
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:49,225
Yes. I moved to be a school principal.

577
00:47:49,309 --> 00:47:54,126
Really? Then, you probably love children.

578
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:58,446
Here. Let's take couple photos.

579
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:05,932
- One, two, three. - Ready?

580
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:08,624
Please smile.

581
00:48:08,777 --> 00:48:10,126
One, two, three.

582
00:48:10,215 --> 00:48:11,966
Turn your head here.

583
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:14,218
Come closer. Touch my cheek.

584
00:48:14,406 --> 00:48:16,656
Please look straight.

585
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:18,846
- Is it short enough? - That's enough.

586
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:24,326
Mr. Principal, I was wondering

587
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:26,766
if you have gone to the market.

588
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,166
Who will cook for you if you live by yourself?

589
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:30,566
Well...

590
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:32,446
I'm hungry now.

591
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:35,010
What should we order this evening?

592
00:48:35,097 --> 00:48:38,766
Oh, my. If you're hungry, you can come to have a meal with us.

593
00:48:38,968 --> 00:48:41,926
I'm having a headache. It's so hot today.

594
00:48:42,046 --> 00:48:44,526
Can you massage me?

595
00:48:45,373 --> 00:48:48,326
Massage me. Strongly.

596
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:56,646
Wow. It's so good. It's comfortable.

597
00:49:01,886 --> 00:49:03,686
It's done, Mr. Principal.

598
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:05,806
It's done.

599
00:49:06,406 --> 00:49:07,966
I'll excuse myself now.

600
00:49:33,078 --> 00:49:34,406
Thank you.

601
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:41,086
Hey! My goodness.

602
00:49:41,286 --> 00:49:43,766
Why don't you continue that upstairs?

603
00:49:43,886 --> 00:49:46,406
Not only you can transfer the money,

604
00:49:46,524 --> 00:49:48,806
but you can transfer her heart too.

605
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:50,446
Transfer my heart?

606
00:49:53,766 --> 00:49:57,606
Mr. Principal, don't forget to take your change.

607
00:50:08,781 --> 00:50:11,886
Don't forget what you've promised me.

608
00:50:30,646 --> 00:50:31,806
Hey.

609
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:12,966
It's normal to fall in love with a man as perfect as that.

610
00:51:13,621 --> 00:51:14,885
Mom.

611
00:51:15,821 --> 00:51:17,021
What are you saying?

612
00:51:17,926 --> 00:51:20,784
Your eyes sparkled when you were with him.

613
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,446
Do you think I didn't notice?

614
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:26,306
A rich man like him wouldn't leave Saikhim.

615
00:51:26,742 --> 00:51:31,046
Well, it's just an act to teach you a lesson, Mom.

616
00:51:31,286 --> 00:51:34,206
Do you think I would be serious with him?

617
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:54,446
(You only want what you don't have.)

618
00:51:54,686 --> 00:51:58,566
(That's why you didn't feel happy with what you have.)

619
00:52:05,494 --> 00:52:07,406
(When you're jealous,)

620
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:09,366
(it's a sign that you believe that)

621
00:52:09,997 --> 00:52:11,446
(you're not as good as Saikhim.)

622
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:19,246
(A smart)

623
00:52:19,454 --> 00:52:20,606
(and impressive woman)

624
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:23,126
(must have more self-confidence.)

625
00:52:26,206 --> 00:52:30,726
(My daughter is good enough to steal someone else's belongings.)

626
00:52:52,726 --> 00:52:55,806
If no one loves us, we have to love ourselves.

627
00:53:01,502 --> 00:53:03,246
I love Khim, Mom.

628
00:53:03,606 --> 00:53:05,806
But I couldn't help but compare myself to her.

629
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:08,286
She can get everything easily in her life.

630
00:53:08,581 --> 00:53:10,581
When I think of that, it's more upsetting

631
00:53:10,726 --> 00:53:12,606
when Khim made me feel like

632
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,486
I'm a villain.

633
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,926
No one's life is easy.

634
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:19,886
Khim also has her own problems.

635
00:53:21,677 --> 00:53:24,366
(This world sends a good man to Saikhim)

636
00:53:24,566 --> 00:53:27,686
(to compensate for her dad's distorted love.)

637
00:53:28,598 --> 00:53:30,598
(Saikhim has no one she can love,)

638
00:53:30,757 --> 00:53:34,246
(so she has to behave nicely to make her dad proud of her.)

639
00:53:35,437 --> 00:53:38,875
(As for you, no matter how ridiculous you are,)

640
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:40,726
(I've never blamed you once.)

641
00:53:41,126 --> 00:53:42,406
(Having someone who loves you)

642
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:45,726
(without having to ask for it is extremely fortunate.)

643
00:53:46,637 --> 00:53:47,886
(This is one thing)

644
00:53:48,015 --> 00:53:49,806
(that Khim is less fortunate than you.)

645
00:53:58,229 --> 00:54:01,726
You have more love than her. You should share some with her.

646
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:07,606
If you don't want to be the villainess of the year,

647
00:54:07,901 --> 00:54:09,846
stop being jealous of Saikhim.

648
00:54:10,388 --> 00:54:13,126
Let your friend have good love.

649
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:16,326
Speaking of which, actually,

650
00:54:16,805 --> 00:54:18,346
a silent man like him,

651
00:54:18,574 --> 00:54:20,126
if you have to stay with him,

652
00:54:20,765 --> 00:54:23,846
it's boring. He looked too serious.

653
00:54:24,246 --> 00:54:25,606
For my daughter,

654
00:54:25,723 --> 00:54:28,626
she deserves someone spicy.

655
00:54:30,515 --> 00:54:32,957
Our family is the home of spicy girls.

656
00:54:45,318 --> 00:54:46,646
- Mr. Sin. - What?

657
00:54:46,806 --> 00:54:49,766
I found the loophole in Kaokla's Arsa app.

658
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,566
Someone used his app to do illegal activities.

659
00:54:52,871 --> 00:54:55,966
- How? - Tourists begin to find local guides

660
00:54:56,286 --> 00:54:58,326
which makes it difficult to control illegal guides.

661
00:54:58,486 --> 00:54:59,681
As for the car drivers,

662
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:02,846
people start to use their personal cars for public transportation,

663
00:55:03,325 --> 00:55:05,686
the same like the app that was regulated earlier.

664
00:55:08,766 --> 00:55:09,979
Ban him.

665
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:11,646
To make him stop his business.

666
00:55:11,757 --> 00:55:13,843
I've released an article exposing this.

667
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:16,101
There should be an anti-trend coming soon.

668
00:55:17,203 --> 00:55:20,046
We need to make him move back to his home.

669
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,326
Kla, look.

670
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:03,606
Our app is banned, claiming it causes teenagers to gain money illegally.

671
00:56:03,942 --> 00:56:05,942
Find out who released this news.

672
00:56:06,182 --> 00:56:07,966
Check if there's a mastermind.

673
00:56:08,182 --> 00:56:11,086
I have to call you back earlier because of this.

674
00:56:12,094 --> 00:56:14,726
There's a TV station that wants to interview you.

675
00:56:14,846 --> 00:56:16,006
Are you ready to refute the claim?

676
00:56:16,134 --> 00:56:17,206
I'll go to the interview.

677
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:18,806
It might silence them.

678
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:20,326
Kla, wait.

679
00:56:20,717 --> 00:56:23,726
You have to see Lady first. She wants to see you now.

680
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,526
I have told you.

681
00:56:33,597 --> 00:56:36,206
Your app has a weakness.

682
00:56:36,406 --> 00:56:38,526
That's why you got attacked by them.

683
00:56:38,781 --> 00:56:40,781
They just don't dare to fight fairly.

684
00:56:41,246 --> 00:56:42,566
They need to use a dirty trick.

685
00:56:42,782 --> 00:56:46,206
Can you still say that Kidakarn isn't our competitor?

686
00:56:46,526 --> 00:56:51,486
You said you wouldn't involve your grudge with your work. It's impossible.

687
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:53,695
You're too careless.

688
00:56:53,846 --> 00:56:54,886
I admit

689
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:58,686
that I underestimated them, so I got ambushed by them.

690
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:02,326
Wait.

691
00:57:06,894 --> 00:57:09,846
There's another person who has entered the tiger's nest.

692
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,406
The other day,

693
00:57:12,126 --> 00:57:15,886
I asked the messenger to send you documents while you're away.

694
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:20,446
I learned that the maid that you hired wasn't normal.

695
00:57:29,486 --> 00:57:32,246
Deal with this father and daughter.

696
00:57:32,805 --> 00:57:34,526
If you can't do it,

697
00:57:35,726 --> 00:57:37,446
I'll have to do it myself.

698
00:57:51,254 --> 00:57:53,806
Contact anyone who wants to phone in with me.

699
00:58:00,886 --> 00:58:04,046
There's a tourist in the hotel requesting a masseuse around here.

700
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:07,006
Good. Send our people upstairs.

701
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:11,126
Ann.

702
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,366
I've accepted the request.

703
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:21,126
- Go up now. - Yes.

704
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:26,958
It's time for the masseuse.

705
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,286
Can he handle it?

706
00:58:28,437 --> 00:58:30,926
If we can prove there's prostitution within the app,

707
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,806
this app will be closed down.

708
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:37,541
I can guarantee that

709
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:40,686
our app has an identity verification.

710
00:58:40,966 --> 00:58:43,606
Everyone who uses our app can check it.

711
00:58:43,806 --> 00:58:46,446
Our app focuses on helping and sharing kindness.

712
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:49,686
We don't have illegal activities or child labor.

713
00:58:55,326 --> 00:58:56,846
They still haven't come out by now.

714
00:58:57,213 --> 00:58:58,806
This isn't just a normal massage.

715
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:01,145
We can use this as evidence to say

716
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,526
that someone's using his app for prostitution.

717
00:59:03,997 --> 00:59:07,366
That volunteering activities are just an advertisement.

718
00:59:07,662 --> 00:59:09,286
You'll go on a news show tomorrow.

719
00:59:09,486 --> 00:59:12,286
We can use this clip to expose him.

720
00:59:13,991 --> 00:59:17,126
But this woman is only an actress from us.

721
00:59:17,294 --> 00:59:19,566
We still have our prey in the spotlight.

722
00:59:19,965 --> 00:59:21,966
This means his app has no protection.

723
00:59:22,631 --> 00:59:25,566
Kaokla is deceiving everyone.

724
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:27,246
He dares to be a saint.

725
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:29,446
Tomorrow, he'll be a sinful man.

726
00:59:30,341 --> 00:59:31,926
Who is actually deceiving the people?

727
00:59:32,189 --> 00:59:35,166
If we get caught, Uncle Sin will have to take responsibility.

728
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:37,206
Whose side are you on?

729
00:59:38,612 --> 00:59:39,886
(I can guarantee that)

730
00:59:39,983 --> 00:59:43,326
(our app has an identity verification.)

731
00:59:43,423 --> 00:59:44,966
He's upgraded himself.

732
00:59:45,572 --> 00:59:48,006
He isn't as bad as when he came to trick Khim.

733
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,326
Your stupid plan, Prompt,

734
00:59:52,453 --> 00:59:54,406
can't do anything to a sly man.

735
00:59:58,669 --> 01:00:00,669
If you can do it with him,

736
01:00:00,837 --> 01:00:02,766
he's not that smart.

737
01:00:04,996 --> 01:00:06,806
Keep this evidence.

738
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:09,566
I'll expose him before the media.

739
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:12,086
I'll make him lose his business in Thailand.

740
01:00:31,654 --> 01:00:32,886
Are you here to see Thaen?

741
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:38,646
What about you?

742
01:00:39,686 --> 01:00:41,846
Don't tell me that you're here to see Kaokla?

743
01:00:42,398 --> 01:00:43,446
And so what?

744
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:45,046
Are you jealous?

745
01:00:52,461 --> 01:00:53,757
Be careful.

746
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,566
Don't let him brainwash you.

747
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:04,646
Why are you here?

748
01:01:05,181 --> 01:01:07,181
Go away if you want to kiss me after a kick.

749
01:01:26,572 --> 01:01:28,806
Khim, how did you get here?

750
01:01:29,582 --> 01:01:30,846
Let's get inside.

751
01:01:31,726 --> 01:01:33,046
Yes.

752
01:01:37,063 --> 01:01:38,486
I'm here to warn you.

753
01:01:38,734 --> 01:01:41,606
Prompt will release another scandal of your company.

754
01:01:44,461 --> 01:01:47,326
- Why are you telling me this? - To assure you I'm on your side.

755
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,206
If you can betray your family,

756
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:53,326
do you think I would trust you?

757
01:01:54,126 --> 01:01:57,206
You can trust me when you're in ruin later if you don't mind.

758
01:02:04,134 --> 01:02:06,366
But let me tell you. The evidence this time

759
01:02:06,566 --> 01:02:08,406
will make you lose your balance.

760
01:02:08,806 --> 01:02:13,126
If you're scared, you can talk with Prompt about the hush money.

761
01:02:14,573 --> 01:02:17,766
If you give up on the land opposite the hotel,

762
01:02:18,165 --> 01:02:21,206
Uncle Sin might change his mind and won't expose you.

763
01:02:30,526 --> 01:02:32,486
- Khem. - I've checked it for you.

764
01:02:32,686 --> 01:02:35,406
A tourist used our app from Elite Hotel.

765
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,846
(I checked his volunteer profile.)

766
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,566
It's a new profile.

767
01:02:39,647 --> 01:02:41,566
(It might be an impersonation)

768
01:02:41,718 --> 01:02:43,166
(to accept a request in our app.)

769
01:02:43,406 --> 01:02:45,486
I think something will happen.

770
01:02:50,022 --> 01:02:51,366
Impersonation?

771
01:02:52,092 --> 01:02:53,406
We got done by them.

772
01:02:58,142 --> 01:02:59,366
I've warned you.

773
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:00,846
I have a problem to settle.

774
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:02,886
Go tell your family.

775
01:03:03,205 --> 01:03:04,886
I'm going all-in for this match.

776
01:03:22,038 --> 01:03:23,206
Khim.

777
01:03:23,606 --> 01:03:25,166
I found the auspicious time for our wedding.

778
01:03:25,534 --> 01:03:27,726
The monks gave me the auspicious time.

779
01:03:28,477 --> 01:03:30,846
In six months. Or at the end of the year.

780
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,526
I forgot my stuff in my car.

781
01:03:33,766 --> 01:03:35,526
I want to go and get it.

782
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:37,326
Sure.

783
01:03:44,036 --> 01:03:46,036
Can I get the CCTV footage that I requested?

784
01:03:46,283 --> 01:03:47,326
Here you are.

785
01:04:47,726 --> 01:04:49,176
(I've watered them.)

786
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:05,286
The weather is nice.

787
01:05:05,846 --> 01:05:07,006
Yes.

788
01:05:18,846 --> 01:05:20,766
Khim, can you decide on our wedding date?

789
01:05:24,006 --> 01:05:28,566
If you still can't decide, we should order something for our dinner.

790
01:05:28,765 --> 01:05:29,908
Yes.

791
01:05:30,261 --> 01:05:31,606
Wait here for me.

792
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,166
Are you that happy?

793
01:05:52,629 --> 01:05:54,846
- What's wrong? - You're acting oblivious.

794
01:05:55,102 --> 01:05:56,524
What's wrong with you?

795
01:05:59,223 --> 01:06:01,686
You must be angry that your true nature got exposed.

796
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,566
I don't care about that.

797
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,126
I know that I'm not that great of a person.

798
01:06:06,654 --> 01:06:09,726
I'm not good at pretending. I can't put on a mask like you.

799
01:06:10,365 --> 01:06:12,038
I can only be half as bad as you.

800
01:06:12,532 --> 01:06:13,846
You made a blunder.

801
01:06:14,213 --> 01:06:15,966
- Why did you take it out on me? - Yes.

802
01:06:16,246 --> 01:06:18,046
I made a blunder because I was careless.

803
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:19,926
You're a wicked woman

804
01:06:20,646 --> 01:06:21,846
with various schemes.

805
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:23,286
If I'm wicked,

806
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,258
you must be a douchebag.

807
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:26,847
Khim, what's wrong?

808
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:32,526
Show your true nature. Stop acting already.

809
01:06:33,494 --> 01:06:34,646
What did you say?

810
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:38,766
Have you seen her true nature?

811
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:41,146
How bad is she when she's behind your back?

812
01:06:41,342 --> 01:06:42,626
With her bad mouth

813
01:06:42,924 --> 01:06:44,086
and her black heart.

814
01:06:44,956 --> 01:06:46,246
You're so great, aren't you?

815
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:47,566
See?

816
01:06:47,782 --> 01:06:49,782
Your dark side will come out one day.

817
01:06:50,054 --> 01:06:52,966
You're only good at doing something behind people's backs.

818
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:54,806
Mr. Carl.

819
01:06:59,726 --> 01:07:00,926
Do you know what?

820
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:04,206
She's good at using your sympathy to kill you.

821
01:07:05,509 --> 01:07:06,566
What are you saying?

822
01:07:06,654 --> 01:07:07,766
You'll see.

823
01:07:08,206 --> 01:07:10,886
I'll expose your lies and deception.

824
01:07:11,366 --> 01:07:14,366
You'll know how horrible she is behind your back.

825
01:07:15,804 --> 01:07:16,926
Why are you quiet?

826
01:07:17,357 --> 01:07:18,606
Why aren't you saying anything?

827
01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:21,206
I won't feel anything if you curse me in your heart.

828
01:07:21,879 --> 01:07:25,806
You'll learn how the betrayal of love tastes one day.

829
01:07:35,246 --> 01:07:36,566
What's going on, Khim?

830
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:38,606
Why did you suddenly fight?

831
01:07:39,534 --> 01:07:41,286
He picked a fight with me first.

832
01:07:42,669 --> 01:07:47,046
Why was he that rude to you? What happened between you two?

833
01:07:51,606 --> 01:07:53,006
It's just because of business.

834
01:07:53,806 --> 01:07:56,206
Because I expose his business.

835
01:07:58,613 --> 01:08:00,366
That's why he's that angry.

836
01:08:17,391 --> 01:08:20,086
(A tourist used our app from Elite Hotel.)

837
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:22,570
(I checked his volunteer profile.)

838
01:08:22,741 --> 01:08:24,246
(It's a new profile.)

839
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,206
(It might be an impersonation)

840
01:08:26,406 --> 01:08:28,046
(to accept a request in our app.)

841
01:08:32,046 --> 01:08:33,766
(Ms. Kasalong Saengchai)

842
01:08:47,326 --> 01:08:49,806
She's good at using your sympathy to kill you.

843
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:51,838
What are you saying?

844
01:08:51,981 --> 01:08:53,006
You'll see.

845
01:08:53,543 --> 01:08:56,286
I'll expose your lies and deception.

846
01:08:56,686 --> 01:08:59,646
You'll know how horrible she is behind your back.

847
01:08:59,965 --> 01:09:02,326
Why are you quiet? Why aren't you saying anything?

848
01:09:02,478 --> 01:09:04,686
I won't feel anything if you curse me in your heart.

849
01:09:05,126 --> 01:09:08,326
You'll learn how the betrayal of love tastes one day.

850
01:09:24,206 --> 01:09:27,206
(Are you asleep? I want to ask something from you.)

851
01:09:36,102 --> 01:09:39,526
(I'll move out of this condo, but I don't have time to move my stuff.)

852
01:09:39,822 --> 01:09:42,006
(I would like to bother you for the last time.)

853
01:09:42,405 --> 01:09:44,566
(I would like you to oversee the workers.)

854
01:09:44,886 --> 01:09:47,686
(If it doesn't bother you, I would like to ask for your favor again.)

855
01:10:01,093 --> 01:10:04,006
(No problem. I'll help you.)

856
01:10:08,365 --> 01:10:09,526
(Thank you.)

857
01:10:40,246 --> 01:10:42,366
Mr. Songsin went to give an interview for a TV show

858
01:10:42,493 --> 01:10:44,046
regarding our app.

859
01:10:44,397 --> 01:10:46,137
Find out the TV station and what show it is.

860
01:10:46,339 --> 01:10:48,339
Tell them that I'd like to appear on it.

861
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,926
This is going to be fun.

862
01:11:05,551 --> 01:11:06,646
Ms. Khim.

863
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:09,966
Kaokla said he would like to appear on a show with Mr. Sin this evening.

864
01:11:17,046 --> 01:11:19,886
I think this has become far from what we expected.

865
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,646
I don't think Dad can catch onto him.

866
01:11:58,012 --> 01:12:00,326
It's fortunate that you let me appear on the show.

867
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:02,286
That's good.

868
01:12:02,501 --> 01:12:04,886
I think it'll benefit our citizens.

869
01:12:07,206 --> 01:12:10,006
I want to see how you would answer us

870
01:12:11,566 --> 01:12:13,286
and how you would fix this problem.

871
01:12:20,846 --> 01:12:23,446
If there's a problem with my system, I can fix it.

872
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:26,606
But if it's a problem from an attitude,

873
01:12:26,806 --> 01:12:28,326
I think we have to change it.

874
01:12:28,884 --> 01:12:31,166
I hope it'll make some people open their minds.

875
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:33,006
So, they would come out of a cave.

876
01:12:37,846 --> 01:12:39,046
You're still arrogant.

877
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:40,742
You might get knocked out.

878
01:12:49,851 --> 01:12:53,206
Just you wait. Someone might lose their own face.

879
01:13:06,406 --> 01:13:10,966
Are you ready? Five, four, three, two, one.

880
01:13:11,966 --> 01:13:15,766
Good afternoon. Welcome to Perd Pom Khao today.

881
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:19,086
We'll talk about the news

882
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:21,366
that is the talk of the town.

883
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,326
It's about the famous app

884
01:13:23,422 --> 01:13:26,246
which are being questioned

885
01:13:26,349 --> 01:13:28,515
whether it's good to be used in Thailand

886
01:13:28,644 --> 01:13:30,926
in terms of morals and ethics.

887
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:44,766
Please go that way.

888
01:13:46,453 --> 01:13:50,166
(Today, our show has welcomed Mr. Songsin Kidakarn,)

889
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:53,006
a minister from the Ministry of Tourism and Sports,

890
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:57,366
who is worried about the ethics of this app.

891
01:13:57,524 --> 01:14:00,766
(And we also have the owner of this app, "Arsa".

892
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:03,046
(Mr. Carl Raman. Greetings to both of you.)

893
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:05,406
- (Hello.) - (Let's get to the point.)

894
01:14:05,548 --> 01:14:09,164
There was one certain video

895
01:14:09,326 --> 01:14:13,985
from an app user. They called a masseuse to massage them in a hotel.

896
01:14:14,087 --> 01:14:15,806
(But the video in question,)

897
01:14:15,887 --> 01:14:19,486
it doesn't look like it's your normal massage.

898
01:14:19,686 --> 01:14:22,606
Please take a look at this footage.

899
01:14:24,607 --> 01:14:27,086
(This is the footage in question.)

900
01:14:28,078 --> 01:14:31,246
From this footage, most people would feel that

901
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:36,326
it looks like a certain act of prostitution.

902
01:14:36,718 --> 01:14:42,006
If that's true, there's been an illegal usage of the app. Isn't that right?

903
01:14:43,095 --> 01:14:45,566
Well, we just saw it together.

904
01:14:45,751 --> 01:14:47,879
Honestly, I'm worried.

905
01:14:48,014 --> 01:14:52,726
If some people use this app to hide their illegal activities,

906
01:14:53,004 --> 01:14:56,206
the app doesn't have any measure to stop it,

907
01:14:56,293 --> 01:14:58,468
or discourage it or anything.

908
01:14:58,573 --> 01:15:01,710
(From the outside, it looks like an app that lets people help each other.)

909
01:15:01,807 --> 01:15:03,566
(But when it can't be regulated,)

910
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:08,166
(we can't say for sure whether the activity is legal or not.)

911
01:15:08,311 --> 01:15:11,526
If the app is being used to exchange accommodations,

912
01:15:11,742 --> 01:15:13,828
and we can't check or regulate it,

913
01:15:13,949 --> 01:15:16,686
would that hotel have enough standard

914
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,366
as what tourists expected? If not, it can be damaging.

915
01:15:19,518 --> 01:15:22,326
You're now in the hotel business too.

916
01:15:22,486 --> 01:15:24,806
Yes. That's another topic. That's just my business.

917
01:15:24,933 --> 01:15:27,246
I'm looking at the big picture of our country.

918
01:15:27,374 --> 01:15:30,606
To make us be trusted again by tourists

919
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:32,686
who want to travel in our country after COVID,

920
01:15:32,846 --> 01:15:34,246
it's not an easy process.

921
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:37,766
(If we run into this situation, it might badly impact our country.)

922
01:15:37,926 --> 01:15:39,806
(That's the opinion of Mr. Minister.)

923
01:15:39,918 --> 01:15:41,997
Mr. Carl, how would you explain

924
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:45,446
to the minister, society, and the audience?

925
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:46,846
I admit that

926
01:15:46,997 --> 01:15:49,486
some people have used fake accounts in our app.

927
01:15:49,725 --> 01:15:51,846
But I can say that it's a minority.

928
01:15:52,446 --> 01:15:55,372
We want volunteers to share their kindness

929
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:58,006
to use their time to create extra income.

930
01:15:58,237 --> 01:15:59,788
If we find an offender,

931
01:15:59,966 --> 01:16:02,646
we can revoke their Arsa's membership.

932
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:05,406
I want everyone to see the benefit of this app

933
01:16:05,646 --> 01:16:07,366
that matches the lifestyle in this city.

934
01:16:07,534 --> 01:16:10,086
(How? I'll be the representative of our audiences.)

935
01:16:10,222 --> 01:16:14,086
Please give an example of how your app works.

936
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:15,383
Of course.

937
01:16:15,464 --> 01:16:19,747
I want to move house today, but I have to come to this show.

938
01:16:19,863 --> 01:16:22,606
(I only need someone who can help me move my stuff.)

939
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,109
Here.

940
01:16:25,486 --> 01:16:28,366
This is the volunteer who came to help me move today.

941
01:16:28,557 --> 01:16:29,846
We'll see

942
01:16:29,966 --> 01:16:32,966
if this person is actually the person who registered with my app.

943
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:37,966
There are a lot of details here. There is a face,

944
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:39,686
name and surname, and phone number.

945
01:16:39,838 --> 01:16:41,726
I'll let everyone see this.

946
01:16:41,844 --> 01:16:46,566
This is what the Arsa app looks like.

947
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,646
(I want everyone to see with their own eyes)

948
01:16:49,766 --> 01:16:52,406
(that there are still good people who can still help us.)

949
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:55,646
(We can check to see if this person is an actual member.)

950
01:16:55,822 --> 01:16:59,766
(If this member isn't Ms. Kasalong Saengchai as it's indicated,)

951
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:02,566
my company would reconsider our system.

952
01:17:13,902 --> 01:17:17,006
(So, Mr. Carl, you're saying that)

953
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,846
(you have the system for checking)

954
01:17:20,006 --> 01:17:23,966
which can be trusted that no one can impersonate anyone else

955
01:17:25,006 --> 01:17:27,366
to do any illegal activities with your app.

956
01:17:27,486 --> 01:17:31,166
This depends on the discretion of the users.

957
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:33,686
It's like your usual dating apps.

958
01:17:33,767 --> 01:17:36,326
If both sides consent to it,

959
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:39,286
we can't say that all of them are lying.

960
01:17:39,966 --> 01:17:44,798
You still insist that you created this app to help each other, right?

961
01:17:44,973 --> 01:17:48,606
Yes. I think several people can benefit from this app.

962
01:17:48,766 --> 01:17:50,615
(For example, an elder without relatives.)

963
01:17:50,726 --> 01:17:53,966
(They can call someone to run a small errand that they can't do.)

964
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:56,846
(Someone can teach a kid how to do his homework.)

965
01:17:56,997 --> 01:17:58,855
There are still handicapped people.

966
01:17:58,944 --> 01:18:01,308
I would like to offer my opinion since it's missing our point.

967
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:05,450
The benefit that you imagine might exist, but what we're worried about

968
01:18:05,532 --> 01:18:09,795
(is that if our country can't regulate the app,)

969
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:13,646
there might be criminals in there. That's what I'm worried about.

970
01:18:13,806 --> 01:18:15,966
What he said has some interesting points.

971
01:18:16,047 --> 01:18:18,526
If people would like to offer their time to someone else,

972
01:18:18,654 --> 01:18:20,886
I think this app will make our life better

973
01:18:21,086 --> 01:18:23,086
as no one will get left behind.

974
01:18:24,093 --> 01:18:27,326
He's talking about the app, while I'm talking about tourism and sports.

975
01:18:27,429 --> 01:18:30,406
I'm talking about the purpose of this app.

976
01:18:30,557 --> 01:18:32,526
(Please calm down.)

977
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:34,005
(This is getting hot now.)

978
01:18:34,086 --> 01:18:35,086
(But we'll go for a break,)

979
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:38,326
We'll come back in the next part. Don't miss it.

980
01:18:38,454 --> 01:18:44,246
Because this volunteer will visit Mr. Carl at our studio.

981
01:18:44,357 --> 01:18:47,126
But for now, we'll take a breather.

982
01:18:49,966 --> 01:18:52,126
I'm sorry. The truck is almost here.

983
01:18:52,326 --> 01:18:53,566
Okay.

984
01:18:53,652 --> 01:18:57,206
When the moving truck arrives, cut into the live show again.

985
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:00,526
And I'll bring one camera to wait downstairs.

986
01:19:00,876 --> 01:19:02,707
You're changing the topic.

987
01:19:02,917 --> 01:19:05,286
I'll never let you blame me one-sidedly.

988
01:19:09,326 --> 01:19:10,606
Watch your mouth.

989
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:12,806
He's a minister, not your friend.

990
01:19:21,437 --> 01:19:23,686
(We're back. And now,)

991
01:19:23,814 --> 01:19:26,606
(the volunteer is ready.)

992
01:19:26,766 --> 01:19:30,326
(We'll get to see if this volunteer)

993
01:19:30,486 --> 01:19:34,046
is the same with the member profile

994
01:19:34,206 --> 01:19:36,566
in this app. Excuse me.

995
01:19:36,668 --> 01:19:39,046
- Please. - We have to check it.

996
01:19:39,182 --> 01:19:43,446
If he's this confident, this could be an act.

997
01:19:44,606 --> 01:19:45,846
You'll see if it's an act.

998
01:19:46,006 --> 01:19:47,246
Please calm down.

999
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:49,806
We'll get to see it with our own eyes soon.

1000
01:19:50,366 --> 01:19:53,126
We'll watch it with our audiences. Once again,

1001
01:19:53,286 --> 01:19:55,126
if it's the same person,

1002
01:19:55,437 --> 01:19:57,686
the volunteer must be a maid named

1003
01:19:57,846 --> 01:20:01,166
Ms. Kasalong Saengchai, 45 years old.

1004
01:20:01,294 --> 01:20:05,006
As indicated on her profile, her hometown is Chiang Rai.

1005
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:06,726
We'll see

1006
01:20:06,862 --> 01:20:10,206
whether she's the same person. Let's take a look.

1007
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:24,006
We're now going to see the live footage downstairs.

1008
01:20:29,246 --> 01:20:30,366
She's here.

1009
01:20:45,782 --> 01:20:47,126
Why did you come here?

1010
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,366
To take you to see my boss.

1011
01:21:02,397 --> 01:21:03,566
Did you betray me?

1012
01:21:03,846 --> 01:21:05,606
Why did you disguise yourself first?

1013
01:21:19,965 --> 01:21:21,806
Hurry up. People all over the country are waiting.

1014
01:21:21,958 --> 01:21:25,446
Why does she have to hide her own face like this?

1015
01:21:27,542 --> 01:21:29,726
From the look of it, it might not be the same person.

1016
01:21:29,989 --> 01:21:33,046
Actually, our app can use phone numbers to check the identity.

1017
01:21:33,246 --> 01:21:34,694
You can try to call her.

1018
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:37,285
Okay. I would like to contact her now.

1019
01:21:37,486 --> 01:21:39,526
We'll see if she'll answer the call.

1020
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:45,590
The phone signal must have reached her.

1021
01:21:47,326 --> 01:21:48,646
We'll see her face now.

1022
01:21:48,774 --> 01:21:54,246
Does this mean this is an impersonation of identity to misuse the app?

1023
01:21:54,446 --> 01:21:58,126
We have to ask her who she is and why she impersonates herself.

1024
01:21:58,326 --> 01:22:01,366
If she has bad intentions, I'm prepared to take action against her.

1025
01:22:01,711 --> 01:22:05,166
It's unbelievable. We're hitting a jackpot.

1026
01:22:05,486 --> 01:22:09,246
Do you feel like she's similar to someone you know, Mr. Minister?

1027
01:22:09,485 --> 01:22:10,846
I think she looks similar.

1028
01:22:10,998 --> 01:22:12,998
I think she is your daughter.

1029
01:22:13,323 --> 01:22:17,462
She might want to try our app by using another person's account.

1030
01:22:17,589 --> 01:22:20,686
With her profile, I couldn't call her a con artist.

1031
01:22:21,213 --> 01:22:23,246
What do you think about this?

1032
01:22:25,914 --> 01:22:27,246
Stop the show right now.

1033
01:22:27,557 --> 01:22:29,926
Stop the show. I told you to stop.

1034
01:22:40,765 --> 01:22:42,766
Wow. Great job.

1035
01:22:45,773 --> 01:22:48,606
Get out of the car. Please respect the reporters.

1036
01:22:48,806 --> 01:22:50,046
Don't you have any manners?

1037
01:22:50,406 --> 01:22:51,526
Quick.

1038
01:22:52,846 --> 01:22:54,126
Stop recording.

1039
01:22:54,525 --> 01:22:55,726
Stop it.

1040
01:22:57,797 --> 01:22:58,797
Why are you recording it?

1041
01:22:58,904 --> 01:23:01,606
Didn't you want to expose the truth? Why are you scared?

1042
01:23:01,879 --> 01:23:04,286
They're using a dirty trick to make us a scapegoat.

1043
01:23:04,717 --> 01:23:06,006
You can't record this.

1044
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:07,966
- Record them. - No.

1045
01:23:09,038 --> 01:23:10,038
You can't record it.

1046
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:12,406
(Let's look at the situation downstairs.)

1047
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,006
(In front of our studio. Here she is.)

1048
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,326
- I told you to stop. - Record them.

1049
01:23:18,606 --> 01:23:20,751
You deceived us, so you have to pay for it.

1050
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:22,526
- Stop. Get out. - Record them.

1051
01:23:22,853 --> 01:23:25,352
- (I told you to stop.) - (I'm sorry.)

1052
01:23:25,486 --> 01:23:28,886
With the chaos, we should come back to our studio.

1053
01:23:29,053 --> 01:23:32,057
The situation right now is unbelievable.

1054
01:23:32,175 --> 01:23:35,195
But our time is almost over.

1055
01:23:35,326 --> 01:23:39,046
We'll have to ask our minister

1056
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:40,846
to say something in the end.

1057
01:23:41,014 --> 01:23:42,326
It depends on the app's maker.

1058
01:23:42,525 --> 01:23:47,086
You have to ask yourself who you want to destroy with today's incident.

1059
01:23:48,206 --> 01:23:50,686
I already told my purpose for making this app.

1060
01:23:50,998 --> 01:23:54,686
But the bad purpose of the impersonator is the cause of today's incident.

1061
01:23:54,839 --> 01:23:56,246
I think we have proved

1062
01:23:56,374 --> 01:24:00,006
whether it's the app's fault or the impersonator's fault.

1063
01:24:00,646 --> 01:24:02,894
So for today,

1064
01:24:03,014 --> 01:24:06,172
our topic has become even more interesting.

1065
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:08,526
I believe there'll be the next part. It's such a shame

1066
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:12,246
that our time is over. Thank you to both of our guests.

1067
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:15,446
And...

1068
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:19,806
We'll say goodbye to you for today. Until next time. Goodbye.

1069
01:24:22,534 --> 01:24:24,366
What? What have you done?

1070
01:24:26,046 --> 01:24:28,446
Your daughter disguised herself to get into my room.

1071
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:31,126
You didn't know that she came to seduce me, right?

1072
01:24:32,462 --> 01:24:34,606
She probably can't give up on me yet.

1073
01:24:34,924 --> 01:24:36,924
She wants to relive the past with me.

1074
01:24:37,109 --> 01:24:38,686
Restrain yourself, alright?

1075
01:24:39,046 --> 01:24:40,726
Please be mindful of my father-in-law.

1076
01:24:40,965 --> 01:24:42,686
Your face is probably cracking by now.

1077
01:24:43,475 --> 01:24:44,966
Dad, don't believe him.

1078
01:24:47,109 --> 01:24:48,646
You overdid it.

1079
01:24:50,189 --> 01:24:53,086
You deceived me. I was tricked by him.

1080
01:24:53,453 --> 01:24:56,446
You stuck your nose in the problem first.

1081
01:24:57,206 --> 01:24:59,046
You used a dirty scheme against me first.

1082
01:24:59,444 --> 01:25:02,926
You brought a masseuse to me. Just be glad I didn't expose you for that.

1083
01:25:04,852 --> 01:25:06,086
Enough!

1084
01:25:08,909 --> 01:25:11,166
Do you think you can win against me with something like that?

1085
01:25:11,366 --> 01:25:14,806
I'm satisfied enough to teach you a lesson in front of the media.

1086
01:25:23,726 --> 01:25:25,766
I'll rip your mask off.

1087
01:25:26,878 --> 01:25:28,646
I'll expose to everyone

1088
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:30,686
that you aren't that great.

1089
01:25:33,166 --> 01:25:34,326
Sure.

1090
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:37,286
We can say that I was your former son-in-law.

1091
01:25:38,846 --> 01:25:40,366
You chased me away like a dog.

1092
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:42,846
You might be the dog this time.

1093
01:25:45,097 --> 01:25:46,566
My daughter.

1094
01:25:47,606 --> 01:25:48,806
Are you satisfied now?

1095
01:25:59,686 --> 01:26:01,206
We have to talk.

1096
01:26:01,433 --> 01:26:03,086
You overdid it.

1097
01:26:03,206 --> 01:26:05,006
You know the truth. Why didn't you say it?

1098
01:26:05,301 --> 01:26:06,766
You tricked me into visiting you.

1099
01:26:06,925 --> 01:26:08,726
You have used me.

1100
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,376
In the end, you did it to humiliate me.

1101
01:26:11,509 --> 01:26:13,686
Are you satisfied? How much do you want to ruin my life?

1102
01:26:13,806 --> 01:26:15,126
I'm not a modest man.

1103
01:26:15,486 --> 01:26:16,686
I'll tell you that

1104
01:26:17,094 --> 01:26:19,166
I won't be satisfied with just you.

1105
01:26:23,309 --> 01:26:24,686
What have I ever done to you?

1106
01:26:25,118 --> 01:26:27,086
Why are you so grudgeful towards me?

1107
01:26:27,206 --> 01:26:29,206
I also asked myself this question.

1108
01:26:29,606 --> 01:26:32,006
What have I ever done to your family?

1109
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:33,526
I asked myself all year.

1110
01:26:33,782 --> 01:26:35,326
If you just start to question it,

1111
01:26:35,486 --> 01:26:36,686
it's not enough.

1112
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:41,406
If you hate me, take it out on me. Why is it related to my dad?

1113
01:26:41,813 --> 01:26:44,206
The one who arrested me was your dad.

1114
01:26:45,006 --> 01:26:47,166
How does it feel when you're framed?

1115
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:51,366
For what you've done to me, I'll give it back to you.

1116
01:26:52,901 --> 01:26:54,326
It'll get worse

1117
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:56,166
if you haven't learned your lesson.

1118
01:27:25,558 --> 01:27:26,845
If you want to get back at me,

1119
01:27:26,973 --> 01:27:28,686
don't drag anyone else involved.

1120
01:27:28,886 --> 01:27:32,206
What have I ever done to you to make you so grudgeful of me?

1121
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:34,246
If you don't use this chance,

1122
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:36,406
your life won't be able to improve again.

1123
01:27:36,519 --> 01:27:38,366
Tell him to go to hell!

1124
01:27:38,766 --> 01:27:41,966
If you stay here and feel uncomfortable,

1125
01:27:42,126 --> 01:27:43,800
you can work with me.

1126
01:27:43,909 --> 01:27:46,206
Mom, this is Ms. Khim, my role model.

1127
01:27:46,501 --> 01:27:48,946
Everyone said you're dead, Mom.

1128
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,686
What have you planned all this for?

1129
01:27:51,941 --> 01:27:54,126
You already wanted to be bad. You should crush them now.

1130
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:55,497
Crush them to death.

1131
01:27:55,606 --> 01:27:57,726
Everyone who was dead is alive again.

1132
01:27:57,894 --> 01:27:59,446
Do you want me to feel sad?

1133
01:27:59,638 --> 01:28:02,246
If that's so, you've succeeded.

1134
01:28:02,726 --> 01:28:05,606
I'm hurt. Are you satisfied now?
