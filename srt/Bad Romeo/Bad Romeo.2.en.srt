1
00:00:00,135 --> 00:00:01,135
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,216 --> 00:00:02,446
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,527 --> 00:00:03,527
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,286
This exchange of our lives,

5
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,646
it might profit us both.

6
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:51,566
Lita, explain to me right now.

7
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:54,446
The house that you let me stay in. Whose house is it?

8
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:57,006
(How is it? Can you hear me, Khim?)

9
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:05,006
You already know

10
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,700
that I hate a woman like your mom.

11
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,726
But I'm not my mom.

12
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,086
Don't argue with me.

13
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:14,246
Turn the car!

14
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:17,086
Darn it!

15
00:03:19,454 --> 00:03:21,126
The one who dares to make you cry

16
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:23,366
is really cruel.

17
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:37,966
Don't let anyone make you feel worthless.

18
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,006
No.

19
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:38,486
(Is he the right one for me forever?)

20
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,366
(What we can only do is keep it during our right time.)

21
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:06,806
Kla!

22
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:21,806
Kla!

23
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:24,566
Wake up!

24
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:26,286
Don't act oblivious!

25
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:28,886
Don't you remember what you did yesterday?

26
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:38,526
What are you looking at?

27
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:45,646
Who are you trying to find?

28
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:54,537
Go back to where you came from.

29
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:55,646
No.

30
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,326
- Go. - I won't.

31
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:01,566
Who is over there?

32
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:04,126
It's not your business.

33
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,366
Who is over there? Come out now.

34
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:08,046
You're too loud.

35
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:09,861
You're hiding someone, aren't you?

36
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:13,366
Come out! I told you to come out!

37
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,166
Come out.

38
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:16,966
You won't come out?

39
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:26,326
I knew it, Kla. You said I was a slut.

40
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,406
You aren't that different from me.

41
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,086
It hasn't been a day. You slept with a new woman.

42
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:33,606
Get out of here.

43
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,286
Did he deceive you?

44
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:37,382
How long have you known her?

45
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:38,686
That's enough.

46
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:41,086
What? You beat up my boyfriend.

47
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:42,726
You're afraid now?

48
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,206
Why can't I beat her up too?

49
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:46,406
Enough.

50
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:50,166
You.

51
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:51,926
Come here.

52
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,886
You probably got deceived by him.

53
00:08:57,222 --> 00:08:58,831
You saw him drive a luxury car,

54
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,966
so you give your body to him.

55
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:02,397
Shut up.

56
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:03,926
What?

57
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:05,646
You act like you're so good.

58
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:07,166
You're as terrible as me.

59
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:09,606
You still run away from your husband.

60
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:11,054
Just to pack up my stuff.

61
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:13,206
I already know your true self.

62
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:15,246
Get out of here.

63
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,230
Hey, you didn't get the money.

64
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:19,587
- Hey, don't go just yet. - If you like to

65
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:21,966
buy a second-handed item, you can take it.

66
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:25,366
But if you want to be serious, I want you to think again.

67
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:28,046
Your life will get worse from now.

68
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:37,846
Hey.

69
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,366
Serves you right.

70
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,157
You ruined my life.

71
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,295
Don't think you can have a new life.

72
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:45,846
Just leave.

73
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:47,686
Stop ruining my life.

74
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:49,726
If you don't have me,

75
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:51,406
your life will be rotten.

76
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,966
You'll see!

77
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:14,966
Hey.

78
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:17,406
You.

79
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,126
What's her name?

80
00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:26,326
Hey.

81
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:32,926
Hey, wait for me.

82
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:34,646
I told you to wait.

83
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:53,406
Please stay. Don't go just yet.

84
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,526
Last night...

85
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:57,366
What about last night?

86
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,686
- I was drunk. - Yes.

87
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:02,486
- And so what? - Listen.

88
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:05,506
Last night, everything happened so fast.

89
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:10,326
But I think I have some feelings for you.

90
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,846
I can't hear you.

91
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:13,686
I think I like you.

92
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,526
I can't hear what you say.

93
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:54,846
Do you get it now?

94
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:56,566
Ms. Saikhim.

95
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:04,686
Sir asked me to pick you up.

96
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:06,686
Are you alright, Miss?

97
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:10,086
Yes.

98
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,646
I'm alright.

99
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,566
What are you doing here?

100
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:24,966
If you're safe, then it's alright.

101
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:30,406
Take Miss back home. I'll handle the rest here.

102
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:32,486
Please.

103
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:49,926
Are you the owner of that garage?

104
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:52,002
Yes. What's wrong?

105
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:54,866
We suspect you're involved with kidnapping for ransom.

106
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:56,726
- For ransom? - Yes.

107
00:12:58,357 --> 00:12:59,646
You're crazy.

108
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,486
Why would I want ransom?

109
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:11,246
Ms. Khim.

110
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:13,006
Where have you been?

111
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:17,646
Why did you run away like that? I was so worried.

112
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:20,973
Please go inside.

113
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:29,926
Where is Dad?

114
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:31,726
Sir already went out.

115
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:38,846
You're back.

116
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:41,166
Where have you been, Khim?

117
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:43,926
Everyone was worried about you. We couldn't sleep.

118
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,566
Don't do anything strange again.

119
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:50,446
If you don't come back today, Mr. Sin will be depressed.

120
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,166
I'm sorry.

121
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:03,446
Go take a shower.

122
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,366
Let's go, Ms. Khim.

123
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:22,286
The problem child is back.

124
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,166
She looks so dirty.

125
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:27,806
Was she afraid we wouldn't know what she has been doing?

126
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,886
I can't believe it. She looks so quiet.

127
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:33,886
I didn't think she would be this much.

128
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:36,486
Uncle Sin has always looked after her.

129
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,126
It's because of her mother's blood.

130
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:44,953
She went wild. History repeats itself.

131
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:48,053
If your uncle knows this, he will go crazy.

132
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,966
Good. I can show my worth.

133
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:54,246
Uncle Sin might give the project in Phuket to me.

134
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,233
You can wait for the good news.

135
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:57,405
Sure.

136
00:15:18,277 --> 00:15:20,277
You should go take a shower.

137
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:22,326
I'll help you.

138
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:30,926
Why are your clothes unkempt like this?

139
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:37,926
After you take a shower, please come down to have your meal.

140
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:41,526
I'll prepare the table for you, please.

141
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,326
Yes.

142
00:15:57,774 --> 00:15:59,646
Reporting to the officers.

143
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:03,110
A reminder to check the location thoroughly. Gather all evidence.

144
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:05,038
Interview the witness in the area. Over.

145
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,046
Understand? Over.

146
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:16,493
Now, speak.

147
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:18,046
I told you.

148
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:20,646
I only know her name is Khim.

149
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:23,406
I'm not sure if that's her real name.

150
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:25,246
I met her on a dating app.

151
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:27,526
You know no one would use a real name.

152
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,686
I'm just her acquaintance.

153
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:31,446
Her acquaintance?

154
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,366
How did she get into your home?

155
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,766
My ex-girlfriend rented out my house daily.

156
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:38,926
I just ran into her.

157
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:40,461
A lover

158
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:42,846
who rented your girlfriend's house.

159
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:46,286
What does that mean? It's too much of a coincidence.

160
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:51,566
Seriously.

161
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:53,846
How old is she?

162
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:57,326
You can't charge child abduction against me.

163
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:00,926
I can say that I was also tricked by her.

164
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:04,326
I can say that I was her victim.

165
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:47,206
You forced her to ask for 1,000,000 baht

166
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:48,926
from her family, right?

167
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,286
You're crazy.

168
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:52,046
I don't know about that.

169
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:54,246
She just crashed my car

170
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:56,382
and said she would pay for it.

171
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,486
I don't know where she would get it.

172
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:01,126
I didn't want the money in the first place.

173
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:05,686
You're saying that

174
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:08,446
you didn't lock her up

175
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:10,326
to ask for ransom?

176
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,406
Why would I ask for ransom?

177
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:15,246
I didn't even know who her parents were.

178
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:18,966
But you take her to the hotel to cause trouble.

179
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:22,086
Don't tell me that you don't know

180
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:24,886
that she is the daughter of the hotel's owner.

181
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:31,278
I don't know.

182
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:35,446
I swear that I don't know her family is that rich.

183
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:37,566
Isn't it because you know

184
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:40,606
that she's the heir of Kidakarn?

185
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:44,045
So, you've been trying to court her since the beginning.

186
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,806
When you knew she's rich,

187
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:55,166
you became her lover and tricked her to pay you money.

188
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:04,254
She's not an emo girl,

189
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:06,504
but a spoiled girl.

190
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,486
Only a phone. Is that right?

191
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,166
Of course.

192
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:04,526
The clothes she wore last night?

193
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,206
Yes. I'll bring you all of them.

194
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,726
The underwear too?

195
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:22,446
Ms. Khim, are you hungry?

196
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,306
I've prepared your meal,

197
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:25,846
so I'm here to call you.

198
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:28,766
If you're ready, please come down.

199
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,486
You were at the garage with her last night.

200
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:52,406
Do you usually bring a stranger to your home?

201
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:55,726
We hit it off, so we stayed together for quite a while.

202
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:57,646
Hit it off?

203
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:00,246
You aren't even sure of her name.

204
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:04,086
We were drunk while we were talking to each other.

205
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,206
What did you do until morning?

206
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:13,166
We're drunk and fell asleep.

207
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:16,726
I couldn't remember when I fell asleep.

208
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:19,766
When the physical examination's result comes out,

209
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:22,646
we'll see how much your words can be trusted.

210
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:26,406
If you want to make sure, do you want my DNA?

211
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:33,646
Good.

212
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:35,966
We'll know what the charge will be.

213
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:40,726
Abduction, extortion, or sexual harassment.

214
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,206
You can even have all of them.

215
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,646
(We hit it off, so we stayed together for quite a while.)

216
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:59,366
(Hit it off? You aren't even sure of her name.)

217
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:00,846
(We were drunk)

218
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,726
- (while we're talking to each other.) - (What did you do until morning?)

219
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,216
(We're drunk and fell asleep. I couldn't remember when I fell asleep.)

220
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:12,286
That man refused all of his allegations.

221
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,990
The police have released him.

222
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,166
I checked Miss's phone, but there isn't his contact.

223
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,646
Do you want me to take Miss to take a physical examination?

224
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:24,446
No.

225
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,966
I'll trust my daughter whom I've raised for over 10 years.

226
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,309
Keep a close eye on Saikhim.

227
00:22:33,326 --> 00:22:35,326
Don't let her see those men again.

228
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:38,966
It's better if you can get rid of them from her life.

229
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:57,526
You said you didn't like dating apps. Why did you do it with her?

230
00:22:58,662 --> 00:23:00,662
You still dare to run your mouth?

231
00:23:01,117 --> 00:23:05,406
It's you who weren't careful. I was almost arrested for abduction.

232
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:09,046
Hey, who knew she would be that rich?

233
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:11,006
You should be happy.

234
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:14,126
You had a chance to play with a high-class woman.

235
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:17,726
I wish I could be her plaything too.

236
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:20,246
I think that girl is our enemy from our past lives.

237
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:23,486
You still haven't realized we might be in jail.

238
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,766
She consented to it, right?

239
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:28,206
You didn't force her to do it.

240
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:30,486
Stop talking about this.

241
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:33,366
I'm saying if the police come here

242
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:36,766
and find this evidence, I don't know how many charges we will get.

243
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,606
You must finish stamping the number.

244
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:45,046
Get it done and deliver the car before the police come here.

245
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:47,726
If not, my charge will increase. Go.

246
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:26,766
Don't tell me

247
00:24:26,951 --> 00:24:29,820
that you don't know that she is the daughter of the hotel's owner.

248
00:24:30,044 --> 00:24:31,526
When you knew she's rich,

249
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:35,246
you became her lover and tricked her to pay you money.

250
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:39,246
You probably got deceived by him.

251
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:41,086
You saw him drive a luxury car,

252
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,126
so you give your body to him.

253
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:45,206
Shut up.

254
00:24:46,597 --> 00:24:47,686
What?

255
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,486
You act like you're so good.

256
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:51,206
You're as terrible as me.

257
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:54,126
Sir asked me to pick you up. Are you alright, Miss?

258
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:04,286
She's so rich. Would I get in trouble?

259
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:11,126
Why am I worried?

260
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:12,501
I should worry about myself.

261
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:30,246
Is Dad back?

262
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:32,092
Yes.

263
00:25:32,485 --> 00:25:33,686
Miss.

264
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,846
Sir is in a video conference with an overseas company.

265
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:39,246
He still isn't free to see you.

266
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:42,446
I can't see him even when we live in the same house,

267
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:46,366
but people on the other side of the world can see him.

268
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,406
I think Dad is trying to avoid me.

269
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:00,942
Are you still mad at me, Dad?

270
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:03,406
You've been avoiding me.

271
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:09,846
I don't have free time

272
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:12,406
to do any nonsense thing like you.

273
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:18,366
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

274
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,046
You're using your emotions with me.

275
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:33,606
You aren't even willing to look at my face.

276
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:38,206
It's a sign

277
00:26:38,446 --> 00:26:40,766
that tells me you're still mad at me.

278
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:46,486
But you can't act like I don't exist.

279
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:55,238
And who

280
00:26:56,043 --> 00:26:57,566
tried to run away from home?

281
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:00,126
Who

282
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:02,526
thinks that that man is more important than me?

283
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:05,086
He asked for ransom.

284
00:27:07,184 --> 00:27:09,606
He wasn't a thief, Dad.

285
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:15,606
That day, I only asked you to test you.

286
00:27:16,877 --> 00:27:19,401
What did he use against you?

287
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:22,006
Why are you defending him this much?

288
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:25,927
He didn't trick me.

289
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,886
You're misunderstanding.

290
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:31,119
If he's that good of a man,

291
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:33,286
would he have been jailed when he was a child?

292
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,566
Who are you talking about?

293
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,046
The man you went out with,

294
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:41,206
he was a prisoner.

295
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,006
He's a criminal.

296
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,566
He assaulted a man and he was in prison.

297
00:27:46,054 --> 00:27:47,686
Can't you see?

298
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:50,286
What are you studying for?

299
00:27:51,894 --> 00:27:53,894
You almost got tricked by that kind of man.

300
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,126
He was...

301
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,950
He was in jail?

302
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:00,246
See?

303
00:28:00,686 --> 00:28:02,966
It's your arrogance.

304
00:28:03,406 --> 00:28:05,166
You almost got tricked by him.

305
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:06,926
Isn't it upsetting?

306
00:28:07,837 --> 00:28:11,806
Your own dad wants the best for you, but you didn't believe me.

307
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:14,046
You believe in that prisoner.

308
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:17,566
Go live in Phuket for now. Don't get involved with him.

I'm here to buy Dramamine for motion sickness.

I'm sorry. We already have it.

336
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:24,866
- Okay. - Let's go.

337
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,006
Are you back from the honeymoon?

338
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,920
I heard you stayed with your lover for a night.

339
00:33:07,007 --> 00:33:08,766
I don't have a lover.

340
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,246
Having a boyfriend is normal.

341
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,686
I understand your hormones want it.

342
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:24,846
But please change your taste. You know

343
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:27,214
that your dad is high class.

344
00:33:27,653 --> 00:33:31,086
If you want that lowly man, it serves you right

345
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,166
if you get grounded here.

346
00:33:35,621 --> 00:33:36,621
Ms. Khim.

347
00:33:36,886 --> 00:33:40,126
Next time, if you want a good boyfriend, tell me.

348
00:33:41,158 --> 00:33:42,438
I'll handle it for you.

349
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:52,806
I heard Saikhim caused trouble, so you have to come back earlier.

350
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,726
It's a shame.

351
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:56,886
It's not that difficult.

352
00:33:57,086 --> 00:33:58,646
I'm worried about Khim.

353
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:01,366
Uncle Sin sent Khim to stay in Phuket.

354
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,086
She's on probation.

355
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:06,246
Khim is already in Phuket?

356
00:34:06,654 --> 00:34:08,646
Yes. It'll probably take a while

357
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:10,966
for Uncle Sin to let Khim go.

358
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,394
When a possessive dad sees a man, he's always like this.

359
00:34:16,526 --> 00:34:17,526
A man?

360
00:34:17,613 --> 00:34:21,686
Thaen, do you really think Khim came back for her friend?

361
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,006
Khim is smart.

362
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,110
She probably used "home-trading" as a facade.

363
00:34:27,726 --> 00:34:32,666
Actually, she probably wanted to come back to her boyfriend.

364
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,126
I'll excuse myself.

365
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:49,446
I don't know that man before.

366
00:34:49,582 --> 00:34:51,403
We only chatted in the app

367
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:55,326
because he lives around the house that I rented for Khim.

368
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,246
I wanted to introduce him to Saikhim,

369
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:01,846
so she would have some friends when she's in Thailand.

370
00:35:02,455 --> 00:35:04,349
How did you know Saikhim?

371
00:35:05,484 --> 00:35:08,694
She's a student of your supported foundation.

372
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:12,806
Every year, you send a scholarship and presents to her.

373
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:15,806
I've also prepared a reward for academic excellence.

374
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,486
Khim saw me,

375
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,148
when I was preparing presents.

376
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:21,366
Miss.

377
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:29,046
Do you like it?

378
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,246
Whose is it?

379
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:38,246
Miss first thought that you're hiding another kid.

380
00:35:38,766 --> 00:35:40,206
I had to tell her

381
00:35:40,324 --> 00:35:43,646
that you had supported a certain child from a foundation.

382
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:47,926
Then, please give this to her. I have tons of them.

383
00:35:48,142 --> 00:35:50,166
I will take that one instead.

384
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,366
This one?

385
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:54,246
I was happy

386
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:56,725
that you gave all the expensive things to me.

387
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,853
So, I wrote an appreciation letter,

388
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:00,846
but it probably didn't get to your hand

389
00:36:00,974 --> 00:36:03,966
because Saikhim wrote the letter back to me for every letter.

390
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:08,006
After that, Ms. Khim said no matter what presents you're going to give,

391
00:36:08,206 --> 00:36:11,526
she wanted us to give that same present to her.

392
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:15,446
Saikhim and I have been in contact for several years via email.

393
00:36:15,646 --> 00:36:18,806
We didn't even know who each other are

394
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:22,046
until Saikhim transferred to the same school as me.

395
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,766
We've become friends since then.

396
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:26,166
So, you became conceited

397
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:29,006
and decided to take over Saikhim's identity.

398
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:30,366
No.

399
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,366
We decided to live in each other's home

400
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:36,726
to see if we can get to live another type of life,

401
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:38,286
how would we become.

402
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:40,286
Familiarity

403
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:42,966
breeds contempt.

404
00:36:43,686 --> 00:36:45,246
Is that an appropriate idiom?

405
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:47,646
Let me be frank with you.

406
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:50,766
I was once extremely jealous of Saikhim

407
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,486
for having a father like you.

408
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:57,046
But when we known each other, I stop being jealous of her.

409
00:36:57,255 --> 00:36:58,766
Because she has a life,

410
00:36:59,557 --> 00:37:01,366
but she didn't get to live it.

411
00:37:01,814 --> 00:37:03,166
Because she has everything,

412
00:37:03,278 --> 00:37:06,517
but she didn't have happiness. That's why she wants a friend like me.

413
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:14,526
Thank you.

414
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:19,686
Mr. Sin has decided to cut off your scholarship.

415
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,862
If you still talk with Ms. Khim,

416
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,686
we'll take action against you.

417
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,966
You still don't feel guilty.

418
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,726
Why do I have to feel guilty?

419
00:37:39,164 --> 00:37:40,686
I didn't trick anyone.

420
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,606
You should know what you've done.

421
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:48,509
Khim might be too nice, so she couldn't catch on to a woman like you.

422
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:49,726
Wow.

423
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:51,646
Rich people

424
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:55,166
are really good at discriminating against others.

425
00:37:56,412 --> 00:37:57,846
I'll tell you one thing.

426
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,966
Khim has never cared about you.

427
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:04,086
Otherwise, she would scream out "Thaenthai"

428
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:05,421
to me sometimes.

429
00:38:05,502 --> 00:38:09,206
Hey, go back to wherever you're from.

430
00:38:23,437 --> 00:38:24,726
Don't try to look.

431
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,606
Khim isn't here.

432
00:38:55,773 --> 00:38:57,286
Ms. Khim.

433
00:38:57,996 --> 00:38:59,886
Look who's here.

434
00:39:05,206 --> 00:39:06,406
Thaen.

435
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,606
I heard you're staying here, so I followed you.

436
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:16,446
Dad was afraid I would go out to cause trouble again,

437
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:18,526
so he keeps me locked up here.

438
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:22,126
And do you have any problems, Khim?

439
00:39:23,046 --> 00:39:25,046
Why did you secretly come back?

440
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:30,526
I just want to live like someone else.

441
00:39:32,509 --> 00:39:36,606
But if you're lonely, you can always call me.

442
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:41,766
Do you want to go diving today? I can take you there.

443
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,686
I don't know whether Dad will allow it.

444
00:39:56,446 --> 00:40:00,246
Oun, can I get on a boat with Thaen?

445
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:03,126
Won't you wait for Mr. Sin first?

446
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:06,086
Oun, tell Uncle Sin to not worry.

447
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:07,806
We won't go out for long.

448
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:10,446
I assure you that I won't let her wander off.

449
00:40:10,966 --> 00:40:12,606
I'll go with you.

450
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:15,006
It's fine, Oun.

451
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:17,286
You should prepare our meal here.

452
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,486
We'll be back at night.

453
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:35,486
Thaen, I'll go buy a Dramamine.

454
00:40:35,638 --> 00:40:36,726
- I'll be back. - Sure.

455
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:42,646
Someone's at the garage?

456
00:40:43,398 --> 00:40:44,806
Did they say who they are?

457
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:49,606
I made the right decision to move out all of my stuff.

458
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:59,406
Watch them and find out why they come. I'm dealing with a problem.

459
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,926
What would you like this time?

460
00:41:16,881 --> 00:41:18,406
Contraceptive pills.

461
00:41:19,086 --> 00:41:21,663
How long ago have you done it?

462
00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:23,646
Has it passed 72 hours?

463
00:41:30,062 --> 00:41:31,404
It's alright. I'll advise you.

464
00:41:31,548 --> 00:41:33,886
For this one, take one immediately.

465
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:36,886
Take another one 12 hours later.

466
00:41:36,998 --> 00:41:39,486
This one is the latest type. It takes only one pill.

467
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:40,645
Which one would you like?

468
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,328
I want all of them.

469
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:44,686
It's 60 baht per box.

470
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:47,046
- Four boxes are 240 baht. - Yes.

471
00:41:57,493 --> 00:41:58,773
I found you.

472
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:07,246
We have to talk.

473
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,926
You followed me?

474
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,672
You got me into trouble. Why did you tell the police to arrest me?

475
00:42:17,446 --> 00:42:19,246
Hold on. You dropped something.

476
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:46,486
Khim, are you done?

477
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,431
- Yes, Thaen. - Where is the pill?

478
00:42:49,084 --> 00:42:50,286
I already took it.

479
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:51,766
Let's go now.

480
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,966
No. They're here for the CCTV.

481
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:24,766
(They even took the camera in our client's car.)

482
00:43:25,286 --> 00:43:29,080
I was right to take out our CCTV's hard disk first.

483
00:43:29,286 --> 00:43:31,446
(They didn't get your footage of that night.)

484
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:33,726
This means that girl must have said something.

485
00:43:33,965 --> 00:43:35,246
I have to handle it.

486
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:38,806
Hey.

487
00:43:39,612 --> 00:43:40,886
Give me that.

488
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:49,046
Please stop.

489
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:52,366
Follow that car.

490
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:07,606
Please stop here.

491
00:44:40,446 --> 00:44:42,566
She caused trouble but she's still so lively.

492
00:44:48,726 --> 00:44:51,006
Can you come up? Let me help you.

493
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:53,526
Do you want to change? I can take you there.

494
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,270
- Yes. - Let's go.

495
00:45:13,822 --> 00:45:15,566
We have two people this time.

496
00:45:15,983 --> 00:45:17,606
Please prepare the kitchen for me.

497
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:19,046
Yes.

498
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:54,126
You. How did you get here?

499
00:45:54,269 --> 00:45:57,446
I'm here to see how you can still be happy.

500
00:45:57,846 --> 00:46:00,366
You followed me from Bangkok.

501
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:02,966
Did you tell anyone about that night?

502
00:46:04,926 --> 00:46:06,086
What about that night?

503
00:46:06,662 --> 00:46:08,246
Do you want me to say it?

504
00:46:08,686 --> 00:46:10,126
That night we...

505
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:11,846
We...

506
00:46:12,342 --> 00:46:13,686
We did it.

507
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:15,766
Are you crazy?

508
00:46:16,637 --> 00:46:18,322
I didn't tell anyone. Why would I?

509
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,277
The police tried to arrest me.

510
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:22,726
They said it's abduction.

511
00:46:23,686 --> 00:46:26,166
So, you came here to harass me.

512
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,126
Harass what?

513
00:46:29,645 --> 00:46:31,846
Watch your words. Watch out.

514
00:46:57,406 --> 00:46:59,366
You stalked me wherever I went.

515
00:46:59,478 --> 00:47:00,766
Isn't this harassment?

516
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,086
I didn't harass and abduct you.

517
00:47:03,222 --> 00:47:05,366
You know that you consented on that day.

518
00:47:07,485 --> 00:47:10,013
No. I didn't consent to it.

519
00:47:10,181 --> 00:47:12,675
See? It's like this, huh?

520
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:14,446
They're trying to put me in jail.

521
00:47:15,324 --> 00:47:17,766
That night, I was drunk.

522
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:20,806
I didn't know that would happen.

523
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:23,006
We're both drunk.

524
00:47:23,158 --> 00:47:24,818
You can't blame me one-sidedly.

525
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:28,366
I didn't tell anyone. You're behaving suspiciously.

526
00:47:29,866 --> 00:47:32,726
Khim? What are you doing?

527
00:47:34,214 --> 00:47:35,446
Khim.

528
00:47:39,806 --> 00:47:41,686
Thaen, I...

529
00:47:45,606 --> 00:47:47,526
I'm changing my clothes, Thaen.

530
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:50,086
Tell me when you're done.

531
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,646
Yes, Thaen. Uh...

532
00:47:55,854 --> 00:47:57,246
What are you doing?

533
00:47:58,205 --> 00:48:00,366
I'll follow you there later.

534
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:07,446
Let go off me.

535
00:48:08,006 --> 00:48:09,246
I didn't want to touch it.

536
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:10,926
Then, stop bothering me.

537
00:48:11,028 --> 00:48:12,468
Stop the police then.

538
00:48:12,716 --> 00:48:13,806
Hold off the charge.

539
00:48:13,904 --> 00:48:16,766
You should ask yourself if you have done anything wrong.

540
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:19,926
If you didn't have any record, no one would suspect you.

541
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:33,206
Where are you going? We have to talk.

542
00:48:34,709 --> 00:48:36,166
Khim, are you alright?

543
00:48:43,049 --> 00:48:47,886
I'm asking him where we're going to see the coral.

544
00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:51,206
Do you want any drink?

545
00:48:51,357 --> 00:48:52,886
Oh, yes. Sure.

546
00:48:53,446 --> 00:48:54,647
What do you have?

547
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,366
Water.

548
00:49:02,822 --> 00:49:04,046
I have water.

549
00:49:05,606 --> 00:49:07,206
I think it's safe.

550
00:49:12,778 --> 00:49:13,778
Khim.

551
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:15,606
I think we should go look at the scenery.

552
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:17,406
- Yes. - Let's go.

553
00:49:36,214 --> 00:49:37,406
The weather is good, isn't it?

554
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,126
Hello.

555
00:49:51,206 --> 00:49:52,566
We went out for a while.

556
00:49:53,046 --> 00:49:55,406
Yes. There's one boatman with us.

557
00:49:58,926 --> 00:50:00,326
He isn't your employee?

558
00:50:00,932 --> 00:50:03,566
How is it possible? How did he get on my boat?

559
00:50:05,206 --> 00:50:07,286
- What's wrong with you? - Come down.

560
00:50:07,726 --> 00:50:10,406
I'll ask him why he got on my boat.

561
00:50:21,732 --> 00:50:22,966
Hurry up.

562
00:50:24,797 --> 00:50:27,326
Come here right now.

563
00:50:31,124 --> 00:50:34,086
Get off the boat right now. No one can know we're on the same boat.

564
00:50:34,286 --> 00:50:35,366
No.

565
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,486
Until you promise that you would talk with your dad.

566
00:50:37,606 --> 00:50:40,126
I told you I didn't tell anyone.

567
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,560
Even if you didn't tell anyone,

568
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:44,766
there's still evidence.

569
00:50:45,229 --> 00:50:46,926
What kind of woman need this pill

570
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,566
if she hasn't done anything with a man?

571
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:51,526
You're trying to get me in jail.

572
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,046
- Give me that. - No.

573
00:50:54,749 --> 00:50:57,486
- Give it to me now. - No.

574
00:50:58,832 --> 00:51:01,926
We're already in a bad enough spot.

575
00:51:02,051 --> 00:51:04,606
- Give me that. - Promise me first.

576
00:51:17,766 --> 00:51:18,966
Yes, Mr. Sansern.

577
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:22,526
I know that someone's on the boat with us.

578
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:24,846
But I couldn't find him yet.

579
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:28,846
Yes. I'll go take a look at the top again.

580
00:51:31,806 --> 00:51:32,966
I beg you.

581
00:51:33,254 --> 00:51:35,526
Please get away from here for now.

582
00:51:35,813 --> 00:51:37,813
If you don't want more trouble, please.

583
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:40,726
To where? This is in the middle of the sea.

584
00:51:41,105 --> 00:51:42,366
Jump off.

585
00:51:42,744 --> 00:51:43,766
Are you crazy?

586
00:51:43,878 --> 00:51:45,286
I wasn't joking.

587
00:51:46,006 --> 00:51:48,166
- Go. - Are you trying to kill me?

588
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:51,126
I have no choice. You got here yourself.

589
00:51:51,534 --> 00:51:54,326
If my dad knows you followed me here, you're finished.

590
00:51:54,462 --> 00:51:55,926
- I won't go. - What?

591
00:51:56,926 --> 00:51:58,006
Khim.

592
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:02,646
Khim.

593
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,246
Thaen is here. I told you to get off.

594
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:07,966
Are you trying to kill me?

595
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:10,046
- You must get off right now. - Khim.

596
00:52:10,507 --> 00:52:12,206
- Get off. - No.

597
00:52:13,007 --> 00:52:14,246
You left me with no choice.

598
00:52:29,216 --> 00:52:30,286
Khim.

599
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:32,218
- Khim. - Yes?

600
00:52:32,509 --> 00:52:34,686
Have you seen the man who's on the boat with us?

601
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:38,166
I haven't seen him.

602
00:52:38,646 --> 00:52:41,646
He followed us here. He's probably a con artist.

603
00:52:42,627 --> 00:52:46,086
- Really? - The harbor is sending security to catch him.

604
00:52:49,258 --> 00:52:50,406
Hello.

605
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,406
Yes.

606
00:53:15,086 --> 00:53:16,326
Don't die.

607
00:53:44,566 --> 00:53:45,566
Jimmy.

608
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:47,326
Go help that boy over there.

609
00:54:21,557 --> 00:54:22,966
Congrats.

610
00:54:25,286 --> 00:54:26,646
You've survived now.

611
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:40,269
It doesn't look like it'll be over soon.

612
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,926
I'm sorry. We didn't think this could happen.

613
00:55:06,342 --> 00:55:07,342
Have you found him?

614
00:55:07,445 --> 00:55:09,040
We would find him in one hour.

615
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,379
It's a miracle if he could survive in the middle of the sea.

616
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,046
- Thank you. - Yes.

617
00:55:24,123 --> 00:55:25,246
Khim.

618
00:55:26,886 --> 00:55:27,926
Don't be scared.

619
00:55:28,086 --> 00:55:30,046
The criminal will surely be caught.

620
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:32,286
Yes.

621
00:55:37,173 --> 00:55:38,806
Is there anything unusual?

622
00:55:39,093 --> 00:55:40,093
No.

623
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,046
I'm sorry that something like this happened.

624
00:55:43,645 --> 00:55:44,752
Please look for him.

625
00:55:44,869 --> 00:55:48,606
A man with white skin. He's as tall as me.

626
00:55:48,734 --> 00:55:51,206
Hey, where are you going?

627
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:56,046
Don't you know we have to report to the office today?

628
00:55:58,846 --> 00:56:00,486
Didn't you hear me?

629
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:03,486
I told you to report to the office.

630
00:56:05,205 --> 00:56:06,605
Why aren't you getting the car?

631
00:56:08,326 --> 00:56:09,846
What are you standing for?

632
00:56:36,717 --> 00:56:38,286
Why is this car with you?

633
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,926
This car is mine from England.

634
00:56:41,654 --> 00:56:45,286
The car was stolen and its license got replaced by someone else.

635
00:56:45,677 --> 00:56:49,566
I have to travel around the world to get this car back.

636
00:56:50,766 --> 00:56:53,326
It's like my own child

637
00:56:54,014 --> 00:56:55,726
was stolen from me.

638
00:56:58,046 --> 00:57:00,166
You know that it really hurts, right?

639
00:57:01,638 --> 00:57:02,838
Who are you?

640
00:57:13,686 --> 00:57:15,686
I'm not the only one

641
00:57:16,045 --> 00:57:18,766
whom you have caused trouble with.

642
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,046
Are you the police informer?

643
00:57:25,757 --> 00:57:28,806
I want to tell you that you owe me your life.

644
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,902
If I didn't help you,

645
00:57:31,086 --> 00:57:33,086
you would already die.

646
00:57:36,846 --> 00:57:38,966
For the rest of your life,

647
00:57:39,086 --> 00:57:41,806
will you give it to me or them?

648
00:58:11,273 --> 00:58:13,726
Ms. Khim, you must be so scared.

649
00:58:14,198 --> 00:58:15,459
Thank goodness

650
00:58:15,629 --> 00:58:18,366
Ms. Khim wasn't alone with the criminal on the boat.

651
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:24,566
The rescue team has dived to find him. We'll know before it's dark.

652
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:28,526
A dangerous man like that must be heavily punished.

653
00:58:28,757 --> 00:58:30,957
I hope he won't die first.

654
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:35,886
Thaen.

655
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:38,806
From there is there really no way to go ashore?

656
00:58:38,976 --> 00:58:42,886
Well, if we don't have a life jacket, it's risky.

657
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:53,816
(This is bad. Is she a police informer?)

658
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:55,982
If she was, she wouldn't let me go.

659
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,416
If I get caught, I'll really be in jail.

660
00:58:59,645 --> 00:59:02,067
It's not great on my side either.

661
00:59:02,237 --> 00:59:05,326
In the end, they got our CCTV's hard disk.

662
00:59:05,454 --> 00:59:07,358
(I don't know whether they'll report our business)

663
00:59:07,469 --> 00:59:10,246
to make us pay for what you've done to her daughter.

664
00:59:10,805 --> 00:59:12,386
Are they a mafia or what?

665
00:59:13,254 --> 00:59:15,406
Did I sleep with the daughter of a godfather?

666
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:17,326
What should we do?

667
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:19,686
The evidence is in their hands.

668
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,726
Do they want to drive us to death?

669
00:59:28,214 --> 00:59:29,214
Khem.

670
00:59:29,372 --> 00:59:30,571
Investigate about them.

671
00:59:30,685 --> 00:59:32,806
Find out what business they have here.

672
00:59:33,126 --> 00:59:35,246
I won't stay still and do nothing.

673
01:00:24,228 --> 01:00:25,926
The room is this way.

674
01:00:46,869 --> 01:00:48,366
Is there any progress?

675
01:00:48,925 --> 01:00:50,646
Have you found the culprit?

676
01:00:51,766 --> 01:00:54,366
You can let anyone go to find evidence on the boat.

677
01:00:54,846 --> 01:00:55,966
I allow it.

678
01:00:56,286 --> 01:01:00,046
If you can catch the suspect, I'll gladly identify him.

679
01:01:10,616 --> 01:01:12,806
I didn't want to kill anyone.

680
01:01:13,726 --> 01:01:16,046
He must be fine. He must have survived.

681
01:01:18,455 --> 01:01:19,886
Please survive.

682
01:01:33,842 --> 01:01:35,006
Ms. Khim.

683
01:01:35,198 --> 01:01:38,526
The air conditioner isn't great. I'll let the technicians clean it first.

684
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,886
Sure. Let them in, Oun.

685
01:01:42,181 --> 01:01:43,380
I'll open the door.

686
01:01:47,446 --> 01:01:48,726
Please come in.

687
01:01:51,696 --> 01:01:53,158
Take a look carefully.

688
01:01:53,365 --> 01:01:57,006
It's summer. Clean it thoroughly to make it blow cool air.

689
01:01:57,406 --> 01:02:00,465
When you're done, go tell me downstairs.

690
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,286
It's already evening.

691
01:02:08,454 --> 01:02:10,046
They can't find him anymore.

692
01:02:12,446 --> 01:02:14,486
We're fortunate that we're alright.

693
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:22,433
Khim.

694
01:02:22,671 --> 01:02:25,046
Khim, have you stopped being scared?

695
01:02:30,342 --> 01:02:34,646
If we still can't find him, we can't be too sure.

696
01:02:35,726 --> 01:02:37,286
This is such a shame.

697
01:02:37,455 --> 01:02:40,046
Why have we only met scary people?

698
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:42,766
Don't try to cause trouble again then.

699
01:02:51,566 --> 01:02:53,566
We can't trust anyone nowadays.

700
01:02:59,554 --> 01:03:00,581
It's done.

701
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:02,606
Okay. Please wait.

702
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,326
Her life is so good.

703
01:03:14,422 --> 01:03:16,422
She's a princess.

704
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,046
A sinful woman.

705
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:35,966
You aren't dead?

706
01:03:36,367 --> 01:03:38,282
I didn't mean to.

707
01:03:38,386 --> 01:03:40,206
Sorry. I'm not dead.

708
01:03:42,086 --> 01:03:43,606
You've really survived?

709
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:47,006
I can't easily die. I can't let you go free like this.

710
01:03:48,508 --> 01:03:51,446
Wait. How did you get in? You'll be in trouble.

711
01:03:51,716 --> 01:03:52,926
I've survived,

712
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:55,886
so I want to experience the living standard of you rich people.

713
01:03:57,486 --> 01:03:59,322
Get out if you don't want to get caught.

714
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,086
At least, I won't be in trouble alone.

715
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,526
We'll die together.

716
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,006
At first, I thought the technicians came to clean the AC.

717
01:04:07,493 --> 01:04:09,926
They actually came to set up the camera.

718
01:04:16,221 --> 01:04:18,086
It's probably to observe your behavior.

719
01:04:18,406 --> 01:04:20,886
Did they take you here for traveling or to lock you up?

720
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:26,764
Dad did this much?

721
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:28,246
It could be worse

722
01:04:28,766 --> 01:04:30,366
if he sees the footage in the hard disk.

723
01:04:30,926 --> 01:04:32,086
What hard disk?

724
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:35,646
The footage from the CCTV in my garage that night.

725
01:04:37,965 --> 01:04:39,406
If there's a camera,

726
01:04:40,317 --> 01:04:43,886
- my dad will see... - If you don't want to die together, get that file.

727
01:04:44,223 --> 01:04:45,886
If he sees our video clip,

728
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:48,446
you'll never get out of this room again.

729
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,686
He must have copied the CCTV footage on that already.

730
01:05:34,694 --> 01:05:37,045
He sent people to watch over my garage the other day.

731
01:05:37,126 --> 01:05:38,486
When I wasn't there,

732
01:05:38,793 --> 01:05:40,086
they broke in to get it.

733
01:05:40,446 --> 01:05:42,166
He's trying to put a charge against me.

734
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:47,726
You must calm your dad

735
01:05:48,046 --> 01:05:50,966
and get all the evidence. He can't ruin my future like this.

736
01:06:01,581 --> 01:06:02,781
Dad.

737
01:06:05,366 --> 01:06:07,966
Dad, do you have some time for me?

738
01:06:08,878 --> 01:06:09,966
Why?

739
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:13,406
I want to watch a movie with you.

740
01:06:16,322 --> 01:06:17,486
Sure.

741
01:06:36,254 --> 01:06:38,046
Which one should we watch?

742
01:06:42,934 --> 01:06:45,646
I will let you choose.

743
01:07:03,446 --> 01:07:04,726
This one is good.

744
01:07:04,989 --> 01:07:07,486
It's a sequel of what we've seen together.

745
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:12,166
Are you sure

746
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:14,286
that you'll let me choose?

747
01:07:15,758 --> 01:07:18,886
If I get to watch TV with you, everything is good.

748
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:30,686
What about this?

749
01:07:38,543 --> 01:07:42,526
Don't think I don't know what you've lied to me.

750
01:07:43,432 --> 01:07:45,166
You're ridiculous.

751
01:07:45,886 --> 01:07:47,246
Thoughtless.

752
01:07:50,245 --> 01:07:51,406
How is he so great?

753
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:53,006
Why did you fall for this man?

754
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:55,766
He recorded a clip to expose you.

755
01:07:56,174 --> 01:07:57,726
Do you want this kind of life?

756
01:07:58,326 --> 01:08:00,206
This kind of disgusting life?

757
01:08:02,189 --> 01:08:03,526
You're so easy.

758
01:08:04,822 --> 01:08:06,222
Ungrateful.

759
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:12,046
Why?

760
01:08:12,326 --> 01:08:14,966
Are you embarrassed? Why weren't you embarrassed then?

761
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,006
On the boat today,

762
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:22,126
don't you think I don't know that it was him.

763
01:08:22,526 --> 01:08:23,966
The CCTV

764
01:08:24,247 --> 01:08:26,566
caught the footage of him around there.

765
01:08:26,813 --> 01:08:29,366
You knew it was him, but you didn't tell Thaenthai.

766
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,446
You brought him with you.

767
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,166
Do you really like him that much?

768
01:08:34,517 --> 01:08:36,246
He made you love him this much?

769
01:08:36,668 --> 01:08:38,166
How did I raise you?

770
01:08:38,334 --> 01:08:39,765
Why have you become like this?

771
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:41,577
Saikhim didn't know I was following her.

772
01:08:48,509 --> 01:08:49,926
What is the meaning of this?

773
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:52,126
Did you bring him here?

774
01:08:52,263 --> 01:08:53,406
I came here myself.

775
01:08:55,366 --> 01:08:57,246
Enough. That's enough.

776
01:08:57,526 --> 01:08:58,726
Enough.

777
01:09:00,085 --> 01:09:01,166
Get out.

778
01:09:02,357 --> 01:09:03,726
Why did you trick my daughter?

779
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:05,446
I didn't trick your daughter.

780
01:09:05,717 --> 01:09:08,446
Are you saying my daughter is stupid and let you trick her?

781
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,926
You raised her but you can't see through her.

782
01:09:11,054 --> 01:09:12,606
She doesn't have any feelings for me.

783
01:09:12,966 --> 01:09:14,326
She hates me.

784
01:09:14,574 --> 01:09:17,286
She swears at me when she sees me. She might want to kill me.

785
01:09:17,709 --> 01:09:19,326
You act like she's infatuated with me.

786
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:21,206
Then, why did you get close to her?

787
01:09:21,477 --> 01:09:23,166
You're the one who drags me to get involved.

788
01:09:23,334 --> 01:09:25,326
You're trying to push me into a corner.

789
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:27,566
You act like you're all high and mighty.

790
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:31,126
It isn't strange if your daughter won't trust you. You're this horrible.

791
01:09:31,383 --> 01:09:32,606
What did you say?

792
01:09:32,718 --> 01:09:34,806
She hates herself whenever she's with you.

793
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,423
You've never made anyone feel like they're good enough.

794
01:09:38,581 --> 01:09:40,486
She didn't fall for any men.

795
01:09:40,831 --> 01:09:42,566
She just feels better with herself

796
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,526
when she's with others.

797
01:09:45,773 --> 01:09:47,606
Have you made her like herself

798
01:09:47,909 --> 01:09:49,558
just like when she's with me?

799
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:58,086
- You're running your mouth. - Dad.

800
01:09:58,486 --> 01:09:59,486
Stop.

801
01:09:59,734 --> 01:10:01,454
- Stop. Please stop. - Get off me.

802
01:10:05,286 --> 01:10:06,726
Dad, stop.

803
01:10:06,886 --> 01:10:09,206
Stop. Please stop, Dad.

804
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:10,686
He isn't at fault.

805
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:14,166
He isn't at fault. I was the one who got close to him.

806
01:10:14,886 --> 01:10:16,166
Look at this, Dad.

807
01:10:16,414 --> 01:10:17,766
See?

808
01:10:18,262 --> 01:10:20,486
He isn't at fault. I was the one who first approached him.

809
01:10:20,614 --> 01:10:22,606
- Can you see? - Enough.

810
01:10:23,926 --> 01:10:25,206
Enough.

811
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:29,966
Are you out of your mind?

812
01:10:30,382 --> 01:10:32,166
He didn't trick me.

813
01:10:33,174 --> 01:10:35,686
He made me open my eyes.

814
01:10:38,141 --> 01:10:39,366
Open your eyes?

815
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:44,086
Do you think he's serious with you?

816
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:49,806
If you don't have the Kidakarn surname anymore,

817
01:10:50,406 --> 01:10:52,646
what men would be interested in you?

818
01:10:53,678 --> 01:10:54,886
Remember.

819
01:10:55,606 --> 01:10:58,006
No man will be interested in you

820
01:10:58,101 --> 01:11:00,526
as long as you don't have my fortune.

821
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:10,966
Get out.

822
01:11:12,846 --> 01:11:14,006
Scram.

823
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:15,766
Don't let me see you again.

824
01:11:20,421 --> 01:11:21,446
Leave!

825
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:05,566
You dare to come here.

826
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:09,046
- Why are you here? - To see my wife.

827
01:12:09,935 --> 01:12:11,126
You scoundrel.

828
01:12:12,726 --> 01:12:13,806
Prompt.

829
01:12:14,165 --> 01:12:15,166
Get him.

830
01:12:19,237 --> 01:12:20,566
What are you doing?

831
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:23,886
Prompt, wait.

832
01:12:26,246 --> 01:12:27,406
Prompt.

833
01:12:27,789 --> 01:12:30,606
- Get off me. - Why isn't he coming up? Is he alright?

834
01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:33,452
Prompt.

835
01:12:33,605 --> 01:12:34,926
Prompt, what are you doing?

836
01:12:35,414 --> 01:12:36,766
Prompt.

837
01:12:38,173 --> 01:12:39,406
Prompt!

838
01:12:39,798 --> 01:12:41,086
That's enough!

839
01:12:45,638 --> 01:12:47,806
No. Don't.

840
01:12:51,268 --> 01:12:52,646
Prompt, stop!

841
01:12:54,406 --> 01:12:55,966
Who do you think you are?

842
01:12:57,126 --> 01:12:58,406
Your brother-in-law.

843
01:13:01,271 --> 01:13:02,542
Prompt.

844
01:13:04,373 --> 01:13:05,926
That's enough, Prompt.

845
01:13:07,506 --> 01:13:08,646
Dad.

846
01:13:09,901 --> 01:13:11,646
Are you going to let Prompt kill him?

847
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:13,406
Tell him to stop, Dad.

848
01:13:13,606 --> 01:13:16,246
You didn't feel anything when he humiliated me.

849
01:13:19,309 --> 01:13:21,046
You still dare to see me as your relative?

850
01:13:22,877 --> 01:13:25,206
See? Do you see how violent he is?

851
01:13:28,686 --> 01:13:29,966
What you've done

852
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:31,944
isn't as violent as that?

853
01:13:32,181 --> 01:13:34,166
You treat him like he isn't human.

854
01:13:34,766 --> 01:13:36,366
That's enough.

855
01:13:41,225 --> 01:13:42,686
- Prompt. - Why?

856
01:13:42,926 --> 01:13:46,046
Why are you so worried about this scoundrel? Do you know

857
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,240
he asked for 5,000,000 baht for that clip?

858
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:51,406
That's not true.

859
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:56,686
He wants to blackmail you with it. I had to pay 5,000,000 baht to get that.

860
01:13:57,142 --> 01:13:58,326
That's not true.

861
01:14:04,397 --> 01:14:05,926
He already got the 5,000,000 baht.

862
01:14:06,213 --> 01:14:07,606
He's still here to bother you.

863
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:09,326
Is 5,000,000 baht not enough?

864
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:11,406
He holds you as a hostage

865
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:13,646
to make us fight with each other.

866
01:14:13,813 --> 01:14:15,813
That's why you thought badly of me.

867
01:14:16,259 --> 01:14:18,396
You're a liar. A liar.

868
01:14:21,386 --> 01:14:22,646
I'm a liar?

869
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:25,766
I've been with you since you were a child.

870
01:14:26,053 --> 01:14:28,766
Who is he? How well do you know him?

871
01:14:31,406 --> 01:14:33,166
Can't you see he's a trickster?

872
01:14:36,086 --> 01:14:37,606
Can you stop bothering my sister?

873
01:14:38,406 --> 01:14:40,006
How long will you leech off a woman?

874
01:14:57,966 --> 01:14:59,686
Enough. Please stop.

875
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,726
We should end it here.

876
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:08,646
It's not worth it for me and you.

877
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:12,806
Think of it as we've never met before.

878
01:15:13,486 --> 01:15:15,270
Don't ruin our lives more than this.

879
01:15:23,526 --> 01:15:24,686
Do you hear that?

880
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,006
She hates you so much.

881
01:15:29,134 --> 01:15:31,126
Get out of Saikhim's life

882
01:15:31,414 --> 01:15:33,062
if you want to live.

883
01:15:38,646 --> 01:15:40,606
Do you really think I'm that horrible?

884
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:46,046
You said you're going to give your life to me.

885
01:16:46,286 --> 01:16:48,846
Why did you get yourself in trouble again?

886
01:16:49,197 --> 01:16:50,926
My woman's luck has been bad recently.

887
01:16:51,396 --> 01:16:53,306
Let's get rid of it with me.

888
01:17:29,071 --> 01:17:31,366
Khem, you have the check.

889
01:17:34,389 --> 01:17:36,766
It's the money to stop bothering his daughter.

890
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:39,046
He left it as an exchange for the footage.

891
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:41,126
Why did you accept it?

892
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:44,246
- You. - Oh my God.

893
01:17:44,438 --> 01:17:45,646
Kla.

894
01:17:45,863 --> 01:17:46,886
Hey.

895
01:17:48,613 --> 01:17:51,126
Do you think it's worth what I've encountered right now?

896
01:17:51,556 --> 01:17:55,006
Hey, who told you to go alone to their home like that?

897
01:17:55,166 --> 01:17:56,886
Do you think you're a boxer?

898
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:58,526
If I accept this money,

899
01:17:58,886 --> 01:18:02,046
it means I'm admitting that I want to trick his daughter.

900
01:18:03,558 --> 01:18:06,446
Think of it as money for your medicine.

901
01:18:06,686 --> 01:18:09,606
Are you going to let them destroy your dignity with this money?

902
01:18:11,206 --> 01:18:14,086
How is it different from us making a living off of rich people?

903
01:18:15,933 --> 01:18:17,966
The money from those prick's desires

904
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:21,086
didn't come with the future of a good girl.

905
01:18:21,381 --> 01:18:23,686
While that girl offers herself to protect me,

906
01:18:23,807 --> 01:18:25,406
look at what you've done to me.

907
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:28,646
It won't make her dad change the way he looks at you.

908
01:18:28,846 --> 01:18:32,126
At least, Saikhim won't be seen as a girl who was tricked by a man.

909
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:35,446
She would be his beloved daughter who can meet her dad's face.

910
01:18:35,926 --> 01:18:37,406
But these 5,000,000 baht,

911
01:18:37,766 --> 01:18:39,486
it can ruin her life.

912
01:18:40,343 --> 01:18:42,846
She shouldn't be pitied because of someone like me.

913
01:18:52,049 --> 01:18:54,126
Mr. Sin has decided to cut off your scholarship.

914
01:18:54,326 --> 01:18:57,886
If you still talk with Ms. Khim, we'll take action against you.

915
01:19:01,013 --> 01:19:03,422
Khim. Khim.

916
01:19:04,142 --> 01:19:05,446
- Lita. - How are you, Khim?

917
01:19:05,654 --> 01:19:07,054
- Khim. - Lita.

918
01:19:40,423 --> 01:19:42,766
Dad, stop. Please stop.

919
01:19:42,989 --> 01:19:44,326
That's enough, Dad.

920
01:19:44,463 --> 01:19:45,553
He isn't at fault.

921
01:19:45,664 --> 01:19:47,566
I was the one who got close to him.

922
01:19:52,446 --> 01:19:54,366
Enough. Please stop.

923
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:48,366
A new member.

924
01:20:48,518 --> 01:20:49,966
Good job.

925
01:20:55,886 --> 01:20:56,926
Hello?

926
01:20:57,182 --> 01:20:59,166
- I think I'm pregnant. - What?

927
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:00,846
(If I'm really pregnant,)

928
01:21:00,996 --> 01:21:02,766
what should I do, Lita?

929
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:04,206
Wait.

930
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:05,565
(Calm down, Khim.)

931
01:21:05,677 --> 01:21:08,126
How could you be pregnant? With whom?

932
01:21:10,519 --> 01:21:13,406
When we exchange our homes, Lita.

933
01:21:13,766 --> 01:21:18,766
What? Don't tell me you're pregnant with a man from the dating app?

934
01:21:22,206 --> 01:21:23,446
Lita.

935
01:21:24,032 --> 01:21:26,166
Lita, if I'm really pregnant,

936
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:28,366
Dad will probably kill me.

937
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:30,709
It might not be that bad.

938
01:21:30,964 --> 01:21:32,366
(Calm down.)

939
01:21:35,845 --> 01:21:38,846
Dad watches all of my steps, Lita.

940
01:21:39,165 --> 01:21:42,486
I'm stressed. I'm extremely stressed.

941
01:21:42,687 --> 01:21:46,406
Can you help me, Lita? I want to know if I'm really pregnant.

942
01:21:47,774 --> 01:21:50,041
Okay. I'm almost getting off work.

943
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,766
(Can you sneak off to see me?)

944
01:21:51,926 --> 01:21:53,486
Don't panic. We need to be sure.

945
01:21:53,686 --> 01:21:55,326
Calm down. I'll go there quickly.

946
01:21:55,422 --> 01:21:56,742
Okay.

947
01:22:00,446 --> 01:22:01,766
Is she really pregnant?

948
01:22:07,968 --> 01:22:09,246
What have I done?

949
01:22:20,806 --> 01:22:22,206
I would like a steam room.

950
01:23:08,278 --> 01:23:10,006
What should I do?

951
01:23:10,206 --> 01:23:12,966
Why did something like this happen to me?

952
01:23:19,121 --> 01:23:20,726
Calm down, Khim.

953
01:23:31,726 --> 01:23:33,246
Test it again.

954
01:23:34,966 --> 01:23:36,386
It might be a mistake.

955
01:23:43,207 --> 01:23:45,077
I shouldn't have let this happen.

956
01:23:45,206 --> 01:23:46,926
What should I do, Lita?

957
01:23:47,158 --> 01:23:49,207
No. How could I let this happen?

958
01:23:49,326 --> 01:23:51,486
It's not your fault, Khim.

959
01:23:53,326 --> 01:23:57,126
It's my fault. I brought those men into your life.

960
01:24:03,142 --> 01:24:05,446
I was bad that I couldn't see through their nature.

961
01:24:08,438 --> 01:24:10,326
That's why it became like this.

962
01:24:17,534 --> 01:24:19,126
Lita.

963
01:24:21,182 --> 01:24:22,686
I'm scared.

964
01:24:25,532 --> 01:24:26,886
If Dad knows,

965
01:24:27,738 --> 01:24:30,526
he will surely kill me, Lita.

966
01:24:30,726 --> 01:24:32,206
Don't let him know.

967
01:24:33,801 --> 01:24:34,969
We...

968
01:24:35,246 --> 01:24:37,326
We'll solve this problem.

969
01:24:37,798 --> 01:24:39,806
We can solve this problem.

970
01:24:54,926 --> 01:24:56,286
It's partly my fault.

971
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:01,006
I'll take responsibility.

972
01:25:01,845 --> 01:25:03,286
Don't be scared, Khim.

973
01:26:10,086 --> 01:26:11,206
Hey.

974
01:26:13,517 --> 01:26:14,926
Are you Saikhim's friend?

975
01:26:15,086 --> 01:26:17,286
It's you. What do you want?

976
01:26:17,398 --> 01:26:18,846
Can I get Saikhim's number?

977
01:26:18,976 --> 01:26:21,326
Douchebag. Who do you think you are?

978
01:26:21,789 --> 01:26:23,486
You probably know about us now.

979
01:26:23,733 --> 01:26:25,566
- I have something... - Stop.

980
01:26:25,939 --> 01:26:28,566
Saikhim told me how much she wanted to kill you.

981
01:26:28,926 --> 01:26:32,006
If possible, she wants to kill you several times a day.

982
01:26:32,766 --> 01:26:34,726
When I heard it from her,

983
01:26:35,396 --> 01:26:37,606
I want to castrate you myself.

984
01:26:38,214 --> 01:26:39,886
A douchebag with strong sperm.

985
01:26:40,086 --> 01:26:42,406
The only suitable place for you is hell.

986
01:26:42,646 --> 01:26:44,326
You shouldn't live in this world.

987
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:50,278
Is she that angry?

988
01:27:28,606 --> 01:27:30,326
(Test it again.)

989
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:33,406
(It might be a mistake.)

990
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:12,766
You said

991
01:28:13,718 --> 01:28:15,806
I could entrust my life to you.

992
01:28:16,766 --> 01:28:22,166
Were you serious? Or did you just say it to make you look cool?

993
01:28:22,437 --> 01:28:24,246
You should be careful.

994
01:28:25,045 --> 01:28:26,045
My uncle

995
01:28:26,182 --> 01:28:27,606
won't let you off easily.

996
01:28:28,117 --> 01:28:31,062
If you're here, your dad can still follow you here.

997
01:28:31,262 --> 01:28:33,085
- Wait. - You can't go up there.

998
01:28:33,190 --> 01:28:34,526
Don't come here.

999
01:28:34,989 --> 01:28:37,526
- I told you that you can't go up. - Get out.

1000
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:41,486
That scoundrel tries to use a baby to trap Saikhim.

1001
01:28:41,654 --> 01:28:44,326
Even if I only have my body, you're no match for me

1002
01:28:44,557 --> 01:28:46,326
because you've never given her freedom.

1003
01:28:46,486 --> 01:28:48,446
That's why she came to see a scoundrel like me.

1004
01:28:49,725 --> 01:28:50,725
Is the baby alright?
