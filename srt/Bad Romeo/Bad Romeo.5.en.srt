1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:01,286
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,373 --> 00:00:02,683
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:03,992
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:45,326
I'll keep this kid.

5
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:49,166
When he's born, I'll give my kid to him.

6
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,086
A stupid child like you,

7
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:53,326
I won't feel sorry if I don't have one.

8
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,006
It's the consequence of using

9
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:57,906
your emotion to lead your life. You only thought of the kid,

10
00:02:58,206 --> 00:03:00,206
but you made her lose everyone.

11
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,966
I'm here to ask for Saikhim's hand.

12
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:04,446
Do you think your son is suitable for my daughter?

13
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:07,446
From now on, no matter how their lives will become,

14
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:10,846
I'll make them feel proud of themselves once again.

15
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:14,446
At least, they'll be better parents than you.

16
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:17,486
(I couldn't imagine waking up without her.)

17
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:19,926
(Our simple happiness)

18
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:22,406
(might be complex when that day comes.)

19
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:26,206
(Your hand that I was holding. Your lap that I was sitting on.)

20
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:29,406
(How could I not think of him when I hug someone else?)

21
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:48,606
The sunset's view in that house must be beautiful.

22
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:54,166
Sure. I'll make a window so you can see this view every day.

23
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,046
Why did you build this house?

24
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:01,126
It's the home for our couple's life.

25
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:05,086
You wanted to stay here, so I decided to build it.

26
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:07,326
I want to finish it as soon as possible.

27
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,206
I can't wait for that day to come.

28
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:14,006
Hold on.

29
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:16,566
I didn't say I would marry you.

30
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:19,326
What would we be then?

31
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,326
We'll be the same as we are right now.

32
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,646
No. You must move there with me when that house is done.

33
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:28,966
I'm not ready.

34
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:30,646
Can we talk about it later?

35
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,126
Are you going to leave?

36
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,791
How could we build a family if we don't live together?

37
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:38,326
We can live as a father and mother.

38
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,286
We don't need to be husband and wife.

39
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:42,726
No. Who would live like that?

40
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:45,246
You don't want to marry me?

41
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,024
People who marry each other also love each other.

42
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:51,783
But...

43
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:53,446
We...

44
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:57,446
It's too abrupt for us if we suddenly get married.

45
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:02,646
We almost have a kid together.

46
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:06,006
It's already late for us.

47
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:01,526
Don't you like the food?

48
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:03,646
No.

49
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:05,486
Kloy.

50
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:08,046
Cook something else tomorrow.

51
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,566
- Sure. - Good.

52
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:10,926
It's alright.

53
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:42,486
People who marry each other also love each other.

54
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:44,926
But we...

55
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:47,213
We...

56
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:50,446
it's too abrupt for us if we suddenly get married.

57
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:10,366
What's wrong with those two?

58
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:11,846
They look awkward.

59
00:07:12,054 --> 00:07:13,054
It's your fault, Dad.

60
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:16,366
You like to get in their ways. They want to flirt with each other.

61
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:18,702
But we're in their ways.

62
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:31,478
Dad.

63
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:34,766
What's this, Dad?

64
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:39,486
There are many mosquitoes. Light this up to chase them away for her.

65
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:42,006
Stay with her until morning.

66
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:43,886
No one would bother you.

67
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,446
Sure, Dad.

68
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:49,206
Wait, Kla.

69
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:56,406
Wear this too.

70
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:04,726
It's cold recently.

71
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:09,406
Go.

72
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:10,966
Thanks, Dad.

73
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,680
Stay there until morning, alright?

74
00:08:44,286 --> 00:08:46,166
Kloyjai bought this from the market.

75
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,606
She didn't think you would have it.

76
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:53,046
Dad told me to light orange peels for you.

77
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:25,526
- Are you alright? - Stop.

78
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,806
Do it yourself.

79
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,206
What are you doing?

80
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,366
Handle the rest yourself.

81
00:09:57,989 --> 00:09:59,806
I know why you're hesitating.

82
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:02,886
If you don't want it, no one can force you.

83
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,726
Hey, why did you come back?

84
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:07,926
Please follow me this way.

85
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,653
Everything that we do here is all organic.

86
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:14,966
This is one of the newest houses. It's made out of mud.

87
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:17,166
And especially for the roof,

88
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:19,206
and we'll...

89
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:25,766
It's made out of mud and also a special type of leaf.

90
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:32,726
Please follow me this way.

91
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:36,086
I'm gonna show you the rice field.

92
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:45,766
Please go ahead.

93
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,846
Khim, look at this.

94
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:09,606
There'll be more visitors on Friday, but we're full. Here.

95
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:14,966
Dad told me to ask you when you'll move to the new house.

96
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,086
So, I can let them stay here.

97
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:28,046
I'll try to gradually move all of my stuff before Friday.

98
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:29,526
Okay.

99
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,446
This house looks nice.

100
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:42,206
Do you want to live in it?

101
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:45,566
I'm going to move my stuff here.

102
00:13:46,502 --> 00:13:47,966
But you didn't want it.

103
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:55,926
The homestays here are all full.

104
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:58,366
I have to move out of that house.

105
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:02,286
Sure. I won't mind if you stay here.

106
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:05,246
It'll feel breezy when you sleep alone here.

107
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:10,213
You said this would be our house.

108
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:01,606
(When I go to a place and I like it,)

109
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:05,046
(I'll sketch the place and keep it here.)

110
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:09,926
(This notebook is like the note that keeps all of my happiness.)

111
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,406
(Everything I love)

112
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:13,646
(is in here.)

113
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:25,606
(People who marry each other also love each other.)

114
00:15:26,086 --> 00:15:30,406
(It's too abrupt for us if we suddenly get married.)

115
00:15:33,046 --> 00:15:34,326
This is the reason.

116
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:54,606
Oun?

117
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:24,566
Oun.

118
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:27,806
- Hello. - Hello.

119
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,046
I miss you so much.

120
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:35,126
Oun, did Dad really fire you?

121
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:37,286
Yes.

122
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:40,686
I can't look after you well enough.

123
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:43,486
It's not like that.

124
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:46,126
I'm sorry, Oun.

125
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,303
You have been with my family for over 10 years.

126
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,166
You got into trouble because of me.

127
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:52,046
It's alright.

128
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:54,246
How are you now, Ms. Khim?

129
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:55,766
Are you alright?

130
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,926
I had to adjust myself when I first came here.

131
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,326
But now, I really like this place.

132
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:13,446
I'll take you to stay at our farm.

133
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,590
You'll see how I have been living.

134
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:16,766
Yes.

135
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,966
Are we going now?

136
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:19,606
I parked my car over there.

137
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:24,486
Oun, do you remember Kla?

138
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:27,646
Hello.

139
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:31,086
I've prepared your accommodation. You can stay there.

140
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:33,686
Let's go.

141
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:37,606
It's alright. I can carry it for you. You must be tired now.

142
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:41,286
Let's go. Let's go to our home.

143
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:52,358
I have an errand to run here.

144
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,486
What are you doing?

145
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:02,446
Since Oun is here,

146
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:04,486
I would like to use this chance

147
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:06,206
to do everything right.

148
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,566
I'll bring Saikhim to register our marriage.

149
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,286
Since Khim respects you like her mother,

150
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,661
I would like you

151
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,606
to be our witness.

152
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:14,806
It's my fault for being negligent like always.

153
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,606
I've taken you for granted.

154
00:20:19,238 --> 00:20:22,406
I understand why you're hesitating about our marriage.

155
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:25,166
We've made a lot of mistakes.

156
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:27,686
This is the first time

157
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:32,406
that we'll do everything right like other couples.

158
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:39,566
I don't want to use "love" like I've been using.

159
00:20:40,646 --> 00:20:42,406
I always use my emotions over logic.

160
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:46,806
But this time, I'll try to use common sense to lead my life.

161
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,806
Please marry me, Khim.

162
00:20:57,126 --> 00:20:58,606
I won't disappoint you

163
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,846
for throwing away your future to live with me.

164
00:22:34,606 --> 00:22:37,646
This day is the first day of your life as a husband

165
00:22:37,886 --> 00:22:39,446
and wife legally.

166
00:22:39,646 --> 00:22:42,166
I hope you'll be happy forever.

167
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,366
There won't be Saikhim Kidakarn anymore.

168
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,246
There'll only be Saikhim Chayodom.

169
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:53,086
You'll be mine alone.

170
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:07,094
I hope you'll be like a pillar and a beam

171
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:09,566
which will help each other to support the house.

172
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,606
I hope you can forgive each other,

173
00:23:16,782 --> 00:23:18,406
so your lives will be stable.

174
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:38,486
I'll leave her to you. Please cherish Ms. Khim as much as possible.

175
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:47,246
I hope you will love and be honest with each other forever.

176
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,006
Make your home truly your home.

177
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:51,446
Then, everything will be alright.

178
00:23:59,246 --> 00:24:01,766
Kla, I'll return this to you.

179
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:06,286
This is all of the money you've sent back to me since you've worked.

180
00:24:08,366 --> 00:24:10,966
Keep it to build your family.

181
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,045
No, Dad.

182
00:24:13,143 --> 00:24:14,286
Just accept it.

183
00:24:14,468 --> 00:24:15,654
No, Dad.

184
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:20,646
If you don't want it,

185
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:22,726
keep it for your kid.

186
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:24,886
I give it to you.

187
00:24:30,926 --> 00:24:32,006
Thank you.

188
00:24:38,606 --> 00:24:39,766
Everyone,

189
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,806
- shall we take a photo? - Sure.

190
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:43,086
Come on.

191
00:24:43,238 --> 00:24:44,406
How would we take it?

192
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:45,897
Dad, stand behind them.

193
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,646
Oun, please stand behind them.

194
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:52,406
Come here.

195
00:24:55,382 --> 00:24:57,142
Are you ready?

196
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:26,526
Uncle Sin doesn't look troubled that her daughter had run away.

197
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:29,086
I think he's trying to accept it.

198
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:33,206
He feels humiliated, but he can't show it to anyone.

199
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,006
He put himself to work so that he doesn't have to think of it.

200
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Can you stay here?

201
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:49,166
It's much better than I imagined.

202
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:50,566
Really?

203
00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:54,366
Then, you should live with me.

204
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:57,046
You'll take care of my kid later.

205
00:27:03,494 --> 00:27:04,966
Isn't it too soon?

206
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:08,166
You got married although you've only known each other for a few months.

207
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:10,606
Do you really know him well enough?

208
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:13,406
Although we just knew each other,

209
00:27:13,646 --> 00:27:18,246
he knows me better than people who've been with me all my life.

210
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:20,046
He might look aggressive,

211
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:23,606
but he's never left me when I have a problem.

212
00:27:25,535 --> 00:27:27,966
He looks after me like I'm a princess.

213
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:30,526
But I won't tell him. He'll get carried away.

214
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:37,047
Oun and Khim, you can stay in our bridal house.

215
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:40,246
Wait, am I bothering you two?

216
00:27:41,045 --> 00:27:42,406
No, Oun.

217
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:45,686
You should stay with me tonight.

218
00:27:47,388 --> 00:27:50,006
Sure. I'll give the bridal house to you.

219
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:53,686
Isn't it the time to walk the bride?

220
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,366
We don't have any ceremony.

221
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,320
We didn't think about the auspicious time either.

222
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:01,646
Anywhere is the same for sleeping.

223
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,206
I'll bring your luggage to our home for now.

224
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:06,446
You don't have to.

225
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:08,406
I can take it myself.

226
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:14,446
No, Oun.

227
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:17,604
You must stay with me tonight, so we can talk together.

228
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:20,046
Okay. I'll take your luggage there.

229
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:23,062
No.

230
00:28:23,861 --> 00:28:25,166
You can stay together.

231
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:31,086
Oun.

232
00:28:53,326 --> 00:28:57,766
Should we open a course to teach how to weave clothes?

233
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,926
It might attract more women to come here.

234
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:03,766
We can let Kloyjai teach them. Should we try it for once?

235
00:29:04,758 --> 00:29:05,886
Here.

236
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:14,326
We have to do everything moderately. Don't do too much or too little.

237
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:20,006
Stop talking about work.

238
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,886
Come here. Let's take a rest.

239
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:13,206
We should stop with our act.

240
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:16,336
What act?

241
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:18,326
I'm always like this.

242
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:25,606
You're resisting it.

243
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:32,486
Your body is so stiff right now.

244
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:46,846
She's still alive.

245
00:30:47,286 --> 00:30:49,006
She might lose her senses.

246
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:53,166
Good night. I'm sleepy now.

247
00:30:58,494 --> 00:30:59,966
Let's see if you can sleep.

248
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:31,926
What's wrong?

249
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:35,366
No.

250
00:32:35,493 --> 00:32:36,646
No?

251
00:32:37,182 --> 00:32:38,382
Nothing.

252
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:43,486
What's wrong?

253
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,870
I think I can't raise my arm. It hurts.

254
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:53,166
I actually slept on your arm last night.

255
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:55,006
Does it hurt much?

256
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,046
I'll massage it for you.

257
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:01,886
Is it better?

258
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:09,758
What are you doing?

259
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:13,326
To make you get used to it. If you're embarrassed, you'll be punished.

260
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,086
No. Don't.

261
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:29,006
No. I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

262
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,686
- Let me go. - I haven't brushed either.

263
00:34:23,502 --> 00:34:24,566
There.

264
00:34:24,782 --> 00:34:26,446
It's what they call the Milky Way.

265
00:34:28,886 --> 00:34:30,766
We can see it only a few months a year.

266
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:33,926
It depends on the lunar phase.

267
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:36,886
In English, they call it "Milky Way" or something.

268
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:41,726
It's pretty.

269
00:34:44,726 --> 00:34:46,286
We only have this at night.

270
00:35:29,806 --> 00:35:33,306
Why are you going back so soon? You should stay here longer.

271
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:36,046
I have to take care of my grandchild.

272
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:41,206
Then, I'll go visit you at your home.

273
00:35:41,846 --> 00:35:44,486
Please take care of yourself, Ms. Khim.

274
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:46,406
That's my job.

275
00:35:46,957 --> 00:35:48,286
I'll take care of her.

276
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:53,806
Please send me some messages. Don't disappear on me.

277
00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:56,526
I'll call you every day.

278
00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:06,166
Have a safe travel.

279
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:07,526
Yes.

280
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,326
My luggage.

281
00:36:09,407 --> 00:36:11,151
- I'll send you off. - Okay.

282
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:21,006
You can just send me off here.

283
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:22,846
- It's alright. - Okay.

284
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:24,166
Thank you.

285
00:36:24,326 --> 00:36:25,846
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

286
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:33,606
You can leave. Don't worry about me.

287
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:57,886
Here.

288
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:10,887
(Hong Hean Yoo Sa Bai)

289
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:14,966
Kla.

290
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:16,686
Someone wants to see you.

291
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:24,528
Khem, how did you get here?

292
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:27,526
Kla, I miss you so much.

293
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,806
I'm here to congratulate you.

294
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:34,046
You left me for your wife.

295
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:41,286
He's Khem, my employee at the garage.

296
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:43,406
He used my photo to chat with you.

297
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:46,086
Hey, if you didn't have me,

298
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:48,806
you wouldn't become a couple.

299
00:37:49,014 --> 00:37:50,766
You came here to brag about that?

300
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:55,326
Actually, there's more than that.

301
00:37:57,887 --> 00:37:59,166
I'm thirsty.

302
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:01,166
Can I have a glass of water?

303
00:38:13,478 --> 00:38:14,566
What?

304
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:17,446
The police freeze our bank account.

305
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,486
I think we're finished.

306
00:38:20,606 --> 00:38:22,166
That's why I brought them here.

307
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:29,886
What should we do?

308
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,366
We can't transfer the money in time.

309
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,766
Leave them here. I'll deal with them.

310
00:38:36,997 --> 00:38:39,606
You should go hide somewhere. Don't let the police track you.

311
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:43,566
Kla, I don't have any money.

312
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:46,366
Where could I run away to?

313
00:39:06,414 --> 00:39:07,606
Is something wrong?

314
00:39:07,957 --> 00:39:09,437
Khem is here to visit me.

315
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:18,966
Are you sure? Is there something about you I didn't know about?

316
00:39:19,614 --> 00:39:21,686
What is actually the job that you two have been doing?

317
00:39:40,365 --> 00:39:42,566
Our garage fakes a license plate for tax-evading vehicles.

318
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:44,686
We're hiding these items.

319
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:47,446
I don't have any degree or any knowledge.

320
00:39:47,716 --> 00:39:50,326
I couldn't make an honest living.

321
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:53,566
So, I make a living off a rich heir who smuggled vehicles.

322
00:39:54,246 --> 00:39:57,006
When your brother got into trouble, I did that to him.

323
00:39:57,387 --> 00:39:59,606
So, all of the money you send here every month

324
00:39:59,806 --> 00:40:01,446
was from this job?

325
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:04,086
My garage is closed now.

326
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:05,726
The police are tracking us down.

327
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:08,046
Khem and I can't go back there anymore.

328
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:11,526
You wouldn't think of this if you weren't cornered.

329
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:14,446
Not everyone is born with a silver spoon.

330
00:40:14,893 --> 00:40:16,406
Our necessities are different.

331
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:21,566
I just know about this now.

332
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,286
What should I do?

333
00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:26,406
Do I have to accept this matter?

334
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:32,326
I know I'm a scoundrel.

335
00:40:35,598 --> 00:40:37,446
We can't go back to change our past.

336
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,006
I would like to be born worthy of you.

337
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,658
I couldn't choose how I was born.

338
00:40:49,549 --> 00:40:51,286
I promise I will turn over a new leaf.

339
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,006
You don't have to forgive me.

340
00:40:55,374 --> 00:40:57,566
Just give me a chance to prove myself.

341
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,066
I promise I won't make you regret that you chose to stay with me.

342
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,486
Please think of me more than before.

343
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:21,206
I promise that

344
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:25,246
I won't do any risky job again.

345
00:41:33,446 --> 00:41:34,526
Take the car.

346
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:36,829
You can use it or sell it. It's up to you.

347
00:41:37,677 --> 00:41:40,126
Think of it as our dividend.

348
00:41:40,534 --> 00:41:43,646
For the money that was taken, think of it as a price to pay for our future.

349
00:41:45,446 --> 00:41:46,526
What about you?

350
00:41:52,254 --> 00:41:53,606
I will start again.

351
00:41:54,413 --> 00:41:56,566
I can't live my life as risky as before.

352
00:41:58,174 --> 00:41:59,406
I understand you.

353
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:02,246
We went through a lot of things.

354
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:08,326
When I see you happy,

355
00:42:08,646 --> 00:42:09,846
I feel happy too.

356
00:42:16,853 --> 00:42:18,133
Please take care of him.

357
00:42:26,548 --> 00:42:27,726
Good luck.

358
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,526
Hello.

359
00:42:38,605 --> 00:42:40,766
Yes. I'd like to make a confirmation

360
00:42:40,863 --> 00:42:45,886
for your group of six people. You're coming in May?

361
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:48,646
Yes.

362
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:52,206
Yes. Perfect. And no food allergies?

363
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,057
Okay. And you'll be doing the group...

364
00:42:59,198 --> 00:43:00,198
Okay.

365
00:43:00,566 --> 00:43:01,566
Perfect.

366
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,726
Yes. We'll see you soon. Bye.

367
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:13,926
Where is Kla?

368
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:15,406
He didn't milk the cows.

369
00:43:15,558 --> 00:43:18,326
Oh, Kla went out to send off his friend.

370
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,046
Where is he going?

371
00:43:24,366 --> 00:43:27,886
I heard Kla would stop by at a bank.

372
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:34,926
Go take a look if Kla's account book is still there.

373
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:36,886
Yes.

374
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:59,046
How is it?

375
00:44:00,236 --> 00:44:01,846
I didn't find the account book.

376
00:44:02,252 --> 00:44:03,446
Kla probably took it with him.

377
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,006
Did he take it or did his friend take it?

378
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:10,126
I knew it. This employee of Kla shouldn't be trusted.

379
00:44:12,033 --> 00:44:13,246
Dad.

380
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:26,326
Kla!

381
00:44:36,013 --> 00:44:37,126
What are you doing here?

382
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,206
You closed the account?

383
00:44:48,406 --> 00:44:49,686
Where is the money?

384
00:44:54,165 --> 00:44:56,366
I gave it to Khem to open...

385
00:44:58,325 --> 00:45:00,548
How would your wife and your kid live?

386
00:45:01,455 --> 00:45:03,455
Do you think you'll leech off your wife?

387
00:45:07,766 --> 00:45:11,046
I didn't think you would see others more important than your family.

388
00:45:57,326 --> 00:45:58,486
Are you angry?

389
00:46:00,206 --> 00:46:02,246
Do you think I should be angry?

390
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:15,416
Although I gave all of my money to Khem,

391
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:17,286
I wasn't stupid.

392
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:28,246
Khem has to take care of his mother.

393
00:46:28,566 --> 00:46:29,726
And about those money,

394
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:33,046
he has to hide from his crime.

395
00:46:33,366 --> 00:46:34,606
It's not much.

396
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:36,246
What about us?

397
00:46:37,726 --> 00:46:38,966
We still have our home,

398
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,366
and our job.

399
00:46:40,886 --> 00:46:42,446
I gave him my money

400
00:46:42,606 --> 00:46:44,526
because I got a job to go observe a power plant.

401
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:47,606
I'll go to Laos with engineers.

402
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:51,966
I want to get money to pay back for that

403
00:46:52,486 --> 00:46:54,206
before our kid is born.

404
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,366
Until you get that much money,

405
00:47:00,525 --> 00:47:02,126
how many times do you have to go?

406
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,166
How long would it take?

407
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,286
I'll come back when it's finished.

408
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,846
Then, I'll go there again.

409
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,486
Until he is born,

410
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:12,926
I think I can go three or four times.

411
00:47:14,062 --> 00:47:15,566
This means

412
00:47:17,094 --> 00:47:19,246
we won't be together anymore?

413
00:47:28,326 --> 00:47:29,886
I want to be the head of the family.

414
00:47:30,382 --> 00:47:32,286
I want my kid to be proud of me.

415
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:38,006
When are you going?

416
00:47:40,446 --> 00:47:41,606
Next week.

417
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:51,646
Please wait for me here.

418
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:53,621
I'll be back.

419
00:47:56,046 --> 00:47:57,286
I'm a new man.

420
00:47:57,766 --> 00:47:59,086
You should be happy.

421
00:48:06,446 --> 00:48:08,006
That shaggy former husband.

422
00:48:10,244 --> 00:48:11,886
He couldn't give you a ring.

423
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:17,086
Don't think it's a waste.

424
00:48:25,117 --> 00:48:26,406
A good man

425
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:30,222
is rarer than a ring.

426
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:32,566
If I have a good husband,

427
00:48:34,565 --> 00:48:36,565
I don't want any ring.

428
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:25,486
He tricked Saikhim to register their marriage.

429
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:27,886
He wants money from us.

430
00:49:28,414 --> 00:49:31,366
It looks like Ms. Khim is really attracted to that man.

431
00:49:31,566 --> 00:49:35,406
I think Khim can't catch on to what he's doing.

432
00:49:36,726 --> 00:49:38,666
He wants to use the law as his tool.

433
00:49:39,681 --> 00:49:40,886
Such a trickster.

434
00:49:41,086 --> 00:49:44,086
Ms. Khim probably wants some love.

435
00:49:44,286 --> 00:49:48,326
When she sees someone who treats her well, she's easily deceived.

436
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:52,526
I don't know when Ms. Khim will realize that.

437
00:49:52,654 --> 00:49:53,966
After I die maybe.

438
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:56,926
I won't give her any inheritance.

439
00:50:06,126 --> 00:50:08,686
Mom, why did Oun come back?

440
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,606
Mr. Sin was the one who picked her up.

441
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:15,086
Khim isn't here anymore. Why did Oun come back?

442
00:50:15,709 --> 00:50:17,886
Saikhim might come back soon.

443
00:50:18,109 --> 00:50:21,446
I heard Khim's boyfriend is being tracked by the police.

444
00:50:22,046 --> 00:50:24,406
If she has no place left, she will come back.

445
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:29,366
Do you think Uncle Sin would accept her child when she's like that?

446
00:50:29,621 --> 00:50:31,046
Even if there wasn't Saikhim,

447
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:33,406
Mr. Sin wouldn't care about us anyway.

448
00:50:33,724 --> 00:50:37,766
But what if we change that? What if we bring Khim back to him?

449
00:50:38,133 --> 00:50:40,486
Would Mr. Sin value us more?

450
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:44,366
Mom, I have always been compared to Khim all my life.

451
00:50:44,692 --> 00:50:46,344
Why would you bring Khim back?

452
00:50:46,438 --> 00:50:48,438
To make you get her back.

453
00:50:48,574 --> 00:50:51,086
She's far too gone. I think it's time

454
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:54,006
for you to mock and embarrass her.

455
00:50:55,206 --> 00:50:58,126
I think Mr. Sin likes to compete and win.

456
00:50:58,365 --> 00:51:01,326
If we can corner Khim to get back into her cage,

457
00:51:01,606 --> 00:51:05,046
we might get Mr. Sin's heart back.

458
00:51:05,366 --> 00:51:06,646
It's not difficult.

459
00:51:06,822 --> 00:51:09,006
If we arrest her boyfriend, she can't go anywhere.

460
00:51:09,253 --> 00:51:10,366
Shall we try it?

461
00:51:10,557 --> 00:51:14,006
Your uncle might have something good for us in return.

462
00:51:28,478 --> 00:51:29,478
Khim.

463
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:32,168
How are you doing?

464
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:35,646
They say pregnant ladies can't take pills randomly.

465
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:38,166
You should try lemon grass water boiled with ginger.

466
00:51:41,917 --> 00:51:43,966
Will it help with my fever?

467
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:54,886
We'll see if it works.

468
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,526
If it's good, I'll boil it for you.

469
00:52:07,597 --> 00:52:10,246
I've prepared an internet router at Dad's house.

470
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,086
Oh, right. And...

471
00:52:16,157 --> 00:52:19,046
I'll leave a flashlight and some batteries in that corner.

472
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:22,566
When the light is out after it's raining,

473
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:24,846
you can see the way to go to the bathroom.

474
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:29,286
They say pregnant ladies go to the bathroom a lot, so I prepared them here.

475
00:52:30,135 --> 00:52:32,126
I almost forgot this.

476
00:52:35,086 --> 00:52:38,206
When you wake up, your stomach is empty. It can cause morning sickness.

477
00:52:38,366 --> 00:52:40,246
So, after you wake up,

478
00:52:40,614 --> 00:52:42,515
eat this snack first.

479
00:52:42,934 --> 00:52:44,686
Don't go anywhere just yet. Understand?

480
00:52:48,262 --> 00:52:49,646
I bought tons of them

481
00:52:50,246 --> 00:52:51,966
and put them in this container.

482
00:52:52,357 --> 00:52:54,086
You can bring it with you anywhere.

483
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:03,834
Wait. How many months are you going to work?

484
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,606
You act like you'll be gone for a year.

485
00:53:11,573 --> 00:53:13,966
You're still sick even when I'm here to take care of you.

486
00:53:14,852 --> 00:53:16,486
How could I be assured if I'm not here?

487
00:53:22,518 --> 00:53:24,726
I put my dad's number as your emergency call.

488
00:53:25,389 --> 00:53:27,526
Call him if there's anything.

489
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:29,166
Just push this call button.

490
00:53:33,957 --> 00:53:35,957
I know you're worried.

491
00:53:36,636 --> 00:53:37,766
But...

492
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,206
Don't worry.

493
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:43,086
You just need to work hard.

494
00:53:45,965 --> 00:53:47,406
I'll wait for you.

495
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,606
Sure.

496
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,006
Sorry.

497
00:55:45,462 --> 00:55:46,566
Lita.

498
00:55:49,886 --> 00:55:51,206
I would like to talk with you.

499
00:55:51,366 --> 00:55:53,926
The university has received a report.

500
00:55:54,054 --> 00:55:56,726
It concerns the approval of your scholarship.

501
00:55:56,846 --> 00:55:58,286
Let's talk in my office.

502
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:21,149
You don't need to buy it now. It's not the time.

503
00:56:21,357 --> 00:56:24,566
Just in case. Who would take you here if I'm not here?

504
00:56:25,612 --> 00:56:28,926
It's still a long time. We can come here later.

505
00:56:29,878 --> 00:56:31,126
You don't like this?

506
00:56:32,614 --> 00:56:34,614
It's not the time.

507
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:37,806
You can wear it to protect yourself from a pervert.

508
00:56:37,998 --> 00:56:41,126
Hey, if you like it that much, wear it yourself then.

509
00:56:43,006 --> 00:56:44,006
Khim.

510
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:47,349
You don't like it when I take you shopping.

511
00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:49,846
Think of it as our honeymoon.

512
00:56:51,526 --> 00:56:52,766
Let's go back to the farm.

513
00:56:59,806 --> 00:57:00,886
Kla.

514
00:57:01,526 --> 00:57:02,766
Calm down.

515
00:57:07,526 --> 00:57:08,526
This way, Khim.

516
00:57:08,918 --> 00:57:10,846
Kla, don't run away.

517
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:23,966
Let's go inside.

518
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:27,886
Khim.

519
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:30,966
Khim, come here.

520
00:57:51,486 --> 00:57:52,766
Don't worry, Khim.

521
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,981
I can walk in here with my eyes close.

522
00:57:59,654 --> 00:58:01,526
I didn't bring you here because I was scared.

523
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:03,486
I don't want him to remember your face.

524
00:58:05,246 --> 00:58:09,286
I understand how it feels to be hated even when I haven't done anything.

525
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:13,926
You and I have been hated for something we couldn't choose.

526
00:58:14,869 --> 00:58:17,526
Is there anyone who would bully a rich girl like you?

527
00:58:20,165 --> 00:58:24,486
I had always been taught that

528
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:28,366
I have to be the best. I can't be just good.

529
00:58:31,886 --> 00:58:34,246
When my test score was the first in my class,

530
00:58:35,117 --> 00:58:38,766
Dad would ask me who was the first in my grade.

531
00:58:40,461 --> 00:58:42,461
Being my dad's beloved daughter

532
00:58:43,158 --> 00:58:45,158
came with being teased by my friends.

533
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:50,046
I couldn't get along with anyone. I was like a weirdo.

534
00:58:51,196 --> 00:58:53,126
The more I tried, the worse it got.

535
00:58:55,461 --> 00:58:57,886
That's the girl with connections.

536
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:00,966
If you aren't rich, you couldn't transfer in the middle of a semester.

537
00:59:01,158 --> 00:59:02,726
Her dad is rich.

538
00:59:05,957 --> 00:59:06,966
Everyone,

539
00:59:07,406 --> 00:59:09,886
- please give a donation... - What's this box?

540
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:13,766
A donation box to support an orphan.

541
00:59:15,192 --> 00:59:16,646
Your wristwatch

542
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,806
can make an orphan live comfortably.

543
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,517
You still ask for someone else's money?

544
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,206
- For what? - Yeah.

545
00:59:22,374 --> 00:59:24,406
Go ask for the money from your dad.

546
00:59:24,653 --> 00:59:27,100
- Go. - Go ask your dad.

547
00:59:27,246 --> 00:59:29,446
- Go. - If you don't want to give the money, leave.

548
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:52,206
Can I sit with you?

549
00:59:57,566 --> 01:00:00,766
You're Saikhim, right? I'm Lita.

550
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:03,206
Do you know my name?

551
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:09,286
Well, I'm one of the students who receive a scholarship from your dad.

552
01:00:09,678 --> 01:00:11,678
Why did you come to sit with me?

553
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:14,726
I'm like you. No one is my friend.

554
01:00:18,562 --> 01:00:20,086
One, two. One, two, three.

555
01:00:20,223 --> 01:00:21,667
One, two. One, two. One, two.

556
01:00:21,766 --> 01:00:23,686
- "Mock the sky", ready? - Ready.

557
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:25,158
Three, four.

558
01:00:25,444 --> 01:00:28,366
- A bear. - A bear. It's cute.

559
01:00:28,509 --> 01:00:31,046
A bear. The bear is so big.

560
01:00:31,164 --> 01:00:34,575
It walks slowly, slowly, and slowly.

561
01:00:38,198 --> 01:00:39,526
What the heck are you doing?

562
01:00:41,758 --> 01:00:43,926
You always think of me as a clown.

563
01:00:44,189 --> 01:00:47,406
So, I acted like a clown for you. You aren't satisfied?

564
01:00:49,342 --> 01:00:52,846
You have been and will always be insincere.

565
01:01:26,462 --> 01:01:28,038
Hey, you rich lady.

566
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,206
- What are you doing? - Can you dance for us again?

567
01:01:35,518 --> 01:01:38,326
You aren't actually proper and prim like you've been acting.

568
01:01:39,806 --> 01:01:40,806
Wait.

569
01:01:41,037 --> 01:01:43,686
I think her clothes

570
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,566
don't look proper at all.

571
01:01:46,085 --> 01:01:47,646
Get it done.

572
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,006
Sure. That's my job.

573
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:52,486
- Come here. - Hey, what are you doing?

574
01:01:52,647 --> 01:01:54,286
- Stay still. - Let me go.

575
01:01:54,446 --> 01:01:56,326
What are you doing?

576
01:01:56,686 --> 01:01:58,966
- You look spicy. - Take a lot of them.

577
01:01:59,606 --> 01:02:01,646
Don't take my photos.

578
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:05,712
Like to bully someone else that much?

579
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:08,015
Are you a mad dog who likes to bite people?

580
01:02:08,404 --> 01:02:09,606
Are they crazy?

581
01:02:11,532 --> 01:02:12,552
Khim.

582
01:02:14,862 --> 01:02:18,006
You don't have to drag yourself down for them.

583
01:02:18,557 --> 01:02:21,366
I consulted about this with my dad once.

584
01:02:22,414 --> 01:02:26,566
Dad told me I should make them jealous of my life.

585
01:02:27,957 --> 01:02:32,406
But actually, I think no one would be jealous of me.

586
01:02:32,806 --> 01:02:34,186
They probably pity me.

587
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,406
At least, one girl would like to be my friend.

588
01:02:38,006 --> 01:02:39,286
She's Lita.

589
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,886
But after this incident,

590
01:02:45,325 --> 01:02:47,606
Lita is probably kept out of my life.

591
01:02:48,216 --> 01:02:49,406
See?

592
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:53,286
Being born as me isn't as great as you thought.

593
01:02:53,973 --> 01:02:55,246
You don't have friends.

594
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:58,246
Your life is still far better than mine.

595
01:02:58,837 --> 01:03:02,646
I had to work in this cinema to get to watch movies for free.

596
01:03:05,822 --> 01:03:07,566
I'm used to this place's darkness

597
01:03:07,892 --> 01:03:09,406
because I worked here.

598
01:03:09,861 --> 01:03:12,286
That's why I'm jealous of you.

599
01:03:13,286 --> 01:03:15,286
You're jealous of my poor life?

600
01:03:15,446 --> 01:03:17,246
At least, you get to live.

601
01:03:17,982 --> 01:03:22,366
I can only study, and I have a father who has never understood me.

602
01:03:23,721 --> 01:03:25,566
You were happier than me.

603
01:03:25,766 --> 01:03:28,566
Now, you get to share your family with me.

604
01:03:29,702 --> 01:03:32,046
I can't be optimistic like you.

605
01:03:35,053 --> 01:03:37,326
I wasn't trying to flatter you or anything.

606
01:03:40,085 --> 01:03:41,486
I only have opportunities,

607
01:03:41,853 --> 01:03:42,886
but...

608
01:03:43,807 --> 01:03:45,046
I....

609
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:48,366
I don't have any real-life experience.

610
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,106
You handle happiness and sadness better than I do.

611
01:03:52,726 --> 01:03:54,566
I have no such life skills.

612
01:03:56,381 --> 01:03:59,166
That's why you're my present from heaven.

613
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,510
Your present or your karma?

614
01:04:04,414 --> 01:04:06,006
A reward for me.

615
01:04:11,046 --> 01:04:12,366
Because of your words,

616
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:15,406
I got whipped by you since that night.

617
01:04:17,606 --> 01:04:19,474
Hey, that's the truth though.

618
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:24,486
You're actually good inside. You just didn't show it to anyone.

619
01:04:28,315 --> 01:04:29,434
The more you say that,

620
01:04:29,654 --> 01:04:31,206
the more I lose myself to you.

621
01:04:32,766 --> 01:04:34,006
When I'm not here,

622
01:04:34,502 --> 01:04:37,006
don't show your cuteness to anyone else.

623
01:04:52,982 --> 01:04:55,206
Someone else will fall in love with you for sure.

624
01:05:16,773 --> 01:05:18,533
Is this romantic?

625
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:31,206
I wore this dress when I played in a piano concert for the first time.

626
01:05:32,966 --> 01:05:33,966
Here.

627
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,606
I got a haircut that day.

628
01:05:37,006 --> 01:05:38,406
From my regular barber.

629
01:05:40,064 --> 01:05:41,206
We're friends.

630
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:47,446
On this day, I tried on the dress that I wore for that piano concert.

631
01:05:48,997 --> 01:05:50,766
Such a high-class lady.

632
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,246
This one.

633
01:05:56,678 --> 01:05:59,166
I got a haircut for a party on that day.

634
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:02,606
Look at the fashion. It was the trend back then.

635
01:06:09,879 --> 01:06:11,326
I thought I deleted all of them.

636
01:06:20,646 --> 01:06:23,326
Well, you looked really close together.

637
01:06:24,926 --> 01:06:26,606
I know I was wrong now.

638
01:06:30,846 --> 01:06:33,326
You used to love her so much.

639
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,791
We all have to pay for our karma from our past lives.

640
01:06:46,326 --> 01:06:49,926
They say men had their love start at 100 percent,

641
01:06:50,765 --> 01:06:52,806
while women had their love start at zero.

642
01:06:53,086 --> 01:06:54,406
It must be true.

643
01:06:56,261 --> 01:06:58,526
You once loved your ex 100 percent.

644
01:06:59,606 --> 01:07:01,646
But now you don't love her.

645
01:07:02,029 --> 01:07:03,510
For me,

646
01:07:04,071 --> 01:07:06,046
I would never think I would like you.

647
01:07:06,613 --> 01:07:09,406
But my feelings gradually grow when I'm with you.

648
01:07:14,161 --> 01:07:15,206
One day,

649
01:07:16,446 --> 01:07:19,126
you would love me less and less

650
01:07:19,701 --> 01:07:21,606
like you did to someone else, right?

651
01:07:21,941 --> 01:07:24,686
Who said that? I would never love you less.

652
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:27,406
It can only go through 100 percent.

653
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,686
If your love for me is gone,

654
01:07:30,806 --> 01:07:32,126
how would it be?

655
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,366
I will never stop loving you.

656
01:07:35,606 --> 01:07:36,926
How can you be sure?

657
01:07:42,077 --> 01:07:44,206
My heart throbs when I'm with you.

658
01:07:45,806 --> 01:07:46,966
I would be bored

659
01:07:47,494 --> 01:07:49,846
only when you make my heart stop.

660
01:07:51,813 --> 01:07:53,166
My love for you would end

661
01:07:53,557 --> 01:07:55,046
only after I die.

662
01:07:56,294 --> 01:07:57,726
I won't be dead soon.

663
01:07:58,169 --> 01:07:59,806
I'll stay alive to love you.

664
01:08:07,926 --> 01:08:10,166
Don't try to make up with me.

665
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:15,286
Let's take a photo.

666
01:08:16,486 --> 01:08:18,330
Why would you want to take it?

667
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:21,211
I want your photo in case I miss you there.

668
01:08:22,086 --> 01:08:24,446
One, two, three.

669
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:31,725
Let's take it with your phone.

670
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,806
- No. Your phone is enough. - Give me that.

671
01:08:37,605 --> 01:08:38,886
Turn to me when I count three.

672
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:41,326
One, two...

673
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:44,406
Three.

674
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:58,966
I hacked Miss's phone and got this photo.

675
01:09:26,766 --> 01:09:28,077
Handle it for me.

676
01:09:28,485 --> 01:09:29,526
Yes.

677
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,166
Uncle.

678
01:09:35,366 --> 01:09:37,926
Uncle, have you received any news from your son-in-law?

679
01:09:38,313 --> 01:09:39,406
What?

680
01:09:41,646 --> 01:09:42,726
I'm sorry.

681
01:09:43,086 --> 01:09:45,086
I was talking about Saikhim's man.

682
01:09:46,902 --> 01:09:49,486
His garage was dealing with tax-evading vehicles.

683
01:09:49,726 --> 01:09:51,166
If he's arrested by the police,

684
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:53,606
Saikhim has no place left.

685
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:57,566
Do you want me to take Saikhim back?

686
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,166
(I'm worried that if he gets arrested,)

687
01:10:03,918 --> 01:10:05,726
(he might speak of our family)

688
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:07,846
(and ruin our reputation with him.)

689
01:10:08,926 --> 01:10:10,406
(Please let me deal with this.)

690
01:10:11,138 --> 01:10:14,694
(We might finally get rid of him from Saikhim's life.)

691
01:11:03,749 --> 01:11:04,757
Khim.

692
01:11:11,836 --> 01:11:12,853
Kla.

693
01:11:13,405 --> 01:11:14,405
Kla.

694
01:11:45,702 --> 01:11:47,406
Take care of yourself.

695
01:11:49,678 --> 01:11:52,486
Don't be surprised if you can't contact me.

696
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:56,326
It might be hard to contact me if I'm in a forest.

697
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:07,286
Please take care of Khim and her kid, Dad.

698
01:12:10,486 --> 01:12:11,686
Just work hard.

699
01:12:12,397 --> 01:12:14,086
Don't worry about anything.

700
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:21,916
Kla.

701
01:12:22,446 --> 01:12:23,446
Kla.

702
01:12:23,622 --> 01:12:24,894
Get in the car.

703
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:28,886
Let's go.

704
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:46,726
After it's done, I'll hurry back to see you.

705
01:13:20,006 --> 01:13:21,246
We have to go now.

706
01:15:47,765 --> 01:15:49,126
Are you still awake?

707
01:16:18,052 --> 01:16:21,086
(One, two, three.)

708
01:16:53,205 --> 01:16:54,566
Hello.

709
01:17:02,029 --> 01:17:03,766
Are you here for our school?

710
01:17:04,206 --> 01:17:05,886
I'm here to see the land.

711
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:08,326
I just passed by here.

712
01:17:08,486 --> 01:17:10,766
Please come inside then.

713
01:17:11,686 --> 01:17:12,966
Thank you.

714
01:17:15,366 --> 01:17:18,526
Our school is a school teaching how to rely on oneself.

715
01:17:19,062 --> 01:17:20,246
You can take a look.

716
01:17:20,356 --> 01:17:22,046
I'll be your guide.

717
01:17:23,246 --> 01:17:24,406
Please.

718
01:17:25,646 --> 01:17:27,926
(Hong Hean Yoo Sa Bai)

719
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:32,166
This way.

720
01:17:36,598 --> 01:17:39,406
We're trying to create everything by ourselves.

721
01:17:39,758 --> 01:17:41,806
Everything in four requisites of our lives.

722
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:44,886
Food, house, medicine, and clothes.

723
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,886
We make them all ourselves.

724
01:17:48,917 --> 01:17:51,286
For example, this cotton.

725
01:17:51,965 --> 01:17:54,886
We're preparing them to weave our own clothes.

726
01:17:55,526 --> 01:17:56,686
Hello.

727
01:18:18,206 --> 01:18:19,925
They're my husband's family.

728
01:18:20,133 --> 01:18:22,616
I'm his wife. I moved to live with him here.

729
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:26,446
And how long have you been pregnant?

730
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:29,606
For around three months.

731
01:18:31,309 --> 01:18:34,326
You don't look like a Thai, but your Thai is really good.

732
01:18:35,766 --> 01:18:38,406
My husband has his business here.

733
01:18:38,522 --> 01:18:41,046
I've been here frequently, so I'm used to Thailand now.

734
01:18:42,605 --> 01:18:45,406
Khim, try to invite her to stay with us for a night.

735
01:18:46,406 --> 01:18:47,686
You can stay here.

736
01:18:50,406 --> 01:18:54,566
This is a place for people in the community to exchange their experiences.

737
01:18:58,302 --> 01:19:02,246
If you like it, please stay with us for a long time.

738
01:19:07,846 --> 01:19:09,166
What about your boyfriend?

739
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:12,966
He went to work in Laos. He hasn't returned yet.

740
01:19:13,139 --> 01:19:15,139
Aren't you afraid of staying here alone?

741
01:19:17,606 --> 01:19:19,526
If we know how to live with nature,

742
01:19:19,957 --> 01:19:22,286
there's nothing to be scared of.

743
01:19:24,999 --> 01:19:28,566
And do you want a son or a daughter?

744
01:19:29,613 --> 01:19:31,206
I want to raise a son.

745
01:19:31,373 --> 01:19:33,606
I want my son to be like his dad.

746
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:43,046
What about you?

747
01:19:43,326 --> 01:19:44,526
Do you have a child?

748
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:46,486
I have a son.

749
01:19:48,052 --> 01:19:49,966
But he's not like me at all.

750
01:19:53,693 --> 01:19:56,966
Mrs. Asia has a son, but he's overseas.

751
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:58,886
Is that so?

752
01:20:00,636 --> 01:20:01,966
How old is he?

753
01:20:02,126 --> 01:20:03,286
He is

754
01:20:04,006 --> 01:20:05,566
probably younger than my son.

755
01:20:07,446 --> 01:20:09,126
They're probably the same age.

756
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:13,046
My son, only his body has matured.

757
01:20:13,614 --> 01:20:16,806
He has matured to be an adult when he's a father now.

758
01:20:26,966 --> 01:20:28,646
Your mom is pretty.

759
01:20:30,446 --> 01:20:31,606
Thank you.

760
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:36,246
She passed away a long time ago.

761
01:20:39,053 --> 01:20:41,053
She didn't get to see her kid's success.

762
01:20:48,326 --> 01:20:51,046
(Kaokla)

763
01:20:54,494 --> 01:20:55,886
I'll excuse myself.

764
01:21:02,211 --> 01:21:04,886
Probably it's Kla calling her. Look at her smile.

765
01:21:07,092 --> 01:21:08,286
Good.

766
01:21:12,949 --> 01:21:16,126
(Khim, I saw a river upstream today.)

767
01:21:16,717 --> 01:21:19,086
They said we have to go through a mountain to avoid the river.

768
01:21:19,269 --> 01:21:20,789
It's probably tough.

769
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:22,990
Our car broke down in the afternoon.

770
01:21:23,206 --> 01:21:25,166
(When everyone knew I can fix it,)

771
01:21:25,286 --> 01:21:26,686
they're amazed.

772
01:21:27,069 --> 01:21:29,686
Boss wants me to oversee the machinery next time.

773
01:21:30,126 --> 01:21:34,006
Wow. What a great man.

774
01:21:34,165 --> 01:21:36,046
This is only your first time.

775
01:21:39,846 --> 01:21:41,726
Whenever I turn on the light,

776
01:21:42,646 --> 01:21:44,446
I always think of you.

777
01:21:45,206 --> 01:21:47,206
I also think of you every day.

778
01:21:48,406 --> 01:21:50,886
When I look at your drawing,

779
01:21:51,126 --> 01:21:52,686
I miss my home so much.

780
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:57,966
Toughen up, Father.

781
01:21:58,181 --> 01:22:00,006
This is just your first time.

782
01:22:00,902 --> 01:22:02,206
Khim.

783
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,446
Can I talk with our kid?

784
01:22:05,248 --> 01:22:06,366
Sure.

785
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,046
Okay. You can speak now.

786
01:22:10,613 --> 01:22:11,806
My child,

787
01:22:12,190 --> 01:22:13,406
it's me, your dad.

788
01:22:13,646 --> 01:22:15,246
(I'm working in a forest.)

789
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:18,286
It's so dark, but there are tons of stars.

790
01:22:22,206 --> 01:22:23,246
Khim.

791
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:27,301
Should we name our kid Temfah?

792
01:22:27,514 --> 01:22:29,126
(If our kid is a girl,)

793
01:22:29,406 --> 01:22:30,966
(she should be Temfah.)

794
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,286
If our kid is a boy,

795
01:22:34,454 --> 01:22:36,086
(should he be Narnnarm?)

796
01:22:36,806 --> 01:22:38,406
Do you think our kid will like them?

797
01:22:38,941 --> 01:22:40,083
(Ask our kid, Khim.)

798
01:22:40,197 --> 01:22:41,646
Take your phone to them.

799
01:22:44,086 --> 01:22:45,086
(My child.)

800
01:22:45,566 --> 01:22:47,926
Who is Temfah? Raise your hand.

801
01:22:48,366 --> 01:22:50,406
I couldn't hear anything.

802
01:22:51,486 --> 01:22:53,046
There's no response?

803
01:22:53,406 --> 01:22:55,046
I think you have to change his name.

804
01:22:56,135 --> 01:22:57,926
He must be Narnnarm then.

805
01:22:58,045 --> 01:22:59,075
(Narnnarm.)

806
01:22:59,171 --> 01:23:00,326
Can you hear me?

807
01:23:00,605 --> 01:23:01,766
(Did he answer?)

808
01:23:02,126 --> 01:23:03,846
I don't think he likes it.

809
01:23:04,018 --> 01:23:05,646
I'll come up with a new one.

810
01:23:06,069 --> 01:23:07,446
(What about Tonkhao?)

811
01:23:08,126 --> 01:23:09,646
Don't you think it's cute?

812
01:23:09,929 --> 01:23:11,246
I don't give it a pass.

813
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:12,846
You don't like it?

814
01:23:15,095 --> 01:23:17,486
Then, I'll come up with a new name when I'm free.

815
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:20,686
We should come up with it together when you're back.

816
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:26,406
(Hong Hean Yoo Sa Bai)

817
01:23:31,326 --> 01:23:32,326
Uncle.

818
01:23:32,686 --> 01:23:34,046
Are you alright?

819
01:23:35,206 --> 01:23:36,366
I'm alright.

820
01:23:36,766 --> 01:23:37,766
It's swollen.

821
01:23:38,559 --> 01:23:39,966
Get gotu kola for me.

822
01:23:40,173 --> 01:23:41,314
It's in the mortar.

823
01:23:41,422 --> 01:23:43,061
- Quick. - Okay.

824
01:23:46,686 --> 01:23:47,766
Quick.

825
01:23:51,534 --> 01:23:53,686
Apply it on my hand.

826
01:23:58,309 --> 01:23:59,406
Is it better?

827
01:24:00,694 --> 01:24:04,996
- It feels better. - I think you should take a seat for now.

828
01:24:05,148 --> 01:24:06,846
I'll wash it for you.

829
01:24:09,446 --> 01:24:10,886
- Thanks. - Sure.

830
01:24:15,166 --> 01:24:16,606
I'll wash it for you.

831
01:24:20,126 --> 01:24:21,806
Kla left his wife in my care.

832
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:23,206
But now,

833
01:24:23,422 --> 01:24:24,926
who's actually taking care of whom?

834
01:24:25,638 --> 01:24:27,917
You've already raised Kla.

835
01:24:28,157 --> 01:24:31,746
It's time for us to give back to you.

836
01:24:35,621 --> 01:24:36,821
Do you know

837
01:24:37,246 --> 01:24:39,898
that Kla isn't my real son?

838
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:47,886
Kla's real father is a foreigner.

839
01:24:49,006 --> 01:24:50,686
But he didn't know who his father was.

840
01:24:52,246 --> 01:24:53,926
After Kla's born,

841
01:24:54,582 --> 01:24:56,386
Rakroy then learned that

842
01:24:56,679 --> 01:24:58,566
her husband has another child.

843
01:24:59,254 --> 01:25:01,126
But what's worse was that

844
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:02,846
she just learned that

845
01:25:03,047 --> 01:25:04,726
he wanted to have another child

846
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:08,086
to transfer his blood to cure his first child.

847
01:25:11,686 --> 01:25:13,166
Did something like that happen?

848
01:25:15,502 --> 01:25:17,606
He didn't treat Kla like a human.

849
01:25:17,718 --> 01:25:19,166
(He only saw him as a spare part.)

850
01:25:19,674 --> 01:25:22,166
(Kla's mother had to take his son away)

851
01:25:22,606 --> 01:25:26,086
(to save Kla's life from the hands of those people.)

852
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:28,086
(Then, I got married to her)

853
01:25:28,286 --> 01:25:29,526
(and accepted Kla as my son)

854
01:25:29,662 --> 01:25:31,248
(to change his name and surname)

855
01:25:31,366 --> 01:25:33,046
(to not let them track him down.)

856
01:25:34,526 --> 01:25:37,246
I didn't want Kla to be famous or rich

857
01:25:37,871 --> 01:25:40,166
not because I didn't want him to succeed.

858
01:25:41,652 --> 01:25:44,446
I want to protect him from those horrible people.

859
01:25:47,022 --> 01:25:48,646
Having a child

860
01:25:49,212 --> 01:25:52,886
is easy. But to protect his life

861
01:25:53,864 --> 01:25:55,198
is even harder.

862
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:59,886
You have to look after and take care of this child.

863
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:02,806
Make him feel like he's worthy of being born.

864
01:26:07,349 --> 01:26:09,046
Kla was so fortunate

865
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:11,286
to have you as his father.

866
01:26:12,309 --> 01:26:13,862
It's normal

867
01:26:14,383 --> 01:26:18,166
if Kla respects and loves you more than anyone else.

868
01:26:27,886 --> 01:26:30,166
(Kla's real father is a foreigner.)

869
01:26:30,677 --> 01:26:32,246
(But he didn't know who his father was.)

870
01:26:32,797 --> 01:26:34,286
(After Kla's born,)

871
01:26:34,494 --> 01:26:36,126
(Rakroy then learned that)

872
01:26:36,526 --> 01:26:38,206
(her husband has another child.)

873
01:26:38,366 --> 01:26:39,926
(But what's worse was that)

874
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:41,526
(she just learned that)

875
01:26:41,766 --> 01:26:43,246
(he wanted to have another child)

876
01:26:43,382 --> 01:26:45,926
(to transfer his blood to cure his first child.)

877
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:55,686
Congrats.

878
01:26:56,406 --> 01:26:57,726
You've survived now.

879
01:26:59,086 --> 01:27:02,015
I want to tell you that you owe me your life.

880
01:27:02,165 --> 01:27:05,733
If I didn't help you, you would already die.

881
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:08,918
For the rest of your life,

882
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:12,686
will you give it to me or them?

883
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:27,006
(Having a child is easy.)

884
01:27:27,933 --> 01:27:31,166
(But to protect his life is even harder.)

885
01:27:31,366 --> 01:27:34,246
Hi, darling. What have you been up to? Okay.

886
01:27:34,461 --> 01:27:37,846
(You have to look after and take care of this child.)

887
01:27:38,266 --> 01:27:40,726
(Make him feel like he's worthy of being born.)

888
01:27:52,326 --> 01:27:53,566
Are you leaving?

889
01:27:54,022 --> 01:27:56,146
There's an emergency. I have to return home immediately.

890
01:27:56,526 --> 01:27:58,006
Is there anything I can help with?

891
01:27:58,638 --> 01:28:00,606
No. Thank you.

892
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:02,430
Please visit us again.

893
01:28:04,971 --> 01:28:08,326
When that time comes, your kid will have already been born.

894
01:28:12,638 --> 01:28:14,846
I hope you'll take great care of him.

895
01:29:09,229 --> 01:29:12,526
We just have to drive a car through the border. When the delivery is done,

896
01:29:12,734 --> 01:29:14,606
we'll get the money.

897
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:16,606
Look. He sent it to me and threatened me

898
01:29:16,787 --> 01:29:17,806
that he'll leak this clip.

899
01:29:17,933 --> 01:29:19,166
Sir just collapsed.

900
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:21,760
Ms. Khim, won't you go to visit him?

901
01:29:21,886 --> 01:29:23,246
Stay still. Don't move.

902
01:29:23,534 --> 01:29:24,766
Put down the weapon.

903
01:29:26,767 --> 01:29:28,006
Quick, Kla.

904
01:29:32,446 --> 01:29:34,566
Officer, my son is in there.

905
01:29:37,286 --> 01:29:38,886
We've surrounded the suspects.

906
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,046
They can't get away.

907
01:29:40,137 --> 01:29:41,566
We're done, Kla.

908
01:29:42,798 --> 01:29:45,006
- Turn yourself in. - (A culprit got shot.)
