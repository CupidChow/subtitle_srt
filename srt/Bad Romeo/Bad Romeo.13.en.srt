1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:01,046
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:02,230
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,317 --> 00:00:03,507
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,446
Do you remember what I asked of you?

5
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:47,726
I have to divorce her before you come back.

6
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:50,573
We have a problem.

7
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:52,046
Your wives are chasing each other.

8
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:57,526
You can't run away from me like this.

9
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,166
Can you hear me, Khim?

10
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:01,526
If there's evidence of murder,

11
00:03:01,694 --> 00:03:02,846
he or his girlfriend

12
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,446
will be prosecuted.

13
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:06,486
I didn't want it to be like this.

14
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:07,806
Even if I was angry,

15
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,486
I didn't kill anyone.

16
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:11,286
If someone has to take responsibility

17
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,482
it should be me.

18
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:13,965
If you don't take action against Claire,

19
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,646
I'll divorce you immediately.

20
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:19,406
This means this might be the last time we will see each other.

21
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,246
Don't act like we haven't been separated.

22
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:23,566
We've been separated by death once.

23
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:27,401
(When love disguised itself as hatred.)

24
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:30,102
(Love usually begins when we lie to ourselves,)

25
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,886
(and it always ends when we lie to others.)

26
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:35,926
(I know that I love her)

27
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,206
(when I didn't truly mean what I said.)

28
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:40,270
(And it ends)

29
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:43,174
(because I lie to her and make her disappear from my life.)

30
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:49,886
Kla.

31
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,648
He wanted to settle things with us.

32
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,366
He chose his girlfriend in the end.

33
00:04:00,496 --> 00:04:04,326
Of course, he has to protect his own people.

34
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:06,846
I know he loves her.

35
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,926
But he is treating Khim's life like it's worthless to him.

36
00:04:13,926 --> 00:04:15,966
He's restraining Khim when she's getting married.

37
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:18,206
When the wedding is ruined, he immediately divorces her.

38
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:20,966
He's trying to keep her to himself.

39
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,806
Mr. Thaen will cancel the wedding?

40
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:29,326
Thaen can't

41
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:32,686
accept that he has to marry me.

42
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:40,246
Why are you here?

43
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:42,886
To settle our divorce.

44
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,126
I'll back away.

45
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:46,806
But you almost killed her.

46
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:48,966
You've never wanted the best for her.

47
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,366
So, you intentionally drag on this problem.

48
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,086
I agree to divorce now.

49
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,406
I'll also give her compensation money.

50
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:56,966
If you want, I can stay here.

51
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:59,466
But I don't find it fun to be here anymore.

52
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:02,406
If you don't mind, you can take over her from me.

53
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:04,086
Everything you've done,

54
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:06,126
is it just for your satisfaction?

55
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,166
Are you still a man?

56
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,326
Why did you torture Saikhim?

57
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:12,086
I want to see that she can't love anyone again.

58
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,406
Make her life become a living hell like mine.

59
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:16,806
I felt more upset when I saw you love her.

60
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,926
So, I stalled to stop you from being together.

61
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,886
It looks like I've succeeded.

62
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:22,686
You're mad now.

63
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:26,486
Get out of Khim's life.

64
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,326
I hope it'll go well for you when you don't have me.

65
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:31,686
You can't blame me anymore.

66
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:33,646
If she doesn't want to go on,

67
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:36,366
that means she still can't move on from me.

68
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,806
This is the divorce contract.

69
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:47,486
He has agreed to divorce if we don't take action against Ms. Claire.

70
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:48,966
Did you agree?

71
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:50,546
Of course, I agreed.

72
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:53,326
I've been waiting for this day.

73
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:59,006
And about our wedding...

74
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:04,086
I understand if you want to cancel it.

75
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:06,806
It looks like I mean nothing to you.

76
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,486
It's not like that, Thaen.

77
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,566
I'm just letting you have the chance to decide it yourself.

78
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,246
Isn't it because you still can't forget someone?

79
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,526
Why did you say that?

80
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:26,966
I just feel like you're doing it to mock someone.

81
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:33,886
So, we really can't be the same anymore.

82
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:36,151
You have been hiding it from me for too long.

83
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:42,502
I don't even know if there's anything left that I could trust.

84
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:56,126
I want to end things with him.

85
00:06:57,846 --> 00:06:59,646
Can this guarantee my intention?

86
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:05,006
Now, it's up to you if you still want to keep me in your life.

87
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:09,326
I'm sorry for making it tough for you.

88
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:18,566
I think we should talk when you feel better.

89
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:20,926
If you use your emotion to decide on something,

90
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:22,566
everything will be ruined.

91
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,029
I thought I had thrown it away.

92
00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:08,446
I've divorced Khim.

93
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,926
She won't take action against you now.

94
00:08:18,553 --> 00:08:19,553
What's this?

95
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:21,086
The divorce contract.

96
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:23,126
We only need to wait for her signature.

97
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:24,806
We will be over soon.

98
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:27,406
Do you think I'm happy that I can take you away from her?

99
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:30,366
She and I have been through for a long time.

100
00:08:31,365 --> 00:08:32,445
Actually,

101
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:34,886
it's been over for several years.

102
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,366
But what I saw wasn't like you said.

103
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:39,926
Lying to yourself is enough. You don't need to lie to me.

104
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:42,606
I don't know whether I can trust you anymore.

105
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:45,206
What if we start our relationship again?

106
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:46,923
I hate myself for feeling jealous.

107
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:49,206
I overthink everything and did something without thinking.

108
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:51,126
Do you know that you made me become like this?

109
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:54,131
You had a chance to handle it earlier, but you didn't do it.

110
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,246
When you're in a corner,

111
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,702
you have to pull me back

112
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:58,326
because you'll have no one left.

113
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:26,846
Yes.

114
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:33,686
Ms. Khim said she won't take action against them

115
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:37,046
and the CCTV footage confirmed that there's nothing.

116
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,289
Please stay here for a moment.

117
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:46,126
I'll prepare fruits for you.

118
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,886
So, there won't be any more investigation.

119
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:57,057
The insurance company

120
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,885
has checked the car from the day of the accident.

121
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:03,214
They found a hole in the exhaust pipe,

122
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,926
causing smoke to flow back into the car.

123
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:08,086
How is it related to the accident?

124
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:11,586
It's related because Khim had too much carbon dioxide in her blood

125
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,388
when she was transported to the hospital.

126
00:10:13,573 --> 00:10:14,886
Are you saying that

127
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:17,046
it wasn't just an accident?

128
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:20,646
(It might be possible that Khim fell unconscious before that.)

129
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:23,046
(It wasn't related to alcohol or the chase.)

130
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,286
(Khim fell unconscious before that,)

131
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:27,326
(so she couldn't turn the car in time.)

132
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:29,046
(She crashed into a tree,)

133
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:31,656
(causing an impact that caused the pulmonary contusion.)

134
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,846
When they said she had respiratory failure,

135
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:36,206
it might not only come from the pulmonary contusion,

136
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:39,326
but someone might have used this opportunity to eliminate Khim

137
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:41,686
by setting it up as an accident.

138
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:44,286
But you saved her in time.

139
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:47,366
If this was a plan to murder Khim,

140
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:49,126
why did it have to be on that night?

141
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,046
That's what I've been wondering.

142
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:55,086
Why did it have to be on the night that you and Khim were together?

143
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,286
This is the footage of that day.

144
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,606
You asked me to swap the cars,

145
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:28,246
so I left Saikhim's car here on the evening of that day.

146
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:33,664
That.

147
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:35,631
Someone wanted to kill Saikhim.

148
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:38,046
And that someone

149
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:40,726
must be the one who knows that you two

150
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:42,766
have been spending time together, right?

151
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:44,246
And they also planned

152
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:46,211
to make us become suspects.

153
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,726
The one who connects you and Khim

154
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,766
must know that you two are married, right?

155
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,846
Aside from you, Kloy, Uncle, and Lita...

156
00:11:57,246 --> 00:11:59,006
It has to be Saikhim's family.

157
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:02,766
Are you crazy? If they wanted to kill someone, they'd want to kill Kla.

158
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:23,486
(I heard you went to consult with the lawyer.)

159
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:27,606
This means you had registered your marriage with Saikhim.

160
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,543
You might lose everything because of her.

161
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:31,669
Our business

162
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:33,006
is also owned by Nate.

163
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:35,046
I won't let anyone else

164
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:37,846
take the inheritance from my son again.

165
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:40,476
(Before you get into the stock market,)

166
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:43,286
(you have to end this problem.)

167
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,406
I won't risk our company.

168
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:48,166
When your dad secretly dated your mom,

169
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,699
he also said that.

170
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:52,286
A man is usually indecisive.

171
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:54,806
That's why the problem has become this big today.

172
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,526
You're fortunate that you didn't have a child.

173
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:58,486
- Or she might... - I know that

174
00:12:58,598 --> 00:13:01,126
you thought of me as a parasite. You couldn't accept me.

175
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:03,926
This cold-blooded heart...

176
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:05,566
There is only one person.

177
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:21,685
Khim.

178
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,478
Wake up, Khim.

179
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,846
You can't leave me like this, Khim.

180
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:28,206
Khim.

181
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:30,350
Khim, I beg you.

182
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,046
Her vitals are back.

183
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:44,344
What is your relationship?

184
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:45,902
I'm her husband.

185
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:54,526
What do you want, Khim?

186
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:00,966
Forget it.

187
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:02,726
Why would you talk now?

188
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:05,246
We should talk when you're feeling better later.

189
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:07,486
When you wake up, whatever you want to say to me,

190
00:14:07,877 --> 00:14:09,246
I won't interrupt you anymore.

191
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:12,526
He was the one who helped me.

192
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:17,486
Did Kaokla save my life?

193
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:29,563
Where are you going?

194
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:31,606
Lady is going abroad for her errand.

195
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:40,726
Where is Lady?

196
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:43,806
Where is Lady?

197
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:50,286
Why did you hurt Saikhim?

198
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,846
What did I do?

199
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,646
Stop pretending to be oblivious.

200
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:58,621
I know everything you've done.

201
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:04,566
You tried to kill Saikhim.

202
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,246
What right do you have to touch that woman?

203
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:11,166
Why are all the problems have something to do with that woman?

204
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,086
Why did you do that to her?

205
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:16,566
Because that woman

206
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,566
is going to take everything.

207
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:20,326
And you're such an idiot.

208
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:23,406
You let her deceive you time and time again!

209
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:24,926
If I didn't kill her,

210
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:28,846
that father and daughter will suck up everything from you. Remember that!

211
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:30,486
If they're horrible to me,

212
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,606
I'll be the one who teaches them a lesson.

213
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,166
You can't control my life.

214
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:36,326
You have no right to decide for me.

215
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:38,594
If it was seven years ago,

216
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:40,046
you wouldn't say this.

217
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,886
You should be grateful

218
00:15:42,046 --> 00:15:45,086
that I was the one who revived you!

219
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:47,086
I have everything today because of my dad.

220
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,126
Your husband was the one who gave birth to me.

221
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:50,486
He left his inheritance for me.

222
00:15:50,678 --> 00:15:51,678
But it's you

223
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:54,286
who has been lying by taking everything from me and my mom.

224
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:56,966
She was just a woman who was bought with our money.

225
00:15:57,126 --> 00:16:01,006
You're the one who has no right to demand anything from my husband.

226
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:02,922
Your promiscuity

227
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,646
must really run in your blood.

228
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,028
If you really love Saikhim that much,

229
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:10,286
please get out and live by yourself.

230
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:12,806
Don't leech off me like this.

231
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,966
I'm not a pet that you have picked up to raise.

232
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:20,406
Stop acting like everyone here has to rely on you.

233
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,886
I expanded the company.

234
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,246
If you're alone, you wouldn't be able to do anything.

235
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,486
You have to rely on me and hold me down.

236
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:28,814
Sure.

237
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:32,213
You've become arrogant when your life is better. Such a man's nature.

238
00:16:32,294 --> 00:16:35,926
Stop taking a grudge from your husband's affair out on me.

239
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,486
(You're crazy.)

240
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:40,366
(You want to own everything.)

241
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:42,526
(You treated me as a substitute for my dad.)

242
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:45,126
(You wanted me to be loyal like a dog.)

243
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:54,206
(You tried to make me do bad things to my dad)

244
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,926
(to get back at him for having an affair.)

245
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,010
(You used me to take revenge against him.)

246
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,368
(You used the guilt to silence me.)

247
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:05,246
(You used the money to satisfy your need.)

248
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:07,702
(You wanted to feel like you're being desired.)

249
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,406
(I've endured being your toy for far too long.)

250
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:14,726
You tried to lower my pride. You tried to make me feel like a prostitute.

251
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
And you've taken me for granted.

252
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:18,806
Stop bothering me.

253
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:21,157
I feel more disgusted by you day by day.

254
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:23,886
You want to escape from me when you're rich.

255
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:26,062
Who would be loyal like your son?

256
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:28,326
His life has been prolonged by seven or eight years.

257
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:29,806
You don't want him to die

258
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:31,686
because you fear you'll have no one left to love.

259
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:33,606
You want to be a selfless mother,

260
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,366
but you've never done that.

261
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:37,366
You're keeping him alive

262
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,406
to keep the inheritance to get to me.

263
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:43,166
I'll never let you control my life like that.

264
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,086
You can go wherever you want.

265
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:49,206
But you can only take your body with you. Don't take my inheritance away!

266
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:51,063
If you don't go to apologize Saikhim,

267
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:52,766
I'll make you have no one left.

268
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,886
Lady, it's almost time for the flight.

269
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:00,126
Go and apologize to Saikhim.

270
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:02,046
If not, I'll attack you even more than this.

271
00:18:02,286 --> 00:18:04,126
Why do I have to apologize to her?

272
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:06,086
Since I don't feel guilty.

273
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:08,798
If you don't feel guilty,

274
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,406
I'll give all the evidence to the police.

275
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:16,046
I'll only send wreaths to apologize to her only when she's dead!

276
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:19,246
Go wherever you want and don't show your face here again!

277
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:32,366
I'm still alive because of Kaokla, Oun.

278
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:35,886
He was the one who helped me.

279
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:38,726
Ms. Khim, please calm down.

280
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:41,126
I thought he hated me.

281
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,366
If he hated me, he wouldn't do something like this.

282
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:48,726
When it's a life-or-death situation, anyone would help you.

283
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:51,246
I also want it to be like that.

284
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:54,806
So, I wouldn't feel guilty like this.

285
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:57,038
If I had died,

286
00:18:57,758 --> 00:19:01,846
I would have never known how much he's worried about me.

287
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:05,206
He didn't want me dead.

288
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:08,326
Alright. Please calm down for now, Ms. Khim.

289
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:17,806
- There, there. - I didn't know anything.

290
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:34,286
Mr. Nate had a seizure.

291
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:36,995
Did you call the doctor? How is he?

292
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:38,686
Mr. Carl has taken him away,

293
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:40,966
but I don't know where they are.

294
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:43,366
Pull over.

295
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:47,086
What's going on? Aren't you going to the airport?

296
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:49,926
If you don't go to apologize Saikhim,

297
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:51,566
I'll make you have no one left.

298
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,086
Go and apologize to Saikhim.

299
00:19:56,215 --> 00:19:58,166
If not, I'll attack you even more than this.

300
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:05,446
Check where Saikhim is being admitted for me.

301
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:13,246
Hello?

302
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,446
Yes. Please send the ambulance right now.

303
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:21,846
The patient is having a seizure.

304
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:23,566
Nate.

305
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:39,486
Nate.

306
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:42,646
Nate.

307
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,806
Nate.

308
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:46,686
Nate.

309
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:56,206
(Where are you taking Nate?)

310
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:59,286
Do you understand how it feels to be desperate now?

311
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:02,246
I asked where you are taking my son.

312
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:05,507
This isn't something you should play with.

313
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:07,126
When you did that to Saikhim,

314
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:09,486
she didn't have a chance to beg for her life.

315
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:11,926
What do you want me to do?

316
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:15,350
Tell me. Give Nate back to me right now.

317
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,566
Go admit your guilt to Saikhim.

318
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:20,435
Or else, you won't have the chance to say farewell to your son.

319
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,326
You're still alright.

320
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,606
Is something the matter?

321
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:01,246
Did Kaokla know that you're safe?

322
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:05,686
After he came to settle our divorce, I couldn't contact him anymore.

323
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:08,526
Since you two have already divorced,

324
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:11,126
why are you still worried about each other?

325
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:15,253
Do you know where Kaokla is?

326
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,406
I should be the one who's asking you that.

327
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:21,166
- Where did he take my son? - Your son?

328
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:24,446
He's holding my son hostage because of you.

329
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,646
- Because of me? - Go tell him

330
00:22:28,134 --> 00:22:29,726
to give my son back.

331
00:22:29,822 --> 00:22:32,886
If not, you can wait for your life

332
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,766
to won't ever be peaceful again.

333
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:41,326
(Carl sent a photo.)

334
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:46,686
Is he your son?

335
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:56,406
Confess...

336
00:22:57,366 --> 00:22:59,566
What does he mean by "confess"?

337
00:23:09,624 --> 00:23:11,086
I know

338
00:23:11,382 --> 00:23:13,046
that you're around here.

339
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:15,173
I won't confess anything.

340
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:17,846
If you think what I've done

341
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:19,446
is horrible,

342
00:23:19,726 --> 00:23:22,526
what you're doing right now is as horrible as what I did.

343
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:26,646
You don't know me well enough, Kaokla.

344
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,086
(This is our divorce contract. I've already signed it.)

345
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,806
(If you sign it,)

346
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:48,806
I'll submit our divorce at the district office.

347
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:51,286
When you feel better, you can come and sign the document.

348
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:58,286
Kla.

349
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,246
(Don't act like we haven't been separated.)

350
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:33,277
(We've been separated by death once.)

351
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,533
Do you want to submit your divorce today? I can take you there.

352
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,286
Since you're leaving the hospital today.

353
00:26:46,766 --> 00:26:48,606
I want to see him again.

354
00:26:48,822 --> 00:26:51,766
You're hesitating because he saved your life?

355
00:26:54,606 --> 00:26:56,446
Why would you feel touched?

356
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:58,686
He did it for himself, Khim.

357
00:26:58,806 --> 00:27:00,646
If something really happened to you,

358
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,406
Claire would be charged with something worse.

359
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:04,966
He came here to settle things with you.

360
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:07,406
It's already obvious whom he has chosen.

361
00:27:10,686 --> 00:27:11,926
Anyway...

362
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:14,686
I still owe him my life.

363
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,886
He isn't here. He has probably run away by now.

364
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:39,086
Then, there is only one way left.

365
00:28:45,647 --> 00:28:48,526
(I need a transport car.)

366
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:02,966
(I've arrived.)

367
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:05,606
(Chiang Mai)

368
00:29:11,326 --> 00:29:12,566
Did you call for a transport car?

369
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:14,966
I'm going to deliver vegetables to the village.

370
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:17,860
Sure. I'll drive you there.

371
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:21,126
There. Over there. She wants to buy all of them.

372
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:08,726
Why did you come here?

373
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,006
Who let you come here?

374
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:15,566
I'm already better. I want to recuperate here.

375
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:19,766
And you came here alone?

376
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:21,806
I came here alone.

377
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,046
I'm here to give you the document back.

378
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:29,766
You can just send it to my home.

379
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,486
You don't need to come here.

380
00:30:33,453 --> 00:30:34,606
I want to see...

381
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:39,926
Where are you going?

382
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:43,606
Well, I'm going the same way as you.

383
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:48,726
The scenery here is pretty as always.

384
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:51,326
Did the doctor check your brain?

385
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:53,486
You're acting unusual now.

386
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:56,566
We can still be friends even if we've divorced.

387
00:30:58,733 --> 00:30:59,733
I won't send you there.

388
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,206
Why not?

389
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:03,766
It's a waste of my time.

390
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:05,806
Wait.

391
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:09,806
Actually, I have something to tell you.

392
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:12,966
Say it. I'm listening.

393
00:31:16,053 --> 00:31:17,246
Here?

394
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:19,661
If it's so important that you have to come here,

395
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:21,286
just say it.

396
00:31:22,726 --> 00:31:24,166
I just learned that

397
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:27,286
you saved my life.

398
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:31,182
So, I want to thank you.

399
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:35,545
That's all? Understood.

400
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,686
Wait.

401
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,486
There's something more.

402
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:43,806
- I... - No. It's already over for me.

403
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:45,766
Or it would take more time.

404
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:25,166
Don't forget to unlock the room or we can't prepare the room in time.

405
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:26,746
Go.

406
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,406
- Dad. - Kla.

407
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:33,966
You're here.

408
00:32:35,892 --> 00:32:37,726
I've arrived. I came here as quickly as I could.

409
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:40,406
Me too.

410
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:42,726
Let's go. I told someone to unlock your house.

411
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:44,366
- Yes. - Go leave your stuff there.

412
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:51,406
Dad, your service is like a five-star hotel now.

413
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:54,446
Those are for a student who is coming here.

414
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:56,006
As for you,

415
00:32:56,238 --> 00:32:57,572
you'll stay over there.

416
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,989
Your former house.

417
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:09,966
The sunset's view in that house must be beautiful.

418
00:33:10,501 --> 00:33:14,086
Sure. I'll make a window so you can see this view every day.

419
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:19,086
Why are you building this house?

420
00:33:19,526 --> 00:33:20,966
It's the home for our married life.

421
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:24,886
You want to stay here, so I decided to build it.

422
00:33:25,406 --> 00:33:29,206
(This note is like the note that keeps all of my happiness.)

423
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:30,886
(Everything I love)

424
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:32,926
(is in here.)

425
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:38,166
Kla.

426
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:40,526
Don't go running around at night.

427
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:42,861
There's been a mad dog here recently.

428
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:48,262
A mad dog?

429
00:34:53,269 --> 00:34:54,566
Where is she right now?

430
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:58,286
Forget it. She probably went back.

431
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,126
She hasn't fully recovered.

432
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:13,806
Can she run away from a mad dog?

433
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:17,606
I should let her fight with it.

434
00:35:31,285 --> 00:35:34,846
(Attention, please gather in front of the village.)

435
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:39,286
(Attention, please gather in front of the village.)

436
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:41,046
(We need your help.)

437
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:53,366
Kla, where are you going?

438
00:35:53,597 --> 00:35:56,486
There was a public announcement. Someone might have gotten hurt.

439
00:35:56,702 --> 00:35:58,646
Wait. Hold on, Kla.

440
00:35:58,766 --> 00:36:00,054
Are you worried about me?

441
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,126
Or are you worried about a mad dog?

442
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:07,486
I was going to tell you that Khim is here.

443
00:36:08,077 --> 00:36:11,286
She booked under Lita's name. I didn't think it would be her.

444
00:36:12,686 --> 00:36:14,326
You disguised yourself to come here.

445
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:16,486
Do you have ulterior motives?

446
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:18,966
If you don't like it,

447
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,366
I can go back.

448
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,166
You should have known that before you came here.

449
00:36:23,606 --> 00:36:26,326
I called him, but he didn't answer my call.

450
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:28,606
So, I have to take a risk and come to see you here.

451
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:32,492
I don't mind, but it's still up to this guy.

452
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:35,006
This is your home, Dad.

453
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:37,846
It's up to you. I just came here to stay.

454
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:47,086
Khim, if you don't mind,

455
00:36:47,526 --> 00:36:49,886
you can stay here. If you feel uncomfortable,

456
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:51,926
I'll find new accommodation for you.

457
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:04,086
Do you have nowhere else to go or what?

458
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:06,886
I said I wanted to thank you.

459
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:09,566
You already said that. Do we still have to talk?

460
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:25,566
When you came to settle things for your girlfriend,

461
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:28,406
I was pouting at first

462
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:32,246
when I saw you protecting someone else when I was the victim.

463
00:37:35,614 --> 00:37:38,566
Until I saw the footage of the accident.

464
00:37:39,397 --> 00:37:41,046
You gave me CPR.

465
00:37:42,246 --> 00:37:45,046
I realized that you didn't want me to die.

466
00:37:52,494 --> 00:37:55,286
Death is too easy for you. I want to see you suffer more than this.

467
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:01,486
Then, stay here to torture me.

468
00:38:02,254 --> 00:38:04,006
Have you become addicted to pain now?

469
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:07,726
I know you're just acting mean.

470
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:30,126
See? You can't stand it if I get hurt

471
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:32,766
because your heart is so great.

472
00:38:34,774 --> 00:38:36,886
Does your heart still tremble because of me?

473
00:38:37,766 --> 00:38:39,006
Annoying.

474
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:52,766
Didn't your boyfriend say anything?

475
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:56,486
Thaen won't marry me anymore.

476
00:38:58,446 --> 00:39:00,646
Your wedding is ruined, so you want to make up with me?

477
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,486
You already have Claire. How could I take you away?

478
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:08,566
I don't know. You're here to seduce me though.

479
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:15,566
I want to repay you for saving my life

480
00:39:15,845 --> 00:39:17,726
by making your wish come true.

481
00:39:18,237 --> 00:39:20,806
I want you to be the old Kaokla.

482
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:23,526
I want to see him again.

483
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:27,006
I know that in truth,

484
00:39:27,686 --> 00:39:29,846
you're still a kind man like back then.

485
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:32,646
That idiot died seven years ago.

486
00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:36,086
That's not true.

487
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:38,606
You're just hiding him.

488
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:40,742
You killed him with your own hands.

489
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:02,406
Then, I would like to atone for my sin.

490
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:05,406
When we divorce, I won't marry again

491
00:40:06,646 --> 00:40:08,646
until I can see you happy.

492
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,646
What are you trying to make merit for?

493
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:25,126
Even if we don't love each other,

494
00:40:25,692 --> 00:40:27,141
it doesn't mean we have to hate each other.

495
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,646
We still might be able to be friends.

496
00:40:33,877 --> 00:40:36,326
A friend to sleep with me is nice. Shall we do it tonight?

497
00:40:36,638 --> 00:40:38,606
I know you don't want to be mean to me.

498
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:42,966
If you hate me, you wouldn't save my life.

499
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:45,893
Go use this time to find a new man instead.

500
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:02,406
You asked me to compensate for the time when I left you to be happy.

501
00:41:03,893 --> 00:41:05,486
I want to repay you

502
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:07,846
by making you happy.

503
00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:10,326
This is the reason why I came here to see you.

504
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:15,806
I don't feel the same as you.

505
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,886
I'm rebellious.

506
00:41:18,158 --> 00:41:20,046
I hate it when I see an optimistic person.

507
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:18,581
Nate.

508
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,246
Nate, my child.

509
00:42:20,486 --> 00:42:21,806
How are you?

510
00:42:21,966 --> 00:42:23,726
Did anyone do anything to you?

511
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,766
Do you miss me?

512
00:42:27,566 --> 00:42:30,286
The doctor said his seizure came from his neurosis.

513
00:42:30,477 --> 00:42:33,846
He might have a seizure again. He might need medication.

514
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,366
But what's more worrying is,

515
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,726
there are signs of failure

516
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:40,006
in the transplanted kidney. It's possible to have acute kidney failure.

517
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,733
Kla only has one kidney left.

518
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:53,766
If you want another kidney,

519
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:55,726
you might need to kill him.

520
00:42:59,566 --> 00:43:01,566
Killing Kla is probably more beneficial

521
00:43:01,756 --> 00:43:03,206
than killing his wife.

522
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:05,846
You can't take her kidney for your son.

523
00:43:06,595 --> 00:43:08,726
I'll make you pay for it later.

524
00:43:09,206 --> 00:43:10,566
That you

525
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:13,006
kidnapped my son and hid him.

526
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:15,726
You only didn't see your son for a few days.

527
00:43:16,246 --> 00:43:17,566
You act like you're dying.

528
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:20,646
Won't it be worse if you're in prison?

529
00:43:22,966 --> 00:43:25,246
This is the resignation letter from Kla

530
00:43:25,766 --> 00:43:28,126
which comes with the document of separation of the business.

531
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:31,486
Kla wants the accommodation renting business

532
00:43:32,014 --> 00:43:34,646
because the business was built by him.

533
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:36,246
Sign these now

534
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,206
if you don't want the police to know about Saikhim.

535
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:41,326
How thick-skinned. What about when you kidnapped my son

536
00:43:41,446 --> 00:43:44,246
and demanded ransom from me? How isn't it illegal?

537
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:45,926
Please think about it.

538
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:49,246
Do you want to stay with your son

539
00:43:50,246 --> 00:43:51,606
or sleep in a prison?

540
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:11,406
Did Ms. Khim arrive at the farm?

541
00:44:11,677 --> 00:44:14,166
Does anyone in the family suspect anything?

542
00:44:16,126 --> 00:44:17,726
I told them that Ms. Khim

543
00:44:17,847 --> 00:44:20,646
wanted to recuperate herself at Phuket with you, Lita.

544
00:44:20,806 --> 00:44:22,886
(No one is suspicious of her.)

545
00:44:23,525 --> 00:44:24,606
Good.

546
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:27,846
Let everyone think that Khim is with me at Phuket.

547
00:44:28,477 --> 00:44:30,726
Oun, if Thaen asks you,

548
00:44:30,822 --> 00:44:32,326
you must say the same thing.

549
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:34,926
Yes. No problem.

550
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:36,046
Thank you.

551
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,606
She wanted to get back to an old flame.

552
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:50,686
That's why she was abandoned by her groom.

553
00:44:51,126 --> 00:44:54,046
Her old husband and her new one are both running away.

554
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:57,606
There's no way she can face anyone if she isn't strong enough.

555
00:44:57,806 --> 00:44:59,726
She will probably stay in Phuket for a long time.

556
00:45:00,725 --> 00:45:03,606
Saikhim really has no luck with men.

557
00:45:05,486 --> 00:45:06,766
Oun.

558
00:45:07,134 --> 00:45:09,134
Please prepare to face reality.

559
00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:11,646
If a gentleman like Thaen still hates it,

560
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:14,766
I don't think Saikhim can find a good husband in this life.

561
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:18,526
I don't see anyone here who can find a good lover.

562
00:45:23,237 --> 00:45:24,566
What are you saying, Oun?

563
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:26,406
It's unlike you.

564
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:35,046
I'm not afraid of being single.

565
00:45:35,286 --> 00:45:38,646
I'm more afraid of not being able to make money for myself.

566
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,206
I'll excuse myself.

567
00:45:46,646 --> 00:45:49,366
Prim is upset after she got heartbroken this time.

568
00:45:49,846 --> 00:45:52,126
But I don't believe she can let Khim go.

569
00:45:52,342 --> 00:45:54,606
I think she'll make money to buy a man for herself.

570
00:45:55,876 --> 00:45:56,876
Prompt.

571
00:45:57,005 --> 00:45:58,246
It's true, Mom.

572
00:45:58,478 --> 00:45:59,966
I don't know who deceived her.

573
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:17,926
Where are all the children?

574
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:20,077
No one left them with you anymore?

575
00:46:24,454 --> 00:46:26,246
They've all grown up for school now.

576
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:29,206
I had to take care of Kloy since the incident.

577
00:46:29,717 --> 00:46:31,606
I didn't have time to look after them.

578
00:46:31,846 --> 00:46:33,166
People felt bad for us,

579
00:46:33,646 --> 00:46:35,646
so no one left the children with us.

580
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:40,846
Since Kloy was shot back then?

581
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:44,526
Kloy got her leg amputated.

582
00:46:45,918 --> 00:46:47,886
She had to learn how to walk again.

583
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:54,446
Kla was in a coma.

584
00:46:55,214 --> 00:46:57,214
We only had each other back then.

585
00:47:01,014 --> 00:47:03,014
Kloy couldn't accept it in the beginning

586
00:47:03,382 --> 00:47:06,086
because she thought her life will be ruined

587
00:47:06,941 --> 00:47:08,286
if she became a handicapped person.

588
00:47:49,062 --> 00:47:51,326
Do you know that Kla committed suicide

589
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:55,086
to give his kidney away to get money for his sister's treatment?

590
00:47:59,759 --> 00:48:01,926
His kidney is compatible with his stepbrother,

591
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:03,886
the real son of his biological dad.

592
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:07,686
He donated his kidney to his brother,

593
00:48:07,862 --> 00:48:11,046
so they repaid him by raising him to become a new person.

594
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,326
His life returned to being the heir of a millionaire.

595
00:48:15,112 --> 00:48:17,326
I didn't know that

596
00:48:18,156 --> 00:48:19,686
something like this happened.

597
00:48:22,622 --> 00:48:24,766
He sacrificed himself for everyone else.

598
00:48:27,086 --> 00:48:28,526
He has saved

599
00:48:28,886 --> 00:48:30,206
two lives.

600
00:48:31,046 --> 00:48:32,606
It's really fortunate that he survived.

601
00:48:34,142 --> 00:48:35,342
As for Kloy,

602
00:48:35,702 --> 00:48:37,726
she had become disheartened

603
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,206
and secluded herself.

604
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:41,206
She didn't want to leave her room.

605
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:45,446
So, I tried to teach her various life skills.

606
00:48:46,275 --> 00:48:48,166
I just realize now

607
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:52,686
how many hardships I've caused you.

608
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,250
Khim.

609
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:56,446
Don't blame yourself.

610
00:48:56,726 --> 00:49:00,726
I tried to teach my kids to be grateful for everything they've seen,

611
00:49:01,053 --> 00:49:03,486
even if they made us lose something.

612
00:49:03,973 --> 00:49:05,046
But in the end,

613
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:08,246
they'll give something back to us.

614
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,513
Look at Kla.

615
00:49:13,062 --> 00:49:14,926
He was really reckless back then.

616
00:49:15,518 --> 00:49:17,086
But since that incident,

617
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:19,246
he has become better.

618
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:22,126
See? He should be thanking you

619
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,310
for changing his life.

620
00:49:25,766 --> 00:49:28,286
I haven't had a chance to tell you this,

621
00:49:28,926 --> 00:49:31,046
but I want you to know that

622
00:49:31,246 --> 00:49:34,046
during the time I had been staying here,

623
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:36,966
it was really valuable for me.

624
00:49:37,926 --> 00:49:41,526
If I didn't meet you, I wouldn't be like this today.

625
00:49:43,678 --> 00:49:45,006
It's me

626
00:49:45,646 --> 00:49:47,526
who should be thanking everyone.

627
00:50:37,006 --> 00:50:38,006
What would you like?

628
00:50:38,206 --> 00:50:40,206
I would like chamomile tea.

629
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:52,166
How are you, Khim?

630
00:50:52,526 --> 00:50:53,846
Did you talk with him?

631
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:56,806
I just understand

632
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:59,446
why he hates me so much.

633
00:50:59,758 --> 00:51:01,406
And can it erase

634
00:51:01,534 --> 00:51:03,766
what he has done to you and almost got you killed?

635
00:51:04,206 --> 00:51:06,806
If you see what we've done to his family,

636
00:51:07,046 --> 00:51:08,846
I don't think it can be compared.

637
00:51:14,126 --> 00:51:15,926
Khim, Thaen is here.

638
00:51:16,594 --> 00:51:19,886
Then, Thaen will know that we aren't at Phuket together.

639
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:23,686
I'll handle it for you.

640
00:51:23,966 --> 00:51:25,006
Lita.

641
00:51:43,324 --> 00:51:44,573
You said you are in Phuket.

642
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:46,246
And...

643
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:47,646
What are you doing?

644
00:51:49,937 --> 00:51:51,470
I have to meet with my client.

645
00:51:51,629 --> 00:51:53,446
So, I let Khim stay there.

646
00:51:54,046 --> 00:51:55,646
Are you here to have a meal?

647
00:51:58,266 --> 00:51:59,326
No.

648
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:00,709
I'm here to catch a liar.

649
00:52:01,606 --> 00:52:02,606
No.

650
00:52:03,044 --> 00:52:04,173
My client will come soon.

651
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:07,170
Your client is me.

652
00:52:16,246 --> 00:52:20,366
If I didn't use this method, I wouldn't know you and Khim are avoiding me.

653
00:52:22,526 --> 00:52:25,126
So, who actually wants to cancel the wedding?

654
00:52:30,157 --> 00:52:31,726
She's not answering.

655
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:34,486
Please don't get me into trouble again.

656
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:43,326
I hope I won't get caught again.

657
00:52:49,444 --> 00:52:50,630
When are you going back?

658
00:53:01,926 --> 00:53:03,326
I'm so tired.

659
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,286
I'll stay until tomorrow.

660
00:53:05,604 --> 00:53:07,246
I'll let you stay here for another night.

661
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:09,566
We'll live separately today.

662
00:53:09,758 --> 00:53:10,926
Don't bother me.

663
00:53:11,198 --> 00:53:12,406
I don't want to see your face.

664
00:53:21,854 --> 00:53:22,886
Get up.

665
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:24,926
No.

666
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:27,486
I came here first.

667
00:53:27,854 --> 00:53:29,606
I told you to not bother me.

668
00:53:30,686 --> 00:53:32,486
When you're breathing on me like this,

669
00:53:32,686 --> 00:53:35,046
if you're not trying to seduce me, I don't know what it is.

670
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:37,806
You said you didn't want to see my face.

671
00:53:38,502 --> 00:53:39,726
Don't look at me then.

672
00:53:41,428 --> 00:53:43,206
And we won't be breathing on each other.

673
00:54:01,678 --> 00:54:03,366
Have those two loved each other?

674
00:54:03,765 --> 00:54:06,406
Did they love each other? Or were they only married?

675
00:54:11,846 --> 00:54:13,246
I want the truth.

676
00:54:13,862 --> 00:54:15,766
Why don't you ask Khim yourself?

677
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:18,286
Are you scared of her answer?

678
00:54:20,726 --> 00:54:21,726
(Why are you quiet?)

679
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:23,029
(Did he ask about Kla?)

680
00:54:24,446 --> 00:54:25,766
What are his good attributes?

681
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:28,366
Why is Khim interested in that man?

682
00:54:28,694 --> 00:54:30,206
If I say she's addicted to "that thing",

683
00:54:31,886 --> 00:54:33,406
can you accept it?

684
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:36,726
(Don't tell him anything.)

685
00:54:39,837 --> 00:54:41,606
What secrets are you hiding from me?

686
00:54:49,646 --> 00:54:52,926
If you don't want to tell me, I'll ask Khim myself.

687
00:55:05,398 --> 00:55:07,798
You're afraid that they'll know you're lying on top of a man.

688
00:55:11,702 --> 00:55:13,606
I came here to see you.

689
00:55:14,861 --> 00:55:16,861
Of course, I want to be with you more.

690
00:55:21,046 --> 00:55:23,246
You intentionally committed suicide in prison

691
00:55:24,261 --> 00:55:26,261
to get money for Kloyjai's treatment?

692
00:55:27,045 --> 00:55:28,206
That scar

693
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:33,646
came from when you donated your kidney for Kloyjai's treatment, right?

694
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:35,846
(I heard that)

695
00:55:36,093 --> 00:55:37,606
(there's an order coming in here.)

696
00:55:37,846 --> 00:55:40,246
(Secretly selling organs for money.)

697
00:55:40,486 --> 00:55:41,926
(If they're compatible,)

698
00:55:42,094 --> 00:55:43,246
(they'll gladly pay the money.)

699
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:45,366
(They don't care if we're criminals.)

700
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:51,166
If we could turn back the time to fix one thing in our relationship,

701
00:55:51,606 --> 00:55:53,366
what would you change?

702
00:55:53,806 --> 00:55:55,366
If I could choose,

703
00:55:55,646 --> 00:55:57,886
I would like to be the one who got shot by the bullet on that day.

704
00:55:58,181 --> 00:55:59,766
Kla, don't do this.

705
00:56:00,246 --> 00:56:01,886
Do I look that horrible to you?

706
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,246
It's as painful as when I was stabbed.

707
00:56:04,879 --> 00:56:07,006
It came from your stare.

708
00:56:08,086 --> 00:56:09,846
Do you want to know how much it hurts?

709
00:56:09,989 --> 00:56:11,246
Kla, calm down.

710
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:13,150
Kla.

711
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:14,541
Kla, calm down.

712
00:56:14,717 --> 00:56:16,762
Don't do this, I beg you.

713
00:56:16,846 --> 00:56:17,846
Let me go.

714
00:56:18,452 --> 00:56:19,926
Kla, enough.

715
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:22,486
Don't! No!

716
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,646
Kloy!

717
00:56:26,646 --> 00:56:29,366
It's my fault for not trusting you on that day.

718
00:56:32,565 --> 00:56:33,766
If I could choose,

719
00:56:34,774 --> 00:56:37,686
I would choose not to trust a spoiled child's words

720
00:56:38,422 --> 00:56:39,566
on that day.

721
00:56:39,974 --> 00:56:42,926
For every kindness that we give to someone,

722
00:56:43,326 --> 00:56:44,446
one day,

723
00:56:45,157 --> 00:56:47,366
it'll come back to us.

724
00:56:47,725 --> 00:56:49,166
You're a nice man.

725
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:52,726
You will never starve.

726
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,286
A nice man? How do you know I'm nice?

727
00:56:55,422 --> 00:56:58,366
The roti lady told me that

728
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:00,966
you didn't have enough to eat before.

729
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:02,366
When you have enough,

730
00:57:02,661 --> 00:57:05,246
you want to share some with others.

731
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:08,606
That's why you paid for the roti beforehand,

732
00:57:08,998 --> 00:57:12,046
in case someone who's in a tough spot pass by.

733
00:57:12,286 --> 00:57:13,726
They'll realize that

734
00:57:14,062 --> 00:57:16,526
someone can still see their difficulties.

735
00:57:17,486 --> 00:57:19,126
When I heard that,

736
00:57:20,326 --> 00:57:21,926
I was so amazed.

737
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,166
Your heart is so cool.

738
00:57:25,926 --> 00:57:28,006
If I didn't trust those words,

739
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:31,309
I wouldn't turn over a new leaf

740
00:57:32,222 --> 00:57:34,086
and destroy everyone's life like this.

741
00:57:38,478 --> 00:57:39,806
If you could choose,

742
00:57:40,637 --> 00:57:43,006
you probably didn't want me in your life.

743
00:57:44,134 --> 00:57:45,326
If I have to compare it,

744
00:57:46,694 --> 00:57:48,366
I like myself in the past

745
00:57:49,286 --> 00:57:50,766
more than I like myself today.

746
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:55,166
I also want to see that man again.

747
00:58:00,846 --> 00:58:03,086
If we could go back to become strangers again,

748
00:58:03,806 --> 00:58:05,046
that would be nice.

749
00:59:23,989 --> 00:59:25,166
Wait.

750
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:26,566
Wait for the guest first.

751
00:59:26,694 --> 00:59:29,806
Dad, you don't need to mind your manners for her.

752
00:59:33,127 --> 00:59:34,893
I forgot to fix the water pump.

753
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:36,806
I'll go take look at it.

754
00:59:38,311 --> 00:59:40,926
You go into that room and see if the water is running.

755
01:00:03,021 --> 01:00:05,206
Hey. Can you take a shower?

756
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:14,406
The water suddenly stopped running.

757
01:00:14,566 --> 01:00:16,126
The water pump is probably broken.

758
01:00:16,326 --> 01:00:17,366
Let me see.

759
01:00:19,005 --> 01:00:20,046
Wait.

760
01:00:41,726 --> 01:00:43,486
The water pump is probably broken.

761
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,046
It was running just earlier.

762
01:01:22,326 --> 01:01:23,606
Don't look at me.

763
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:57,566
You don't have to wait.

764
01:03:57,966 --> 01:03:59,206
You should have them first.

765
01:06:14,686 --> 01:06:17,086
Let's trade rooms. Go sleep in the house.

766
01:06:20,886 --> 01:06:22,166
Why do we have to trade rooms?

767
01:06:49,126 --> 01:06:50,846
Can you stay here for two more days?

768
01:06:53,246 --> 01:06:54,406
Sure.

769
01:06:55,446 --> 01:06:57,726
- Why? - So we can go deal with our divorce together.

770
01:07:50,502 --> 01:07:51,806
It's pretty.

771
01:08:26,046 --> 01:08:28,286
I guess we can only be this close.

772
01:08:58,166 --> 01:09:00,406
When I close my eyes, I still see those images every year.

773
01:09:00,694 --> 01:09:04,006
When I'm awake, I can't tell what the nightmare or the truth is.

774
01:09:04,246 --> 01:09:05,606
During all these years,

775
01:09:06,046 --> 01:09:09,286
I don't want to sleep as I'm afraid I can't wake up again.

776
01:09:09,606 --> 01:09:10,806
Try to live as me.

777
01:09:10,997 --> 01:09:13,206
Can you endure half of what I've faced?

778
01:09:32,094 --> 01:09:33,606
I submitted our resignation,

779
01:09:33,758 --> 01:09:36,286
but I don't know if she'll let us separate our business from her.

780
01:09:38,766 --> 01:09:41,006
We already threatened to take action against her.

781
01:09:41,213 --> 01:09:42,601
She didn't feel even a bit remorseful.

782
01:09:42,789 --> 01:09:44,606
I'll leave with nothing if it's necessary.

783
01:09:45,157 --> 01:09:48,366
If we still live with a murderer, the next victim might be us.

784
01:09:49,726 --> 01:09:53,686
Everything happened because Khim has been holding you with your property.

785
01:09:53,966 --> 01:09:56,166
That's why you got cut off from the inheritance.

786
01:09:56,271 --> 01:09:59,486
If it wasn't because of those matrimonial properties,

787
01:09:59,886 --> 01:10:02,246
you wouldn't have to fight with your stepmother.

788
01:10:05,003 --> 01:10:06,846
If your life is this bad when you have a wife,

789
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:08,806
I don't think you should have one anymore.

790
01:10:09,108 --> 01:10:11,766
This one wife has already caused you a lot.

791
01:10:14,573 --> 01:10:16,286
If it wasn't for Khim,

792
01:10:16,686 --> 01:10:20,166
you would already lead such a better life.

793
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:31,566
Who would want that money?

794
01:10:32,046 --> 01:10:33,766
I didn't marry you for that money.

795
01:10:37,173 --> 01:10:39,406
I almost forgot this feeling.

796
01:10:41,086 --> 01:10:43,806
- Step on it stronger. - I know that.

797
01:10:45,702 --> 01:10:47,166
Yes. More.

798
01:10:51,389 --> 01:10:53,006
Do you want more? What?

799
01:11:15,981 --> 01:11:18,486
We should call it a day for now, Kloy. It's enough.

800
01:11:29,053 --> 01:11:30,646
- Does it hurt? - No.

801
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:33,526
Just kidding.

802
01:11:34,296 --> 01:11:35,806
- You fell for it. - Fine.

803
01:11:38,646 --> 01:11:40,046
Please have some drinks.

804
01:11:41,446 --> 01:11:42,886
Your black coffee.

805
01:11:50,486 --> 01:11:51,686
Kloy.

806
01:11:53,366 --> 01:11:54,646
You should have some water.

807
01:11:55,606 --> 01:11:58,206
Is this what they call possessive?

808
01:11:58,526 --> 01:12:01,806
You've agreed to divorce, but you didn't want to see him move on.

809
01:12:02,014 --> 01:12:04,938
So, you're staying here to make him unable to forget you.

810
01:12:05,085 --> 01:12:06,406
The one who should be here

811
01:12:06,668 --> 01:12:08,166
is Claire.

812
01:12:08,605 --> 01:12:10,326
They love each other.

813
01:12:10,486 --> 01:12:12,366
Why did you make them break up?

814
01:12:12,487 --> 01:12:14,806
Do you hope that Kla will return to you?

815
01:12:15,126 --> 01:12:18,406
That's why you're doing a special mission to win his heart back?

816
01:12:21,518 --> 01:12:22,686
Kloy.

817
01:12:23,766 --> 01:12:25,366
I don't want anything like that.

818
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:27,806
What? Then, why are you staying here?

819
01:12:28,366 --> 01:12:30,886
I don't think an old flame is trendy anymore.

820
01:12:35,545 --> 01:12:37,086
I'll help you.

821
01:12:37,326 --> 01:12:38,846
Hey, don't bother.

822
01:12:44,381 --> 01:12:46,246
Why do you need to get in our way?

823
01:12:48,878 --> 01:12:50,078
Do you hear that?

824
01:12:51,526 --> 01:12:53,366
Can we ask for our privacy?

825
01:13:13,141 --> 01:13:14,726
I'll go back now.

826
01:13:22,574 --> 01:13:24,726
After you're done with our divorce here,

827
01:13:24,926 --> 01:13:26,606
submit it to Bangkok.

828
01:13:27,326 --> 01:13:28,886
I'll wait to divorce over there.

829
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:32,653
So we don't have to face each other.

830
01:13:42,486 --> 01:13:43,926
You said you would wait for tomorrow.

831
01:13:46,061 --> 01:13:48,286
I only make you feel uncomfortable when I'm here.

832
01:13:51,686 --> 01:13:52,926
It's better if I'm not here.

833
01:14:07,206 --> 01:14:08,286
Good.

834
01:14:09,651 --> 01:14:11,006
It hurts but it's over.

835
01:15:22,806 --> 01:15:24,126
(I'll go back now.)

836
01:15:24,372 --> 01:15:26,566
(After you're done with our divorce here,)

837
01:15:26,805 --> 01:15:28,246
(submit it to Bangkok.)

838
01:15:28,485 --> 01:15:30,046
(I'll wait to divorce over there.)

839
01:15:30,285 --> 01:15:32,206
(So we don't have to face each other.)

840
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:11,406
Why are you so grudgeful of her? You're the reason

841
01:16:11,886 --> 01:16:14,086
why Saikhim went away to another man.

842
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,126
What are you saying?

843
01:16:17,262 --> 01:16:18,526
For us,

844
01:16:19,933 --> 01:16:22,206
love isn't a matter between two people sometimes.

845
01:16:22,326 --> 01:16:24,486
Do you remember when you eloped with Khim?

846
01:16:24,837 --> 01:16:26,046
Back then,

847
01:16:26,366 --> 01:16:28,046
you loved each other so much

848
01:16:28,396 --> 01:16:30,246
because you two had a lot of obstacles.

849
01:16:30,812 --> 01:16:34,086
Khim and you had the same enemy which is your father-in-law.

850
01:16:34,455 --> 01:16:37,286
But when he changed his role, the situation changed.

851
01:16:37,517 --> 01:16:38,766
Saikhim understood that

852
01:16:38,847 --> 01:16:40,086
actually,

853
01:16:40,255 --> 01:16:42,806
you're the bane of her life.

854
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:45,246
If we want to know whether it's true love,

855
01:16:45,779 --> 01:16:47,966
we have to wait for when the enemy is all gone.

856
01:16:48,517 --> 01:16:50,117
If you don't love each other enough,

857
01:16:50,469 --> 01:16:52,469
when there's no obstacle for you,

858
01:16:52,877 --> 01:16:54,646
you'll turn against each other.

859
01:16:55,526 --> 01:16:56,846
Do you understand now

860
01:16:57,125 --> 01:17:00,206
why she wants to go back to marry her boyfriend?

861
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:03,646
Because you

862
01:17:03,854 --> 01:17:06,206
are the proof of her true love.

863
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,046
They can love whom they want.

864
01:17:12,566 --> 01:17:14,286
If you want her to open up her eyes,

865
01:17:14,486 --> 01:17:16,606
you must stop being her bane of existence.

866
01:17:19,438 --> 01:17:21,206
Do you understand what I said?

867
01:17:30,406 --> 01:17:32,846
You asked me to pay you 200 million baht as dowry.

868
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,646
You think if it's Carl,

869
01:17:34,829 --> 01:17:37,366
he can easily get this amount of money, right?

870
01:17:39,205 --> 01:17:40,646
It's the truth

871
01:17:40,846 --> 01:17:42,126
that Khim should know

872
01:17:42,269 --> 01:17:44,006
what the consequence of a divorce is.

873
01:17:45,238 --> 01:17:47,206
The one who wants to destroy your wedding

874
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:48,766
is Khim's dad.

875
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:53,926
He intended to use these photos

876
01:17:54,126 --> 01:17:55,806
to break you and Khim up.

877
01:17:56,364 --> 01:17:58,926
We're only tools being used by him.

878
01:17:59,165 --> 01:18:01,366
Why does he want Carl as his son-in-law?

879
01:18:02,397 --> 01:18:04,166
It's a game of revenge

880
01:18:04,469 --> 01:18:06,366
between those two people.

881
01:18:06,606 --> 01:18:08,606
Khim didn't want it to be like this.

882
01:18:10,597 --> 01:18:12,726
Do you dare to challenge both of those men

883
01:18:13,173 --> 01:18:14,646
to protect Khim?

884
01:18:18,606 --> 01:18:21,966
I don't think I can get this much money for you right now.

885
01:18:24,925 --> 01:18:26,925
But I have a way to make at least

886
01:18:27,022 --> 01:18:29,086
two hundred million baht for your company.

887
01:18:29,614 --> 01:18:31,526
So, you don't care about Khim's past?

888
01:18:31,711 --> 01:18:33,046
I know very well

889
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:36,846
how uncomfortable it is to always

890
01:18:37,117 --> 01:18:38,686
be judged and observed.

891
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,926
No one is perfect.

892
01:18:41,109 --> 01:18:44,886
Even for me, it's not like I don't have any flaws.

893
01:18:45,126 --> 01:18:47,726
I won't use this matter to judge Khim.

894
01:18:47,862 --> 01:18:49,526
People can make mistakes.

895
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,486
A wedding isn't the end.

896
01:18:55,766 --> 01:18:58,726
You might encounter even more unexpected things.

897
01:18:59,013 --> 01:19:00,366
But if it's Saikhim,

898
01:19:00,829 --> 01:19:02,926
I'm ready to risk everything for her.

899
01:19:08,173 --> 01:19:10,686
So, is Thaen here to cancel the wedding?

900
01:19:10,918 --> 01:19:14,206
He's talking with Uncle behind Khim's back, so it's possible.

901
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:20,286
So, do we need to congratulate you

902
01:19:20,486 --> 01:19:22,006
or console you?

903
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:25,046
I think I have to invite you to our wedding in advance.

904
01:19:26,446 --> 01:19:28,046
It's like she got to drive off her bad luck.

905
01:19:29,076 --> 01:19:30,286
Since the car accident,

906
01:19:30,429 --> 01:19:32,686
everything is in favor of Saikhim.

907
01:19:32,949 --> 01:19:36,566
She gets married immediately after her divorce. I wish Prim is like that.

908
01:19:38,886 --> 01:19:40,446
When Khim has fully recovered,

909
01:19:40,996 --> 01:19:44,326
I'll invite you officially again. I'll excuse myself.

910
01:19:47,445 --> 01:19:49,886
Why is he so naive that he could eat another person's leftovers?

911
01:19:50,526 --> 01:19:53,526
I'm curious what changed Thaen's mind.

912
01:20:02,293 --> 01:20:04,293
I just saw a cow running to a butcher.

913
01:20:04,702 --> 01:20:06,806
Suddenly, Thaenthai asked for Saikhim's hand.

914
01:20:07,085 --> 01:20:09,085
(And did Khim's dad allow it?)

915
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:11,006
You can tell Saikhim

916
01:20:11,293 --> 01:20:13,086
to prepare to leave Carl.

917
01:20:13,548 --> 01:20:15,286
Thaenthai is ready to buy a secondhand item.

918
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,566
The only thing left is about the two of us.

919
01:20:20,213 --> 01:20:22,446
When do you want me to ask for your hand?

920
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:24,846
(If I get as much dowry as Khim,)

921
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,326
(I might say yes.)

922
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:27,606
For you, Lita,

923
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:29,446
I can do everything.

924
01:21:07,806 --> 01:21:09,846
Khim is interested in Kaokla

925
01:21:10,093 --> 01:21:11,646
because he's crazy enough

926
01:21:11,926 --> 01:21:13,566
to challenge Khim's dad

927
01:21:13,766 --> 01:21:15,646
without caring whether he's right or wrong.

928
01:21:15,774 --> 01:21:17,086
He doesn't care about anyone.

929
01:21:17,366 --> 01:21:18,406
What about you?

930
01:21:18,606 --> 01:21:20,406
How bad can you be for Khim?

931
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:29,606
(An hourglass. I would like to buy this one.)

932
01:21:37,037 --> 01:21:40,046
A cautious person like you won't dare to do any dirty things.

933
01:21:43,142 --> 01:21:44,606
Because you're too good,

934
01:21:44,934 --> 01:21:47,366
Khim doesn't want you to be stained by these problems.

935
01:21:48,046 --> 01:21:50,526
Khim was the one who had to protect you.

936
01:21:50,797 --> 01:21:53,846
If you still love yourself, you'll lose to Kaokla.

937
01:22:07,197 --> 01:22:08,246
Lita.

938
01:22:10,086 --> 01:22:11,566
Why did you take their stuff with you?

939
01:22:12,997 --> 01:22:14,246
Miss.

940
01:22:15,678 --> 01:22:16,878
We have a problem now.

941
01:22:17,781 --> 01:22:19,046
You overpaid us.

942
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:23,150
Oh, it's alright.

943
01:22:23,581 --> 01:22:25,086
- It's a tip. - Thank you.

944
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,166
You're a coward. Can you handle it?

945
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:51,726
Listen, you have to slice these vegetables carefully.

946
01:22:51,966 --> 01:22:55,326
When you put them on a dish, you need to put them cleanly.

947
01:22:55,446 --> 01:22:56,886
Make it pretty.

948
01:23:07,158 --> 01:23:09,246
(Then, I would like to atone for my sin.)

949
01:23:09,541 --> 01:23:10,541
When we divorce,

950
01:23:10,766 --> 01:23:12,246
I won't marry again

951
01:23:12,847 --> 01:23:14,646
until I can see you happy.

952
01:23:15,397 --> 01:23:16,806
You're lying again.

953
01:23:17,741 --> 01:23:19,181
Is this your way of atonement?

954
01:23:59,886 --> 01:24:02,046
(Thank you.)

955
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:09,486
Where is my pill?

956
01:24:09,686 --> 01:24:10,766
I threw it away.

957
01:24:10,902 --> 01:24:12,206
(I saw that you can't fall asleep.)

958
01:24:12,445 --> 01:24:14,726
So I made herbal tea for you.

959
01:24:14,997 --> 01:24:19,253
(You said you couldn't sleep since that incident which was caused by me.)

960
01:24:19,363 --> 01:24:21,286
(I want to fix it myself.)

961
01:24:21,646 --> 01:24:23,166
(That bottle of herbal tea)

962
01:24:23,789 --> 01:24:26,206
was made from the memory of your village.

963
01:24:28,166 --> 01:24:31,406
(I added a smell that will make you think of your farm.)

964
01:24:31,606 --> 01:24:33,606
The smell of your dad's rice.

965
01:24:33,725 --> 01:24:35,926
The smell of your mom's favorite pandan leaf.

966
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:39,206
The smell of the orange peels that you used to chase away mosquitoes.

967
01:24:39,406 --> 01:24:42,486
(And various flowers around there.)

968
01:24:48,668 --> 01:24:50,126
(You're so fortunate)

969
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:53,166
(that you get to live in the world that I didn't get to live in.)

970
01:24:58,006 --> 01:24:59,166
(So,)

971
01:24:59,966 --> 01:25:01,526
(please don't be sad because of me.)

972
01:25:04,126 --> 01:25:06,646
If you want to remember the moment when we love each other,

973
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:08,206
(or when we fought,)

974
01:25:08,566 --> 01:25:09,846
(you should keep those memories.)

975
01:25:10,262 --> 01:25:11,806
But your dad said

976
01:25:12,118 --> 01:25:16,086
if we're brave enough to be grateful for what happened to us,

977
01:25:17,493 --> 01:25:20,646
those incidents won't affect our minds again.

978
01:25:21,085 --> 01:25:24,006
(I've already thanked you.)

979
01:25:24,206 --> 01:25:26,726
I'll wait for the day when you'll thank me.

980
01:25:27,006 --> 01:25:28,246
Do you really want to hear it?

981
01:25:28,582 --> 01:25:30,726
(You said you wouldn't get married again after you've divorced,)

982
01:25:30,926 --> 01:25:32,606
(not until you can see me happy again.)

983
01:25:32,806 --> 01:25:35,046
Then, can I get married before you?

984
01:25:36,975 --> 01:25:38,375
I'll be deeply grateful.

985
01:25:38,662 --> 01:25:40,662
(If your wish comes true,)

986
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:43,126
I'll be glad.

987
01:25:43,246 --> 01:25:45,166
Can you really feel happy for me?

988
01:25:45,326 --> 01:25:46,806
(If you don't mind,)

989
01:25:47,366 --> 01:25:49,606
(I can even be your best woman.)

990
01:25:49,973 --> 01:25:51,046
That position?

991
01:25:52,829 --> 01:25:54,829
It's difficult for us to even be acquaintances.

992
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:56,490
(Listen,)

993
01:25:56,660 --> 01:26:00,526
(if you're still single within these next four months,)

994
01:26:01,565 --> 01:26:04,046
I'll postpone my wedding.

995
01:26:04,622 --> 01:26:06,166
(I'll wait until)

996
01:26:06,676 --> 01:26:08,676
your wish comes true with Ms. Claire.

997
01:26:09,606 --> 01:26:10,726
Is that enough?

998
01:26:10,966 --> 01:26:12,326
Then, the divorce contract is at stake.

999
01:26:12,526 --> 01:26:15,086
If my wish doesn't come true, you won't find any new man.

1000
01:26:15,446 --> 01:26:16,686
(If you're afraid,)

1001
01:26:17,462 --> 01:26:19,462
(you should make Claire become my bride.)

1002
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:21,246
I'll sign the document on that day.

1003
01:26:21,453 --> 01:26:23,046
Hey, wait.

1004
01:26:23,365 --> 01:26:25,006
You can't shift it on me.

1005
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:26,646
Hey.

1006
01:26:32,725 --> 01:26:35,045
Best woman? How could she say that?

1007
01:26:40,326 --> 01:26:42,046
If we want to know whether it's true love,

1008
01:26:43,006 --> 01:26:45,006
we have to wait for when the enemy is all gone.

1009
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:46,726
If you don't love each other enough,

1010
01:26:46,917 --> 01:26:48,966
when there's no obstacle for you,

1011
01:26:49,326 --> 01:26:51,046
you'll turn against each other.

1012
01:26:51,509 --> 01:26:52,857
Do you understand now

1013
01:26:53,206 --> 01:26:56,206
why she wants to go back to marry her boyfriend?

1014
01:26:56,509 --> 01:26:57,926
Because you

1015
01:26:58,166 --> 01:27:00,366
are the proof of her true love.

1016
01:27:16,662 --> 01:27:18,446
Do you want to change from my enemy into my friend?

1017
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:23,486
Let me be the protagonist for once.

1018
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:25,406
We'll see

1019
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:27,126
if you can still love that loser.

1020
01:27:32,197 --> 01:27:34,446
I'll bring everything with me.

1021
01:27:55,037 --> 01:27:56,646
Claire likes my accommodation on the island,

1022
01:27:56,757 --> 01:27:58,286
but we haven't had a chance to go together.

1023
01:27:58,757 --> 01:28:01,431
If I sell it to your boyfriend, I can't go there.

1024
01:28:01,564 --> 01:28:03,246
Are you also trying to win against him?

1025
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:05,985
It's a man's problem. You wouldn't understand. Where are you going?

1026
01:28:06,143 --> 01:28:07,486
I'm going to recover my heart.

1027
01:28:07,717 --> 01:28:09,806
We'll see each other again when the time comes.

1028
01:28:09,995 --> 01:28:11,995
Take care of yourself, Thaen.

1029
01:28:14,557 --> 01:28:15,726
I'm just keeping my promise

1030
01:28:15,989 --> 01:28:17,805
that I'll make you happy.

1031
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:20,246
Do you have a plan? Since you want to see me happy,

1032
01:28:20,334 --> 01:28:22,166
you should stay with me until the end.

1033
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:23,766
It's your fault

1034
01:28:23,942 --> 01:28:27,646
for trying to be his friend. It's best if you just hate on each other.

1035
01:28:27,798 --> 01:28:28,886
Kla wants a ring.

1036
01:28:29,126 --> 01:28:30,966
- What ring? - A wedding ring.

1037
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:33,246
Kla will propose to Claire at this place today.
