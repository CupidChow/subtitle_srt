1
00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:01,101
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,182 --> 00:00:02,266
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:03,528
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:45,886
I'm ordering you to stay here. Don't take Nate anywhere.

5
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:49,526
If you run, I'll send all the evidence I have to the police immediately.

6
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:53,126
Since he asked for trouble himself, I can't help it.

7
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:55,606
So, is he Mr. Khemmarat Kongrit?

8
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,326
Goodbye, Nate.

9
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,686
The world forces me to be bad.

10
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:01,606
You'll see that someone will be ruined soon.

11
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,526
For every second you suffered,

12
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:05,046
someone must suffer more than you.

13
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:07,845
We found the suspicious items for the murder.

14
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,074
I know who did it.

15
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:10,892
It's related to the relationship between us, isn't it?

16
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:12,926
It'll be better than the last time. I promise.

17
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,369
Did Carl send you here?

18
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:16,686
Why did you frame him for your son's case?

19
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,086
I'll never do anything reckless.

20
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:19,309
Help.

21
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:20,806
Because I still love my own life

22
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:23,286
and I still want to live with Saikhim for a long time.

23
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:27,646
(The last chance to love.)

24
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:29,806
(Death doesn't make me as scared as this.)

25
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:32,286
(The only thing I'll miss)

26
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:34,246
(is that we'll have no tomorrow.)

27
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:36,486
(No matter how many times I'm reborn,)

28
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:38,646
(I would like to see her again.)

29
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:41,286
(Although we don't have a chance to be together,)

30
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:44,786
(I still hope our love will live on forever.)

31
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:52,166
Kaokla, you'll pay for this!

32
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:55,373
Khim, watch out!

33
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,326
No!

34
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,166
All the bullets are here.

35
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:18,566
You and I,

36
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:20,206
we won't die off easily.

37
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:24,086
I'll wait to see you slowly die to them.

38
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,206
You'll pay for your cold-blooded heart.

39
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:50,246
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:53,318
Goodbye, Nate.

41
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:06,606
So, is he Mr. Khemmarat Kongrit?

42
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:31,206
You should stay here tonight.

43
00:05:32,086 --> 00:05:33,646
Don't go back to the garage.

44
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:36,446
You might be depressed if you go there.

45
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:40,766
I don't dare to let you stay alone at this time.

46
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,486
I won't leave you.

47
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:06,566
Kla.

48
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,126
If we want to build a family,

49
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:13,726
you have to control your emotions.

50
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:16,246
You can't use your emotions to handle problems.

51
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:21,449
Please don't blow a fuse like today again.

52
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,926
I don't want to see you die in front of my eyes.

53
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:26,526
Your life is more valuable than mine.

54
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,566
Listen.

55
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:34,486
My life will only be valuable

56
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:38,206
when you're here with me.

57
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,206
The three of us will get to be together.

58
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:49,606
How could I leave you and our child?

59
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,326
If we didn't have the child,

60
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:00,686
can I still hold you back?

61
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:07,246
You wouldn't do everything to bring us back together, right?

62
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:09,894
Why did you think like that?

63
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:14,726
You said your feelings had long gone.

64
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,766
So, I was being naive

65
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:20,286
to use our child to keep you back.

66
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:23,206
Khim.

67
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,526
Don't be stupid.

68
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:28,086
You're my whole world.

69
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,646
You're my home.

70
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,366
How could I let go of your hand?

71
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:28,246
- Dad. - You always ask for trouble.

72
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:31,486
The prison might be suitable for someone like you.

73
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:40,566
(No, don't take Nate away.)

74
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:42,766
(He's still alive, but I don't think he can survive.)

75
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,726
(Then, leave him here.)

76
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:46,406
(You can't make Kla)

77
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:48,486
(get into trouble because of you.)

78
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:50,886
Is anyone here?

79
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,566
Help.

80
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:57,046
I couldn't protect Nate.

81
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:02,206
I'm sorry.

82
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:15,206
I'll keep my eyes on you with my phone.

83
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:17,126
If you want me to be your important person,

84
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:19,886
don't turn off the camera.

85
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:22,286
Your friend must have known

86
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:24,166
that you would get framed,

87
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:26,326
so he prepared the evidence.

88
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,606
How did you have it?

89
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:42,086
Do you want it?

90
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:46,255
If you want it, kneel in front of me here

91
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:48,366
and ask for my forgiveness.

92
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:53,886
- Dad. - Do you want this case to end?

93
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:55,726
If you want the case to end,

94
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,366
kneel in front of me.

95
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,766
Here.

96
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:05,046
How could you feel nothing from seeing people die?

97
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:07,206
Even if he couldn't survive,

98
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:10,046
if this clip can help him not die for nothing,

99
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,846
how could you dare to use his life to negotiate?

100
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:16,366
I'm curious. Between your pride

101
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:17,886
and your friend,

102
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:19,326
what would you choose?

103
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:20,846
Why did you do this?

104
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:22,486
Do you dare?

105
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:27,286
If you don't dare, you love your pride more than him.

106
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,606
You can't love anyone.

107
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:31,886
How is this related, Dad?

108
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:33,166
It's related.

109
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:35,646
If it's something more important than this,

110
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:37,126
someone like him

111
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:39,413
would never sacrifice himself for anything.

112
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,366
Arrogant.

113
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:42,846
I'll throw it away.

114
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,846
Darn it.

115
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:51,926
You can't even throw your own pride away.

116
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:53,526
Didn't you want to see me in prison?

117
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,286
I'm right in front of you.

118
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:56,686
Do you remember

119
00:11:58,206 --> 00:11:59,686
what you had said?

120
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:03,206
People can die three times.

121
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,350
Are you prepared to die?

122
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:15,326
Because your life right now, it's no different if you're alive or dead.

123
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:18,806
You're hiding the evidence.

124
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:20,726
You aren't any different from a murderer.

125
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,206
But you wronged me first.

126
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,526
That's not true.

127
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:25,166
Kla didn't do it.

128
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,006
He stole our hotel.

129
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:28,706
He made me get abandoned.

130
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:30,846
I couldn't face anyone.

131
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,006
I'll never beg for forgiveness from a narrow-minded man like you.

132
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:39,279
Even for someone trashy like Khem,

133
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:41,326
he still has more worth than you.

134
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:48,726
I gave you a chance.

135
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:51,326
You didn't take it.

136
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,526
We really can't stay in the same world.

137
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,246
Don't play with someone else's life.

138
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:01,886
I didn't play anything. I'm serious.

139
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:22,806
Dad, you thought winning is more important than someone's life.

140
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:26,686
Do you have anything left that I could respect you?

141
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,606
I already gave him a chance.

142
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:32,166
He chose to ask for trouble.

143
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,046
I can't help it.

144
00:14:06,486 --> 00:14:07,686
Kla.

145
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:11,806
Kla.

146
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:23,966
Kla.

147
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,926
(For sale, for rent. Please contact...)

148
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,366
Kla is with me.

149
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:24,371
I picked him up last night.

150
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:25,606
That's a relief.

151
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:27,126
I couldn't contact him.

152
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:29,136
Kla went to Ms. Asia's house last night.

153
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:30,406
They almost killed each other.

154
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:31,926
Keep your eyes on him.

155
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:33,566
Don't let him hurt anyone again.

156
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,166
Uncle,

157
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:42,366
Kla has disappeared.

158
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:44,206
(He wants to go all-in again.)

159
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:59,926
(When I was a mechanic, I thought the world was unfair.)

160
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,086
(The rich get richer.)

161
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:04,206
(Humans have never been equal.)

162
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:18,806
(I developed the Arsa app,)

163
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:21,646
(but we couldn't get it rolling in the end.)

164
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:26,486
(Someone always tries to take us down.)

165
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:28,326
(I can't change the world.)

166
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:33,926
(Last night, you probably saw)

167
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,046
(how worthless my life is.)

168
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:38,326
(No one wants to see dirt like me)

169
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:40,966
(showing my face in front of someone like them.)

170
00:16:43,364 --> 00:16:44,526
(When I struggled,)

171
00:16:44,726 --> 00:16:46,486
(everyone else gradually left me.)

172
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:49,766
(If I knew my place and continued to work as a mechanic,)

173
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,366
(my life would be easier.)

174
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,766
(The fact that you aren't pregnant now)

175
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:55,846
(might be a blessing for our child.)

176
00:16:56,526 --> 00:16:58,406
(Because if I continue to fight,)

177
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:01,046
(I might not have my life left to live.)

178
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:08,054
Kla, answer it.

179
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:20,886
(You have to come to terms with this if you love me.)

180
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:23,366
(We might only be able to come this far.)

181
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,406
(Khim, you're one of the few nice things in my life.)

182
00:17:32,246 --> 00:17:34,246
(I believe everything won't be over like this.)

183
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:38,046
(I don't want it to be like that,)

184
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:41,086
(but I can't stay still like this and get beaten up one-sidedly.)

185
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:45,886
(If it doesn't end well again, don't blame yourself.)

186
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:52,686
(Don't live to wait for me.)

187
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:56,606
(Your life is far more valuable than being with a man like me.)

188
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:26,486
Why did you come here?

189
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:28,326
I have something to ask of you.

190
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:31,086
Are you here to beg for your son's life?

191
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:34,166
Can you think of him as your other son?

192
00:18:37,886 --> 00:18:40,286
Since I gave Kla to you,

193
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:44,126
I thought you would love him like your child.

194
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:47,486
But I've never thought it would be like this.

195
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:50,366
Maybe, it's my fault

196
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:52,726
for not making everything obvious.

197
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:54,646
Didn't you ever feel that something is wrong?

198
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:56,726
Why was his body tissue

199
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:58,446
compatible with your son?

200
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:01,086
Because they're brothers with the same father.

201
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,875
(If you're here to ask me to be grateful for this...)

202
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:17,286
(I didn't come here to do that.)

203
00:19:18,638 --> 00:19:20,486
(I only want you to be fair to him.)

204
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:24,806
(Go and ask him what he did to me last night.)

205
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,583
He being ungrateful like that,

206
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,046
it might be because

207
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:30,086
I didn't tell him the whole truth.

208
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:33,606
Three years ago, I found this business card

209
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:35,686
in my wife's document box.

210
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:39,006
I didn't think of it much.

211
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:43,006
But I found my wife's message.

212
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,126
It said we should call this person.

213
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:51,526
So, I called the number on the card.

214
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,686
And I learned

215
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:56,566
that this person is an obstetrician.

216
00:19:56,948 --> 00:19:58,926
I tried to find out more about her.

217
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:01,606
I learned that she was in prison

218
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,406
over 10 years ago

219
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,086
(because of illegal surrogacy.)

220
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:08,246
(That's why I asked you)

221
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:10,966
(if you have ever wondered)

222
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:13,846
(why those two brothers)

223
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:16,966
(have tissue compatibility.)

224
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,606
(Your husband knew about this better than anyone.)

225
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,046
(That's why he wrote a will for Kla)

226
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:27,086
(and left some for Rakroy)

227
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:28,886
- (as hush money.) - (Stop.)

228
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:30,766
(Stop. That's not true.)

229
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,606
(It's the truth.)

230
00:20:40,787 --> 00:20:42,206
(You and your husband)

231
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:44,766
(had wanted another child)

232
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:47,606
(to treat your first son's blood disease, right?)

233
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,606
(He asked that obstetrician)

234
00:20:50,086 --> 00:20:51,406
(to perform in-vitro fertilization)

235
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:54,486
(and hired my wife to be a surrogate mother.)

236
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:56,366
This means...

237
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:57,966
Kaokla's mother

238
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,126
isn't your husband's lover as we initially thought.

239
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:03,046
That's not true.

240
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:05,246
I also didn't know about this.

241
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:08,406
I always thought that Kla

242
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:11,006
was her illegitimate child

243
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:13,126
with your husband.

244
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:15,566
Kaokla

245
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:18,526
is your real son.

246
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:32,846
Is this true?

247
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,766
Yes.

248
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,726
She's your real mother.

249
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:39,446
(Don't do anything that you'll regret later.)

250
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,318
(Understand? If you have a problem,)

251
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:44,046
(we can solve it together.)

252
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:07,686
(He hates me.)

253
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:11,886
(If he knows the truth that I'm his mother,)

254
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,366
(there's no way he would accept me.)

255
00:22:15,406 --> 00:22:16,886
If you can't accept it,

256
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,566
you don't have to accept him as your son.

257
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,286
But I beg you,

258
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,206
please let him go.

259
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,718
I don't want you to hate him

260
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:27,966
because he's a bastard child.

261
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:30,622
You don't have to treat him as your son.

262
00:22:30,907 --> 00:22:33,286
I know that love

263
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:35,686
can't be controlled.

264
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:48,926
You betrayed me.

265
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:54,926
How could you do something thoughtless like this?

266
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,686
It's because of you. It's your fault.

267
00:22:58,047 --> 00:22:59,806
The sin fell onto me.

268
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:02,446
Do you hate me that much?

269
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:04,706
How could you do this?

270
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:07,966
Darn it.

271
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:43,046
How could I face him now?

272
00:23:53,926 --> 00:23:55,606
Do you know

273
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,526
what I've done?

274
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,686
If I knew,

275
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:09,966
I wouldn't do this.

276
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:16,486
No parents want to kill their own child.

277
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,246
Someone gave us this evidence.

278
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:06,806
We might learn where Mr. Khem was before his death

279
00:26:07,157 --> 00:26:09,566
and what happened to Mr. Khem and Mr. Nate.

280
00:26:24,934 --> 00:26:26,166
What do you want?

281
00:26:26,797 --> 00:26:29,046
I would like to turn myself in for Mr. Khemmarat's case.

282
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,166
I was the one who framed Mr. Carl.

283
00:26:32,846 --> 00:26:34,966
Did Dad really return the evidence?

284
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,320
Mr. Chartchai has also turned himself in?

285
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:42,806
(Yes. The police will issue a warrant for Ms. Asia tomorrow.)

286
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:46,326
Thank you so much.

287
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,126
The police will issue a warrant for Ms. Asia tomorrow.

288
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:53,646
Kla is alright now.

289
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:54,806
Yes.

290
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:57,366
But I don't know where he is.

291
00:26:57,886 --> 00:26:59,766
Try to call him again.

292
00:27:41,086 --> 00:27:42,326
(Hello.)

293
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:45,366
I got this number from Mr. Carl's phone.

294
00:27:46,326 --> 00:27:48,806
Yes. You're speaking with his wife.

295
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:54,686
What happened, Khim?

296
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:02,886
Khim.

297
00:28:07,496 --> 00:28:09,206
I don't understand.

298
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:14,926
Everything is getting better.

299
00:28:18,145 --> 00:28:19,526
Why did this have to happen?

300
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:20,886
Khim.

301
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:25,646
What happened, Khim?

302
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:44,486
No one had seen Mr. Carl sailing his boat when the storm was coming.

303
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:46,846
I thought he was in his accommodation.

304
00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:49,117
We were diving to find his body.

305
00:28:49,332 --> 00:28:52,086
But the weather was bad, so I had to bring my team back.

306
00:28:52,246 --> 00:28:54,166
How many hours has it been?

307
00:28:54,845 --> 00:28:56,566
Does he have a chance to survive?

308
00:28:56,686 --> 00:28:59,046
I don't think he has a high chance with this strong wave.

309
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:01,926
He probably went out while knowing that.

310
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:04,806
What can we do?

311
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,606
I was afraid that he won't survive if we let him be by himself.

312
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:20,846
Please wait for a moment.

313
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,926
Lady, the police would like to see you.

314
00:29:32,783 --> 00:29:33,859
Lady...

315
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:49,206
She's dead.

316
00:31:01,646 --> 00:31:03,806
Our relationship has always been hard.

317
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:09,616
But why is it so easy for us to get separated?

318
00:31:12,811 --> 00:31:15,686
Will we really not see each other anymore?

319
00:31:31,366 --> 00:31:33,526
If I knew I only had this much time,

320
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:39,326
I would stay with him more than this.

321
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:51,286
It's alright, Khim.

322
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:54,183
We'll try to find him.

323
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:01,206
I wish I could see his face for at least one last time.

324
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,046
(You said you wouldn't do anything that makes you regret it.)

325
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:49,646
(If you do this,)

326
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,406
(can you really die peacefully?)

327
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:55,806
(Heaven sent you to be my son.)

328
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,806
(Don't make me feel disappointed that I couldn't protect you.)

329
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:50,246
Khim, the rescue team has stopped to find him.

330
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:51,686
It's been several days.

331
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:53,366
We're unlucky.

332
00:34:57,518 --> 00:34:58,886
Khim, please be strong.

333
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:01,141
Everyone had done their best.

334
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,166
We've searched all the islands around here.

335
00:35:05,366 --> 00:35:06,726
We've searched everywhere

336
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:10,486
including the beach that might bury Kla's body.

337
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:17,646
We should go back, Khim.

338
00:35:19,438 --> 00:35:21,926
No. Even if we can't find him,

339
00:35:24,006 --> 00:35:25,686
I can't leave him here.

340
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:27,966
It's too cruel.

341
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,606
Khim.

342
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:39,366
Can you please come back?

343
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,806
Don't we still love each other?

344
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:44,421
Why did you have to leave me?

345
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:54,246
How do you want me to live? It's already too painful for me.

346
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:44,974
He's back for this?

347
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:57,766
Kla.

348
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,270
Kla.

349
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:06,326
Kla, are you here?

350
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:11,166
Kla.

351
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:19,886
Kla.

352
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:24,501
Kla.

353
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:28,166
Khim wouldn't go back. She said she wanted to find Kaokla.

354
00:37:29,174 --> 00:37:32,166
We can't underestimate a woman's intuition.

355
00:37:32,526 --> 00:37:34,486
We should trust Khim for one last time.

356
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:16,326
Are you alright?

357
00:38:16,765 --> 00:38:17,941
I'm alright.

358
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,406
Kla.

359
00:38:45,922 --> 00:38:47,046
Kla.

360
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,646
Kla.

361
00:38:52,884 --> 00:38:54,286
This isn't a dream?

362
00:38:55,086 --> 00:38:56,566
Kla, you're not dead.

363
00:38:57,195 --> 00:38:58,366
I almost died.

364
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:03,406
Kla. Kla.

365
00:39:03,853 --> 00:39:06,686
You have to be alright. I'm here to save you.

366
00:39:08,285 --> 00:39:09,606
You're alright.

367
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:14,926
I'm already here.

368
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,846
I'll help you.

369
00:39:20,406 --> 00:39:21,726
Please endure it for a bit more.

370
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,526
They're coming to help you.

371
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:26,486
But I think I won't survive.

372
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:34,166
Kla.

373
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:35,766
Kla.

374
00:39:36,117 --> 00:39:37,117
Kla.

375
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,366
Kla.

376
00:39:44,206 --> 00:39:45,286
Kla.

377
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:47,726
I'm here.

378
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:49,766
I won't let anything happen to you.

379
00:39:50,183 --> 00:39:52,183
Where does it hurt? Tell me.

380
00:39:53,686 --> 00:39:56,606
My boat sank and I was drowning.

381
00:39:57,557 --> 00:39:59,766
When I woke up, the wave had carried me to this coast.

382
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,726
I tried to go back.

383
00:40:03,326 --> 00:40:05,806
But I couldn't. It's too painful.

384
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:08,366
You knew there was a storm.

385
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:10,326
Why did you come out?

386
00:40:12,045 --> 00:40:13,246
I wanted to prove

387
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:16,006
whether the world wants me alive or dead.

388
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:19,838
Every time I defy my fate,

389
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:21,806
every time I put up a fight,

390
00:40:22,302 --> 00:40:24,606
Heaven always punishes me.

391
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:28,286
I wanted to let nature decide my fate

392
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:31,453
to see if my life would be better.

393
00:40:35,544 --> 00:40:36,774
And how was it?

394
00:40:39,357 --> 00:40:40,726
It made me

395
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:42,966
love my life even more.

396
00:40:48,101 --> 00:40:50,726
Kla, on that lantern,

397
00:40:52,646 --> 00:40:54,246
didn't you tell Khem

398
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:56,886
that you would make his dream come true.

399
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:59,886
You promised Khem that

400
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:02,686
every time Khem's mom opens her fridge,

401
00:41:02,862 --> 00:41:04,286
there'll always be something in there.

402
00:41:06,126 --> 00:41:07,486
You already promised him

403
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:10,966
that you would fill up her fridge every time she opens it,

404
00:41:11,173 --> 00:41:12,646
just like when he was alive.

405
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:15,781
That dream was really silly.

406
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,142
Even for something that small,

407
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:21,854
Khem couldn't even do it himself.

408
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:28,446
That's why

409
00:41:29,157 --> 00:41:31,806
I always fall in love with you again and again.

410
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:41,286
Kla.

411
00:41:43,646 --> 00:41:44,966
You have to be alive

412
00:41:45,326 --> 00:41:49,526
to make everyone's little dreams come true as you've dreamed for.

413
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,166
Your life is for helping others.

414
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:58,446
So, your life has a lot of meaning.

415
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:00,926
You can't die.

416
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:06,286
Because I also want to make you do something silly for me.

417
00:42:07,181 --> 00:42:08,446
How silly is it?

418
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:18,326
If you want to know,

419
00:42:20,086 --> 00:42:22,246
you have to stay alive to find that answer yourself.

420
00:42:34,646 --> 00:42:36,486
Kla's injury

421
00:42:36,725 --> 00:42:38,446
might be difficult to be healed.

422
00:42:38,646 --> 00:42:42,246
So, I want him to get his treatment here before he goes back.

423
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:46,246
Are you sure you can stay here?

424
00:42:53,045 --> 00:42:54,726
You don't have to be worried.

425
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:57,746
I'll take great care of Kla.

426
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,366
Seeing him alive

427
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:06,046
is already enough for me.

428
00:43:14,406 --> 00:43:16,046
I'll leave him to you.

429
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Yes.

430
00:43:30,382 --> 00:43:33,126
(Asia Raman committed suicide to escape her crimes in Thailand.)

431
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:12,206
Prompt.

432
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:14,046
Prompt.

433
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:17,326
Why is he so drunk? Prompt, let's go home.

434
00:44:18,506 --> 00:44:20,766
- Get up. - Where is my home?

435
00:44:23,882 --> 00:44:25,326
This way, Sir.

436
00:44:27,253 --> 00:44:29,366
Thank you. I'll handle it myself.

437
00:44:30,726 --> 00:44:31,873
Let me do it.

438
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:33,246
How did you come here?

439
00:44:33,686 --> 00:44:35,166
Mr. Prompt usually comes here.

440
00:44:35,493 --> 00:44:37,366
The staff always calls me.

441
00:44:37,956 --> 00:44:39,286
I'll handle this.

442
00:44:42,934 --> 00:44:44,086
Let's go.

443
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:46,606
No. Leave me alone.

444
00:44:48,259 --> 00:44:50,006
Mr. Prompt, let's go.

445
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:53,886
Let's go.

446
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,966
I told the employees to wash Mr. Prompt's clothes.

447
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:20,766
They're all in here.

448
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,886
So, Prompt moved to live here?

449
00:45:30,013 --> 00:45:33,126
I picked up Mr. Prompt from the store and drove him here.

450
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:37,526
Mr. Prompt didn't move anywhere. He has nowhere to go.

451
00:45:40,406 --> 00:45:41,886
What happened to him?

452
00:45:42,742 --> 00:45:44,486
Why has he become like this?

453
00:45:45,806 --> 00:45:47,526
He invested his money in his friend.

454
00:45:47,934 --> 00:45:50,126
He got tricked, losing all of his money.

455
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:52,357
Mom took all the money back as she was afraid

456
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:53,806
he would throw it all away.

457
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:55,906
As for his other friends,

458
00:45:56,214 --> 00:45:57,806
they all left him

459
00:45:58,309 --> 00:45:59,966
as they're afraid he'll borrow their money.

460
00:46:04,854 --> 00:46:07,446
This hotel was built by Mr. Songbun.

461
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:11,086
But it's already old.

462
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:13,286
It's time for a renovation.

463
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:17,246
Mr. Sin gave this place as your inheritance.

464
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,806
You can do whatever you want with it.

465
00:46:22,535 --> 00:46:24,886
From now on, Mr. Sin will retire from his company.

466
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:27,966
If Mr. Prompt

467
00:46:29,526 --> 00:46:31,606
wants to prove himself to his mom,

468
00:46:32,717 --> 00:46:35,006
I think he should start from here.

469
00:46:41,846 --> 00:46:43,846
Will you help us with that?

470
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,766
I don't think Mr. Prompt will like it if he sees me here.

471
00:47:00,925 --> 00:47:05,054
I can only look after him from afar like what I'm doing right now.

472
00:47:13,013 --> 00:47:15,126
It's dangerous. You can get hurt.

473
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:21,086
Please stop, Ms. Prim.

474
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:44,206
Although I didn't have a chance to raise her

475
00:47:44,925 --> 00:47:46,925
because I have to look after you,

476
00:47:47,886 --> 00:47:49,166
I'll be proud

477
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:51,526
if my daughter can grow up

478
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:53,486
and be like you.

479
00:47:59,101 --> 00:48:01,366
How can you be so nice to us?

480
00:48:05,054 --> 00:48:06,926
For a non-family member like me,

481
00:48:08,526 --> 00:48:10,286
I can only do this.

482
00:48:19,486 --> 00:48:21,246
When I was in the hospital,

483
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:24,526
you bought this new phone for me.

484
00:48:26,046 --> 00:48:29,046
I used a gaming app on the phone to chat with my daughter.

485
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:33,606
She doesn't know who I am.

486
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:37,286
We secretly met in the game. When I was sick,

487
00:48:37,798 --> 00:48:40,086
you played the game on my phone

488
00:48:40,366 --> 00:48:42,026
with my daughter for me.

489
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:44,126
You took care of my family for me.

490
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:46,926
I only did the same thing for you.

491
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:51,526
If my dad was still here,

492
00:48:53,686 --> 00:48:55,486
he would be nice like you, wouldn't he?

493
00:48:57,206 --> 00:49:00,126
I'll wait for the day you and Mr. Prompt have succeeded.

494
00:49:03,406 --> 00:49:05,326
Please don't abandon each other.

495
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:01,006
Good morning.

496
00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:11,286
It's not morning. The day is almost over.

497
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:13,238
I slept for a whole day?

498
00:51:13,669 --> 00:51:15,006
Not just a day.

499
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:18,046
You slept for four whole days.

500
00:51:18,957 --> 00:51:22,046
The doctor said your body was extremely tired.

501
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:25,286
How do you feel? Do you feel better?

502
00:51:27,526 --> 00:51:28,726
It still hurts.

503
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,846
I think I need you as my cane.

504
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:35,006
Sure.

505
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:39,726
Let me charge my battery.

506
00:51:46,246 --> 00:51:47,846
This situation seems so familiar.

507
00:51:48,165 --> 00:51:49,485
I must be dreaming.

508
00:51:50,295 --> 00:51:51,966
I haven't fully woken up, have I?

509
00:52:04,126 --> 00:52:05,606
Do you still think you're dreaming?

510
00:52:06,013 --> 00:52:08,733
Everything was too good when I woke up.

511
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,286
If you didn't wake up,

512
00:52:13,844 --> 00:52:15,286
you would regret it

513
00:52:16,646 --> 00:52:19,286
because you didn't get to see that my dad helped you.

514
00:52:25,606 --> 00:52:27,126
I'm really not dreaming.

515
00:52:31,831 --> 00:52:33,646
My dad just wanted to test you.

516
00:52:34,806 --> 00:52:37,686
In the end, he sent all the evidence to the police.

517
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,197
Although you can't change the world,

518
00:52:41,494 --> 00:52:42,966
at least,

519
00:52:43,486 --> 00:52:44,966
you can change my dad.

520
00:52:46,141 --> 00:52:47,326
That's more than a dream.

521
00:52:47,926 --> 00:52:49,686
It's like I got reborn again.

522
00:52:50,973 --> 00:52:52,366
If that's so...

523
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:56,046
Happy birthday.

524
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:00,166
Today

525
00:53:00,766 --> 00:53:02,526
will be the start of your new life.

526
00:53:03,629 --> 00:53:04,886
All those bad things,

527
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,726
you should leave them all in the past.

528
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:10,646
We'll start our new lives again.

529
00:53:28,277 --> 00:53:29,946
What happened to her?

530
00:53:43,685 --> 00:53:45,365
Your mother

531
00:53:45,865 --> 00:53:48,366
committed suicide on the day you came here.

532
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,366
Kla.

533
00:53:58,646 --> 00:54:00,286
Please forgive her.

534
00:54:01,573 --> 00:54:03,806
She gave all the evidence to the police.

535
00:54:04,646 --> 00:54:05,992
She confessed to her crime.

536
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:07,166
And,

537
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:09,206
she drank poison.

538
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:11,846
She couldn't accept that she had a son like me.

539
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,606
It's the same for me.

540
00:54:15,822 --> 00:54:18,606
I also couldn't put my mom in jail.

541
00:54:55,806 --> 00:54:57,406
Our lives aren't much.

542
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,926
We can't take anything with us in the end.

543
00:55:01,317 --> 00:55:04,126
As your legal last descendant,

544
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,726
I'll establish a foundation for you.

545
00:55:08,846 --> 00:55:10,406
I'll give all the inheritance

546
00:55:12,086 --> 00:55:14,006
to the charity.

547
00:55:14,966 --> 00:55:16,406
This might be the only thing

548
00:55:16,886 --> 00:55:18,387
that I could make you proud

549
00:55:18,509 --> 00:55:20,006
as your son.

550
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:24,286
Thank you for giving me my life.

551
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:28,524
I'll take care of it.

552
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:33,326
I promise I'll live my life as worthwhile as possible

553
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:36,310
until my last breath.

554
00:55:58,382 --> 00:56:00,566
This family is really pitiful.

555
00:56:05,526 --> 00:56:07,806
I believe that I'm a lot more fortunate than them.

556
00:56:21,206 --> 00:56:23,886
I'll use Carl Raman as my name to remind myself.

557
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:28,206
So, I wouldn't get into trouble because of inheritance.

558
00:56:50,486 --> 00:56:51,646
You should go in.

559
00:56:52,366 --> 00:56:53,926
There's nothing scary.

560
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,526
(No matter how rich or poor we are,)

561
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:07,566
(everyone wants happiness.)

562
00:57:08,597 --> 00:57:10,046
(But for someone,)

563
00:57:10,654 --> 00:57:12,966
(happiness isn't that easy to get.)

564
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:15,926
(Like in this house,)

565
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:19,086
(there has never been a sound of piano for a long time.)

566
00:57:21,526 --> 00:57:26,366
(Technology might make our life easier, but not love.)

567
00:57:27,606 --> 00:57:29,046
(When the world revolves quicker,)

568
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:32,166
(it's easy to see each other. But it's difficult to feel connected.)

569
00:57:33,973 --> 00:57:36,966
(We need the courage to go through trial and error.)

570
00:57:37,598 --> 00:57:40,006
(We must have the courage to be disappointed)

571
00:57:40,949 --> 00:57:43,766
(because trust can't be created within a few days.)

572
00:57:45,168 --> 00:57:46,286
(Just like us.)

573
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:50,246
I couldn't believe I would have a day like today,

574
00:57:51,917 --> 00:57:53,286
the day I can sit here.

575
00:57:56,475 --> 00:57:59,046
I already told you.

576
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:01,486
If you do nice things without asking for anything in return,

577
00:58:01,965 --> 00:58:04,046
your kind deeds will come back to you one day.

578
00:58:04,573 --> 00:58:06,366
If we kill each other this time,

579
00:58:07,766 --> 00:58:09,886
we might see each other again in our next lives.

580
00:58:10,326 --> 00:58:12,446
Hey, if that's the case,

581
00:58:13,046 --> 00:58:14,766
we aren't soulmates.

582
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:16,566
How could we not be soulmates?

583
00:58:17,046 --> 00:58:19,006
I think we're already true lovers.

584
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:22,486
The world will make us see each other when we have problems.

585
00:58:23,926 --> 00:58:25,206
When I was abandoned,

586
00:58:25,671 --> 00:58:27,686
you're the one who pulled me back.

587
00:58:29,246 --> 00:58:30,446
It's the same this time.

588
00:58:31,126 --> 00:58:33,326
When I was in darkness and my future was bleak,

589
00:58:34,174 --> 00:58:36,174
you're the one who supported me.

590
00:58:36,525 --> 00:58:37,726
Of course.

591
00:58:38,486 --> 00:58:39,566
Because

592
00:58:40,271 --> 00:58:43,166
I'm your reserve battery.

593
00:58:50,797 --> 00:58:52,766
Do you remember that...

594
00:58:58,886 --> 00:59:01,766
I want to introduce Kla to you officially.

595
00:59:02,366 --> 00:59:04,646
Just like when people introduce their lovers to their family,

596
00:59:05,486 --> 00:59:07,486
I want to have this moment with you.

597
00:59:08,006 --> 00:59:11,806
So, I invited Kla to have dinner with us.

598
00:59:31,789 --> 00:59:33,526
Do you know how to act like other couples?

599
00:59:34,686 --> 00:59:36,486
Think about our culture and tradition.

600
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,326
We're getting back to date each other again.

601
00:59:43,269 --> 00:59:45,269
We'll do everything right this time.

602
00:59:47,486 --> 00:59:48,926
You only come up with this now?

603
00:59:50,574 --> 00:59:52,926
If we date each other again,

604
00:59:53,645 --> 00:59:55,086
do you have any problems?

605
00:59:55,423 --> 00:59:57,466
Have I ever been able to stop you?

606
00:59:58,966 --> 01:00:00,246
Do what you want.

607
01:00:00,686 --> 01:00:01,846
Eat what you want.

608
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:03,566
And just go back if you're done.

609
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:07,926
I'm sorry for how I've offended you.

610
01:00:10,646 --> 01:00:12,566
I know that I have done a lot of things to you.

611
01:00:13,669 --> 01:00:15,726
You still returned Khem's evidence to us

612
01:00:16,926 --> 01:00:19,526
even though you could still try to teach me a lesson.

613
01:00:21,749 --> 01:00:23,686
If you can cast off your pride,

614
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:25,854
I don't know why I should keep it.

615
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:35,686
I want you to forgive me.

616
01:00:44,013 --> 01:00:45,606
Please give Saikhim to me.

617
01:00:48,766 --> 01:00:50,566
I'll be worthy of Khim.

618
01:00:51,126 --> 01:00:53,966
I'll never make you feel like I'm taking your daughter away from you.

619
01:00:54,829 --> 01:00:56,726
I want to start again with Khim.

620
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:58,886
I don't know whether you would mind it or not.

621
01:01:05,006 --> 01:01:06,406
I hope you can do as you said.

622
01:01:08,606 --> 01:01:10,086
Don't make me feel ashamed again.

623
01:01:16,426 --> 01:01:17,526
What does that mean?

624
01:01:24,886 --> 01:01:26,366
He allows it.

625
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:31,846
But if he's hungry for food, he might change his mind.

626
01:02:44,768 --> 01:02:47,286
- This is... - Our wedding.

627
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:53,686
You finally have someone who you can live your life with.

628
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:58,046
Welcome back to our family again, Khim.

629
01:03:00,126 --> 01:03:01,406
I'm glad

630
01:03:01,806 --> 01:03:03,806
that we got you as our daughter-in-law again.

631
01:03:08,841 --> 01:03:10,366
Thank you.

632
01:03:10,669 --> 01:03:13,866
I've never thought I would have another wedding.

633
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:17,566
You can't elope again.

634
01:03:19,606 --> 01:03:22,206
You have your bridesmaid this time.

635
01:03:25,061 --> 01:03:26,486
But there's more.

636
01:03:27,877 --> 01:03:29,726
There's another person who will surprise you.

637
01:03:52,806 --> 01:03:56,389
And now, it's time for the most important moment of this event.

638
01:03:56,558 --> 01:03:58,286
I would like the groom

639
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,246
to put in on

640
01:04:02,366 --> 01:04:03,966
the bride.

641
01:04:08,357 --> 01:04:10,046
No. Wait.

642
01:04:10,165 --> 01:04:12,926
- Mom? - How could you not wait for me?

643
01:04:15,246 --> 01:04:16,646
Hello, everyone.

644
01:04:16,926 --> 01:04:18,326
I'm Sajee.

645
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:21,406
You could say I'm the godmother of the groom and the bride

646
01:04:21,598 --> 01:04:23,598
because I was the first one

647
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:25,326
who welcomed this couple to my home

648
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:27,046
when they eloped.

649
01:04:27,126 --> 01:04:28,246
Mom.

650
01:04:29,637 --> 01:04:32,246
And this is Mr. Thaenthai.

651
01:04:32,356 --> 01:04:35,606
- He's my future son-in-law. - Mom.

652
01:04:35,766 --> 01:04:36,766
I know that.

653
01:04:36,902 --> 01:04:40,726
As for my real boyfriend, he's working today.

654
01:04:41,526 --> 01:04:44,366
Okay. We can start the wedding now.

655
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:53,586
(Now, the one who makes my heart skip a beat)

656
01:04:54,116 --> 01:04:56,726
(and always takes my breath away)

657
01:04:57,814 --> 01:04:59,086
(is you)

658
01:05:00,717 --> 01:05:03,326
(The one who reads my mind even before I could)

659
01:05:04,262 --> 01:05:05,726
(is you.)

660
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:22,086
(No matter how many times I have to die and be reborn,)

661
01:05:23,317 --> 01:05:24,886
(the one I want to meet)

662
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,766
(is you.)

663
01:05:27,366 --> 01:05:30,926
(The reason for us two to continue living from now on)

664
01:05:32,301 --> 01:05:33,646
(is you.)

665
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:44,406
I'm confident that those two

666
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:48,246
will love and care about each other more than before.

667
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:51,046
Saikhim is the most valuable thing in my life.

668
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:54,566
(If someone can prove to me that)

669
01:05:55,134 --> 01:05:59,206
(he can love and take care of Saikhim for the rest of his life,)

670
01:05:59,526 --> 01:06:01,326
(I might love him)

671
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:03,486
(as you love him.)

672
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:05,566
Love is the most unstable

673
01:06:05,886 --> 01:06:07,606
when there's doubt.

674
01:06:08,556 --> 01:06:12,686
(Love will be the most stable and strongest when there's trust.)

675
01:06:13,566 --> 01:06:15,726
No matter what will happen from now on,

676
01:06:16,399 --> 01:06:18,126
I hope you'll trust each other.

677
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:20,606
We won't let go of each other's hands again.

678
01:06:23,758 --> 01:06:26,086
I really have to give it up to Saikhim

679
01:06:26,254 --> 01:06:27,646
for this wedding

680
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:31,486
because she didn't only just choose the best thing for her,

681
01:06:31,686 --> 01:06:33,166
(but she also)

682
01:06:33,446 --> 01:06:35,966
(drag out the best part)

683
01:06:36,638 --> 01:06:37,846
(out of this man.)

684
01:06:38,341 --> 01:06:40,246
When we can make someone

685
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:42,926
want to be a better person,

686
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:44,766
that's true love.

687
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:47,846
(She made this friend of hers)

688
01:06:48,478 --> 01:06:50,126
(stop being jealous)

689
01:06:50,566 --> 01:06:53,966
(because she knows she has worked hard to gain this.)

690
01:06:58,046 --> 01:07:00,966
Since when did those two date each other?

691
01:07:01,453 --> 01:07:02,526
I'm also curious.

692
01:07:04,573 --> 01:07:06,286
Someone is looking at us.

693
01:07:11,517 --> 01:07:12,806
Don't be sad.

694
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:15,486
Because the good things between us

695
01:07:16,262 --> 01:07:17,926
all happened because of you.

696
01:07:20,646 --> 01:07:21,926
So,

697
01:07:22,966 --> 01:07:25,246
do you still want to date a silly man like me?

698
01:07:28,725 --> 01:07:31,206
There's no perfection in love.

699
01:07:31,502 --> 01:07:34,126
You don't have to be cool all the time.

700
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,006
No matter how suck I am,

701
01:07:40,262 --> 01:07:41,526
at least

702
01:07:42,918 --> 01:07:45,286
I still want you to be proud of me.

703
01:07:53,606 --> 01:07:55,006
We can't let them beat us.

704
01:08:14,315 --> 01:08:15,766
I almost cry from reading this.

705
01:08:16,758 --> 01:08:19,926
Is it that touching? Let me see what Thaen wrote.

706
01:08:21,622 --> 01:08:24,366
He sent his wedding invitation to you.

707
01:08:24,496 --> 01:08:25,496
Really?

708
01:08:26,566 --> 01:08:29,286
Hey, let me see.

709
01:08:33,846 --> 01:08:35,166
I thought it was true.

710
01:08:35,558 --> 01:08:36,606
Look closely.

711
01:08:36,893 --> 01:08:38,413
Look whose signature that's written with his.

712
01:08:42,126 --> 01:08:45,326
I'm happy that both of them can date each other.

713
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:52,006
A lot of good things happened tonight. We have to celebrate it.

714
01:08:52,438 --> 01:08:53,726
It'll be fun

715
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,470
if we can get drunk.

716
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:07,098
What's wrong, Khim?

717
01:09:07,229 --> 01:09:11,926
Well, here. There are a lot of flowers here.

718
01:09:13,118 --> 01:09:17,086
I'm allergic to flowers. The staff forgot about this.

719
01:09:17,463 --> 01:09:19,126
Didn't you stop being allergic to it?

720
01:09:21,606 --> 01:09:24,726
They should have asked me about these little details.

721
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:29,166
I have to note it.

722
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:33,446
Forget it, Khim.

723
01:09:34,321 --> 01:09:35,686
No.

724
01:09:36,023 --> 01:09:41,006
They should know about these details. Other people would be unhappy.

725
01:09:41,246 --> 01:09:42,366
Khim.

726
01:09:42,581 --> 01:09:44,566
They gave everything to you.

727
01:09:46,157 --> 01:09:48,766
I'll handle it. You should stay still.

728
01:09:56,269 --> 01:09:57,366
Here.

729
01:09:57,918 --> 01:09:59,206
There are no flowers anymore.

730
01:10:03,846 --> 01:10:04,846
Oh...

731
01:10:05,862 --> 01:10:08,006
This isn't cold anymore.

732
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,606
The champagne isn't cold anymore. It'll ruin the mood.

733
01:10:14,046 --> 01:10:15,046
This can't be good.

734
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:16,966
Are you at the office or what?

735
01:10:18,512 --> 01:10:21,686
If it's another couple, they would be so disappointed.

736
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:25,046
No one would care about that on their first night.

737
01:10:27,526 --> 01:10:32,326
If I didn't see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't know about this.

738
01:10:36,286 --> 01:10:38,726
You only have to pay attention to your husband today.

739
01:10:40,646 --> 01:10:45,046
Isn't it hot? I think it feels hot. Did they turn on the AC?

740
01:10:45,462 --> 01:10:47,086
Are you looking down on me?

741
01:10:47,774 --> 01:10:49,046
Am I not sexy?

742
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:53,966
The one who you should check is me.

743
01:10:55,165 --> 01:10:56,686
Let me note this for a bit.

744
01:11:00,949 --> 01:11:02,686
I'll be the one who assesses you

745
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:04,766
to see how many stars it would be tonight.

746
01:11:17,726 --> 01:11:21,166
Hey, are we here for our honeymoon?

747
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:24,366
Someone must have misunderstood something.

748
01:11:24,606 --> 01:11:28,406
Kloy is trying the new system of accommodations

749
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:32,206
letting all couples around the world unknowingly exchange their places.

750
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:34,766
Be careful.

751
01:11:38,221 --> 01:11:40,926
The honeymoon couple will only know their destination later.

752
01:11:41,243 --> 01:11:45,566
- Oh, and we... - There must be a mistake.

753
01:11:46,097 --> 01:11:49,086
Since we're already here,

754
01:11:50,122 --> 01:11:52,766
consider this as a practice for our real honeymoon.

755
01:11:53,405 --> 01:11:55,566
We'll go again next time.

756
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,926
Come here.

757
01:12:13,806 --> 01:12:16,846
And what should we do next?

758
01:12:21,006 --> 01:12:23,646
Kloy has probably noticed now. She shared the location.

759
01:12:44,701 --> 01:12:46,446
Madam Emery.

760
01:12:51,302 --> 01:12:53,302
Monsieur Anthony.

761
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:28,286
Kloy. So, what's the actual destination for my honeymoon?

762
01:13:28,486 --> 01:13:29,766
Why is it here?

763
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:32,686
We got sent to the island after we swapped places.

764
01:13:32,966 --> 01:13:34,766
Our luggage didn't come with us.

765
01:13:35,686 --> 01:13:37,606
What? It's already delivered?

766
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:39,526
To Paris?

767
01:13:41,285 --> 01:13:43,526
You only delivered our luggage, but not us?

768
01:13:44,446 --> 01:13:46,126
What kind of package is this?

769
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:48,166
Kloy...

770
01:13:52,245 --> 01:13:54,245
So, we have nowhere to go now.

771
01:13:54,605 --> 01:13:58,046
This is probably Kloy's prank to make us feel nostalgic.

772
01:14:06,222 --> 01:14:09,206
Consider this a change of scenery for us.

773
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:16,126
Then, how do we live? We don't have any clothes.

774
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,446
We're here for our honeymoon.

775
01:14:19,358 --> 01:14:21,326
Our clothes aren't necessary, right?

776
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:26,926
You said you wanted to live like a normal couple.

777
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:29,926
This is the kind of normal moment you should remember.

778
01:15:08,173 --> 01:15:09,774
We did it, Khim.

779
01:15:19,453 --> 01:15:20,726
They have a key.

780
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,040
Kloy!

781
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:29,166
Does this villa have fresh water?

782
01:15:30,686 --> 01:15:32,086
Come on, Khim.

783
01:15:32,926 --> 01:15:34,326
This is only a small matter

784
01:15:34,686 --> 01:15:36,046
compared to what we went through.

785
01:15:43,296 --> 01:15:44,526
Khim.

786
01:15:46,246 --> 01:15:47,806
No matter where we are,

787
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:50,046
if we have each other,

788
01:15:50,286 --> 01:15:51,606
that's already enough.

789
01:15:54,935 --> 01:15:57,766
Don't let Kloyjai actually do this campaign.

790
01:15:58,366 --> 01:15:59,446
Yes, Khim.

791
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:23,006
Khim, you're cute.

792
01:16:26,286 --> 01:16:27,846
But from looking at your dress,

793
01:16:28,868 --> 01:16:31,006
this couple doesn't have any chemistry.

794
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:33,726
Their tastes are so different.

795
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:36,766
I'm curious though. If Kloy's project has become real,

796
01:16:37,046 --> 01:16:38,886
who got our luggage?

797
01:16:42,726 --> 01:16:43,806
It's such a shame.

798
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:45,506
We've prepared matching outfits.

799
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:51,006
Don't watch too many movies.

800
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:53,806
An actual couple will wear something like these.

801
01:16:53,926 --> 01:16:55,366
It's realistic.

802
01:16:59,759 --> 01:17:03,466
What should we start with? The local people have shared some food with us.

803
01:17:04,941 --> 01:17:08,006
This probably will be a lucky random meal. It's exciting.

804
01:17:10,894 --> 01:17:13,606
Isn't this exciting enough?

805
01:17:16,216 --> 01:17:17,446
Come on, Khim.

806
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:19,566
No matter where we are,

807
01:17:20,206 --> 01:17:22,406
at least, we get to see the sunset.

808
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:24,966
Even if we're here or at Riviera,

809
01:17:25,454 --> 01:17:26,686
it's the same sun.

810
01:17:32,886 --> 01:17:34,966
We should have this kind of accommodation

811
01:17:35,246 --> 01:17:36,926
for guests to stay.

812
01:17:40,587 --> 01:17:43,526
It has no privacy at all.

813
01:17:44,492 --> 01:17:45,766
It's staring at us.

814
01:17:46,302 --> 01:17:48,046
How could we sleep?

815
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:49,406
Forget it.

816
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:52,926
We should flirt with each other.

817
01:17:58,144 --> 01:17:59,406
Can we really do it?

818
01:18:00,576 --> 01:18:02,206
Don't pay attention to it.

819
01:18:03,494 --> 01:18:05,846
This is our first honeymoon night.

820
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:08,606
Let's flirt.

821
01:18:19,926 --> 01:18:24,366
I don't think we could ever forget this honeymoon our entire lives.

822
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:52,766
(Happy seventh-day anniversary of our wedding.)

823
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:57,446
(Although our honeymoon might be a little troubled,)

824
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:58,890
(but)

825
01:19:59,486 --> 01:20:03,046
(I'll tell you what I like about you to let you know.)

826
01:20:04,246 --> 01:20:06,466
(It's a small thing,)

827
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:10,126
(but it might make our marriage life more meaningful.)

828
01:20:10,527 --> 01:20:12,527
(I like it that you don't look in a mirror.)

829
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:15,646
(It's like you don't need a mirror in this world.)

830
01:20:15,885 --> 01:20:19,326
(You rarely looked at your face in the mirror.)

831
01:20:20,589 --> 01:20:22,926
(When you didn't keep your look while we're together,)

832
01:20:23,286 --> 01:20:24,886
(it shows your true nature.)

833
01:20:25,214 --> 01:20:28,686
(I like it when you brag that you're more romantic than me.)

834
01:20:29,013 --> 01:20:31,606
(I like it when you try to prove it.)

835
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:33,518
(I didn't want to interrupt you.)

836
01:20:34,218 --> 01:20:36,406
(I'll let you brag about it.)

837
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:41,206
(But I believe that this note will make you lose to me.)

838
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:49,446
(Another thing that I like is)

839
01:20:49,909 --> 01:20:52,366
(that no matter what you search for every day,)

840
01:20:52,901 --> 01:20:55,566
(there'll be at least one thing that's related to me.)

841
01:20:56,189 --> 01:20:59,186
(You searched for honeymoon activities yesterday.)

842
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,006
Khim.

843
01:21:03,453 --> 01:21:05,453
Should we go kayaking?

844
01:21:07,084 --> 01:21:08,206
Khim.

845
01:21:09,989 --> 01:21:11,229
What did you say?

846
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,166
Should we go kayaking?

847
01:21:40,486 --> 01:21:42,126
Great minds think alike.

848
01:21:42,406 --> 01:21:43,966
(Happy honeymoon.)

849
01:21:44,757 --> 01:21:47,246
(Think of this as a consolation gift from me.)

850
01:21:47,806 --> 01:21:49,686
(You must have been bored all day long yesterday.)

851
01:21:50,111 --> 01:21:51,766
(But I want to tell you that)

852
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,926
(I like that we can go anywhere together.)

853
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:55,526
(No matter how tough it is,)

854
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:58,846
(you can make every place feels like heaven on earth for me.)

855
01:21:59,967 --> 01:22:03,046
(I also like it when you argue with me in your dream.)

856
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:06,486
(When you cursed at me while you were dreaming,)

857
01:22:06,886 --> 01:22:08,557
(I'm really happy I get to be with you)

858
01:22:08,581 --> 01:22:12,206
(both when you're awake and asleep.)

859
01:22:16,055 --> 01:22:19,526
(I like it when you told me it's alright)

860
01:22:19,845 --> 01:22:22,086
(because you usually make it like that.)

861
01:22:22,966 --> 01:22:24,566
Should we go kayaking?

862
01:22:27,664 --> 01:22:29,046
Isn't it too difficult?

863
01:22:29,846 --> 01:22:31,086
It's up to you.

864
01:22:31,294 --> 01:22:34,926
(But whenever you say "It's up to you.",)

865
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:37,726
(you don't actually mean that.)

866
01:22:38,046 --> 01:22:41,386
(But it means that I can't go against you about that.)

867
01:22:41,652 --> 01:22:43,726
- Are you sulking? - No.

868
01:22:44,606 --> 01:22:46,006
Smile.

869
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:51,126
(I like it when you were still a mechanic.)

870
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:53,486
(You tried to fix everything yourself.)

871
01:22:53,878 --> 01:22:56,286
(You've never abandoned or given up on anything,)

872
01:22:57,486 --> 01:22:58,886
(including us.)

873
01:22:59,954 --> 01:23:02,206
(Even if we reach a dead end,)

874
01:23:02,782 --> 01:23:04,639
(you're ready to fix it.)

875
01:23:05,474 --> 01:23:08,006
(You always have a way to fix all the bad things.)

876
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:09,886
Kla.

877
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:13,566
Kla.

878
01:23:17,606 --> 01:23:18,846
Kla.

879
01:23:20,982 --> 01:23:22,982
(Another thing I just found was that)

880
01:23:23,237 --> 01:23:25,086
(you thought you're easygoing.)

881
01:23:25,374 --> 01:23:26,806
(But in your easygoingness,)

882
01:23:27,006 --> 01:23:29,306
- (there are tons of difficulties.) - Where is he?

883
01:23:30,966 --> 01:23:33,406
(But you still like to say you're easygoing.)

884
01:23:33,966 --> 01:23:35,246
(You've never been)

885
01:23:35,606 --> 01:23:36,886
(easygoing.)

886
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:40,286
Kla.

887
01:23:42,965 --> 01:23:44,086
Kla.

888
01:23:45,091 --> 01:23:46,246
Khim.

889
01:23:47,286 --> 01:23:50,326
Khim. Oh, hey.

890
01:23:54,445 --> 01:23:55,686
Where have you been?

891
01:23:55,911 --> 01:23:57,606
And this. You're cheating.

892
01:23:58,142 --> 01:23:59,286
Cheat?

893
01:24:00,092 --> 01:24:01,966
There's no good point here.

894
01:24:02,686 --> 01:24:04,086
Tell me my good points.

895
01:24:05,571 --> 01:24:06,571
Khim.

896
01:24:06,765 --> 01:24:10,286
If our thoughts are so similar, you could probably guess the rest of it.

897
01:24:11,864 --> 01:24:15,086
It's not the same. I want to hear it from your mouth.

898
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:19,037
Tell me what you like about me.

899
01:24:19,172 --> 01:24:22,526
This is what I told you. Your difficulties.

900
01:24:25,692 --> 01:24:29,286
Why did you have to ruin the mood? We're on our honeymoon now.

901
01:24:35,846 --> 01:24:37,366
There are hundreds of good points.

902
01:24:37,926 --> 01:24:40,086
We should keep some for our next honeymoon.

903
01:24:41,196 --> 01:24:44,726
What if we don't have a chance? Tell me right now.

904
01:24:51,326 --> 01:24:53,646
This is another reason why I like to be with you,

905
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:55,870
because you make me give all of my love to you.

906
01:24:56,149 --> 01:24:58,446
We've gone through a lot of heavy stuff.

907
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:00,486
We doubted each other once

908
01:25:00,806 --> 01:25:02,246
and we've been separated for seven years.

909
01:25:02,526 --> 01:25:04,566
It made me love you like there's no tomorrow.

910
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:07,366
Even if tomorrow is the last day,

911
01:25:09,446 --> 01:25:10,646
I'm not scared anymore

912
01:25:11,046 --> 01:25:12,526
because I know that every day

913
01:25:13,446 --> 01:25:15,046
I'll get to love you with all my heart.

914
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:26,846
If we can go on

915
01:25:27,445 --> 01:25:29,046
or even if we only have today left,

916
01:25:30,566 --> 01:25:31,766
I...

917
01:25:32,886 --> 01:25:34,286
I can't love you more than this.

918
01:25:35,629 --> 01:25:38,526
We have to love each other when we still have time.

919
01:25:43,299 --> 01:25:45,006
And...

920
01:25:51,582 --> 01:25:53,726
We have to hug each other when we still have time.

921
01:26:01,015 --> 01:26:02,526
The time we're together

922
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:04,726
is the best moment of my life.

923
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,566
We're so fortunate that we get to be together.

924
01:26:12,861 --> 01:26:16,206
Thank you for not dying on that day.

925
01:26:17,909 --> 01:26:20,406
That's why we can share our happiness like this.

926
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,806
(I like to use you to kill my time.)

927
01:27:30,086 --> 01:27:32,006
(We've wasted our time on nonsensical things.)

928
01:27:32,222 --> 01:27:33,726
(We argued and picked fights)

929
01:27:33,886 --> 01:27:35,406
(about who loves each other more.)

930
01:27:35,764 --> 01:27:37,646
(The fact that we get to be together again)

931
01:27:37,855 --> 01:27:39,126
(is the most valuable thing.)

932
01:27:39,557 --> 01:27:42,166
(When I'm with you, it feels like I have nothing to do)

933
01:27:42,334 --> 01:27:44,486
(and I've never thought of it as a waste of time.)

934
01:27:57,221 --> 01:27:59,646
(I like it that you never feel tired of waiting.)

935
01:28:00,206 --> 01:28:01,606
(No matter what I'm doing,)

936
01:28:02,078 --> 01:28:03,846
(I'll see your face when I turn around.)

937
01:28:29,854 --> 01:28:31,526
Another thing that I like

938
01:28:32,284 --> 01:28:33,501
is that when I'm with you,

939
01:28:33,877 --> 01:28:35,477
nothing is impossible.

940
01:28:37,365 --> 01:28:39,166
From the first day until today,

941
01:28:39,582 --> 01:28:43,419
I couldn't imagine if I could come this far if I didn't have you.

942
01:28:51,365 --> 01:28:52,926
You can't go anywhere now.

943
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,566
There's a strong gravity here

944
01:28:55,701 --> 01:28:58,237
that brings us closer together.

945
01:29:05,093 --> 01:29:06,846
How many days will we stay here?

946
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:12,845
We can stay here for a long time.

947
01:29:13,063 --> 01:29:15,063
I'll give a five-star review for it.

948
01:29:22,406 --> 01:29:24,251
(The one who makes me feel like...)

949
01:29:24,347 --> 01:29:26,366
(My life is worth it now)

950
01:29:27,325 --> 01:29:28,566
(is you.)
