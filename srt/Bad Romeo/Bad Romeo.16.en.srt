1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:01,198
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:02,366
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:03,535
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,686
If you want me to open my heart to you again,

5
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:47,326
you must make me trust you first.

6
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,926
So, can we make up now?

7
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:52,672
I don't know whether you're sincere or if you just want to win.

8
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:54,986
He did this much to me.

9
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:56,550
I have to get him to jail.

10
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:57,726
Let me see Saikhim.

11
00:02:57,823 --> 00:02:59,102
- You can't go in. - Let me go.

12
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,566
He's never forgotten about what you did to him.

13
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,086
Think about it again.

14
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,526
When he's Carl,

15
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,368
he'll always try to get back at you.

16
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,502
Kla has become a suspect in the car bombing

17
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:12,263
even when you're always with him.

18
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,804
Don't you want to confirm his alibi?

19
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:15,806
If you promise you'll divorce,

20
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,326
I'll be your alibi.

21
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:19,326
Since we could never be together.

22
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:21,246
You told me your feelings are gone.

23
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:23,646
I'm ready to prove my innocence in your dad's case.

24
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:25,117
(If we don't take a risk,)

25
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:27,166
(we'll never find true love.)

26
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:29,846
(I can do everything to get her back.)

27
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:32,526
(If she hates what I have become,)

28
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:36,686
(it's better than letting her love me who isn't truly me.)

29
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:54,326
Slowly. Your left.

30
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:56,886
Be careful. Be careful.

31
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:05,366
It looks like Saikhim chose her dad.

32
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:08,006
I'm sorry that you can't be together.

33
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:11,526
Are you here to console me or mock me?

34
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:15,046
Since you have no reason left to be in Thailand,

35
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:18,286
are you sure you won't go back to America with me?

36
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:22,246
I'll give you a chance to change your mind about being my heir.

37
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:31,893
You can't go anywhere.

38
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:35,326
Whenever I travel, I bring you a souvenir.

39
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,766
I've never been to this place before.

40
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:41,326
I promise we'll go there together.

41
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,326
I'm giving you this to remind you that I'm waiting.

42
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:45,566
So, you can't give up, Nate.

43
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:48,133
I'll come back to remind you of the promise.

44
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,966
We'll take him back to America.

45
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:03,686
Some states' law allows the patients

46
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:05,446
to end their own lives.

47
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,526
I've contacted them.

48
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:09,206
We'll send him off together.

49
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:11,046
You have no right to decide anyone's life.

50
00:05:12,198 --> 00:05:13,566
This is his life.

51
00:05:17,126 --> 00:05:18,206
Nate.

52
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:19,886
Can you hear me?

53
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:21,366
I'm Carl.

54
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:22,846
If you hear me,

55
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:24,766
please open your eyes for me.

56
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:27,406
I'm trying to find a way to talk with you,

57
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:30,006
to make sure that you want to leave by your own decision.

58
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:31,646
If you aren't ready,

59
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:33,166
I'll let you stay.

60
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:36,806
I'll develop this eye reading machine as soon as possible.

61
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:40,566
This might be something that makes you want to continue to live.

62
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:42,006
If you can hear me,

63
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,406
please open your eyes for me.

64
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,646
He wouldn't answer you.

65
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:49,766
Stop trying.

66
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:52,486
You should answer me.

67
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,404
Are you going back?

68
00:05:54,757 --> 00:05:56,526
We're going back to America.

69
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:58,766
You, Nate, and I.

70
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,206
Do you want to go back to America

71
00:06:05,997 --> 00:06:08,086
or do you want to run away from your crime?

72
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:11,806
Did you send your people to bomb that hotel?

73
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,326
Why would I do that?

74
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:16,670
To manipulate the stock's price.

75
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:18,486
You want to take over Saikhim's business.

76
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:21,246
You let me take over it

77
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:23,437
to instigate Saikhim and me to doubt each other.

78
00:06:23,782 --> 00:06:25,166
Is it because of this business?

79
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:27,366
You're so manly.

80
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,246
When you got dumped by a woman,

81
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:30,726
you blamed it all on me.

82
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:33,486
I have evidence showing that you caused this car bombing.

83
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:39,766
Give it to the police then.

84
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:41,166
Of course, I'll send it

85
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:44,066
if you still want to take over Kidakarn's business.

86
00:06:44,758 --> 00:06:45,846
What do you mean?

87
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,613
Don't touch Saikhim again.

88
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,726
Otherwise, instead of holding on to your treasure,

89
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:51,566
you'll be holding on to the prison cell.

90
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,710
I'm going to install an elevator.

91
00:07:17,806 --> 00:07:18,846
But now,

92
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:20,927
I've prepared your room downstairs.

93
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:22,406
You should rest there.

94
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:36,046
You can stay still. You don't need to do anything.

95
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,686
I'll find the evidence

96
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:41,006
and the witness. I'll make myself survive.

97
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:44,766
You can choose your dad.

98
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:47,864
But don't treat me as your enemy.

99
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,886
Can you really do it?

100
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:53,966
I don't want you to hate me.

101
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:55,926
We only have each other.

102
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,766
What would we get from hating?

103
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,566
I...

104
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:05,486
I think we should go our separate ways.

105
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:08,966
I believe there's still more than this.

106
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:12,286
There's something more painful waiting for us.

107
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:45,526
Since you left the hospital, where have you been?

108
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:47,086
I was in my safe house.

109
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:49,214
I didn't go anywhere as I was worried about my safety.

110
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:52,526
Can anyone confirm that you recuperated by yourself there?

111
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:54,646
My sister and my assistant.

112
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:56,294
They visited me sometimes.

113
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:03,726
Someone confirmed his alibi.

114
00:10:10,806 --> 00:10:13,606
It looks like the accuser doesn't have any more concerns.

115
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,030
I won't bother you anymore.

116
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:24,806
Your wife confirmed that you were with her at your safe house.

117
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:28,186
She confirmed that you weren't behind the car bombing incident.

118
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:30,276
It's only a little fight

119
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:32,285
between a father-in-law and a son-in-law.

120
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:33,966
It's not something you need to kill for.

121
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:44,326
Why are you here? I said I would end everything myself.

122
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:47,246
To offer a peace treaty, maybe.

123
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:51,646
Everyone knows what we are now.

124
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:55,366
It should be everyone knows what we were.

125
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:07,246
Can you do what I asked?

126
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:10,606
Seven years ago,

127
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,166
it was like this when we doubted each other.

128
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,146
A broken glass

129
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:30,086
can't be repaired.

130
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:34,766
It's the same for our feelings.

131
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,486
It's time for us to accept the truth.

132
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,286
I understand.

133
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:44,366
You want us to end it like this?

134
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,326
Yes.

135
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,086
We should end it here.

136
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,166
I'll prove to you that we aren't enemies.

137
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,199
We might know each other too little.

138
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,486
So, you don't dare to trust me.

139
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:20,126
What are you doing?

140
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,326
The world forces me to be bad.

141
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:25,613
You'll see that someone will be ruined soon.

142
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,391
(For the car bombing incident, it's now confirmed)

143
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:42,407
(that Mr. Carl Raman, a famous businessman,)

144
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,706
(is actually a member of the Kidakarn's family)

145
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:50,046
(because Mr. Carl Raman is married to Ms. Saikhim Kidakarn,)

146
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,806
(the daughter of Mr. Songsin Kidakarn, the victim.)

147
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:56,998
(Ms. Saikhim became his alibi which confirms)

148
00:12:57,091 --> 00:12:59,830
(that they are still staying together as husband and wife)

149
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:01,885
(even on the day of the incident.)

150
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:05,266
(And she doesn't believe that her husband would be the culprit)

151
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:06,733
(who hurt her father.)

152
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:10,766
(Since Ms. Saikhim has become a witness for this case,)

153
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:14,126
(the police have to remove Mr. Carl Raman)

154
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:17,406
(from the suspect list.)

155
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,416
(But the police still believe)

156
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:22,485
(that the motive must be because of business conflict.)

157
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,686
(They'll continue to investigate more about this case.)

158
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:27,246
Darn it.

159
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,086
Are they crazy?

160
00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:32,766
Are you crazy? Why did you become his witness?

161
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:36,597
I believe that Kla didn't do it.

162
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:39,806
Do you have to wait for your dad to die to see his true nature?

163
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:44,006
But there's no evidence that Kla did that to you.

164
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:46,060
How could the police arrest him?

165
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:48,246
I'm sitting right here. Isn't this enough evidence?

166
00:13:48,398 --> 00:13:51,206
How much more evidence do you need to open your eyes?

167
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,726
- I've divorced Kla. - And so what?

168
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,486
Can it at least make you feel better?

169
00:13:56,622 --> 00:13:57,766
Feel better?

170
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,766
Do I have anything to make me feel better?

171
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:03,646
Do you need me to become handicapped? Is it worth it?

172
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:05,326
Feel better? How?

173
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,926
Why are you so stupid to let love blind you?

174
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:10,966
There's only an idiot who doesn't have a brain.

175
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,526
You only do and think stupid stuff.

176
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:15,646
Kla already knew

177
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:18,726
how much you fell for him, so he manipulated you.

178
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:20,726
Today's incident

179
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:22,246
will make him more arrogant.

180
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:24,246
He'll try to destroy me again.

181
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:28,006
You'll see a disaster happen to your dad. You must be happy now, right?

182
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:31,526
You'll see what's going to happen from what you did today.

183
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:33,846
Dad, hold on.

184
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,006
Leave me alone.

185
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:37,926
Leave me alone.

186
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:40,646
Leave if you think that man is better than me.

187
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,406
Go stay with him.

188
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:45,926
Go.

189
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:49,566
Leave me to die here alone.

190
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:51,206
Don't show your face anymore.

191
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:53,206
You're so crazy about him

192
00:14:53,637 --> 00:14:55,086
that you're leaving your dad like this.

193
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:14,366
(Do you have to wait for your dad to die)

194
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:15,886
(to see his true nature?)

195
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:21,320
(You'll see a disaster happen to your dad.)

196
00:15:21,446 --> 00:15:22,926
(You must be happy now, right?)

197
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,366
(You'll see what's going to happen from what you did today.)

198
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:32,486
I'll prove to you that we aren't enemies.

199
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:34,486
We might know each other too little.

200
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:36,606
So, you don't dare to trust me.

201
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:39,086
(Why are you so stupid to let love blind you?)

202
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,606
(There's only an idiot who doesn't have a brain.)

203
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:45,286
(You only do and think stupid stuff.)

204
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:46,926
(Kla already knew)

205
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:49,926
(how much you fell for him, so he manipulated you.)

206
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:51,766
The world forces me to be bad.

207
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,046
You'll see that someone will be ruined soon.

208
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,086
After your divorce, you get to be single again.

209
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,966
You'll be popular now.

210
00:16:09,606 --> 00:16:11,726
I'll leave the matter of the property to you.

211
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,206
Yes. I'll take care of it.

212
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:21,406
It has become news.

213
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,710
This might become scandalous now.

214
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:25,086
People just realize

215
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:28,566
that Thaenthai was just an affair partner.

216
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:31,018
I'm still wondering one thing.

217
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,086
You showed off your hug with her.

218
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:34,486
Were you trying to mock someone?

219
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:37,806
Carl has signed his divorce

220
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:40,366
as the divorce agreement indicated.

221
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,464
Then, we should end this as soon as possible.

222
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:52,166
I'm not sure if you've seen all of the addenda.

223
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,446
It's behind the divorce document.

224
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,566
Mr. Carl has shared his matrimonial property to compensate you.

225
00:16:58,438 --> 00:16:59,606
Just forget it.

226
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,886
I don't want anything from him.

227
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:05,646
I'm satisfied enough when he agrees to the divorce.

228
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:10,446
There'll be a meeting with the board.

229
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:13,806
There'll be a special agenda about the restructuring of directors.

230
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:17,166
They'll appoint Mr. Carl.

231
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:20,566
The most worrying thing is

232
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:25,726
there's an agenda about checking my dad's earlier management.

233
00:17:26,718 --> 00:17:29,126
The shareholders will force Mr. Sin to resign

234
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:31,726
to take responsibility for the damage.

235
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:34,126
He wants to take over our company.

236
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:36,606
If Mr. Sin still can't walk,

237
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:39,526
it'll affect the confidence of the shareholders.

238
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:44,846
In this bad situation,

239
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:47,526
Mr. Sin has to regain their confidence.

240
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:49,206
If not,

241
00:17:49,438 --> 00:17:51,326
he has to show support to you, Ms. Khim.

242
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,045
It's the only way

243
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:55,846
to make the power stay in Kidakarn's family.

244
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,006
Dad.

245
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:22,846
It's almost time for the meeting with the board.

246
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:24,646
You should try to walk.

247
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:27,126
Kaokla will come here to get rid of me.

248
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:29,806
I heard he's getting closer to the board members.

249
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:31,926
It's not just Kaokla.

250
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,926
Thaen's project that got canceled

251
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,046
make several of them unhappy.

252
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:39,006
Our stock is plummeting.

253
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:40,966
They're probably scared.

254
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,926
Isn't it because you broke up with Thaenthai?

255
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:45,526
That's why the island project was gone.

256
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:53,166
Do you have a plan to handle it?

257
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:55,766
If the board allows Kaokla to become the new president.

258
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:58,045
I'll never let them use a dirty trick against me.

259
00:18:58,301 --> 00:18:59,301
You too.

260
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:01,686
Don't let him know about our stuff again.

261
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,726
I only want you to be healed in time for that day.

262
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,406
At least, if everyone sees you're healthy again,

263
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,846
some directors might change their minds.

264
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:21,806
At least, we'll know on that day

265
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:24,966
how many people are happy with this situation.

266
00:19:26,286 --> 00:19:29,246
There must be some two-faced directors waiting for us.

267
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,526
Dad, can you stand?

268
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:28,086
Is everyone here?

269
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,126
Let's begin the meeting.

270
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,166
We're still waiting for some people.

271
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:33,606
Wait for five more minutes.

272
00:20:34,221 --> 00:20:35,646
Forget them if they don't come.

273
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:40,326
Oh, another red light.

274
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,246
After the incident during these past few months,

275
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:47,006
there has been a stop to investment and selling of shares.

276
00:20:47,174 --> 00:20:49,846
Some directors have resigned.

277
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:53,846
So, we need this meeting to consider appointing Mr. Carl Raman.

278
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,646
Some have resigned? Since when?

279
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:58,126
They submitted it this morning.

280
00:20:58,262 --> 00:21:01,246
We need a resolution from this meeting to appoint him.

281
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,486
It's already time. Can you get there in time?

282
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:07,166
Call and tell them that I'm on my way.

283
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:13,166
If Carl isn't here, we should postpone this agenda.

284
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:14,446
That's it.

285
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:18,446
Mr. Carl contacted me and said he was on his way.

286
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:23,406
We can vote on this matter.

287
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:27,326
Anyone who supports Mr. Carl, please raise your hand.

288
00:21:39,854 --> 00:21:40,926
Yes.

289
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:49,326
So, there are four votes in favor of Mr. Carl.

290
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:04,286
If we include Mr. Thabthim and Mr. Kittipat,

291
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:07,686
there are now six votes in favor of Mr. Carl.

292
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:09,006
Wait.

293
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:11,182
Why did you raise your hand?

294
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,686
If Mr. Carl gets in here,

295
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,356
what problem would he cause again?

296
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:18,845
You got lobbied.

297
00:22:48,286 --> 00:22:50,245
You're conspiring to dismiss me

298
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:52,142
to appoint him, aren't you?

299
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:54,806
We would like to propose that

300
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,606
Ms. Saikhim should be the new CEO.

301
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,326
It's you.

302
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:09,006
You're conspiring with him to crush me.

303
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,606
I did nothing.

304
00:23:12,884 --> 00:23:15,526
Just admit that you aren't good enough.

305
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:19,306
We already saw how badly you managed this hotel.

306
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:21,726
You're playing dirty.

307
00:23:21,997 --> 00:23:23,997
We left you with a director position.

308
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:26,006
We have already given you so much face.

309
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,166
If you didn't conspire to cheat me,

310
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,846
no one can win against me.

311
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,006
How could you say it's cheating?

312
00:23:33,342 --> 00:23:36,766
Because Saikhim owns more than 40 percent of the hotel's shares.

313
00:23:36,926 --> 00:23:38,643
It's normal if she becomes the CEO.

314
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:40,086
How could she have 40 percent?

315
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:44,126
As everyone knows, Saikhim and I were married.

316
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:47,366
We just agreed to split our matrimonial properties.

317
00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:50,206
I gave all of my shares in Kidakarn Group

318
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:51,966
to Saikhim as compensation.

319
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:54,206
How could it not reach 40 percent?

320
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:56,566
After the transfer of shares is signed,

321
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:59,046
I'll announce it in a meeting again.

322
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:00,926
Now, I would like a resolution

323
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:03,950
of who's in favor of Saikhim becoming the CEO

324
00:24:04,637 --> 00:24:06,406
replacing Mr. Songsin who's just dismissed.

325
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:22,286
It's almost unanimous, except for your dad's vote.

326
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:29,173
You allowed the enemy to get in.

327
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:31,286
Everyone will be ruined.

328
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:34,606
I'll expose

329
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,326
that you did the car bombing to create a scene.

330
00:24:37,683 --> 00:24:41,726
You're the one who manipulated the stock's price to take over the hotel.

331
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:43,686
Mark my words.

332
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:45,989
Every one of you

333
00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:48,926
is letting the enemy into your home.

334
00:24:49,094 --> 00:24:51,094
What else could I call you but a moron?

335
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:52,646
A moron.

336
00:24:53,078 --> 00:24:54,486
- Dad. - No.

337
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:56,766
Don't try to show off when you're stupid.

338
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,401
Remember.

339
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:00,966
I'll take back everything I've built.

340
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:07,086
So, let's end the meeting for today. Thank you, everyone.

341
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:33,286
Your plan to fake your injury

342
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:35,486
can get you sympathy from Khim.

343
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:38,486
But it destroys the investors' confidence.

344
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:41,526
You should blame yourself before you say they betrayed you.

345
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:46,326
You're the one who's playing tricks on everyone first.

346
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:49,086
You used her sympathy to make us break up.

347
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,726
I'll let you two fight each other today.

348
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:53,686
Khim will realize that you

349
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:55,246
have never loved her.

350
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:59,926
Don't act like you know everything. It's not over yet.

351
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:02,526
Khim has already lost enough respect from you.

352
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:05,726
Can you still face her?

353
00:26:08,189 --> 00:26:11,126
Stop taking your disappointment in your life out on Khim.

354
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:13,428
Your love hasn't become fulfilled.

355
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:16,286
So, you've never let Khim love anyone else except for you.

356
00:26:16,614 --> 00:26:19,814
You've never protected her. You only kick her while she's down.

357
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,766
You can't ask her to compensate for your disappointment.

358
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:25,309
Don't try to teach me.

359
00:26:25,621 --> 00:26:26,726
I'm not teaching you.

360
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:29,286
But you humiliated your daughter in the meeting today.

361
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:31,613
It reflects how bad of a father you are.

362
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:33,246
How great are you then?

363
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,006
- Dad. - At least,

364
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:37,286
I'm happy about her success.

365
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:39,486
If she can go further while beating me down,

366
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:41,966
I'm happy to let her step on me.

367
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:54,646
You've raised Saikhim like this,

368
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:57,486
so she doesn't dare to fall in love with anyone.

369
00:26:58,413 --> 00:26:59,806
I didn't come here for the money.

370
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:01,446
I'm here to get her dad back to her.

371
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:09,846
Can you open your mind to love her more than you love yourself?

372
00:27:52,413 --> 00:27:53,486
The transfer of shares.

373
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:55,406
Take it.

374
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:29,846
I told you

375
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:31,606
I could prove the truth.

376
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:38,086
What do you want?

377
00:28:46,646 --> 00:28:50,246
The CCTV recorded the culprit who set the bomb in Mr. Sansern's car.

378
00:28:50,591 --> 00:28:51,886
It didn't come from the hotel.

379
00:28:52,284 --> 00:28:53,966
It came from the dashcam.

380
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:57,166
Someone tried to threaten them to manipulate the stock's price.

381
00:28:57,517 --> 00:28:59,766
About the identity of the mastermind,

382
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,126
you should find out about it yourself.

383
00:29:03,774 --> 00:29:05,286
All evidence is in there.

384
00:29:06,438 --> 00:29:08,046
Prompt and his mom

385
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:10,806
are behind this?

386
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,646
They might want to get back at you.

387
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,446
And

388
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:18,926
I know a certain secret about your family.

389
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:30,446
Someone intentionally shared your mom's photos to damage her

390
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:33,526
to let herself get in between your family.

391
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,166
Your dad was stupid enough to fall for that lame trick.

392
00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:47,486
Was it Aunt?

393
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:50,246
Your dad has never learned.

394
00:29:50,742 --> 00:29:52,526
He repeated the same mistake.

395
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:55,606
Your aunt decided to sell all of her shares

396
00:29:55,925 --> 00:29:57,446
because of her past deeds.

397
00:29:57,926 --> 00:29:59,606
I don't blame you for doubting me

398
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:01,446
because you grew up with those people.

399
00:30:02,246 --> 00:30:05,086
So, you let me fight with my dad this way instead.

400
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:10,766
I want you to know

401
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,566
that I'm sincere with you.

402
00:30:13,606 --> 00:30:15,846
You only want to see my dad in ruin.

403
00:30:17,253 --> 00:30:19,446
He was the one who faked his injury to trick us.

404
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,287
He's a traitor.

405
00:30:21,957 --> 00:30:23,646
If you want to protect me,

406
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:26,926
there must be a better way than this.

407
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,326
No matter how bad you are,

408
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:31,446
if you hate my dad,

409
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:34,566
we can't be together anyway.

410
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:37,446
If the first button in a shirt is put on wrongly,

411
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,006
then we will always repeat the same mistake.

412
00:30:41,645 --> 00:30:43,886
Even though there's a day like today seven years later,

413
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,526
we might still hate each other because of this.

414
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,926
So, you closed off your heart

415
00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:06,446
and you won't let me prove myself anymore?

416
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,406
You hate me now, right?

417
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,806
Since there are only the two of us left,

418
00:32:59,582 --> 00:33:01,886
we should go back to America.

419
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:05,046
Why should we beg someone who doesn't value us?

420
00:33:26,626 --> 00:33:27,966
Kaokla...

421
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:33,806
I told you to handle it.

422
00:33:33,998 --> 00:33:36,166
Why are there people who still connect it to me?

423
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:38,726
You said there was no CCTV footage anymore.

424
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:41,246
With this evidence, she can't escape.

425
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:42,966
Get the camera as evidence.

426
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:45,006
I'll never let only myself be framed.

427
00:33:46,806 --> 00:33:48,006
That scoundrel!

428
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:59,821
Nate. Nate, did you see?

429
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,046
Look at him.

430
00:34:01,326 --> 00:34:04,486
He wasn't born to help us. He was born to destroy me,

431
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:06,246
to destroy our family.

432
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:07,886
Wake up.

433
00:34:08,286 --> 00:34:11,366
Do you still want to be with him, Nate?

434
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,126
Kla.

435
00:34:44,308 --> 00:34:45,886
They found out that we set up a wiretap.

436
00:34:46,102 --> 00:34:48,926
Asia must have realized now. She's taking her son away with her.

437
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:51,926
Kla, what should we do?

438
00:34:52,038 --> 00:34:54,486
We can't let her escape her crime like this.

439
00:35:00,134 --> 00:35:02,486
Kla, they're going to take Nate, but I don't know where.

440
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:06,926
Where are you trying to escape?

441
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:10,326
I'm doing this for my son's safety.

442
00:35:10,614 --> 00:35:12,614
You almost took him to death once.

443
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:15,486
You're still worried about his safety?

444
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:20,326
I'm ordering you to stay here. Don't take Nate anywhere.

445
00:35:20,966 --> 00:35:24,686
If you run, I'll send all the evidence I have to the police immediately.

446
00:35:26,326 --> 00:35:27,566
How can I trust you?

447
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:30,126
If you still bother me and my people,

448
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:32,086
no matter if it's Saikhim or Nate,

449
00:35:32,783 --> 00:35:35,246
you can wait for the time for you to get in prison.

450
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:42,286
These two clips are from the car bombing.

451
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,046
The other one is from your accident.

452
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,446
These two incidents have the same culprit.

453
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,766
So, the disputant with me from that time wasn't Ms. Claire.

454
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:56,446
If someone touched your car,

455
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:58,286
I don't think it's an accident.

456
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:02,206
Did Kaokla say anything else about the culprit?

457
00:36:03,366 --> 00:36:06,126
He only said the car bombing

458
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:08,366
must be related to price manipulation.

459
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,086
Price manipulation?

460
00:36:10,998 --> 00:36:12,926
Aside from Kaokla who was your husband,

461
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:16,126
who else would benefit from hurting you?

462
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:18,726
Ms. Khim.

463
00:36:19,662 --> 00:36:21,246
And what if...

464
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:23,966
What if it's Kaokla's stepmother?

465
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:27,198
Ms. Asia?

466
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:31,166
As her adopted son, your divorce from him

467
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,086
might impact the business and inheritance of that family.

468
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:37,446
Is it possible that

469
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:40,646
Ms. Asia would like to eliminate you

470
00:36:41,086 --> 00:36:42,766
because of the matrimonial property?

471
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:48,046
(If you're thinking that woman is behind everything,)

472
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,966
(I wouldn't be surprised.)

473
00:36:51,173 --> 00:36:52,926
What did you know about her?

474
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:55,286
She tried to keep every woman away from Carl.

475
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,606
She wouldn't let Carl have anyone except her.

476
00:36:57,901 --> 00:36:59,997
(And since you're Carl's wife,)

477
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:02,246
she would really want to eliminate you.

478
00:37:06,886 --> 00:37:08,886
(Even if she's Carl's stepmother,)

479
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:12,246
(she doesn't think of Carl as her adopted son.)

480
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:17,166
(She's jealous and shows her possessiveness to Carl.)

481
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:21,246
(You can say she's raised Carl to be her man.)

482
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:24,806
(She tried to make us fight with each other once.)

483
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:29,046
(I'm worried whether you can handle that bad woman.)

484
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:32,301
(When Carl tried to keep his distance from her,)

485
00:37:32,453 --> 00:37:35,646
(she became upset and tried to stop Carl from having his new life.)

486
00:37:36,893 --> 00:37:39,806
(If you're saying she's the one who caused the accident,)

487
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:42,286
(I wouldn't be surprised)

488
00:37:43,622 --> 00:37:45,622
(because she wanted us to hate each other.)

489
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:48,886
(Ms. Khim, you should be careful.)

490
00:37:50,414 --> 00:37:52,726
(I'm sure she didn't revive Carl)

491
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:54,606
(for him to become someone else's man.)

492
00:38:00,686 --> 00:38:02,726
Kla asked you to check these accommodations.

493
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,567
Put them in the system if they're okay.

494
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:08,986
I want you to update the details here for our team over there.

495
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:11,406
- Yes. No problem. - Okay.

496
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:22,726
Will he be alright like this?

497
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:28,486
Hey, stop your nonsense.

498
00:38:28,726 --> 00:38:31,326
Here. Take this just in case.

499
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:38,446
Wow. Do you want to keep your eyes on him all the time?

500
00:38:39,062 --> 00:38:41,326
No. Give me that. I'll add it here.

501
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:44,726
I'll use this to watch your behavior.

502
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:46,166
If you turn off the camera,

503
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:49,766
it'll mean you're trying to do something sneaky.

504
00:38:49,966 --> 00:38:52,126
So, don't close the camera.

505
00:38:52,894 --> 00:38:54,894
If you want me to be your important person,

506
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,646
I'll keep my eyes on you with my phone. Understand?

507
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:01,206
Yes. I understand.

508
00:39:04,437 --> 00:39:06,406
- Khem. - Yes.

509
00:39:10,206 --> 00:39:12,886
Watch over Nate. Don't let her get close to him

510
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:14,686
until the true culprit is arrested.

511
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:17,606
Do you remember the experimental eye-reading machine?

512
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:20,198
No matter where I am in the world,

513
00:39:20,462 --> 00:39:22,406
if Nate moves or opens his eyes,

514
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,966
or shows any reactions,

515
00:39:24,286 --> 00:39:27,166
give that machine to him. I'll reply as soon as possible.

516
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:28,806
Yes.

517
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:30,526
Kla.

518
00:39:31,486 --> 00:39:32,686
Are you really leaving?

519
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:35,389
It might hurt less if we're far apart.

520
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:39,446
Khim might have finished with all of her errands here by then.

521
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:21,606
(Kaokla)

522
00:40:29,991 --> 00:40:31,486
Answer my call.

523
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:45,486
(Welcome to call back service.)

524
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:58,806
(I'm ordering you to stay here. Don't take Nate anywhere.)

525
00:40:59,606 --> 00:41:01,538
(If you run, I'll send all the evidence I have)

526
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:03,286
(to the police immediately.)

527
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:24,086
If I have to stop Carl,

528
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:27,046
we have to say farewell forever.

529
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,363
Where is Nate?

530
00:43:43,452 --> 00:43:46,606
Someone called us and said Mr. Carl agreed to transfer him overseas.

531
00:43:46,814 --> 00:43:48,006
Kla?

532
00:43:53,486 --> 00:43:54,526
How long has he gone out?

533
00:43:54,654 --> 00:43:56,150
Just a moment ago.

534
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:11,958
Hey.

535
00:44:12,726 --> 00:44:13,964
Where are you taking Nate?

536
00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:15,749
I have to call Mr. Carl first.

537
00:44:17,013 --> 00:44:18,086
Get in the ambulance.

538
00:44:18,446 --> 00:44:19,526
Get in the ambulance.

539
00:44:47,526 --> 00:44:48,526
Nate.

540
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:51,406
Can you hear me?

541
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:53,886
We're going to the airport.

542
00:44:57,063 --> 00:44:58,206
If you hear me,

543
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,766
please open your eyes to talk with me.

544
00:45:01,526 --> 00:45:02,766
I have something for you to see.

545
00:45:05,126 --> 00:45:06,526
Has he always slept like this?

546
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,526
Are you sure there's no problem?

547
00:45:12,446 --> 00:45:14,086
His blood pressure is normal.

548
00:45:17,086 --> 00:45:18,406
Or is it because of the medicine?

549
00:45:23,006 --> 00:45:25,886
The engine might have broken down. I have to check it.

550
00:45:27,188 --> 00:45:28,446
Why did you come this way?

551
00:45:28,766 --> 00:45:29,925
To avoid the traffic.

552
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,326
I was afraid that you might not get on the flight in time.

553
00:45:45,486 --> 00:45:47,406
Why didn't he turn on the camera?

554
00:46:01,206 --> 00:46:03,246
The camera isn't on. He's not answering my call.

555
00:46:04,254 --> 00:46:05,726
Where is he?

556
00:46:06,726 --> 00:46:07,886
You can't contact Khem?

557
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:11,166
He always annoys me.

558
00:46:12,277 --> 00:46:14,346
- Should we go now? - Let's go.

559
00:46:19,036 --> 00:46:22,038
I want you to reconsider the previous resolution.

560
00:46:32,366 --> 00:46:33,446
How is it?

561
00:46:35,317 --> 00:46:36,486
It's almost done.

562
00:46:37,254 --> 00:46:38,446
Just a bit more.

563
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:49,174
What are you doing?

564
00:46:50,165 --> 00:46:52,046
I asked what you are doing.

565
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:53,726
Are you trying to kill him?

566
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,126
Who ordered you?

567
00:46:57,926 --> 00:46:59,286
I asked what you are doing.

568
00:47:01,206 --> 00:47:02,766
Tell me. Why did you inject him?

569
00:47:02,918 --> 00:47:05,526
- To make him sleep. - To make him sleep or to make him dead?

570
00:47:08,678 --> 00:47:09,758
Nate.

571
00:47:17,263 --> 00:47:20,246
What is he doing? He still hasn't answered my call.

572
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:23,806
Nate, wake up.

573
00:47:24,006 --> 00:47:25,406
Don't fall asleep. Ouch.

574
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:30,669
Hey, stop. Stop. I told you to stop.

575
00:47:33,206 --> 00:47:35,426
Stop. I told you to stop the car.

576
00:47:52,613 --> 00:47:54,757
Where is he? His camera isn't on either.

577
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,046
Hey, he's running away.

578
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,246
Don't do anything to Nate.

579
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:45,046
- Let Nate go. - Darn it.

580
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:05,206
I'll excuse myself for a bit.

581
00:49:17,366 --> 00:49:18,446
Mr. Thongthom.

582
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:21,246
So, you want to resign?

583
00:49:22,197 --> 00:49:23,226
Quick.

584
00:49:38,827 --> 00:49:40,998
Kla, Khem didn't turn on the camera,

585
00:49:41,022 --> 00:49:42,729
but he turned on the voice recorder.

586
00:49:46,176 --> 00:49:48,566
(No, don't take Nate away.)

587
00:49:48,931 --> 00:49:50,326
Check his condition.

588
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:52,662
No, don't take Nate away.

589
00:49:53,606 --> 00:49:54,846
No.

590
00:49:59,486 --> 00:50:01,688
- He's still alive, but I don't think he can survive.

591
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:03,006
- He's still alive?

592
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:05,126
Then, leave him here.

593
00:50:06,326 --> 00:50:07,966
What happened to those two?

594
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:22,246
I don't know who will die first.

595
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:40,302
Since he asked for trouble himself, I can't help it.

596
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:08,806
We have to part like this

597
00:51:09,286 --> 00:51:11,806
because my other son betrayed me first.

598
00:51:14,582 --> 00:51:17,606
Since he only wants two people in the family,

599
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:21,326
I'll have Carl take responsibility for you.

600
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:26,126
Please be strong, Nate.

601
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:27,686
You have to be alright.

602
00:51:27,886 --> 00:51:29,326
You can't make Kla

603
00:51:29,982 --> 00:51:31,246
get into trouble

604
00:51:31,597 --> 00:51:32,766
because of you.

605
00:51:33,198 --> 00:51:34,486
Help.

606
00:51:35,397 --> 00:51:37,766
Is anyone here?

607
00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:39,870
Help.

608
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:44,006
Check the server to see where Khem last logged in.

609
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:46,246
Make them find Khem's location.

610
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:07,166
Kla.

611
00:52:10,886 --> 00:52:14,046
We received a report that you kidnapped a patient from the hospital.

612
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:17,606
So, where did you hide your brother, Mr. Carl?

613
00:52:58,446 --> 00:52:59,486
Kla.

614
00:52:59,813 --> 00:53:01,086
The lawyer is coming.

615
00:53:01,454 --> 00:53:03,245
Check Khem's latest location.

616
00:53:03,454 --> 00:53:05,806
If we find it out, we might be able to save them.

617
00:53:06,926 --> 00:53:10,166
Kla, don't forget to give Khem's recording to the police.

618
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:17,926
Your friend disappeared with your elder brother at the same time?

619
00:53:18,149 --> 00:53:21,846
Yes. I asked him to take care of my brother while I'm going abroad.

620
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,806
Why did you send the message to threaten the victim?

621
00:53:28,486 --> 00:53:29,806
I didn't send it.

622
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,646
But it said you're the one who told her to give you the CEO position

623
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:34,926
in exchange for your brother.

624
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:37,224
So, are you holding the patient as your hostage?

625
00:53:37,326 --> 00:53:39,166
She's the one who kidnapped Khem and Nate

626
00:53:39,326 --> 00:53:40,886
and set me up as the kidnapper.

627
00:53:41,133 --> 00:53:42,726
They're both in danger.

628
00:53:43,007 --> 00:53:45,886
If I was truly the culprit, why would I hurt Khem?

629
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:48,606
You heard from the recording that he got hurt.

630
00:53:48,742 --> 00:53:51,206
The ones in the ambulance kidnapped both of them.

631
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:52,446
How can I confirm

632
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:54,006
that this recording is true?

633
00:53:54,118 --> 00:53:55,385
You...

634
00:53:55,822 --> 00:53:57,062
We found the hostage.

635
00:53:57,398 --> 00:53:58,806
He got abandoned by the roadside.

636
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:01,606
He's in a coma, but we haven't found the other one.

637
00:54:01,766 --> 00:54:02,846
Nate...

638
00:54:03,645 --> 00:54:04,966
I would like to see Nate.

639
00:54:07,102 --> 00:54:08,902
I said I would like to see Nate.

640
00:54:12,117 --> 00:54:13,166
Nate.

641
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:14,806
Nate.

642
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:23,686
I'm sorry. You can't go in.

643
00:54:26,793 --> 00:54:28,366
I'm sorry.

644
00:54:59,406 --> 00:55:01,246
I promise we'll go there together.

645
00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:03,486
I'm giving you this to remind you that I'm waiting.

646
00:55:03,806 --> 00:55:05,606
So, you can't give up, Nate.

647
00:55:06,565 --> 00:55:08,646
(I'll come back to remind you of the promise.)

648
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:17,646
Goodbye, Nate.

649
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,566
Mr. Prompt and his mom were going to sell their shares to Ms. Asia.

650
00:55:43,902 --> 00:55:45,806
I think Kaokla knew about this

651
00:55:46,053 --> 00:55:48,486
and bought them all before her.

652
00:55:48,814 --> 00:55:51,766
He might have really wanted to face Asia to protect us,

653
00:55:51,966 --> 00:55:54,326
not to take revenge against Mr. Sin as we first thought.

654
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:12,926
Kloy.

655
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,006
What happened?

656
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:17,502
The police arrested Kla for attempted murder.

657
00:56:17,926 --> 00:56:19,126
Murder?

658
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,406
He's still in Thailand?

659
00:56:22,855 --> 00:56:24,646
Mr. Carl's relative, please come inside.

660
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,726
Have you seen this medicine before?

661
00:56:32,024 --> 00:56:33,206
No.

662
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:35,926
We found it on Mr. Carl's work desk.

663
00:56:36,094 --> 00:56:37,806
This is an injection for euthanasia

664
00:56:37,934 --> 00:56:39,054
or prisoner's execution.

665
00:56:39,158 --> 00:56:40,846
We'll keep it for the forensic unit.

666
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:42,486
How did Kla have this?

667
00:56:42,631 --> 00:56:43,806
Don't frame him.

668
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:46,166
He was going to run away overseas.

669
00:57:37,766 --> 00:57:40,460
We found the suspicious items for the murder.

670
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,566
You're a suspect for your stepbrother's

671
00:57:43,814 --> 00:57:44,947
premeditated murder.

672
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:47,166
Please testify at the police station.

673
00:57:50,438 --> 00:57:53,246
Find Khem as soon as you can and bring the lawyer to me.

674
00:58:12,629 --> 00:58:13,709
Wait.

675
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:20,006
Don't go.

676
00:58:24,006 --> 00:58:25,486
If you didn't do it,

677
00:58:26,477 --> 00:58:27,766
why did you avoid my eyes?

678
00:58:28,566 --> 00:58:30,726
I realized that I'm not worthy of you.

679
00:58:31,406 --> 00:58:32,886
If you didn't do anything wrong,

680
00:58:33,598 --> 00:58:34,843
tell me.

681
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,166
If I told you,

682
00:58:36,455 --> 00:58:38,366
could you love me again?

683
00:58:42,542 --> 00:58:44,126
I know who did it.

684
00:58:45,709 --> 00:58:47,606
It's related to the relationship between us, isn't it?

685
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:50,926
Don't give up.

686
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,166
Don't die. You can't let anything happen to you

687
00:58:53,733 --> 00:58:55,966
until you can explain everything to me.

688
00:58:56,725 --> 00:58:59,126
If you want to be in the same family with me again,

689
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:04,006
you can't let my hand go.

690
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,286
Can you promise me

691
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:09,126
that this won't separate us like before again?

692
00:59:09,717 --> 00:59:11,406
If someone has to be in prison,

693
00:59:12,301 --> 00:59:13,486
it shouldn't be me.

694
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:16,086
If you're wrong again,

695
00:59:17,326 --> 00:59:18,766
you'll regret it.

696
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:20,446
What do you mean?

697
00:59:21,613 --> 00:59:24,046
Are you still waiting for the child to come back?

698
00:59:25,815 --> 00:59:27,446
The time is up. Take him.

699
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:29,966
It'll be better than the last time. I promise.

700
00:59:30,246 --> 00:59:31,406
Get in the car.

701
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:33,526
We'll get through it.

702
00:59:33,842 --> 00:59:35,126
You have to go.

703
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:38,966
- Go. - Get in.

704
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,926
The board has stopped accepting Kaokla.

705
01:00:08,493 --> 01:00:11,166
There'll be no certificate for that.

706
01:00:13,686 --> 01:00:14,686
Why?

707
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:17,246
Because he's being prosecuted.

708
01:00:17,486 --> 01:00:18,686
He might be in prison

709
01:00:18,862 --> 01:00:20,862
for wrongful possession of properties.

710
01:00:21,005 --> 01:00:22,486
The money he used to buy our shares

711
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,846
might come from killing his brother to get his inheritance.

712
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,286
It's not like you thought.

713
01:00:29,029 --> 01:00:32,086
I used to want Kaokla to be the same man again.

714
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:35,286
But after I know everything he's gone through,

715
01:00:35,446 --> 01:00:36,846
I understand now

716
01:00:37,077 --> 01:00:39,206
why he has changed so much.

717
01:00:39,454 --> 01:00:40,766
If he wasn't bad,

718
01:00:40,894 --> 01:00:43,726
he would be the victim that would be crushed by everyone.

719
01:00:44,733 --> 01:00:47,966
You fell for him again after he gave all of his shares to you?

720
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:51,246
Because he knows you're my weakness.

721
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,286
Honestly, Dad,

722
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:56,366
he could do more than this, but he didn't do it.

723
01:00:56,558 --> 01:00:57,726
And so what?

724
01:00:57,926 --> 01:01:00,806
Do I have to kneel and thank him that he didn't kill me?

725
01:01:03,853 --> 01:01:05,606
He still needs you alive

726
01:01:06,517 --> 01:01:09,166
because there are a lot of truths that you should know.

727
01:01:10,741 --> 01:01:13,406
At least, you should know that your prejudice

728
01:01:13,526 --> 01:01:15,846
has killed a lot of people in your life.

729
01:01:17,606 --> 01:01:19,486
When you're being yourself like this,

730
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:22,286
it doesn't mean you're strong.

731
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:25,166
It means that you're extremely weak,

732
01:01:25,686 --> 01:01:27,486
that you're scared to love anyone.

733
01:01:29,117 --> 01:01:30,766
I might be mad,

734
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:34,606
but I've never hated that you're like this.

735
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:36,446
If it's someone else,

736
01:01:37,007 --> 01:01:39,007
I might hate them to death

737
01:01:39,582 --> 01:01:42,006
if they pretend to be nice to me.

738
01:01:42,285 --> 01:01:43,766
But with you,

739
01:01:45,157 --> 01:01:47,037
even if you have to force yourself,

740
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,686
I want you to pretend as if you love me.

741
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:53,046
If you care about me,

742
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,046
be nice to me,

743
01:01:55,453 --> 01:01:57,006
or worry about me,

744
01:01:58,926 --> 01:02:00,286
it might be nice.

745
01:02:17,566 --> 01:02:19,646
Have you ever kidnapped Mr. Nate before?

746
01:02:19,878 --> 01:02:21,846
Yes. I took him away once,

747
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:24,406
but it's for his recovery.

748
01:02:24,606 --> 01:02:27,406
Did you have a problem with your own family?

749
01:02:27,669 --> 01:02:29,446
Go ask my stepmother,

750
01:02:29,934 --> 01:02:31,934
what she has done to me.

751
01:02:33,126 --> 01:02:35,086
But we found this medicine in your room.

752
01:02:35,574 --> 01:02:38,606
- And what? - It's the same chemicals we found in the body.

753
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:42,126
We also found the receipt on your computer.

754
01:02:42,516 --> 01:02:44,846
- Why did you order it? - Do you have proof

755
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:46,286
that I injected it to him?

756
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:47,630
I don't need to tell you.

757
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:50,246
You also sent your people to watch over him.

758
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:52,165
Where is Mr. Khemmarat right now?

759
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:53,926
I also want to know where he is.

760
01:02:59,798 --> 01:03:00,846
How was it?

761
01:03:00,998 --> 01:03:02,166
I'm fine.

762
01:03:02,389 --> 01:03:03,846
The police allowed my bail.

763
01:03:05,062 --> 01:03:06,942
Kloy, have you found Khem?

764
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:09,246
No. We still can't contact him.

765
01:03:09,612 --> 01:03:10,926
This is getting scary.

766
01:03:11,686 --> 01:03:13,286
He should be at the crime scene.

767
01:03:13,446 --> 01:03:14,726
A drowned corpse?

768
01:03:16,253 --> 01:03:17,333
What happened?

769
01:03:17,439 --> 01:03:18,686
The police said that

770
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:20,206
someone found a drowned corpse

771
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:22,246
not far from where they found Mr. Nate.

772
01:03:22,374 --> 01:03:24,726
They want us to identify him.

773
01:03:48,174 --> 01:03:50,726
So, is he Mr. Khemmarat Kongrit?

774
01:04:04,246 --> 01:04:05,766
The autopsy indicated that

775
01:04:05,871 --> 01:04:08,326
he has been dead for 27 hours.

776
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:09,886
He drowned,

777
01:04:10,197 --> 01:04:11,686
but his real cause of death

778
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,326
might be from respiratory failure

779
01:04:14,526 --> 01:04:16,086
before he drowned.

780
01:04:27,926 --> 01:04:29,086
No.

781
01:04:30,582 --> 01:04:32,366
That's not true.

782
01:04:32,598 --> 01:04:34,846
It isn't him, right?

783
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,966
No.

784
01:04:38,246 --> 01:04:39,366
No.

785
01:04:50,602 --> 01:04:52,566
If we put the button in the right order now,

786
01:04:53,038 --> 01:04:54,206
it's already too late.

787
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,486
Kla.

788
01:04:56,966 --> 01:04:58,446
Why did you say that?

789
01:04:58,646 --> 01:04:59,966
If it wasn't for me,

790
01:05:00,221 --> 01:05:01,686
Khem wouldn't die.

791
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,006
They actually want my own life.

792
01:05:12,126 --> 01:05:14,126
You're having a problem with your stepmother.

793
01:05:14,486 --> 01:05:17,806
Partly, it's because of our marriage.

794
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,206
She made me get into a car accident

795
01:05:20,557 --> 01:05:22,886
and let Claire take the fall, right?

796
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,806
That's when I had fallen out with her.

797
01:05:26,846 --> 01:05:29,606
For her, I shouldn't even be born.

798
01:05:30,078 --> 01:05:32,078
The one she wants alive is dead.

799
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:34,206
She doesn't want me to be alive to mock her.

800
01:05:34,637 --> 01:05:36,406
She tried to put me in jail again.

801
01:05:43,246 --> 01:05:44,806
But this time, you have me.

802
01:05:45,181 --> 01:05:46,606
We'll survive together.

803
01:05:47,406 --> 01:05:49,206
Even if we have to fight for seven more years,

804
01:05:49,998 --> 01:05:51,246
it'll be alright.

805
01:06:03,315 --> 01:06:05,086
This isn't true.

806
01:06:08,901 --> 01:06:10,806
Kla...

807
01:06:32,286 --> 01:06:33,966
The nurse testified that

808
01:06:35,238 --> 01:06:37,806
someone called her and said you wanted to transfer Nate overseas.

809
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:41,446
So, Khem chased after the ambulance and went out together.

810
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,406
Now, the police found the abandoned ambulance.

811
01:06:44,854 --> 01:06:46,286
But the dashcam is gone.

812
01:06:46,956 --> 01:06:48,766
But we have the recording from the pen camera.

813
01:06:49,941 --> 01:06:51,806
You still can't use it as evidence.

814
01:06:52,469 --> 01:06:53,886
We have to get that pen camera.

815
01:06:56,507 --> 01:06:58,286
Kloy, give me the bag.

816
01:07:07,878 --> 01:07:09,206
Nate's tablet is gone.

817
01:07:19,264 --> 01:07:20,264
What's wrong?

818
01:07:20,414 --> 01:07:23,206
His wife found this near the canal the other day.

819
01:07:25,487 --> 01:07:27,086
(To Ms. Saikhim Kidakarn)

820
01:07:28,766 --> 01:07:29,806
Thank you.

821
01:07:42,686 --> 01:07:43,806
What's this envelope?

822
01:07:51,174 --> 01:07:53,174
The director appointment letter.

823
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,820
We're going to fire him from the director position

824
01:07:56,118 --> 01:07:58,118
because he lacks ethics and morals.

825
01:07:58,371 --> 01:07:59,406
Throw it away.

826
01:08:06,206 --> 01:08:07,246
What's that?

827
01:08:12,806 --> 01:08:13,966
Here you are.

828
01:08:20,675 --> 01:08:21,675
Kloy.

829
01:08:30,589 --> 01:08:31,989
Waiting for her in front of the toilet?

830
01:08:33,757 --> 01:08:36,126
Kloy wasn't brave enough to go to the toilet alone.

831
01:08:36,398 --> 01:08:37,966
But now, she isn't scared anymore.

832
01:08:38,142 --> 01:08:41,046
I had to sing a song or whistle

833
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:42,766
to make Kloy finish her business.

834
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:45,006
Is this already romantic for you?

835
01:09:04,366 --> 01:09:05,806
Although he didn't say goodbye,

836
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:08,286
I know he's worried about you.

837
01:09:10,374 --> 01:09:11,486
No matter where we are,

838
01:09:11,622 --> 01:09:13,926
we'll still see him supporting us beside us.

839
01:09:19,686 --> 01:09:21,326
We owed him a lot.

840
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:23,686
Don't make him worry about us.

841
01:09:27,646 --> 01:09:28,886
Kla...

842
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:05,286
(For the rest of my life,)

843
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:08,926
(whether it's seven years, eight years, or ten years,)

844
01:10:09,486 --> 01:10:10,646
(I give it all to you.)

845
01:10:11,045 --> 01:10:12,686
(Why would I want that lowly life?)

846
01:10:13,485 --> 01:10:14,966
You're smelly trash.

847
01:10:15,126 --> 01:10:18,806
Hey, when it's necessary one day, you'll realize that this pile of trash

848
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:20,046
can die for you.

849
01:10:23,821 --> 01:10:25,166
The lollipop of oath.

850
01:10:25,581 --> 01:10:27,346
We'll share our happiness together.

851
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:30,446
Hey, you don't really love me, do you?

852
01:10:30,765 --> 01:10:32,966
We won't even share our happiness together.

853
01:10:33,094 --> 01:10:35,446
Can we really share our pain together then?

854
01:10:36,062 --> 01:10:37,206
Lick it.

855
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:53,046
You're more than my friend, Khem.

856
01:11:49,383 --> 01:11:50,543
Thank you

857
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,206
for accompanying Kla.

858
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:54,206
I want to know

859
01:11:54,845 --> 01:11:57,406
why Ms. Asia was so cruel to us.

860
01:12:00,886 --> 01:12:02,166
I just learned about this.

861
01:12:02,406 --> 01:12:04,646
Kla hasn't told me anything.

862
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:09,886
I thought she adopted Kla because she felt sorry for him.

863
01:12:10,342 --> 01:12:11,846
I think she's grudgeful.

864
01:12:12,212 --> 01:12:14,086
She thought Kla was just a bastard child.

865
01:12:14,484 --> 01:12:16,086
So, she couldn't truly accept him.

866
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:17,943
It's so unfair.

867
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,846
Kla didn't choose to be born.

868
01:12:22,397 --> 01:12:25,526
I thought I'm already unfortunate, but actually,

869
01:12:26,646 --> 01:12:28,966
Kla isn't that different from me.

870
01:12:35,926 --> 01:12:37,526
I'll excuse myself for a bit.

871
01:12:40,707 --> 01:12:42,926
Khim, I'm at the place now.

872
01:12:43,206 --> 01:12:44,606
Have you found Mr. Chartchai?

873
01:12:44,702 --> 01:12:45,926
(I haven't seen him.)

874
01:12:46,094 --> 01:12:49,006
But why do you think he's a traitor?

875
01:12:49,405 --> 01:12:50,526
I don't know.

876
01:12:50,982 --> 01:12:53,846
Since the incident happened, he has never shown his face.

877
01:12:54,438 --> 01:12:56,366
He might be the spy for that side.

878
01:12:56,606 --> 01:12:58,766
(Aside from him, I can't think of anyone else)

879
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:01,646
who can use Kla's computer.

880
01:13:01,925 --> 01:13:02,925
I see.

881
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:07,246
Why did you come here?

882
01:13:10,246 --> 01:13:11,246
Did you find him?

883
01:13:11,405 --> 01:13:13,926
Khim, I'll call you as soon as I find him. I need to go now.

884
01:13:14,653 --> 01:13:15,726
Lita.

885
01:13:17,238 --> 01:13:18,806
I told you not to come here.

886
01:13:19,118 --> 01:13:20,766
You shouldn't risk yourself for this.

887
01:13:21,013 --> 01:13:23,966
If you show your face now, they'll get suspicious.

888
01:13:26,525 --> 01:13:28,681
- Go back. - I won't go back.

889
01:13:28,813 --> 01:13:30,966
If we go back, it'll be a waste for us to come here.

890
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:32,766
We're almost there.

891
01:13:33,126 --> 01:13:34,286
Then, stay still.

892
01:13:34,663 --> 01:13:35,686
Don't risk yourself.

893
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:37,526
I'll go instead.

894
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:42,326
You give your command here. If I can catch the culprit,

895
01:13:42,966 --> 01:13:44,046
I want a reward.

896
01:13:44,246 --> 01:13:46,126
What should be the reward?

897
01:13:48,045 --> 01:13:49,566
If this mission is successful,

898
01:13:49,934 --> 01:13:51,221
we'll reveal we're together tomorrow.

899
01:13:51,366 --> 01:13:53,926
Hey, you're forcing me right now.

900
01:13:54,246 --> 01:13:55,386
Then, I'll go back.

901
01:13:56,366 --> 01:13:58,046
Don't be sulky.

902
01:13:58,326 --> 01:13:59,526
Thaen.

903
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:01,966
We will risk it together.

904
01:14:23,909 --> 01:14:26,206
- Hello? - Mr. Chartchai is really here.

905
01:14:26,453 --> 01:14:28,245
(He really does know Ms. Asia.)

906
01:14:28,365 --> 01:14:30,846
Your deduction is probably true then.

907
01:14:31,086 --> 01:14:32,566
(He must be the spy.)

908
01:14:32,766 --> 01:14:34,326
Are they together right now?

909
01:14:36,286 --> 01:14:37,766
You must keep your mouth shut.

910
01:14:53,726 --> 01:14:55,366
Dad, take Kloy to rest first.

911
01:14:55,775 --> 01:14:57,046
I think she can't take it anymore.

912
01:15:01,349 --> 01:15:03,166
Don't worry. What about you?

913
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:05,286
I'll sleep here with Khem.

914
01:15:06,326 --> 01:15:07,614
Are you sure?

915
01:15:08,646 --> 01:15:11,126
You haven't got to rest for a day since the incident.

916
01:15:11,437 --> 01:15:14,086
I rather sacrifice my sleep than die with my grudge.

917
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:16,885
I'm a lot more fortunate than Khem.

918
01:15:21,086 --> 01:15:23,726
You need to be focused and strong.

919
01:15:24,181 --> 01:15:26,006
We have to fight for Khem.

920
01:15:26,631 --> 01:15:29,446
Don't be bogged down in sadness that you forget everything else.

921
01:15:34,206 --> 01:15:35,446
Remember.

922
01:15:35,974 --> 01:15:37,726
Every single of our breath

923
01:15:38,749 --> 01:15:41,326
can be used to demand justice for Khem.

924
01:15:42,366 --> 01:15:43,446
Yes, Dad.

925
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:49,406
Let's go.

926
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:04,030
Don't force yourself if you can't.

927
01:16:04,718 --> 01:16:07,526
One night of sleep can make you feel better.

928
01:16:09,669 --> 01:16:12,286
But if you need anything, please tell me.

929
01:16:13,126 --> 01:16:14,766
I'll come and stay with you.

930
01:16:15,133 --> 01:16:16,166
It's you

931
01:16:16,311 --> 01:16:17,766
who has to take care of yourself.

932
01:16:19,373 --> 01:16:21,206
I should be the one who takes care of you.

933
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:24,286
You only need to keep yourself safe.

934
01:16:24,726 --> 01:16:26,446
You're important to all of us.

935
01:16:26,589 --> 01:16:27,686
Do you know that?

936
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:01,926
For every second you suffered,

937
01:17:02,063 --> 01:17:03,846
someone else must suffer more than you.

938
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,326
Mr. Carl is in the dining room.

939
01:17:41,796 --> 01:17:45,326
I've never thought I would welcome Ms. Saikhim here again.

940
01:17:46,573 --> 01:17:49,246
I'm sorry that I have to bother you at night.

941
01:17:51,676 --> 01:17:53,966
I don't know that you're also in mourning.

942
01:17:56,014 --> 01:17:58,646
Actually, I want to express my condolences to you.

943
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:02,726
But I don't know if you're really sad about it.

944
01:18:02,926 --> 01:18:04,091
Did Carl send you here?

945
01:18:04,206 --> 01:18:06,046
He didn't know I came here.

946
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:08,886
Why did you frame him for your son's case?

947
01:18:09,406 --> 01:18:10,726
What did Carl do to you?

948
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:13,526
You're defending him right now?

949
01:18:13,686 --> 01:18:16,126
I'm confident he's innocent.

950
01:18:16,518 --> 01:18:17,526
It's you

951
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:20,326
who deserves to be in prison for all your charges.

952
01:18:21,116 --> 01:18:23,006
Carl must be really touched

953
01:18:23,244 --> 01:18:25,646
if he knows that you're fighting for him here.

954
01:18:25,925 --> 01:18:29,526
It won't be a waste of his time that he has been waiting for this day.

955
01:18:30,029 --> 01:18:34,086
Finally, he'll have some good love like other people.

956
01:18:35,261 --> 01:18:37,526
If only he didn't get a life sentence.

957
01:18:38,734 --> 01:18:40,286
When a man doesn't love you,

958
01:18:40,926 --> 01:18:44,126
even if you do this, he'll never love you.

959
01:18:49,029 --> 01:18:51,326
You thought too highly of him.

960
01:18:52,246 --> 01:18:54,486
He didn't have such good honor.

961
01:18:54,846 --> 01:18:58,206
If Carl really felt something for you,

962
01:18:58,894 --> 01:19:02,446
you wouldn't be jealous and go insane like this.

963
01:19:03,686 --> 01:19:06,206
Do you think he's loyal to you?

964
01:19:06,398 --> 01:19:09,666
Tell me where he is right now.

965
01:19:16,975 --> 01:19:18,606
He has an appointment with me tonight.

966
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:20,294
Impossible.

967
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,686
Then, should we call him together?

968
01:19:23,622 --> 01:19:25,766
We'll see whose call he will answer.

969
01:19:26,774 --> 01:19:30,246
You don't dare to? Are you scared you can't accept the truth?

970
01:19:38,503 --> 01:19:39,806
Hello?

971
01:19:40,725 --> 01:19:42,006
You're here?

972
01:19:42,286 --> 01:19:43,486
Wait there for a bit.

973
01:19:43,694 --> 01:19:46,086
I have a surprise guest.

974
01:19:46,685 --> 01:19:47,845
I'll go there.

975
01:19:50,366 --> 01:19:53,246
Go see if he has lied to you.

976
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:55,926
If you really know him,

977
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:58,886
you should know he's a trickster.

978
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:07,846
You came here for him.

979
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:09,726
If he knows you're here,

980
01:20:09,926 --> 01:20:11,766
he must be so touched.

981
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:14,086
If you want to gain his affection,

982
01:20:14,262 --> 01:20:16,366
go tell him yourself.

983
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:34,526
You're here.

984
01:20:34,926 --> 01:20:36,726
I thought you would come earlier.

985
01:20:37,015 --> 01:20:38,366
Why did you do this?

986
01:20:38,902 --> 01:20:40,806
Nate doesn't want to live anymore.

987
01:20:41,382 --> 01:20:44,126
I only made him die as he wished.

988
01:20:44,575 --> 01:20:46,366
But no matter how he died,

989
01:20:46,566 --> 01:20:48,046
it'll probably be the same.

990
01:20:48,246 --> 01:20:50,366
You don't have a trace of humanity left in you.

991
01:20:50,877 --> 01:20:53,486
I'm not even sure if Nate really wanted to die.

992
01:20:54,205 --> 01:20:55,302
Even though he's your son,

993
01:20:55,566 --> 01:20:57,526
you have no right to decide his fate

994
01:20:58,335 --> 01:21:00,006
or use him to hurt anyone!

995
01:21:00,246 --> 01:21:01,366
Hey.

996
01:21:02,142 --> 01:21:03,427
If you're so worried about him,

997
01:21:03,452 --> 01:21:05,246
why did you abandon him in the first place?

998
01:21:05,606 --> 01:21:08,206
You let him lie uselessly on the bed,

999
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,430
making him feel worthless.

1000
01:21:10,645 --> 01:21:12,006
You also said

1001
01:21:12,135 --> 01:21:14,686
that I was a bad mother who kept him alive.

1002
01:21:14,823 --> 01:21:17,446
And you suddenly want to be the hero

1003
01:21:17,663 --> 01:21:19,766
who wants to prolong his life.

1004
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:21,406
A family member

1005
01:21:21,717 --> 01:21:24,046
wouldn't abandon them in the first place!

1006
01:21:24,486 --> 01:21:25,686
Remember that!

1007
01:21:26,341 --> 01:21:28,566
You also hadn't viewed me as your family.

1008
01:21:29,126 --> 01:21:31,246
You can't blame me that I destroyed it.

1009
01:21:31,606 --> 01:21:33,166
For everything you've done,

1010
01:21:33,934 --> 01:21:36,486
you only did it for your satisfaction, didn't you?

1011
01:21:37,166 --> 01:21:38,166
Yes.

1012
01:21:38,606 --> 01:21:40,086
If I have no one left,

1013
01:21:40,468 --> 01:21:42,686
you also shouldn't have anything left.

1014
01:21:43,574 --> 01:21:45,726
Your life is so valuable, isn't it?

1015
01:21:46,357 --> 01:21:48,646
How dare you treat us like dogs?

1016
01:21:48,926 --> 01:21:50,246
You raise it when you want.

1017
01:21:50,486 --> 01:21:51,686
You kill it when you want.

1018
01:21:51,886 --> 01:21:53,326
If it wasn't for Nate,

1019
01:21:53,645 --> 01:21:56,726
someone like you wouldn't even be born.

1020
01:21:57,846 --> 01:22:00,606
I know that. Can I choose to be born or not?

1021
01:22:00,846 --> 01:22:03,246
Go blame your husband who gave birth to me.

1022
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:05,646
You let me be born to prolong your own son's life.

1023
01:22:05,886 --> 01:22:07,766
But when I had a better life than your son,

1024
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:10,430
you saw me as a thorn in your side.

1025
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,846
If having me brought so much suffering,

1026
01:22:13,229 --> 01:22:14,926
you should learn to fix yourself.

1027
01:22:15,351 --> 01:22:17,351
How could you blame it on me?

1028
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,206
How is it related to me?

1029
01:22:38,366 --> 01:22:39,366
And so what?

1030
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,806
You came here today.

1031
01:22:44,143 --> 01:22:45,806
What do you want from me?

1032
01:22:47,286 --> 01:22:49,206
I'm here to demand justice for Khem.

1033
01:22:49,926 --> 01:22:51,286
He had nothing to do with this.

1034
01:22:52,086 --> 01:22:54,486
Since he got involved in this matter himself,

1035
01:22:55,525 --> 01:22:57,646
will you really let him die for nothing?

1036
01:22:58,589 --> 01:23:00,326
Make him take the fall.

1037
01:23:01,086 --> 01:23:02,406
You can say anything.

1038
01:23:02,606 --> 01:23:04,206
He must be so touched

1039
01:23:04,966 --> 01:23:07,446
that he got to sacrifice his life to protect you.

1040
01:23:11,204 --> 01:23:13,326
Your thoughts are really rotten.

1041
01:23:15,606 --> 01:23:17,686
Do you never have some nice thoughts in your head?

1042
01:23:22,486 --> 01:23:24,446
Don't try to act like the protagonist in front of me.

1043
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:28,126
I know who you actually are.

1044
01:23:35,326 --> 01:23:37,766
So, you wanted to use him to make me innocent

1045
01:23:37,926 --> 01:23:39,166
or to make you innocent?

1046
01:23:45,926 --> 01:23:48,166
If you don't make him take the blame,

1047
01:23:49,869 --> 01:23:51,526
you have to accept the blame yourself.

1048
01:23:55,949 --> 01:23:58,406
Are you trying to make me stay in prison forever?

1049
01:24:08,214 --> 01:24:09,766
We've known each other for so long.

1050
01:24:11,037 --> 01:24:12,886
You always do everything for yourself.

1051
01:24:13,261 --> 01:24:15,686
This isn't the first time.

1052
01:24:16,557 --> 01:24:18,726
We should make a deal for this.

1053
01:24:19,478 --> 01:24:22,606
Let Khem take the fall to end everything quickly.

1054
01:24:22,982 --> 01:24:26,726
Only the two of us will know about this.

1055
01:24:27,478 --> 01:24:29,478
I won't be human anymore if I do that.

1056
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:35,486
There are more horrible things that only the two of us know.

1057
01:24:36,014 --> 01:24:37,646
This isn't the first thing.

1058
01:24:46,726 --> 01:24:48,686
If Saikhim knows the truth,

1059
01:24:49,222 --> 01:24:50,942
she'll never be able to accept it

1060
01:24:51,327 --> 01:24:53,086
because she's not that thick-skinned.

1061
01:24:53,309 --> 01:24:56,246
She'll never be able to accept your horrible attributes.

1062
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:58,286
But for us,

1063
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:02,206
a small matter like this doesn't even matter.

1064
01:25:11,246 --> 01:25:13,726
No one knows you as well as I do.

1065
01:25:14,006 --> 01:25:18,246
You've never revealed your true nature to anyone except me.

1066
01:25:19,101 --> 01:25:20,101
Cheers.

1067
01:25:30,206 --> 01:25:31,366
That's true.

1068
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:43,067
I've never been this horrible to anyone.

1069
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:45,726
For what you did to Khem and Nate,

1070
01:25:47,305 --> 01:25:48,846
I'll do the same thing to you.

1071
01:25:49,286 --> 01:25:50,646
You offered yourself to me,

1072
01:25:50,886 --> 01:25:53,166
so you got to drink your own poison.

1073
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:57,886
The same poison you used on them.

1074
01:25:59,406 --> 01:26:01,206
I'm here to demand justice for them.

1075
01:26:02,686 --> 01:26:05,006
Prepare to receive your karma for what you did to them.

1076
01:26:12,806 --> 01:26:14,726
You said you wanted to see Nate rest in peace.

1077
01:26:14,982 --> 01:26:17,886
You only know if he could really go in peace.

1078
01:26:18,655 --> 01:26:20,326
If you drink it,

1079
01:26:20,584 --> 01:26:22,366
the effect will be slow.

1080
01:26:22,727 --> 01:26:24,727
But it'll be far more torturous than what Khem got.

1081
01:26:25,069 --> 01:26:26,606
When it gets into your nervous system,

1082
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:28,246
you'll be unable to breathe.

1083
01:26:30,389 --> 01:26:31,806
Can you still breathe?

1084
01:26:31,942 --> 01:26:33,926
Kla, what are you doing?

1085
01:26:34,077 --> 01:26:36,206
- Please stop. - I'm making her understand

1086
01:26:36,726 --> 01:26:38,846
how it feels like when she's dying.

1087
01:26:42,328 --> 01:26:43,389
You scoundrel.

1088
01:26:52,775 --> 01:26:54,906
Kla, please stop.

1089
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:56,486
She can't stand it anymore.

1090
01:26:56,686 --> 01:26:59,486
We should call the hospital, Kla.

1091
01:27:01,054 --> 01:27:02,646
In a few seconds,

1092
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,406
you'll feel nothing.

1093
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:07,190
Do you have any last words?

1094
01:27:07,531 --> 01:27:09,246
You're a scoundrel.

1095
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:11,326
You're the same as your dad.

1096
01:27:11,711 --> 01:27:13,326
They said when you're dying,

1097
01:27:13,709 --> 01:27:15,166
you should only think of nice things.

1098
01:27:15,773 --> 01:27:18,253
But have you ever done anything nice in your life?

1099
01:27:24,886 --> 01:27:26,086
Kla...

1100
01:27:28,806 --> 01:27:30,286
You're sweating all over your body.

1101
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:32,726
The poison must be everywhere now.

1102
01:27:33,966 --> 01:27:36,646
You pushed me into corners to bring out my darkness,

1103
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,366
but I won't fall for your trick.

1104
01:27:38,741 --> 01:27:40,126
I'll never do anything reckless

1105
01:27:40,277 --> 01:27:41,825
because I still love my own life

1106
01:27:42,045 --> 01:27:44,686
and I still want to live with Saikhim for a long time.

1107
01:27:46,765 --> 01:27:47,926
Help.

1108
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,086
Help.

1109
01:27:50,318 --> 01:27:51,446
So,

1110
01:27:51,838 --> 01:27:54,166
I'll never lower myself to kill you.

1111
01:27:58,046 --> 01:28:00,086
I didn't add poison to your glass.

1112
01:28:01,206 --> 01:28:02,846
You're imagining things yourself.

1113
01:28:17,926 --> 01:28:20,166
You were suffering and crawling on the floor.

1114
01:28:22,454 --> 01:28:24,606
It's a condition of someone who did something wrong.

1115
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:28,246
You'll never get to see my horrible side even if you want to see it.

1116
01:28:28,446 --> 01:28:31,686
Because I'm not the same Kaokla who only used my emotions.

1117
01:28:32,166 --> 01:28:34,726
I'll live my life nicely to make you feel jealous.

1118
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:37,766
As for you, please live with your suffering

1119
01:28:37,989 --> 01:28:40,326
and curse at me from the prison.

1120
01:28:53,725 --> 01:28:55,046
Why did you do this?

1121
01:28:55,366 --> 01:28:56,606
Why did you come here?

1122
01:28:56,806 --> 01:28:57,966
Don't you know it's dangerous?

1123
01:28:58,102 --> 01:29:00,246
I find out Mr. Chartchai is her spy.

1124
01:29:00,932 --> 01:29:01,932
Khim.

1125
01:29:02,286 --> 01:29:04,566
It's useless to use the truth to threaten someone.

1126
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:06,326
But this is also risky for you.

1127
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:09,210
Kaokla.

1128
01:29:09,406 --> 01:29:11,166
You'll pay for this.

1129
01:29:13,176 --> 01:29:14,246
Khim, watch out.

1130
01:29:16,486 --> 01:29:20,046
Your friend knew you would get framed, so he prepared the evidence.

1131
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:23,566
If you want the case to end, kneel in front of me here.

1132
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:25,366
Kla has disappeared.

1133
01:29:25,566 --> 01:29:27,006
He wants to go all-in again.

1134
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:28,766
Can you think of him as your other son?

1135
01:29:29,126 --> 01:29:30,486
Don't hate him

1136
01:29:30,726 --> 01:29:32,646
or bother him like how you've done before.

1137
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:36,046
I don't want it to be like that, but I can't stay still like this.

1138
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:37,926
Don't live to wait for me.

1139
01:29:38,046 --> 01:29:40,526
Your life is far more valuable than being with a man like me.

1140
01:29:40,646 --> 01:29:43,526
Everything is getting better. Why does this have to happen?

1141
01:29:43,726 --> 01:29:45,526
Don't we still love each other?

1142
01:29:45,638 --> 01:29:47,206
Why did you have to leave me?

1143
01:29:47,311 --> 01:29:49,486
If we could turn back time...

1144
01:29:49,622 --> 01:29:52,846
What happened between us, can it be called love?

1145
01:29:53,086 --> 01:29:56,486
If it's true, I'm ready to wait for you.
