1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:01,100
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,181 --> 00:00:02,246
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:03,516
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,644 --> 00:02:46,850
I'll set it so that you can make up with her on the island as you asked.

5
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:49,006
I thought my heart had already stopped beating.

6
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:50,686
I only realized it's still beating

7
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,086
when I met her again.

8
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:55,406
No woman has ever made my heart beat as strongly as her.

9
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:57,566
I hope your wish will come true

10
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,086
to make you know how to love again.

11
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:02,926
You should ask yourself

12
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:04,606
how you see him.

13
00:03:05,206 --> 00:03:07,286
I can only see his good points.

14
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:10,240
Tell me if you don't want it to end. We can still go back.

15
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:11,766
That breakup letter

16
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,125
was faked by someone.

17
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:14,766
I'll crush my father-in-law

18
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:16,405
if you give something back to me.

19
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:17,566
What's that?

20
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,670
The letter that Khim wrote for me in prison.

21
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:21,046
What will you do now?

22
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,526
I'll take my revenge against the one who separated me and Khim.

23
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:28,427
(The way back to love.)

24
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:32,566
(Love is when we expose our weaknesses to someone else.)

25
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:38,326
(And I still let the same person play with my feelings.)

26
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:43,166
(I'm curious how many times we can fall in love with the same person.)

27
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:46,806
(Because it looks like I can't move on from this man.)

28
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,541
It has become a universal trend

29
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:55,365
for people nowadays to pay attention not only to their physical,

30
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,246
but to their mental health as well.

31
00:03:57,381 --> 00:04:02,206
At our hotel, we intend to eliminate any mental exhaustion of our guests.

32
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,946
They will be provided with a real sense of relaxation.

33
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:08,086
If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask me.

34
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:10,846
Hey, your nose is bleeding.

35
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:17,006
I'm so sorry.

36
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:22,886
I think you're overworking yourself.

37
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:24,526
Please have some rest.

38
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:37,966
I have to go see my dad.

39
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:49,726
I'm waiting for Simon's reply.

40
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,686
I hope he won't reject us again.

41
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:55,206
Why did everyone reject us?

42
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:58,086
Isn't it because of Kaokla?

43
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:04,846
No. I haven't heard anything from him.

44
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:06,846
He's probably still in America.

45
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,486
You didn't protect him, right?

46
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:20,326
I know you don't trust me.

47
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:21,886
But for now,

48
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:23,766
please don't suspect each other.

49
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:25,406
We need to fix these problems.

50
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:27,126
You know that

51
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,726
I'll never let

52
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:31,886
everything that I've been building to be ruined in front of my eyes?

53
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,726
Thank you for trusting me, Mom.

54
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:41,366
I hope I won't be disappointed in trusting you.

55
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:44,446
What the heck is wrong with you?

56
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:46,423
Why didn't you tell me about it?

57
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,006
If we told you,

58
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,606
everything would be exposed.

59
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:51,006
Mom.

60
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,846
Can't we just live by ourselves without Uncle Sin?

61
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:56,646
Trust me.

62
00:05:57,142 --> 00:05:59,046
We don't have to depend on Uncle Sin anymore.

63
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,046
Mom.

64
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:03,046
Do as your brother said.

65
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:07,446
Mom, did you drop the bomb on Thaen's family?

66
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:12,806
Send this to the address. Don't tell them who sent it.

67
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:15,144
(Recipient)

68
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:16,255
(Mr. Thamrong Tulanont)

69
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:25,606
Is something the matter, Dad?

70
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,526
Look at this.

71
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:29,606
You got scammed by them.

72
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,617
Saikhim has been married before.

73
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:32,966
Did you know

74
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:34,878
that you're dating a divorcee?

75
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:37,486
(Marriage Certificate)

76
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,646
Where did you get it?

77
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,446
Someone dropped it in our mailbox.

78
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,086
There is no sender's name.

79
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,766
They're probably afraid you'll be deceived.

80
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,446
It might be her ex-husband who's trying to blackmail you.

81
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:52,766
I had sent my people to investigate it.

82
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:54,765
He's just a prisoner.

83
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:57,046
I don't know where he is right now.

84
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:01,566
If it's him, I can easily find him.

85
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,046
Are you saying you already knew about this

86
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,326
and you still want to marry her?

87
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:10,086
Cancel the wedding.

88
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:14,366
I'll never let that scandalous woman become my daughter-in-law.

89
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:18,966
Dad, what year is it now?

90
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:21,326
You can't judge Khim from something like this.

91
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,926
Stop getting involved with that family.

92
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:24,646
This is my ultimatum.

93
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,092
I know you're stressed about your hotel.

94
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,446
But, my dad...

95
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,566
I understand.

96
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:49,046
I'll take responsibility for everything.

97
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:50,886
What do you mean?

98
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:53,286
I ruined everything

99
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:55,686
because I can't divorce.

100
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:57,486
If the wedding gets canceled,

101
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:59,526
I'll be the one who ends it.

102
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:01,853
You won't get pressured by your family

103
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,726
and you'll stop being used by my dad.

104
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:08,606
Khim.

105
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:19,646
I know that you also feel uncomfortable.

106
00:08:20,637 --> 00:08:23,646
We shouldn't let this make us hate each other.

107
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:27,806
But...

108
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:30,046
Are we going to end it like this?

109
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:38,806
Thaen.

110
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:43,326
If your gentleness makes you feel hesitant or unsure,

111
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:46,806
I want you to think about it carefully

112
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:48,606
whether I am

113
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:51,526
still the woman that you want.

114
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,086
If you only want to prove

115
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:57,246
that you aren't as bad as the man I've met before,

116
00:08:57,517 --> 00:09:00,966
you shouldn't use your entire life to prove it.

117
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:23,263
It's good that you canceled the wedding.

118
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:24,966
Both that son and his dad are useless.

119
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:30,086
There's still no investor who has contacted us back.

120
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,086
The large shareholders

121
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:33,486
see that it's a bad situation.

122
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:35,326
They're selling their shares.

123
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:38,126
We have to make them trust again quickly.

124
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,126
We have a problem.

125
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:43,366
Kaokla secretly bought our hotel's shares.

126
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,326
How is it possible? Why didn't we know about this?

127
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,166
He used a nominee to buy them.

128
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:54,566
(He has slowly bought shares from the large)

129
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:56,366
(and small shareholders.)

130
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,566
(Now, he transferred all of the shares to be under his name.)

131
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:02,366
(He might be the largest shareholder)

132
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:05,526
(who'll make us lose the authority on our hotel.)

133
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:17,646
How is it possible? How could he be the largest shareholder?

134
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,846
Unless someone inside sold the shares to him.

135
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:22,222
Well...

136
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:25,206
The ones who sold the shares to Kaokla

137
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:28,206
were Mr. Prompt and Ms. Pijika.

138
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:42,006
Surprise.

139
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:52,726
I was thinking of meeting you at the shareholders' meeting.

140
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:55,286
But I couldn't wait.

141
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:56,646
Kla.

142
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,966
Please be polite to me.

143
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:01,126
Don't forget that I'm the one who saved your hotel.

144
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:04,726
You're really a devil.

145
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:08,166
You're bad at managing hotels and you're also rude.

146
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,646
You should be dismissed.

147
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:11,206
- You're... - Dad.

148
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:20,646
- Did you and... - Khim doesn't know anything. Don't drag her involved.

149
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:22,246
This is between us.

150
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:26,726
Enough.

151
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:29,966
Mr. Sansern.

152
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:32,326
- Please take Dad outside first. - Yes.

153
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,966
Why did you do this?

154
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:53,966
I admitted that I want to get back at your dad.

155
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:56,334
But actually, I'm here to help you.

156
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:58,486
Help? How would you help me?

157
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:01,046
What you did hurt me and my dad.

158
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:03,046
He's the one who hurt both of us.

159
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,326
Why would you protect him?

160
00:12:04,461 --> 00:12:06,486
Because he's my dad.

161
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,726
I don't know what your plan is.

162
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:13,846
But don't think that you can take our hotel from us.

163
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,126
It's not my plan to take anything from you.

164
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:19,206
But if you still let your dad manage everything,

165
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,606
you'll get filed for bankruptcy one day.

166
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:24,046
How could I trust you?

167
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,166
I'll prove my innocence.

168
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:28,846
If you want to prove your innocence,

169
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:31,046
divorce me.

170
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,006
Are you back, Uncle Sin?

171
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:44,086
Uncle Sin, I don't know anything.

172
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:46,144
I didn't sell my share to Kaokla.

173
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:48,726
- Get out. - What did you just say?

174
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:50,606
I told you to get out!

175
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:56,749
You chase everyone away from you.

176
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:58,846
You might be left with no one.

177
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:04,726
Tomorrow, I'll ask people to move my belongings.

178
00:13:22,286 --> 00:13:24,206
Please go take a rest upstairs.

179
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,086
Didn't you hear me?

180
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:29,286
I told you to get out, including you.

181
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:31,206
Why do you have to care about those two?

182
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:33,366
You've never protected me and my kids.

183
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:35,046
If you don't tell me why you want it,

184
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:36,886
it means you don't trust me.

185
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,766
You let Prompt get chased away like a dog.

186
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,566
How could I trust you?

187
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:50,406
If you think they're better than me,

188
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:53,286
go resign from your position.

189
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:05,006
You're so quick. You got to act as a hero before me.

190
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:08,886
I shouldn't have let you see that I was in contact with Pijika.

191
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:11,886
Otherwise, Saikhim's hotel would already be mine.

192
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:18,501
What are you trying to do?

193
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:20,246
I'm just doing my business.

194
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,566
Don't overthink it.

195
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:24,486
Don't think of using Khim to negotiate with me.

196
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:27,086
Then, come back and do business with us.

197
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:29,646
I'll stop bothering Saikhim.

198
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:31,206
I won't go back.

199
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:35,126
Do you think Saikhim will care about you

200
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,270
if you stay over there?

201
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:38,926
In her eyes,

202
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:40,646
you can only be

203
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:42,126
a traitor

204
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:43,726
who stole her hotel.

205
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:47,966
I have my entire life to explain myself to her for that.

206
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,366
I'll warn you one last time.

207
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,366
Don't bother my woman.

208
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:19,286
Are you also going to say goodbye to me?

209
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:20,926
No.

210
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:23,446
I'm here to take a look at you.

211
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:27,846
Are you hungry?

212
00:15:28,206 --> 00:15:31,726
I'll make something downstairs, so you can take your medicine.

213
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:33,766
You must be satisfied right now

214
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:36,566
that you see me losing, right?

215
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,966
Dad, you're too pessimistic.

216
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,766
Go to him if you want to see him that much. I can stay here alone.

217
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:44,686
Dad, stop chasing me away.

218
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:48,366
How much more do I have to do to make you trust me?

219
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:51,326
If I can get our hotel back,

220
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:53,646
- Will you trust me? - No way.

221
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,886
You'll never get our hotel back.

222
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:01,166
- It's over. Can't you hear me? - It's not over, Dad.

223
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:03,446
It's not over.

224
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:06,846
I'll make you see that I can do more than what you thought of me.

225
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,526
You'll finally stop looking down on me.

226
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,966
If Mr. Carl becomes the new president,

227
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:35,686
there's nothing to be worried about.

228
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,846
Can I talk with you?

229
00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:46,846
Can I talk with you?

230
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:51,846
I'll excuse myself.

231
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:56,366
Do you have time to let me explain?

232
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:01,286
Sure. I have some time.

233
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,621
But you have to promise me you'll tell the truth.

234
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:05,286
I promise

235
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,981
I'll tell the truth to you.

236
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:11,766
Okay.

237
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,606
Meet me at the garage this evening.

238
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,646
Wait.

239
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:21,446
I'll wait for you there.

240
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:44,246
Have a seat.

241
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:05,806
What do you want to ask me?

242
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,926
Why did you get involved with my hotel?

243
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:15,206
Asia is going to take over your hotel.

244
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,926
She lobbied Ms. Pijika and other shareholders,

245
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,926
- So I have to... - Why didn't you tell me?

246
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:25,054
You wouldn't let me help if I told you.

247
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,726
If you want to take down Asia,

248
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:31,526
you need to use me to your advantage.

249
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:33,646
Let's just say I'm sorry

250
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:35,446
for not consulting with you.

251
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:43,246
Are you going to dismiss my dad?

252
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,686
He deserved to be dismissed.

253
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,566
This is the time for everyone to see your talents.

254
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:51,686
I know how much you have worked for your business.

255
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:53,766
Even if no one sees it,

256
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,526
I know that this hotel still exists because of you alone.

257
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:58,606
You love this work so much.

258
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:01,886
I'll help you protect your beloved hotel

259
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:04,246
until Asia stops targeting you.

260
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:06,166
Consider this a present from me.

261
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,926
Why did you do this?

262
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:12,406
What do you want? I...

263
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:19,341
I want something impossible.

264
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:22,926
You're the only one I want.

265
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:31,686
Please reconcile with me.

266
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,446
You have to stop manipulating me.

267
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:41,166
I ran after you to explain myself,

268
00:19:41,422 --> 00:19:42,622
but you went back first.

269
00:19:43,085 --> 00:19:45,806
You have to stop playing with someone else's feelings.

270
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,086
I'll go back if you only want to talk about this.

271
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:39,166
How did it get here?

272
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:44,846
(If we're back together, Clare is unnecessary for me any longer.)

273
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:50,309
I hope we can fix everything in time.

274
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:56,686
He broke up with Claire and came back to you?

275
00:20:57,094 --> 00:20:58,846
It seems like that.

276
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:02,566
Khim has never stopped loving you.

277
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:04,766
If this can be the last chance

278
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:07,406
to make you and Khim love each other again,

279
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,126
grab it.

280
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,281
Khim, you should calm down.

281
00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:16,926
You need to make sure first.

282
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:19,086
I know that.

283
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:23,886
Actually, I'm afraid he might have another plan up his sleeve.

284
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:28,646
Since he's this close to you,

285
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:32,086
you should keep your eyes on him for now.

286
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:35,766
About Thaen,

287
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,526
I'll handle it.

288
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:47,166
- Good job. - Excellent.

289
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:49,406
- Excellent. - What are you doing?

290
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,486
Thaen.

291
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,406
I know you're stressed, so I brought you here to vent it all out.

292
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:01,926
I like coming here to release my stress.

293
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:06,406
Try it.

294
00:22:07,318 --> 00:22:08,886
Take it. Here.

295
00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:14,966
I'll leave my friend to you. He's heartbroken.

296
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,286
- Don't worry. - You can do it.

297
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:23,606
It's your turn. You can think of the target

298
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:25,406
as Carl.

299
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:35,966
I know that you want to smack an ax at his head.

300
00:22:36,343 --> 00:22:37,926
What are you saying?

301
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:40,446
Think of it as Khim then.

302
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:49,446
It made me feel kind of good.

303
00:22:49,622 --> 00:22:51,046
You have some grudges.

304
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,846
But no. Not yet. We still need more than this.

305
00:22:56,363 --> 00:23:00,646
To make it fun, we need to build it up.

306
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,366
You prick.

307
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:11,646
Try it.

308
00:23:14,383 --> 00:23:15,886
That fickle woman.

309
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:20,046
No. Not yet. Not yet.

310
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,326
You only cursed that much?

311
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,246
Here, try it again.

312
00:23:26,686 --> 00:23:28,846
- More than that? - More than that.

313
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:30,846
Vent it all out.

314
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:33,446
That douchebag.

315
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:36,046
Good job.

316
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:41,926
He won't feel anything if you curse so softly like that.

317
00:23:45,606 --> 00:23:46,766
One more.

318
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,846
That donkey.

319
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:55,886
Wait.

320
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:57,926
Why was that curse so cute?

321
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:01,206
Look at me.

322
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:05,926
You loan shark.

323
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,245
What does that even mean?

324
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:13,046
He's taken everything from us.

325
00:24:57,661 --> 00:24:59,846
- Hello. - (Come see me.)

326
00:25:05,802 --> 00:25:07,926
(How to make up with a girlfriend)

327
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:20,646
What's wrong?

328
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:21,846
I'm sorry

329
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:23,726
for attacking you that much.

330
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:26,166
I won't rush you like that again.

331
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:29,726
I can't accept this.

332
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:32,406
I'll leave it with you for now.

333
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,526
No.

334
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:39,086
Please.

335
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:43,566
If you want me to open my heart to you again,

336
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,126
you must make me trust you first.

337
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,886
Should we start by making your hotel get a reassessment?

338
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:54,846
Can you do that?

339
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:57,566
The one who was hired by the chain owner is my friend.

340
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:00,526
Do you know Jerry?

341
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,126
Yes.

342
00:26:04,566 --> 00:26:05,806
Has Jerry arrived?

343
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,566
He said he would be here in 10 minutes.

344
00:26:08,162 --> 00:26:10,166
Let's cross the street.

345
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:12,406
Are you crazy?

346
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:15,366
The car was so fast. You would die if you went out like that.

347
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:17,926
You don't trust my skill to cross the streets?

348
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:20,006
It's not trustworthy.

349
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,406
Don't you know that a lot of people got into an accident here?

350
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:25,406
I'm not a local like you.

351
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:30,006
You can't even cross the street at this age.

352
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:32,286
You're looking down on me.

353
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:34,516
Don't you remember you almost got hit by

354
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,900
a car when you crossed the street?

355
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,286
Watch out.

356
00:26:38,446 --> 00:26:40,426
You would be dead if I didn't pull you away.

357
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:46,086
Now.

358
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:16,806
(Jerry will reassess our hotel.)

359
00:27:17,446 --> 00:27:19,846
(Do you trust me now that I want to help you?)

360
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:23,126
(Thank you for making the appointment.)

361
00:27:23,421 --> 00:27:24,766
(It's really alright.)

362
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,966
(He changed his mind because of you.)

363
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:30,926
(I promised my dad I would protect this hotel.)

364
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:34,126
Can you do it?

365
00:27:34,726 --> 00:27:36,286
I'll help you.

366
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:47,286
I have another appointment.

367
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,686
Be careful.

368
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:51,846
Be careful of what?

369
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:55,086
I might not be here again if you're running away from me.

370
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:10,646
You're so delicate.

371
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:19,966
Abracadabra. It'll get better soon. Don't worry.

372
00:28:21,886 --> 00:28:24,726
Thank you. But it still hurts

373
00:28:26,293 --> 00:28:27,526
in here.

374
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:36,846
That area needs some time to get better.

375
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:43,366
Can I dress your wound?

376
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:49,846
That wound needs strong medicine.

377
00:28:50,244 --> 00:28:51,766
If you don't want a scar,

378
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,646
you should let Khim treat you to not let them become a scab.

379
00:29:02,246 --> 00:29:05,166
I was the one who told Lita to invite you here.

380
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:08,166
I don't want us to be unable to face each other.

381
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:16,606
I heard Carl took over your hotel.

382
00:29:18,286 --> 00:29:19,446
Yes.

383
00:29:20,837 --> 00:29:24,126
It's karma. I'm paying for it now.

384
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,326
I don't know how I could get out of this cycle.

385
00:29:29,646 --> 00:29:30,846
But,

386
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,686
it's good that you got out of my life.

387
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:37,846
If not, your life might be ruined with me.

388
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:40,726
If I didn't leave,

389
00:29:41,253 --> 00:29:43,253
you would feel even more pain, right?

390
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,006
Maybe

391
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:53,886
I might not be worthy of any good love as Kla said.

392
00:29:57,766 --> 00:30:00,406
But still, I want you to be happy.

393
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:03,566
Even if your happiness

394
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:05,406
won't have me in it.

395
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:09,566
But I still hope

396
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:11,526
that someone

397
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:13,829
will make you

398
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,606
smile again.

399
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,446
(I hope love)

400
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:33,046
(becomes better than what I've dreamed.)

401
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:36,846
(I hope that one)

402
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:40,286
(is better at everything than me.)

403
00:31:09,957 --> 00:31:10,966
Hey.

404
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,566
What are you doing? Come down.

405
00:31:12,694 --> 00:31:13,766
Ouch.

406
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:15,179
What are you doing?

407
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,606
My scarf is up there.

408
00:31:20,014 --> 00:31:22,014
No. No.

409
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,526
Let me ask you first.

410
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:26,202
How are you? Are you alright?

411
00:31:26,432 --> 00:31:27,645
I'm better than you.

412
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:30,046
You don't need to act manly in front of me.

413
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,806
Say it if it hurts.

414
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:35,286
Say it if you can't stand it. If you want to cry...

415
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:37,726
Just cry.

416
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,166
I don't want to cry.

417
00:31:40,101 --> 00:31:41,526
I only want to do this for now.

418
00:31:43,006 --> 00:31:45,406
Hey, what are you doing?

419
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,286
Get it back.

420
00:32:12,993 --> 00:32:14,246
Are you really alright?

421
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:17,166
Are you lying?

422
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:18,486
Maybe I'm used to it.

423
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:19,766
Alright.

424
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,206
Your new love,

425
00:32:23,461 --> 00:32:25,606
I assure you it'll be better than this.

426
00:32:56,477 --> 00:32:58,006
I'm here to pick Lita up.

427
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:01,606
Oh.

428
00:33:02,892 --> 00:33:04,486
You're here.

429
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,486
Let me hug you.

430
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:16,966
I'm leaving, Thaen.

431
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:47,513
(They say to make up with a woman,)

432
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:49,109
(I need sincerity.)

433
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:51,846
(Is it cute that I'm trying to make up with you like this?)

434
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:56,326
(To Khim, I sent you a letter before,)

435
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:58,206
(but it didn't reach you.)

436
00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:00,166
(This one will reach you now.)

437
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,526
(I left it on the table myself.)

438
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,766
(No one could swap it this time.)

439
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:08,166
(There's something I haven't told you.)

440
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:11,206
(I read the letter that you wrote for me.)

441
00:34:11,686 --> 00:34:13,766
(You also read my letter, right?)

442
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:15,926
(I'm sorry, Khim.)

443
00:34:16,646 --> 00:34:20,486
(From now on, let me compensate for what I've done to you.)

444
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,526
(I hope this letter can be the beginning,)

445
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:25,422
(not the end like the last time.)

446
00:34:26,462 --> 00:34:27,726
(I love you.)

447
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,286
(If you want to hear these words with your own ears,)

448
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:34,846
(please come down to the front of the hotel. I'll be waiting.)

449
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:04,326
Be careful.

450
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:06,406
Be careful of what?

451
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:09,726
I might not be here again if you're running away from me.

452
00:35:34,806 --> 00:35:36,086
Answer my call.

453
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:42,806
Where is he?

454
00:36:05,774 --> 00:36:06,914
(Khem.)

455
00:36:07,437 --> 00:36:08,766
(Where is Kaokla?)

456
00:36:08,944 --> 00:36:10,646
Tell him to answer my call.

457
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:18,326
He's busy. Please learn how to wait.

458
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:19,686
Busy?

459
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:21,526
Tell him to answer my call now.

460
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:23,749
If not, I'll go there to take him back.

461
00:36:25,006 --> 00:36:26,166
You're threatening me again.

462
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:28,886
A wife is so hard to understand. Just wait for him.

463
00:36:35,197 --> 00:36:36,246
Thank you.

464
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:41,566
Get your race done quickly.

465
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:43,006
Someone wants to surprise you.

466
00:36:43,526 --> 00:36:45,646
- Who? - It's your wife.

467
00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:47,206
I don't know why she is angry.

468
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:48,926
She said she would come here.

469
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,486
She finally realized.

470
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,446
If she really comes,

471
00:36:53,606 --> 00:36:55,366
I'll treat her as my finish line.

472
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:58,686
Right. There's another thing.

473
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,406
Someone won't sell their shares at the market price to raise the price.

474
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:04,206
It's not hard to guess that

475
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:06,406
that someone must have offered them a better deal.

476
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:08,286
Do you have any idea who they are?

477
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:10,853
Asia tried to take it from us.

478
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,566
We'll find a way to close the deal after the race.

479
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,446
You should be careful.

480
00:37:21,926 --> 00:37:23,726
I have to be honest with you.

481
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:25,606
All these times,

482
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:27,926
Mr. Carl was the one who managed the company.

483
00:37:28,597 --> 00:37:31,006
You don't know about the company as well as him.

484
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:41,406
If I have to advise you,

485
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:46,326
you should try to take Mr. Carl back

486
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:48,926
so you don't have to carry all of the problems like this.

487
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:12,686
His kidney is beginning to fail and he also has septicemia.

488
00:38:13,286 --> 00:38:16,846
With his condition, even if he gets a kidney transplant,

489
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:20,686
he can't receive the surgery. It's too risky.

490
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:25,126
But we've come this far. We can't give up like this.

491
00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:27,406
You have to accept it.

492
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:30,726
it's useless even if he's going to get new organs.

493
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:38,166
It's already giving a heavy toll on him to take care of his septicemia.

494
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:42,326
I recommend palliative care for him

495
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,126
and let nature take its course.

496
00:39:14,013 --> 00:39:16,253
Are you going to leave me too?

497
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,366
It might be the time for me to choose only one person.

498
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:44,702
Khem.

499
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,446
Why is there a rescue drone?

500
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,246
(The people here don't agree with this race.)

501
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:50,406
(They're here to protest.)

502
00:39:50,853 --> 00:39:52,126
Where are they protesting?

503
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,006
(Probably at the race track.)

504
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,406
Get the car. I'll go to the checkpoint as soon as I can.

505
00:40:04,581 --> 00:40:07,126
(I want this event to create a new kind of tourism)

506
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:09,846
(by letting participants get close to nature)

507
00:40:09,982 --> 00:40:11,806
(and local people.)

508
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:14,566
(When they come here, they'll come to like it.)

509
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:17,766
(Everyone will realize that Thailand has more interesting places.)

510
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,166
He's there.

511
00:40:38,326 --> 00:40:39,646
Did you find the culprit?

512
00:40:40,111 --> 00:40:42,166
From what we've found, there might be more than one.

513
00:40:42,366 --> 00:40:44,166
There was chaos everywhere when it happened.

514
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:46,006
What's the latest situation?

515
00:40:46,087 --> 00:40:47,726
The surgery is done,

516
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:50,077
but the bullet got close to the leg nerves.

517
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:52,046
The doctor said his leg might be impaired.

518
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:54,566
I don't know whether Mr. Carl can accept it.

519
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,606
What happened?

520
00:40:58,142 --> 00:40:59,366
You came in time.

521
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:07,206
There was an accident yesterday, causing Kla to drop out of the race.

522
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:10,886
Is he alright?

523
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:14,606
What's worrying is we don't know if it's just an accident.

524
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,166
Someone might intentionally be doing this to make us paranoid.

525
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:22,166
Where is Kla right now?

526
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:23,566
We're suppressing the news.

527
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:25,526
We have to hide him for now.

528
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:27,406
If we let him stay in the hospital,

529
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:29,646
he'll be a sitting duck.

530
00:41:30,044 --> 00:41:31,566
We can't trust anyone.

531
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:34,046
We must keep our eyes on him.

532
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,486
But he's safe, right?

533
00:41:36,884 --> 00:41:38,206
If you want to help,

534
00:41:38,669 --> 00:41:41,726
go support him and calm him down

535
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,846
before taking any revenge.

536
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:53,006
This way, please.

537
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:03,646
Does it hurt?

538
00:43:03,853 --> 00:43:05,086
It's far from my heart.

539
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,406
Don't try to make a joke to hide it.

540
00:43:17,022 --> 00:43:20,086
I thought you would give me the answer when you come here.

541
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,406
So, can we make up now?

542
00:43:29,557 --> 00:43:31,926
I don't know whether you're sincere

543
00:43:32,581 --> 00:43:34,246
or you just want to win.

544
00:43:36,454 --> 00:43:38,566
I'm scared I can't read you.

545
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,446
But when I know something happened to you,

546
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,686
I...

547
00:43:47,285 --> 00:43:49,285
I can't think of anything except...

548
00:43:50,317 --> 00:43:52,126
I want to take care of you.

549
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:56,206
I...

550
00:43:56,966 --> 00:43:58,566
I want to hug you.

551
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:01,606
I want you to be cured.

552
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:04,766
I want to be your cane.

553
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,526
I can only think of that.

554
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:14,046
Even if I have to use my life,

555
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:16,203
it's worth it if I see you worried about me.

556
00:44:20,405 --> 00:44:22,166
Don't jinx it.

557
00:44:25,286 --> 00:44:27,926
I'll consider you my hardest finish line ever.

558
00:44:29,342 --> 00:44:32,126
If I want to get you back, I'll have to trade it with my life.

559
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,726
Then...

560
00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:43,606
You can't die.

561
00:44:45,206 --> 00:44:47,886
And you have to be cured.

562
00:44:49,726 --> 00:44:52,126
If you want to be my special nurse,

563
00:44:52,837 --> 00:44:54,837
I'll run again tomorrow.

564
00:44:58,014 --> 00:44:59,886
It depends on the patient

565
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:03,726
if he wants this nurse to take care of him.

566
00:45:04,694 --> 00:45:06,446
I'll even pay for overtime.

567
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:10,126
But you have to be on duty starting tonight.

568
00:45:14,566 --> 00:45:15,886
I...

569
00:45:16,622 --> 00:45:18,406
Can I be on this duty for this life

570
00:45:19,046 --> 00:45:21,166
and drop it in my next life?

571
00:45:24,126 --> 00:45:26,126
I don't want to be cured now when I heard that.

572
00:45:29,566 --> 00:45:31,366
I want to lie like this for the rest of my life.

573
00:45:58,326 --> 00:46:01,926
Your hand is rough because it touches chemicals all day long.

574
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:07,366
It won't do anything. I've done it my entire life.

575
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,326
You shouldn't feel tired anymore.

576
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:28,886
He looks naive, but he's crafty.

577
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,886
Oh, Thaen.

578
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:35,646
Why didn't you call me?

579
00:46:35,743 --> 00:46:37,622
Why are you standing here? Why didn't you go inside?

580
00:46:38,901 --> 00:46:40,006
You can't go in.

581
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,806
Why? Mom isn't there?

582
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:47,326
I told you to not go in.

583
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:50,246
What's wrong?

584
00:46:56,517 --> 00:46:57,877
There's nothing.

585
00:47:01,294 --> 00:47:04,886
You're always smart. But why did you trust that kind of man this time?

586
00:47:06,246 --> 00:47:08,646
Oh, you're here.

587
00:47:08,806 --> 00:47:10,046
- Hello. - Mom.

588
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:12,206
You brought a man with you today.

589
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,766
I didn't bring him.

590
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,670
I just ran into him in front of the salon.

591
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:21,686
We haven't seen each other for some time.

592
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:24,606
I heard you broke up with Khim.

593
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:26,486
Are you alright?

594
00:47:28,383 --> 00:47:29,966
You two should talk.

595
00:47:30,285 --> 00:47:32,806
Hern and I are going to see a movie.

596
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,806
- Should we go now? - You can close it for a day and come with us.

597
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,766
I already made an appointment with my customer. You should go.

598
00:47:44,749 --> 00:47:46,696
I thought this would be a family's day.

599
00:47:47,566 --> 00:47:49,366
It's more like a day of deception.

600
00:47:49,758 --> 00:47:51,766
Don't you know that you got deceived by him?

601
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:54,486
Come here. We need to talk.

602
00:47:58,469 --> 00:48:00,006
Why did you pick a fight with him?

603
00:48:00,246 --> 00:48:02,326
That man is seducing your mom.

604
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,166
Can't you see he's having an affair?

605
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:08,686
He can't be trusted, even though he looks naive.

606
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:11,126
He's trying to make you and your mom fight for him.

607
00:48:11,246 --> 00:48:13,166
Hey, you're spouting nonsense.

608
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:15,366
Is he the good man that you want?

609
00:48:16,206 --> 00:48:18,486
If you can only get him, you shouldn't have a boyfriend.

610
00:48:18,806 --> 00:48:20,686
Hey, do you think you're better than him?

611
00:48:21,806 --> 00:48:23,509
At least, I'm not a pervert like him.

612
00:48:23,607 --> 00:48:26,486
Hey, you're being delusional just now.

613
00:48:26,662 --> 00:48:28,366
But he's society's trash.

614
00:48:28,726 --> 00:48:30,326
You're inviting an enemy into your home.

615
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:32,126
I like it.

616
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:36,606
And why do you have to be that worried?

617
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:41,406
Fine. Stay with him.

618
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:43,861
If you don't realize anything after I told you this,

619
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,286
stay with him then.

620
00:48:46,646 --> 00:48:47,846
A woman like you,

621
00:48:48,046 --> 00:48:49,726
there are more women who are better than you.

622
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,766
I don't understand why you would be crazy about him.

623
00:48:54,022 --> 00:48:55,606
Hey, Thaen.

624
00:48:56,117 --> 00:48:59,846
Do you think you're so great when you curse at someone else's dad?

625
00:49:00,966 --> 00:49:02,726
When did I curse at your dad?

626
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:09,126
- Don't tell me... - If you don't want to call Hern my dad,

627
00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:11,526
you have to call him my mom's boyfriend.

628
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:15,286
You didn't know that they were a couple, did you?

629
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,686
It's you who's being delusional.

630
00:49:22,366 --> 00:49:23,486
Come here.

631
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:25,606
Do you like it?

632
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,926
Hern wanted to court my mom,

633
00:49:33,446 --> 00:49:37,126
but he didn't dare to as he's much younger than her.

634
00:49:37,447 --> 00:49:38,861
He came to consult with me

635
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:40,966
on how to not make it glaringly obvious.

636
00:49:41,406 --> 00:49:42,966
I told him to

637
00:49:43,262 --> 00:49:45,366
take care of both the mom and the daughter.

638
00:49:46,012 --> 00:49:48,486
I got close to him

639
00:49:48,638 --> 00:49:51,206
to make my mom really want to be with him.

640
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,766
You're wrong about him.

641
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,486
He doesn't feel anything about me.

642
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,949
I know you're jealous.

643
00:50:14,957 --> 00:50:16,326
For my mom, right?

644
00:50:19,086 --> 00:50:20,406
I'm afraid you might get deceived.

645
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,766
Are you talking about me or Mom?

646
00:50:27,406 --> 00:50:32,006
So, are you afraid I would be dumped or

647
00:50:33,045 --> 00:50:34,846
are you afraid you would be dumped?

648
00:50:35,581 --> 00:50:37,286
When you said

649
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:40,606
you could find a better woman than me,

650
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:42,686
are you talking about yourself?

651
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:44,286
Do you think I'm better than him?

652
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,726
It can't even be compared.

653
00:50:46,469 --> 00:50:47,646
Don't be embarrassed.

654
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:49,446
He's a lot better than you.

655
00:50:49,574 --> 00:50:51,486
He always says what he means.

656
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,286
He knows he's playing with fire,

657
00:50:53,526 --> 00:50:55,246
but he got close to Mom without care.

658
00:50:55,462 --> 00:50:57,566
- But you... - You want me to show it off.

659
00:50:57,694 --> 00:50:59,206
Can you allow me to hit on you?

660
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,766
(There's an unexpected situation at the trail running race.)

661
00:51:07,926 --> 00:51:11,326
(One of the participants fell off the mountain.)

662
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:15,485
(The participant is Mr. Jakkrit Poompisai, 36 years old.)

663
00:51:15,582 --> 00:51:19,686
(He's a participant in the trail running race on the island.)

664
00:51:19,806 --> 00:51:23,766
(The rescue team had tried to find him all night long.)

665
00:51:23,966 --> 00:51:26,006
(They found Mr. Jakkrit in the end.)

666
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,526
(After a physical examination,)

667
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:32,827
(it's found that Mr. Jakkrit's spine is heavily injured,)

668
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:35,566
(causing his right leg unable to be used.)

669
00:51:35,686 --> 00:51:39,126
(It's possible that he might become handicapped.)

670
00:51:40,846 --> 00:51:42,006
Kla.

671
00:51:54,126 --> 00:51:55,646
I feel so refreshed now.

672
00:51:57,205 --> 00:51:58,246
Do you want to come in?

673
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,926
You said your leg was hurt.

674
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:03,326
It's just muscle strain.

675
00:52:04,093 --> 00:52:05,526
I said it's far from my heart.

676
00:52:09,813 --> 00:52:10,846
Let it go.

677
00:52:12,749 --> 00:52:13,806
Kla.

678
00:52:20,966 --> 00:52:22,326
Hey, Kla.

679
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,686
You lied to me again.

680
00:52:25,214 --> 00:52:26,286
What lie?

681
00:52:27,486 --> 00:52:28,886
I really fell off the mountain.

682
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,766
But I fell because I helped the man who was shot.

683
00:52:32,764 --> 00:52:35,166
We fell together when I tried to carry him up.

684
00:52:37,206 --> 00:52:39,046
I thought you got shot.

685
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,926
Why didn't you tell me? Don't you know how much I worried?

686
00:52:42,485 --> 00:52:45,046
I want to cry, but I don't want to cry in front of others.

687
00:52:45,268 --> 00:52:47,686
Am I stupid to make up with you?

688
00:52:54,161 --> 00:52:55,486
I know you're worried.

689
00:52:57,278 --> 00:52:58,726
I'm really touched.

690
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:01,606
Why didn't you tell me you're alright?

691
00:53:02,502 --> 00:53:04,118
When will you stop being playful?

692
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:06,446
Can I still trust your words?

693
00:53:22,477 --> 00:53:25,126
Are you hitting on me? Why is it so rough?

694
00:53:25,462 --> 00:53:27,526
Your voice doesn't sound sweet

695
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,526
like when you were with Saikhim.

696
00:53:29,678 --> 00:53:31,886
I know you'll compare me like that.

697
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:35,646
You probably think I was dumped, so that's why I came to you instead.

698
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:37,277
If I say I like you,

699
00:53:37,526 --> 00:53:39,246
you'll say I'm indecisive.

700
00:53:40,193 --> 00:53:41,646
You're really indecisive.

701
00:53:44,381 --> 00:53:47,006
And it's difficult when I'll be told I take

702
00:53:47,118 --> 00:53:50,726
my friend's boyfriend. I'll be teased for the rest of my life.

703
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:53,326
Everyone will say

704
00:53:53,566 --> 00:53:55,086
I date you for money.

705
00:53:55,223 --> 00:53:56,486
It's a lose-lose situation.

706
00:53:56,797 --> 00:53:58,246
I'm sorry then.

707
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:00,046
I can only do this much.

708
00:54:01,108 --> 00:54:02,846
Even if I knew my heart earlier,

709
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,646
I couldn't change anything anyway.

710
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:06,406
If you use my past to judge me,

711
00:54:06,733 --> 00:54:08,886
I can't make us meet earlier.

712
00:54:09,526 --> 00:54:11,846
Just forget about today

713
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,126
if that can make you feel better.

714
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,838
See? You're playing hard to get.

715
00:54:26,862 --> 00:54:29,739
Serves you right. He changed his mind now.

716
00:54:32,655 --> 00:54:34,886
Why is this man so sulky?

717
00:54:38,126 --> 00:54:40,326
Thaen, we need to talk.

718
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,726
So...

719
00:54:51,334 --> 00:54:52,846
Do you really want to date me?

720
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:57,046
And do you have good reasons for me to date you?

721
00:54:58,366 --> 00:54:59,486
A lot.

722
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:02,846
If you think Khim deceived you all these times,

723
00:55:03,157 --> 00:55:06,286
don't forget that you used Khim to build up your image.

724
00:55:06,454 --> 00:55:07,806
You only wanted to marry Khim

725
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:09,406
to mock your dad.

726
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:11,105
You didn't want to marry her

727
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,366
because you want money, just like what your dad told you.

728
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:14,945
You thought that

729
00:55:15,053 --> 00:55:17,446
not caring about Khim's past is love.

730
00:55:17,677 --> 00:55:19,046
You tried to prove

731
00:55:19,326 --> 00:55:21,686
that you're a good enough gentleman.

732
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,686
But when you know

733
00:55:23,846 --> 00:55:26,686
that Saikhim didn't exactly like a gentleman like you,

734
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:28,926
you only feel grudgeful,

735
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,526
but not heartbroken.

736
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,206
This isn't called love. You only wanted to win.

737
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:40,486
Was it too straightforward?

738
00:55:54,086 --> 00:55:55,766
If you know me this well,

739
00:55:56,741 --> 00:55:57,886
we should date.

740
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:28,926
Where are you going?

741
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:30,846
You can stay here alone.

742
00:56:31,046 --> 00:56:32,606
It was Claire before and now this.

743
00:56:32,814 --> 00:56:34,446
I can't stand you anymore.

744
00:56:36,301 --> 00:56:37,686
I'm stupid to not see through

745
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:39,333
what the truths and lies are

746
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:41,926
because I always get deceived by you.

747
00:56:42,574 --> 00:56:43,766
It's not just you.

748
00:56:43,879 --> 00:56:46,046
I'm also unsure if it's a dream or a reality.

749
00:56:52,582 --> 00:56:54,406
When we were strangers that night,

750
00:56:54,646 --> 00:56:56,126
you weren't as wary as you are today.

751
00:56:56,517 --> 00:56:57,926
We already knew each other well.

752
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:00,486
Why don't you trust me?

753
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,806
It's because I know you well that I'm getting more scared.

754
00:57:04,006 --> 00:57:05,206
I promise that

755
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:07,406
I'll tell you everything from now on.

756
00:57:07,701 --> 00:57:09,326
I won't make you doubt me.

757
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:12,990
Being sincere with me,

758
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:15,006
can you do it?

759
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:18,406
Okay.

760
00:57:19,996 --> 00:57:21,526
I have one more thing to tell you.

761
00:57:21,886 --> 00:57:23,606
But I'm afraid I might not have the chance.

762
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,366
I'll tell you right now.

763
00:57:30,606 --> 00:57:31,766
You know me.

764
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:35,686
You know my mind.

765
00:57:37,606 --> 00:57:38,726
You know my secret.

766
00:57:39,886 --> 00:57:41,086
You know everything.

767
00:57:43,342 --> 00:57:44,606
Do you want to know anything else?

768
00:58:18,725 --> 00:58:20,006
How long has it been

769
00:58:20,437 --> 00:58:22,446
since the last time we stayed quietly like this?

770
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:27,446
We need to stop fighting.

771
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:29,829
Because

772
00:58:30,149 --> 00:58:33,246
we don't know whether tomorrow or our next lives will come first.

773
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,806
I don't have much time to prove myself.

774
00:58:36,534 --> 00:58:38,126
You need to stop being sulky.

775
00:58:39,806 --> 00:58:41,446
It depends on you.

776
00:58:42,434 --> 00:58:43,806
It's as my dad said.

777
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:46,006
No matter who our enemy is,

778
00:58:46,627 --> 00:58:47,942
I have to thank him

779
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,686
because he brought you back.

780
00:58:50,917 --> 00:58:52,846
He's the true obstacle to our true love.

781
00:59:03,966 --> 00:59:05,126
Do you think

782
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:07,686
our child is waiting for us?

783
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:10,286
Will the baby wait to be born as our child again?

784
00:59:10,862 --> 00:59:12,566
Or is the baby waiting for us to go up there?

785
00:59:15,709 --> 00:59:20,446
One day, there'll be a day that we'll be together.

786
00:59:24,486 --> 00:59:25,846
Did the doctor tell you

787
00:59:26,349 --> 00:59:27,846
whether the baby was a boy or girl?

788
00:59:29,126 --> 00:59:30,486
I don't know.

789
00:59:31,326 --> 00:59:32,606
I didn't dare to ask.

790
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:50,646
No matter the baby was Narnfah or Temfah,

791
00:59:51,726 --> 00:59:52,926
when it's time,

792
00:59:53,805 --> 00:59:55,206
we can go to see the baby later.

793
01:00:03,613 --> 01:00:05,126
We'll be a family up there.

794
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:48,406
The ones who sold the shares to Kaokla were Mr. Prompt and Ms. Pijika.

795
01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:50,126
I told you to get out!

796
01:00:51,374 --> 01:00:52,806
You chase everyone away from you.

797
01:00:53,284 --> 01:00:54,526
You might be left with no one.

798
01:00:54,741 --> 01:00:56,206
You must be satisfied right now

799
01:00:57,846 --> 01:00:59,046
that you see me losing, right?

800
01:00:59,526 --> 01:01:01,526
Dad, you're too pessimistic.

801
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:04,366
Mr. Sansern. Mr. Sansern.

802
01:01:04,557 --> 01:01:06,286
Please don't go to see Mr. Sin right now.

803
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:07,966
But I want to talk with Mr. Sin.

804
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:10,286
Please wait for Mr. Sin to calm down.

805
01:01:10,526 --> 01:01:12,286
Go clean the rabbit's cage if you're that free.

806
01:01:15,552 --> 01:01:17,863
I'll ask our employees to clean it instead.

807
01:01:17,957 --> 01:01:19,086
No.

808
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:23,486
I don't know why I should hire you if you can't even do this.

809
01:01:24,342 --> 01:01:26,326
Aren't you good at cleaning?

810
01:01:27,006 --> 01:01:28,086
Do it.

811
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:29,726
Or do you hate it?

812
01:01:29,844 --> 01:01:32,246
Just tell me, so that I'll know you choose your work now.

813
01:01:33,198 --> 01:01:34,406
I'll do it.

814
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:37,606
After you're done,

815
01:01:38,726 --> 01:01:42,106
I don't mind if you throw it away or kill it.

816
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:47,126
If an animal isn't loyal to you,

817
01:01:47,763 --> 01:01:48,886
it's filthy.

818
01:01:49,118 --> 01:01:50,806
It's the same as an ungrateful human.

819
01:01:53,397 --> 01:01:54,486
Come here.

820
01:01:54,886 --> 01:01:56,886
- Come here. - Give it more.

821
01:01:59,446 --> 01:02:00,806
Don't spoil it that much.

822
01:02:01,006 --> 01:02:03,286
It'll get conceited, thinking that we have to treat it well.

823
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:06,606
Let it eat more.

824
01:02:07,326 --> 01:02:08,526
To make it understand

825
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:10,206
who has given it food and water,

826
01:02:10,382 --> 01:02:12,046
who has given it its home.

827
01:02:13,165 --> 01:02:14,206
Eat it.

828
01:02:16,526 --> 01:02:17,846
If you're not on my side,

829
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:19,806
don't show your face to me.

830
01:02:24,766 --> 01:02:27,126
It's not like I want to take their side, Mr. Sin.

831
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:29,486
What?

832
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,166
Are you trying to say

833
01:02:31,437 --> 01:02:33,326
that you're only attracted to that woman?

834
01:02:33,806 --> 01:02:35,306
I shouldn't have trusted you.

835
01:02:35,582 --> 01:02:36,622
I let you be an idiot

836
01:02:36,703 --> 01:02:38,286
who was ordered around by a woman

837
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:40,726
and you let Prompt destroys our company.

838
01:02:42,117 --> 01:02:45,366
Is it your plan for Saikhim to go back to Kaokla?

839
01:02:45,518 --> 01:02:47,646
Do you want everyone to stay away from me?

840
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:49,846
It's not like that, Mr. Sin.

841
01:02:50,317 --> 01:02:51,766
Why would I do that?

842
01:02:52,245 --> 01:02:55,166
Aren't you good at manipulating others?

843
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:57,286
I should have realized

844
01:02:57,526 --> 01:02:59,326
that you always acted like a saint

845
01:02:59,573 --> 01:03:01,406
and made me a villain in front of my daughter.

846
01:03:02,086 --> 01:03:03,166
No.

847
01:03:03,757 --> 01:03:05,006
That rabbit,

848
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:07,246
you used it to brainwash Saikhim.

849
01:03:09,446 --> 01:03:12,286
The reward for the second-best student from me.

850
01:03:12,814 --> 01:03:13,926
Second?

851
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:15,246
It's alright, isn't it?

852
01:03:15,613 --> 01:03:18,993
Useless. You're worse than before and you still asked me if it's alright.

853
01:03:19,686 --> 01:03:21,326
I studied as hard as before.

854
01:03:21,606 --> 01:03:23,566
It has to be more than before.

855
01:03:23,902 --> 01:03:25,126
Aren't you ashamed?

856
01:03:25,453 --> 01:03:29,286
You're always in the first place, but you let others take over you.

857
01:03:29,734 --> 01:03:31,006
I'm ashamed.

858
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:37,966
What's that?

859
01:03:38,926 --> 01:03:42,006
A reward for being a good girl from Mr. Sansern.

860
01:03:44,334 --> 01:03:45,406
Good girl?

861
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:49,166
The one who disappointed me isn't a good girl.

862
01:03:51,646 --> 01:03:53,046
Give me that.

863
01:03:54,821 --> 01:03:55,926
A rabbit?

864
01:03:56,348 --> 01:03:59,326
- Give me that. - Dad.

865
01:04:00,246 --> 01:04:02,806
A naughty girl can't raise anything.

866
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,886
Dad, you can't take it away.

867
01:04:06,287 --> 01:04:07,926
- Dad. - Khim, let it go.

868
01:04:08,486 --> 01:04:09,926
Don't be stubborn.

869
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,926
Do you want to get hit?

870
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:14,766
I'm not stubborn. You're mean.

871
01:04:14,926 --> 01:04:17,006
Khim, let it go. Khim.

872
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:18,486
Khim.

873
01:04:22,086 --> 01:04:23,366
What the heck is going on?

874
01:04:24,118 --> 01:04:26,166
It doesn't mean that it's bad when her study gets worse.

875
01:04:26,734 --> 01:04:28,526
It's only our disappointments

876
01:04:28,805 --> 01:04:30,726
that will make Ms. Khim love herself less and less.

877
01:04:36,086 --> 01:04:37,987
Khim started to argue with me

878
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:39,886
ever since she raised that rabbit.

879
01:04:40,478 --> 01:04:41,806
Ms. Khim doesn't have siblings.

880
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:44,646
- I want her to... - I used to be my daughter's world.

881
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:49,526
But I've become a villain to her because of someone like you.

882
01:04:51,501 --> 01:04:52,966
You want to look down on me.

883
01:04:54,806 --> 01:04:58,246
You forgot your roots and wanted to be in the same family as me?

884
01:04:58,926 --> 01:05:00,486
You should know your place.

885
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:01,861
Someone like you

886
01:05:02,038 --> 01:05:05,486
will never catch on to a cunning woman like Pijika.

887
01:05:05,966 --> 01:05:07,206
If you're still stupid

888
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,886
to be her dog,

889
01:05:09,046 --> 01:05:10,606
get out of my life.

890
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:12,726
Know your place.

891
01:05:13,491 --> 01:05:14,674
You suck.

892
01:05:14,806 --> 01:05:16,954
You have nothing for that woman to leech off.

893
01:05:17,086 --> 01:05:19,086
She only used you to destroy me.

894
01:05:19,222 --> 01:05:21,366
When it's done, she'll leave you.

895
01:05:21,486 --> 01:05:23,166
Like a stray dog.

896
01:05:24,126 --> 01:05:25,206
Moron.

897
01:05:39,392 --> 01:05:40,526
What?

898
01:05:42,197 --> 01:05:43,246
Come here.

899
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:44,814
No.

900
01:05:45,014 --> 01:05:48,086
Let me go. I told you to let me go.

901
01:05:53,655 --> 01:05:54,886
What's with you?

902
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:57,246
How could you betray Kidakarn?

903
01:06:00,629 --> 01:06:02,629
Mr. Sin knows everything about us.

904
01:06:03,246 --> 01:06:04,726
You dated me

905
01:06:05,469 --> 01:06:07,926
because you only wanted me to betray Mr. Sin?

906
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:11,766
A service dog like you

907
01:06:12,638 --> 01:06:14,030
can only be that.

908
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:19,086
You're loyal to him,

909
01:06:19,701 --> 01:06:20,886
but you've never cared about me.

910
01:06:21,151 --> 01:06:22,766
How could I love you?

911
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,686
You have no dignity,

912
01:06:29,093 --> 01:06:30,486
so your wife left you.

913
01:06:39,326 --> 01:06:42,446
I'll wait for you to be the next one who gets chased away by Mr. Sin.

914
01:07:00,286 --> 01:07:01,446
Mom.

915
01:07:04,078 --> 01:07:05,966
What's the relationship between you and Mr. Sansern?

916
01:07:09,286 --> 01:07:10,646
Don't talk about him.

917
01:07:11,438 --> 01:07:12,966
For someone like him,

918
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,086
who could lower oneself to date him?

919
01:07:17,766 --> 01:07:20,766
That's why he tried to be nice to me.

920
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:24,926
Do you want me to consider him as my dad?

921
01:07:25,486 --> 01:07:27,406
He's just being delusional.

922
01:07:27,534 --> 01:07:28,646
Prim.

923
01:07:29,006 --> 01:07:31,926
You should stop saying things that embarrass me.

924
01:07:32,222 --> 01:07:34,856
Are you sure you didn't want to use him

925
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:37,006
to destroy Uncle Sin for you?

926
01:07:37,526 --> 01:07:38,926
A good-for-nothing like him

927
01:07:39,126 --> 01:07:40,606
can't even do anything.

928
01:07:41,246 --> 01:07:43,606
He can't even protect himself.

929
01:07:44,366 --> 01:07:45,886
Let him stay like that.

930
01:07:46,526 --> 01:07:48,606
When Mr. Sin gets ruined one day,

931
01:07:49,036 --> 01:07:51,246
I'll be the first one who mocks him.

932
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:20,886
Will anyone be sincere with me in this life?

933
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:54,886
- Hello. - Hello.

934
01:08:57,391 --> 01:08:59,145
We talked on the phone yesterday.

935
01:08:59,317 --> 01:09:01,286
- Yes. - Did you bring the document?

936
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:02,966
Yes.

937
01:09:10,486 --> 01:09:12,806
I have to apologize. I'm really sorry.

938
01:09:18,406 --> 01:09:20,366
Please call me if you change your mind.

939
01:09:31,142 --> 01:09:33,102
Mr. Sompong rejected you, didn't he?

940
01:09:35,397 --> 01:09:37,166
He's on Kaokla's side.

941
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:40,686
This is the list of investors you should meet.

942
01:09:42,526 --> 01:09:44,086
Do I need you for this?

943
01:09:47,486 --> 01:09:49,846
There was an incident at Kaokla's race yesterday.

944
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:52,966
Ms. Khim went to see him there.

945
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:57,558
If those two make up with each other,

946
01:09:58,646 --> 01:10:00,846
the ratio of shareholders will change.

947
01:10:25,606 --> 01:10:26,726
Go wait in the car.

948
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:44,086
I'll give you one last chance.

949
01:10:44,862 --> 01:10:47,388
If Saikhim wants to go back to Kaokla,

950
01:10:47,806 --> 01:10:50,086
I have to get all of the shares back.

951
01:10:51,894 --> 01:10:54,206
Force Saikhim to sell her shares.

952
01:10:54,726 --> 01:10:56,246
Teach Saikhim a lesson for me.

953
01:10:58,046 --> 01:11:00,926
Then I'll be sure that you're still loyal to me.

954
01:11:37,349 --> 01:11:38,509
What?

955
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:42,846
Is this random food?

956
01:12:53,558 --> 01:12:54,686
Hey.

957
01:12:58,926 --> 01:13:00,966
What will it be this time?

958
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:06,366
Your bro has sent it to you several times.

959
01:13:16,324 --> 01:13:18,606
(For the car bomb incident)

960
01:13:18,742 --> 01:13:22,926
(that happened at the Elite Hotel on 11.20 am,)

961
01:13:23,045 --> 01:13:25,246
(the EOD team)

962
01:13:25,358 --> 01:13:27,926
(has closed off the place to investigate it.)

963
01:13:28,014 --> 01:13:29,446
(As for the injury,)

964
01:13:29,566 --> 01:13:33,006
(it's found that there were two heavily injured from this incident.)

965
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,143
(One is the former minister, Mr. Songsin Kidakarn,)

966
01:13:36,168 --> 01:13:37,960
(who's heavily injured.)

967
01:13:38,102 --> 01:13:40,646
(He's being transported to the hospital.)

968
01:13:40,757 --> 01:13:42,966
(But we still don't have a clear report)

969
01:13:43,061 --> 01:13:45,486
(on whether he's safe or not.)

970
01:13:45,575 --> 01:13:49,966
(We'll watch over the situation to report the damage to you.)

971
01:13:56,838 --> 01:13:58,918
(Missed Call - Oun)

972
01:14:04,871 --> 01:14:06,766
I have to go.

973
01:14:08,838 --> 01:14:10,286
I'll go with you, Khim.

974
01:14:12,061 --> 01:14:13,286
Kla, Kla.

975
01:14:13,686 --> 01:14:14,726
Have you seen the clip?

976
01:14:14,966 --> 01:14:16,646
He finally got something good.

977
01:14:16,749 --> 01:14:18,246
I'm satisfied that he got his payback.

978
01:14:25,613 --> 01:14:27,726
He really did a lot of things to us.

979
01:14:31,253 --> 01:14:32,286
Let's go.

980
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:41,206
If you only want to mock him,

981
01:14:42,742 --> 01:14:45,326
don't go. I should go alone.

982
01:14:55,646 --> 01:14:56,766
Are you satisfied now?

983
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,886
- Lita. - Khim.

984
01:15:11,989 --> 01:15:13,286
How is Dad?

985
01:15:13,613 --> 01:15:14,926
His thigh got hit by the bomb.

986
01:15:15,023 --> 01:15:17,286
The doctors are collecting blood to perform a surgery.

987
01:15:17,815 --> 01:15:19,286
How could this happen?

988
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:21,446
You should go and see his condition.

989
01:15:21,926 --> 01:15:23,406
He only called your name.

990
01:15:31,021 --> 01:15:32,521
Dad, please be alright.

991
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:56,486
Khim.

992
01:16:03,806 --> 01:16:04,846
Khim.

993
01:16:12,181 --> 01:16:14,006
I rushed here when I knew about it.

994
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:17,566
Please be strong, Khim.

995
01:16:20,446 --> 01:16:22,566
If there's anything I can help with the case,

996
01:16:22,742 --> 01:16:24,166
you can tell me.

997
01:16:25,925 --> 01:16:27,246
At least, for your divorce,

998
01:16:27,406 --> 01:16:29,926
I have a good lawyer who can help you.

999
01:16:36,086 --> 01:16:38,486
(Kaokla)

1000
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:48,006
If Carl really did this to him this time,

1001
01:16:48,966 --> 01:16:51,326
he shouldn't be your husband anymore.

1002
01:17:01,789 --> 01:17:03,029
But it's strange.

1003
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:05,383
It wasn't the car that your father-in-law always used.

1004
01:17:05,526 --> 01:17:07,566
It's his assistant's personal car.

1005
01:17:09,446 --> 01:17:11,046
And now,

1006
01:17:11,413 --> 01:17:12,706
the stock is plummeting.

1007
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:15,166
From being downgraded from a five-star hotel,

1008
01:17:15,638 --> 01:17:16,806
this time,

1009
01:17:17,173 --> 01:17:18,806
they might go bankrupt.

1010
01:17:30,286 --> 01:17:33,566
If you really think he can easily forgive you,

1011
01:17:33,846 --> 01:17:35,726
you're too optimistic.

1012
01:17:43,686 --> 01:17:45,206
When I heard the news,

1013
01:17:46,502 --> 01:17:48,606
I immediately came here to see you.

1014
01:17:50,326 --> 01:17:51,526
Kaokla,

1015
01:17:52,022 --> 01:17:54,686
he's never forgotten about what you did to him.

1016
01:17:56,206 --> 01:17:57,406
To his sister.

1017
01:17:57,854 --> 01:17:59,286
To his child.

1018
01:18:00,006 --> 01:18:02,446
Think about it again.

1019
01:18:02,805 --> 01:18:04,206
When he's Carl,

1020
01:18:04,678 --> 01:18:07,566
he always tries to get back at you.

1021
01:18:08,389 --> 01:18:09,686
Both your dad

1022
01:18:10,366 --> 01:18:11,766
and your wedding.

1023
01:18:12,117 --> 01:18:15,526
Let alone your hotel's shares that he has bought.

1024
01:18:16,445 --> 01:18:17,846
He planned everything.

1025
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:21,206
The money he used to buy your shares,

1026
01:18:21,469 --> 01:18:23,926
he got it from his brother.

1027
01:18:38,111 --> 01:18:39,786
And you're stupid.

1028
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,382
You still go back to love him.

1029
01:18:59,606 --> 01:19:01,478
Khim, how was he?

1030
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:02,846
What did the doctor say?

1031
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:04,766
Are you behind the incident today?

1032
01:19:05,054 --> 01:19:06,326
What did you hear?

1033
01:19:09,741 --> 01:19:11,741
A stare will tell the truth.

1034
01:19:12,204 --> 01:19:13,766
I video called you

1035
01:19:14,134 --> 01:19:16,134
to see if you're lying to me.

1036
01:19:16,742 --> 01:19:18,086
If I want to get him back,

1037
01:19:18,518 --> 01:19:21,126
I don't have to do this disastrous scene.

1038
01:19:22,302 --> 01:19:24,486
Because the company's shares are more important?

1039
01:19:24,806 --> 01:19:26,406
(You didn't want my dad to die.)

1040
01:19:26,685 --> 01:19:29,286
It's more satisfying to take everything from him slowly.

1041
01:19:29,756 --> 01:19:31,606
(Dying is too easy.)

1042
01:19:32,157 --> 01:19:33,446
It's about this, isn't it?

1043
01:19:36,421 --> 01:19:37,766
Let me ask you this.

1044
01:19:38,222 --> 01:19:41,006
Do you suspect that my dad was behind the race incident?

1045
01:19:41,269 --> 01:19:42,489
I have to doubt him.

1046
01:19:43,798 --> 01:19:46,166
Don't forget that I have to take responsibility for the injured.

1047
01:19:46,287 --> 01:19:48,287
When you bought our hotel's shares,

1048
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:50,766
it's related to that, isn't it?

1049
01:19:50,966 --> 01:19:52,406
I have my own reason to buy them.

1050
01:19:53,236 --> 01:19:54,566
(I told you.)

1051
01:19:54,734 --> 01:19:55,926
I'm tired of

1052
01:19:56,623 --> 01:19:58,086
being unsure.

1053
01:19:59,084 --> 01:20:00,246
(In this life,)

1054
01:20:01,061 --> 01:20:03,726
can I really trust you again?

1055
01:20:04,741 --> 01:20:05,886
Khim.

1056
01:20:06,325 --> 01:20:07,366
Listen to me.

1057
01:20:07,893 --> 01:20:09,126
(Look at me carefully.)

1058
01:20:09,366 --> 01:20:11,726
I've never intended to hurt you and your dad.

1059
01:20:12,758 --> 01:20:14,486
I can't look at you.

1060
01:20:14,878 --> 01:20:15,990
What do you mean?

1061
01:20:17,327 --> 01:20:19,327
We've hurt each other too much.

1062
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:23,238
We have wounds all over our bodies.

1063
01:20:24,126 --> 01:20:26,206
(It hurts every time we hug.)

1064
01:20:27,766 --> 01:20:29,406
(Mom told me that)

1065
01:20:29,698 --> 01:20:31,281
we could love someone,

1066
01:20:33,308 --> 01:20:35,046
but it might not be good to stay with them.

1067
01:20:35,533 --> 01:20:36,926
(We might be like that.)

1068
01:20:37,406 --> 01:20:39,086
I think we should let each other go.

1069
01:21:20,932 --> 01:21:23,075
The patient is heavily injured

1070
01:21:23,206 --> 01:21:24,566
as he was close to the bomb.

1071
01:21:24,768 --> 01:21:26,606
Are you his relative?

1072
01:21:31,259 --> 01:21:33,686
Not really. It's...

1073
01:21:35,846 --> 01:21:37,286
He's my co-worker in the company.

1074
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:03,921
Dad.

1075
01:22:04,357 --> 01:22:05,590
What are you doing?

1076
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:07,659
Your wounds aren't healed yet.

1077
01:22:07,845 --> 01:22:09,286
Why is my leg all numb?

1078
01:22:10,206 --> 01:22:11,251
Why can't I feel anything?

1079
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:12,926
You just went through surgery.

1080
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:15,206
You need to calm down. Don't be impatient.

1081
01:22:15,446 --> 01:22:16,646
I'll move your bed.

1082
01:22:16,886 --> 01:22:18,286
He must be satisfied now

1083
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:19,966
that I can't walk anymore.

1084
01:22:22,086 --> 01:22:23,566
Dad, calm down.

1085
01:22:26,933 --> 01:22:29,406
Dad, stop.

1086
01:22:29,652 --> 01:22:31,046
Dad, listen to me.

1087
01:22:31,222 --> 01:22:33,326
When your wounds healed, you'll rehabilitate

1088
01:22:33,518 --> 01:22:35,566
and you'll be back to normal again. Trust me.

1089
01:22:35,702 --> 01:22:37,326
He did this much to me.

1090
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:39,486
I have to get him to jail.

1091
01:22:39,766 --> 01:22:42,766
For him, life sentences won't be good enough.

1092
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:51,486
You can't go in.

1093
01:22:52,637 --> 01:22:53,846
I'm here to see Saikhim.

1094
01:22:57,757 --> 01:23:00,726
Oun, please tell Saikhim to come out to see me.

1095
01:23:00,966 --> 01:23:02,206
Please go back.

1096
01:23:02,605 --> 01:23:04,406
And don't show your face here again.

1097
01:23:07,341 --> 01:23:08,566
Wait, Oun.

1098
01:23:09,166 --> 01:23:11,686
- Let me see Saikhim. Let me go. - You can't go in.

1099
01:23:12,614 --> 01:23:14,486
- I have to talk with Saikhim. - You can't go in.

1100
01:23:15,478 --> 01:23:16,558
Oun.

1101
01:23:17,247 --> 01:23:18,486
- Let me go. - You can't go in.

1102
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:20,046
Let me see Khim again.

1103
01:23:20,151 --> 01:23:21,726
- You can't go in. - Khim.

1104
01:23:22,509 --> 01:23:25,126
Let me go. I told you to let me go.

1105
01:23:31,213 --> 01:23:32,366
What happened?

1106
01:23:32,614 --> 01:23:33,926
He's waiting for you.

1107
01:23:34,062 --> 01:23:36,166
He wants to meet you.

1108
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:39,446
He probably wants to mock me.

1109
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:41,566
He's probably here to look down on me.

1110
01:23:41,813 --> 01:23:45,206
He can't come in. There are people guarding in front of your room.

1111
01:23:45,501 --> 01:23:47,501
How could we let him walk freely like this?

1112
01:23:47,758 --> 01:23:50,086
Don't the police know he's here to bother me?

1113
01:23:50,382 --> 01:23:51,526
He's crazy.

1114
01:23:51,829 --> 01:23:53,326
He wants to mock me.

1115
01:23:53,606 --> 01:23:55,126
He can't come in, Dad.

1116
01:23:55,286 --> 01:23:56,646
Don't worry.

1117
01:23:56,917 --> 01:23:58,246
He'll go back soon.

1118
01:24:38,166 --> 01:24:40,726
(I heard you wanted to hear a thank you from my mouth.)

1119
01:24:41,677 --> 01:24:45,526
(I thought of everything I should have thanked you for.)

1120
01:24:46,157 --> 01:24:49,326
(I want you to know what you have done to my life.)

1121
01:24:50,084 --> 01:24:52,246
(First, thank you)

1122
01:24:52,502 --> 01:24:53,966
(for making me smarter.)

1123
01:24:54,438 --> 01:24:55,766
(At least, I know)

1124
01:24:56,022 --> 01:24:57,766
(that a woman can be dramatic every day.)

1125
01:24:58,310 --> 01:24:59,766
(You always get upset.)

1126
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:01,766
(You always doubt me.)

1127
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:03,366
(You caused problems)

1128
01:25:03,518 --> 01:25:05,526
(while you're only running away from it.)

1129
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:07,566
(You didn't want to face me when you broke up.)

1130
01:25:07,742 --> 01:25:09,206
(You used a video call.)

1131
01:25:09,536 --> 01:25:11,086
(You didn't dare to talk face-to-face.)

1132
01:25:11,246 --> 01:25:12,526
(I'm not surprised)

1133
01:25:12,646 --> 01:25:15,006
(that you didn't know our child was a boy or a girl.)

1134
01:25:15,413 --> 01:25:18,746
(Because you're afraid to know, you chose not to pay attention.)

1135
01:25:19,126 --> 01:25:20,686
(Leave the problem behind you.)

1136
01:25:21,286 --> 01:25:23,606
(When it's bad for you, you will act pitiful.)

1137
01:25:23,966 --> 01:25:25,926
(You thought your tears could negotiate everything.)

1138
01:25:26,566 --> 01:25:28,686
(Do you think I have to stop for your tears?)

1139
01:25:29,173 --> 01:25:30,886
(Stop acting pitiful)

1140
01:25:31,348 --> 01:25:33,486
(and stop acting like you're the only victim.)

1141
01:25:33,846 --> 01:25:37,126
(Stop blaming everything and stop using your dad as an excuse.)

1142
01:25:37,622 --> 01:25:39,422
(He's the victim this time.)

1143
01:25:39,983 --> 01:25:42,366
(It doesn't mean he's never hurt us before.)

1144
01:25:42,687 --> 01:25:44,206
(If you only trust him,)

1145
01:25:44,446 --> 01:25:46,246
(you'll be like your dad)

1146
01:25:46,869 --> 01:25:48,966
(who has to be alone for all his life.)

1147
01:25:50,573 --> 01:25:51,806
(Thank you)

1148
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,806
(for making me say this kind of stuff.)

1149
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,566
(We have nothing to lose anyway.)

1150
01:25:57,406 --> 01:26:00,126
(Since you want sincerity, I can only give you this much.)

1151
01:26:01,054 --> 01:26:03,846
(I'm sure no one can be as sincere as me in this life.)

1152
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:06,926
(Thank you for reading until the end.)

1153
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:11,086
(And thank you for making me not care when I got abandoned this time.)

1154
01:26:12,022 --> 01:26:13,486
(It's not only you.)

1155
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,366
(My feelings can be gone too.)

1156
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:17,726
(The world forces me to be bad.)

1157
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:20,286
(You'll see that someone ruined soon.)

1158
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:31,726
The police sent you a warrant

1159
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,446
for the car bomb's case.

1160
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:35,526
You got drag to be involved again.

1161
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:37,197
Khim was always with you.

1162
01:26:37,318 --> 01:26:38,726
She still dared to doubt you.

1163
01:26:38,918 --> 01:26:41,486
When did she think you would plan to kill her dad?

1164
01:26:46,846 --> 01:26:47,926
She's here.

1165
01:26:48,086 --> 01:26:49,086
Let me ask you.

1166
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,206
Don't you think of confirming an alibi for Kla?

1167
01:26:51,605 --> 01:26:52,726
Alibi?

1168
01:26:54,966 --> 01:26:57,166
Kla has become the suspect in the car bombing

1169
01:26:57,287 --> 01:26:59,326
even when you're always with him.

1170
01:27:01,047 --> 01:27:02,806
Don't you want to confirm his alibi?

1171
01:27:16,206 --> 01:27:17,806
I'll be your alibi.

1172
01:27:18,142 --> 01:27:19,726
Will you divorce me?

1173
01:27:22,653 --> 01:27:23,926
How is that related to this?

1174
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:26,766
If you want to get out of this case,

1175
01:27:27,166 --> 01:27:28,486
I'll help you.

1176
01:27:29,581 --> 01:27:31,806
I should have been cleared from this case because I did nothing.

1177
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:34,766
You already knew that. Don't use divorce as an excuse.

1178
01:27:34,967 --> 01:27:37,286
I don't even know if you're truly innocent.

1179
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:38,766
You put this charge against me

1180
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:40,686
to force me to divorce, right?

1181
01:27:42,046 --> 01:27:43,886
You're the one who's playing a trick.

1182
01:27:51,462 --> 01:27:53,606
If you promise you'll divorce,

1183
01:27:54,198 --> 01:27:55,913
I'll be your alibi.

1184
01:27:56,046 --> 01:27:57,166
And so what?

1185
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:58,556
If I don't divorce,

1186
01:27:58,686 --> 01:28:01,006
you'll put me in jail like what you did in the past?

1187
01:28:01,957 --> 01:28:03,342
Do you only know how to

1188
01:28:03,549 --> 01:28:04,966
cut me out of your life?

1189
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:07,206
Can you only do that, Ms. Saikhim?

1190
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:09,486
You're really your dad's clone.

1191
01:28:24,807 --> 01:28:26,886
Since we doubt each other this much,

1192
01:28:28,285 --> 01:28:29,846
why should we endure it?

1193
01:28:30,582 --> 01:28:33,406
I only offered a deal that is fair for both sides.

1194
01:28:34,806 --> 01:28:36,846
You're calling this fair?

1195
01:28:40,254 --> 01:28:41,454
What do you want then?

1196
01:28:41,981 --> 01:28:43,926
Since we could never be together.

1197
01:28:44,237 --> 01:28:46,326
You told me your feelings are gone.

1198
01:28:46,558 --> 01:28:48,886
I'm ready to prove my innocence in your dad's case.

1199
01:28:49,294 --> 01:28:52,046
Don't run away from the truth by using our divorce.

1200
01:28:52,469 --> 01:28:54,469
You said it like you haven't used that with me before.

1201
01:28:54,773 --> 01:28:55,886
What?

1202
01:28:57,006 --> 01:28:58,286
Do you want to get me back?

1203
01:28:58,606 --> 01:28:59,886
We only need to sign for divorce.

1204
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:01,566
So, we can end it.

1205
01:29:01,829 --> 01:29:03,646
I'm being this straightforward.

1206
01:29:03,806 --> 01:29:05,886
You'll stop saying I'm running away from problems.

1207
01:29:06,038 --> 01:29:07,126
It's easy to say for you.

1208
01:29:07,437 --> 01:29:08,886
You've never cared about anything.

1209
01:29:09,284 --> 01:29:11,046
And you've cared so much?

1210
01:29:13,495 --> 01:29:14,566
Here.

1211
01:29:14,758 --> 01:29:17,406
You wrote the breakup letter on used paper.

1212
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:19,278
That's it.

1213
01:29:20,446 --> 01:29:22,246
The sincerity you asked from me.

1214
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,566
I told you from my heart.

1215
01:29:24,886 --> 01:29:27,286
I'm annoyed at your sarcasm.

1216
01:29:27,574 --> 01:29:29,177
Do you think you're the only one who's right

1217
01:29:29,366 --> 01:29:31,866
I can't stand your rudeness anymore.

1218
01:29:32,806 --> 01:29:34,886
Then, when you said you wanted to hug me until I got better,

1219
01:29:35,566 --> 01:29:37,006
you wanted to be my cane,

1220
01:29:37,286 --> 01:29:38,766
all that wasn't true at all?

1221
01:29:40,966 --> 01:29:42,086
Yes.

1222
01:29:42,342 --> 01:29:45,126
It's fake. I acted like I was okay when I was with you.

1223
01:29:46,046 --> 01:29:48,886
I want you to know that our child was a boy.

1224
01:29:49,415 --> 01:29:50,766
It's not that I didn't know.

1225
01:29:51,556 --> 01:29:52,798
I just faked it

1226
01:29:53,126 --> 01:29:55,246
because I know how much you wanted a boy.

1227
01:29:55,366 --> 01:29:58,406
I know you love your dad so much that you want to be like him.

1228
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:02,446
I faked it and lied because I didn't want you to know.

1229
01:30:02,892 --> 01:30:06,366
It's not like I closed my eyes and didn't pay any attention to it.

1230
01:30:12,493 --> 01:30:14,806
I didn't solve every problem with my tears.

1231
01:30:15,006 --> 01:30:16,766
Don't look at me if you don't like it.

1232
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:21,434
It's alright.

1233
01:30:24,254 --> 01:30:25,406
I know.

1234
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:27,910
I understand.

1235
01:30:30,077 --> 01:30:31,326
Even if it hurts when we hug,

1236
01:30:31,798 --> 01:30:33,886
I want to be hurt together with you.

1237
01:30:43,477 --> 01:30:44,526
It's alright.

1238
01:30:49,093 --> 01:30:51,006
I didn't want to run away from problems.

1239
01:30:52,566 --> 01:30:55,046
I don't want you to be sad with me.

1240
01:30:56,304 --> 01:30:57,446
Forget it.

1241
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:59,646
It's already in the past.

1242
01:31:02,398 --> 01:31:04,398
I don't want you to hate me.

1243
01:31:05,086 --> 01:31:06,366
We only have each other.

1244
01:31:07,789 --> 01:31:09,246
What would we get from hating each other?

1245
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:11,806
It's not just the two of us.

1246
01:31:13,206 --> 01:31:14,486
My dad...

1247
01:31:16,701 --> 01:31:18,966
I think we should go our separate ways.

1248
01:31:21,078 --> 01:31:23,566
I believe there's still more than this.

1249
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:26,886
There's something more painful waiting for us.

1250
01:31:33,038 --> 01:31:34,726
At least, we're better than them.

1251
01:31:37,757 --> 01:31:39,526
Our lives are far easier than theirs.

1252
01:32:03,438 --> 01:32:05,126
Don't make me choose anymore.

1253
01:32:06,749 --> 01:32:07,856
It's fine.

1254
01:32:09,021 --> 01:32:11,021
You can stay still. You don't need to do anything.

1255
01:32:11,326 --> 01:32:12,686
I'll find the evidence,

1256
01:32:13,174 --> 01:32:16,006
and the witness. I'll make myself survive.

1257
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:19,606
You can choose your dad.

1258
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:22,726
But don't treat me as your enemy.

1259
01:32:37,576 --> 01:32:40,046
(If two broken people meet each other)

1260
01:32:40,397 --> 01:32:42,286
(and have never given up on each other,)

1261
01:32:42,733 --> 01:32:45,486
(they might be the right one for each other.)

1262
01:32:58,166 --> 01:32:59,886
You're conspiring to dismiss me

1263
01:33:00,037 --> 01:33:02,006
to appoint him, aren't you?

1264
01:33:02,277 --> 01:33:03,766
We would like to propose that

1265
01:33:03,972 --> 01:33:06,286
Ms. Saikhim should be the new CEO.

1266
01:33:06,487 --> 01:33:07,766
Don't act like you know everything.

1267
01:33:07,902 --> 01:33:09,166
It's not over yet.

1268
01:33:09,406 --> 01:33:12,606
- What happened? - The police arrested Kla for attempting murder.

1269
01:33:12,846 --> 01:33:13,846
Murder?

1270
01:33:13,942 --> 01:33:15,966
If Saikhim knows the truth,

1271
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:17,766
she'll never be able to accept it.

1272
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:20,326
Because he's being prosecuted.

1273
01:33:20,613 --> 01:33:21,886
He might be in prison

1274
01:33:22,046 --> 01:33:24,126
for wrongful possession of the property.

1275
01:33:24,421 --> 01:33:25,926
So, you closed off your heart

1276
01:33:26,181 --> 01:33:28,423
and you won't let me prove myself anymore?

1277
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:30,246
I'm sorry that you can't be together.

1278
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:32,086
For every second you suffer,

1279
01:33:32,223 --> 01:33:33,966
someone else must suffer more than you.

1280
01:33:34,278 --> 01:33:35,806
The world forces me to be bad.

1281
01:33:36,342 --> 01:33:38,182
You'll see that someone ruined soon.
