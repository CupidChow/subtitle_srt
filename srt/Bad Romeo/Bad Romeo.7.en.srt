1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,166
(Names, characters, places, and incidents)

2
00:00:01,247 --> 00:00:02,428
(are all fictitious for entertainment purposes.)

3
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:03,529
(We don't condone any acts portrayed in this production.)

4
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:45,726
Your life is worth more than a car.

5
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:48,197
Don't let anyone make you feel worthless.

6
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:50,166
Keep a close eye on Saikhim.

7
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:52,126
Don't let her see those men again.

8
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:53,278
I think I'm pregnant.

9
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,446
Why did something like this happen to me?

10
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:56,686
Even if I only have my body,

11
00:02:56,797 --> 00:02:58,406
you're no match for me

12
00:02:58,606 --> 00:03:00,227
because you've never given her freedom.

13
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:02,206
That's why she came to see a scoundrel like me.

14
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:05,086
If you don't mind, I'm here to ask for Saikhim's hand.

15
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:07,886
Do you think your son is suitable for my daughter?

16
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,260
I don't know if he's good enough even if he's reborn.

17
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:11,846
Can you live here with me?

18
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:14,166
What do you want me to live as?

19
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:15,646
As my woman.

20
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:16,846
If he's arrested by the police,

21
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:18,326
Saikhim has no place left.

22
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:20,206
You must be satisfied now.

23
00:03:20,486 --> 00:03:22,006
The only thing I've done wrong

24
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:23,386
is to love a woman like you!

25
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,720
(Love has reached its turning point.)

26
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:27,887
(Hatred.)

27
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:30,352
(Seven years later)

28
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,293
We've found the island's owner.

29
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:35,286
I'm going on a boat to the island.

30
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:37,686
I'll make them propose the price first.

31
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,195
I would like Mr. Sansern to prepare the cost estimate

32
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:42,286
in case I might have to negotiate with him.

33
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:43,406
Thank you.

34
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:49,806
This way, Ms. Saikhim.

35
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:33,646
What are you doing?

36
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,526
I'm releasing a floating lantern for my dad in heaven.

37
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:37,886
Oh.

38
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:40,326
This floating lantern can probably fly up far.

39
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:43,406
When I miss my dad, I'll release it here.

40
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:45,966
I always get what I wish for.

41
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:48,806
Your dad must be so proud of you.

42
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,446
Do you know anyone in heaven?

43
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:54,046
You can write a letter to him.

44
00:04:57,406 --> 00:04:59,526
I don't know if he's still up there.

45
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:02,766
It's been seven years.

46
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:05,086
A miracle is real.

47
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:14,286
(The car is ready.)

48
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:26,024
Are we almost there?

49
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:28,886
We haven't reached even halfway yet.

50
00:05:29,054 --> 00:05:31,446
Why did he build a house up here?

51
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,126
Of course.

52
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,166
What should we do?

53
00:05:58,062 --> 00:05:59,326
What happened?

54
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,246
The oil is leaking.

55
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,366
I have to get the oil. I don't know if they have a reserve.

56
00:06:09,246 --> 00:06:10,474
We'll do this then.

57
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:11,846
I'll go there first.

58
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:14,846
I'll let you deal with the car. Come pick me up when you're ready.

59
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:16,246
I'll wait for you at that house.

60
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:17,446
Understood.

61
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:18,886
- Thank you. - Yes.

62
00:07:04,686 --> 00:07:06,046
Excuse me.

63
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:11,686
How long is it until I can get to the island's owner's house?

64
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,970
Sorry.

65
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,046
Kla.

66
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,566
I'm sorry. I think I must have been tired.

67
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,566
Why do you look like someone I've known?

68
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:18,646
Someone you've known?

69
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,109
So similar.

70
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:22,221
Really?

71
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:24,686
I don't think the world is that small.

72
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:31,006
He's already dead.

73
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,280
That's why you looked like you saw a ghost.

74
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:46,126
Excuse me, but I'm here to meet the island's owner.

75
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:48,766
Do you know him?

76
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:52,166
I heard he has a vacation home up here.

77
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:58,726
Who wouldn't know him?

78
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,149
Can you take me to see him?

79
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:06,966
Here. I would like to bother you.

80
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:14,166
Thank you so much.

81
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:41,446
Is this really this place?

82
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:46,406
Hello?

83
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:50,406
Is anyone home?

84
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:56,246
Hello?

85
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,206
Is anyone home?

86
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:12,126
I arrived at his house, but I haven't seen him.

87
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:16,526
This place looks weird.

88
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,566
I didn't think he would live like this.

89
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:24,086
Come pick me up here.

90
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,606
Hold on.

91
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:32,446
The island's owner isn't here.

92
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:34,133
How can I contact him?

93
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:35,566
You'll see him when he's here.

94
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,086
Wait.

95
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,966
Thank you.

96
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:19,846
When a fortune teller said our lucks aren't compatible,

97
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,486
I was worried.

98
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,406
I have an earth element.

99
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,702
But this color,

100
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:26,206
it doesn't increase power.

101
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,206
If we add red,

102
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:30,841
it'll increase power and confidence.

103
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:34,446
I want a strong and bright color and I want it to look luxurious.

104
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:36,886
Can you edit it for me?

105
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:39,997
I'll make a new one to show to you.

106
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:42,566
I'm sorry for asking you to edit it again.

107
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:45,006
It's not much though.

108
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:48,686
Yes. I can do it for my customers.

109
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:50,646
Thank you.

110
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:52,909
(Khim)

111
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,566
Edit the design.

112
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:56,694
This is probably the millionth time now.

113
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:59,086
(I don't know who got into her dream this time.)

114
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,846
I've wasted almost 100 models.

115
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:05,146
I'm a house designer, not a luck designer.

116
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:06,526
Aren't you used to it now?

117
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:08,086
No.

118
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:11,646
Come on. You're a talented girl, Lita.

119
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:13,046
(This is easy for you.)

120
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,166
Sure. Of course.

121
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:18,846
Right. Why did you call me?

122
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:21,326
I'm in Phuket for my business.

123
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:23,646
I met a strange thing.

124
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:25,646
I met Kla here.

125
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:27,486
Which Kla?

126
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:30,686
Do you think it's that man?

127
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:32,206
He looks so similar.

128
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:35,806
Even his voice sounds similar. I thought he was the same one.

129
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,646
But he's already dead long ago.

130
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,789
Yeah. That's why I'm confused.

131
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:42,486
Why does he look so similar to him?

132
00:13:42,764 --> 00:13:44,886
The only thing that he didn't have is his tattoo.

133
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:47,926
Did he have a twin or relative?

134
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,046
Kla only has one sister.

135
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:54,886
Did he know your face?

136
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,046
(No.)

137
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:57,926
He didn't know me.

138
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,086
Then just forget it. It might be a coincidence.

139
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,006
So, are you going to Hong Kong with me this evening?

140
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,086
I think I can't leave in time.

141
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,526
I think I have to follow you there later.

142
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:14,006
But I'll arrive there before tomorrow noon.

143
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,330
Please tell Thaen for me, Lita.

144
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,526
Hey, you can't skip this big of an event.

145
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:25,086
Hello, Khim? Khim? What?

146
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:56,846
I took your boss to negotiate with the island's owner.

147
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,286
She said you can leave now.

148
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:00,806
They'll ride a helicopter to the airport together.

149
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:32,286
No one has come.

150
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,846
I think we might have missed each other.

151
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:39,926
Can I ask you to give him a letter and business card?

152
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:41,886
Your driver is waiting for you.

153
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:44,006
Get in the car. I'll send you there.

154
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:48,733
Come.

155
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:05,166
Are you a local? How long have you been here?

156
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:06,415
No.

157
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:09,286
What are you doing here?

158
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,686
Did the island's owner hire you?

159
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:29,006
Has anyone offered to buy this island?

160
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:30,326
No.

161
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,926
Do you think he will sell it?

162
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:35,477
Fifty million.

163
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,646
He'll sell at 50 million?

164
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:40,166
No. I'm talking about the ransom.

165
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:44,246
What do you mean?

166
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:52,227
Pay me 50 million and I'll let you go.

167
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:54,206
What?

168
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,166
Since you've become a new Saikhim,

169
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:58,486
I want to see if anyone would see your worth.

170
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,040
Between you and money, what will your dad choose this time?

171
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:03,966
Who actually are you?

172
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,566
What do you want?

173
00:17:17,926 --> 00:17:19,939
- Mr. Sansern, please help me. - (Ms. Khim.)

174
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,326
(What happened?)

175
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:25,046
I'm holding her for ransom! Give me 50 million and I'll let her go!

176
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:27,326
(Where are you, Ms. Khim?)

177
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:29,102
We're going to our death!

178
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:33,809
What are you doing?

179
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,686
Taking you to live with me, darling.

180
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,886
Thank God.

181
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:23,766
He hasn't answered my call.

182
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,246
Where is he filling the tank?

183
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:41,206
Your driver is waiting for you.

184
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:43,566
Get in the car. I'll send you there.

185
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,686
I can drive myself.

186
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:04,286
Are you sure?

187
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:06,606
Yes.

188
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:46,046
Are you sure?

189
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:13,126
Help.

190
00:23:16,422 --> 00:23:19,046
Is there anyone here? Help.

191
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:22,206
(Thaenthai)

192
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:34,906
(I don't know if heaven really exists.)

193
00:24:36,093 --> 00:24:38,286
(But I want to send it anyway.)

194
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:40,926
(I want you to know)

195
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,886
(that I can still remember you.)

196
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:45,766
(Seven years.)

197
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:48,166
(Up there,)

198
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:50,886
(it might just be a second.)

199
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,686
(They said)

200
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:56,766
(some people live in our hearts more than we live together.)

201
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,726
(I just understand it today.)

202
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:03,038
(Those four months)

203
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:06,126
(have changed my life till today.)

204
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:22,789
(I want to ask you)

205
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:25,686
(if there's one thing we can change in our lives,)

206
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,887
(would you change it to that we haven't met each other?)

207
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:33,486
(I want to know if your answer will be the same as mine.)

208
00:25:39,526 --> 00:25:40,646
(My child,)

209
00:25:41,047 --> 00:25:42,246
(it's your dad.)

210
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,766
(I'm working in a forest.)

211
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:46,866
(It's so dark, but there are tons of stars.)

212
00:25:48,526 --> 00:25:50,486
(Should we name our kid Temfah)

213
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,246
(if our kid is a girl?)

214
00:25:53,382 --> 00:25:55,006
If our kid is a boy,

215
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,846
should he be Narnnarm?

216
00:25:57,702 --> 00:25:59,806
Have they met each other by now?

217
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:05,526
Wait for me.

218
00:26:08,246 --> 00:26:09,726
I'll follow you there.

219
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:37,437
Help. We have an injured person.

220
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:03,526
We can't call the helicopter now.

221
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:05,686
It's safer to leave in the morning.

222
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:07,966
You should stay here for a night.

223
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:10,846
At least, we have electricity here.

224
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:14,726
Thank you for helping me.

225
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:18,446
If you rest, you might be better tomorrow.

226
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:20,406
I'll leave her to you.

227
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:23,326
We'll come to see her in the early morning.

228
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:33,966
Whose house is this? Why are you here?

229
00:27:59,406 --> 00:28:03,886
My phone's battery is dead. Can I borrow your phone?

230
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:05,486
To call my family.

231
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:12,406
We don't have phones here.

232
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,166
Do you have a charger?

233
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:31,645
Take a pill and go to sleep.

234
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:33,302
I'll send you off tomorrow morning.

235
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:57,926
I'll sleep outside. Tell me if you need anything.

236
00:30:21,972 --> 00:30:23,067
(Sorry.)

237
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:26,326
(The number that you've dialed cannot be connected at this time.)

238
00:30:31,342 --> 00:30:33,886
Ms. Khim hasn't contacted me. She's probably still on the island.

239
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:35,966
Why did you let her go alone?

240
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,686
This isn't the first time Khim has disappeared.

241
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:41,206
Maybe,

242
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,966
Khim might have went out at night.

243
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:51,846
But this time, I don't think it'll be unfortunate like the last time.

244
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:54,806
Go to Phuket right now.

245
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:58,326
I need an update on Saikhim by tonight.

246
00:30:58,659 --> 00:30:59,726
Yes.

247
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:05,486
Don't worry.

248
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:07,126
She isn't a child anymore.

249
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:09,926
If my company had someone who can help with our work,

250
00:31:10,725 --> 00:31:12,406
Khim wouldn't have to work by herself.

251
00:31:25,245 --> 00:31:26,846
She stuck her nose in herself.

252
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:28,926
He still blamed us.

253
00:31:40,086 --> 00:31:41,126
(Excuse me.)

254
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:44,326
(Why do you look like someone I've known?)

255
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:46,286
(I don't think the world is that small.)

256
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,726
(He's already dead.)

257
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,520
(That's why you looked like you saw a ghost.)

258
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:54,726
Calm down.

259
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:58,966
Kla, listen to me. Calm down, Kla.

260
00:32:03,864 --> 00:32:06,160
Kla, calm down.

261
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
Kla.

262
00:32:10,366 --> 00:32:11,686
Kla, don't go.

263
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:14,726
Kla, don't run away again.

264
00:32:14,926 --> 00:32:17,640
Kla, stay here. Please don't leave again.

265
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:19,086
Kla, stay here.

266
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,086
Kla, don't do this.

267
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:23,246
Do I look that horrible to you?

268
00:32:25,222 --> 00:32:26,806
It's as painful as when I was stabbed.

269
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:29,686
It came from your stare.

270
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,766
Do you want to know how much it hurts?

271
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:35,046
Kla, please let it go.

272
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:39,146
Kla, I'm sorry.

273
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,846
I didn't mean to do that.

274
00:32:44,286 --> 00:32:45,486
Didn't mean to?

275
00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:49,326
You probably don't know what I went through.

276
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:53,206
Kla!

277
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:02,126
Kla.

278
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,206
Wake up.

279
00:33:07,113 --> 00:33:08,406
One more push.

280
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,446
Stay strong.

281
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:13,886
We've gone through a lot.

282
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:17,166
Don't give up now.

283
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:38,926
My son is still in danger.

284
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,606
The kidney he got

285
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,699
can prolong his life,

286
00:33:44,117 --> 00:33:46,486
but we don't know when he'll wake up.

287
00:33:55,662 --> 00:33:59,126
The compensation as written in the contract.

288
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:09,366
I can't accept it. I didn't want to sell my kid.

289
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:14,606
But this is what your son wants to leave you with.

290
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:17,326
It's not worth it,

291
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:19,686
no matter how much it is.

292
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:25,126
Then, I'll repay you with this instead.

293
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:27,566
I'll help you with the case.

294
00:34:28,054 --> 00:34:30,326
I'll make Kaokla's sentence as low as possible.

295
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:33,205
At least, I'll get him out to recover

296
00:34:33,356 --> 00:34:35,356
until his sentence is up.

297
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:38,446
No matter what will happen later,

298
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:42,166
I promise I'll take care of him

299
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:44,806
as one of my heirs.

300
00:34:45,526 --> 00:34:47,166
I'll protect him

301
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,606
like I'm protecting my own son.

302
00:34:51,076 --> 00:34:52,286
I promise.

303
00:34:58,526 --> 00:34:59,526
Kla.

304
00:35:05,366 --> 00:35:06,526
Kla.

305
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:14,606
Kla, my son.

306
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:38,526
Nate.

307
00:36:38,736 --> 00:36:40,166
The first application.

308
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,806
Finally did it, bro. Nate, look.

309
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:53,446
Yes. Hello, Jack. Did you get my email?

310
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:56,486
Good morning. The video presentation is ready.

311
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:05,206
Hey, guys. Talk to you later.

312
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,966
Looking forward for that.

313
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:08,246
Bye.

314
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:35,046
You won't die from this much, Saikhim.

315
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,966
(The world isn't that small.)

316
00:40:25,797 --> 00:40:29,726
(You've finally answered. What are you doing?)

317
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,599
(Kla.)

318
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:38,006
It's really him.

319
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,166
(Who's that? Kla? Do you hear me?)

320
00:40:41,534 --> 00:40:43,186
(Kla! Kla!)

321
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:52,806
Kla.

322
00:40:54,846 --> 00:40:56,046
Kaokla.

323
00:40:57,966 --> 00:40:59,846
You deceived me?

324
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,046
Kaokla.

325
00:41:08,126 --> 00:41:09,206
Kla.

326
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:11,566
Kaokla.

327
00:41:13,398 --> 00:41:14,486
Kla.

328
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,086
Did you deceive me?

329
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:20,486
Kla.

330
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:44,886
Why didn't you tell me it's you? You didn't die.

331
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:48,966
Why did you lie to me?

332
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:51,806
Why did you act like someone else?

333
00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:53,646
What are you talking about?

334
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:55,806
Stop lying to me.

335
00:41:56,518 --> 00:41:58,926
I know the truth now. Why did you lie?

336
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:01,046
When did we know each other?

337
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,400
From what I remember, I don't think we know each other.

338
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:06,486
What do you mean?

339
00:42:06,614 --> 00:42:07,846
Although we've lived together,

340
00:42:08,046 --> 00:42:10,246
it didn't mean we actually know each other.

341
00:42:11,638 --> 00:42:13,286
We wouldn't know what the another was thinking.

342
00:42:16,486 --> 00:42:18,366
What have I done to you?

343
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:21,366
It's only you

344
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:24,046
who deceived me that you're already dead.

345
00:42:25,438 --> 00:42:26,486
Yeah.

346
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,790
The Kla that you knew is already dead.

347
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:31,766
But the one in front of you isn't that idiot.

348
00:42:32,702 --> 00:42:35,566
And now who are you? Why did you come here?

349
00:42:35,709 --> 00:42:36,806
To kill you maybe.

350
00:42:37,566 --> 00:42:39,326
It's a shame you survive last night.

351
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:41,926
What have I done to you?

352
00:42:42,204 --> 00:42:43,431
You told me this.

353
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,286
What can't kill us makes us stronger.

354
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:56,605
It's your fault that you couldn't kill me.

355
00:42:56,846 --> 00:42:58,606
That's why I'm able to get back at you.

356
00:43:21,846 --> 00:43:23,846
Ms. Khim, what happened?

357
00:43:27,061 --> 00:43:28,061
That...

358
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:30,846
Take me away from here.

359
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,452
Let's go.

360
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:05,966
What's going on?

361
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:09,141
Didn't you say Kaokla committed suicide in prison?

362
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:10,937
Why is he still alive?

363
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,570
I had a medical certificate which said his brain was dead.

364
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,606
It's impossible for him to survive.

365
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:18,086
I want to know what actually happened.

366
00:44:19,013 --> 00:44:21,162
Mr. Sansern, please investigate it for me.

367
00:44:21,293 --> 00:44:22,566
I'll handle it.

368
00:44:22,967 --> 00:44:24,726
But you have to leave now, Ms. Khim.

369
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:26,850
We still have an event in Hong Kong.

370
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:29,326
But I want to know what actually happened.

371
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:31,606
For these seven years,

372
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:33,246
where have he been?

373
00:45:04,886 --> 00:45:06,366
The lady is waiting inside.

374
00:45:20,264 --> 00:45:21,726
She's inside.

375
00:45:29,629 --> 00:45:30,646
It's me.

376
00:45:56,972 --> 00:45:58,126
I'm back.

377
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:04,846
I've been waiting for your news.

378
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:06,878
What did they say?

379
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,076
Paris wanted us to compensate for 10 million euros.

380
00:46:14,486 --> 00:46:15,690
So much.

381
00:46:15,802 --> 00:46:17,166
It's still in a court procedure.

382
00:46:17,638 --> 00:46:19,166
The lawyer is stalling for us.

383
00:46:19,406 --> 00:46:21,046
I wouldn't back off easily anyway.

384
00:46:52,493 --> 00:46:56,766
These people intentionally used the law to obstruct our business.

385
00:46:57,077 --> 00:46:58,566
Be careful.

386
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,526
You also have to be careful here.

387
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:04,366
I'm trying to find a way to open our business here legally.

388
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,246
I don't think it's easy.

389
00:47:18,886 --> 00:47:21,166
But if we get to sign an MOU with the officials,

390
00:47:21,366 --> 00:47:22,566
there won't be a problem.

391
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:24,726
If we can get listed on a stock market,

392
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,966
everything will be better.

393
00:47:32,581 --> 00:47:34,297
I'm not disappointed

394
00:47:34,409 --> 00:47:36,926
that I let you follow your dream.

395
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,126
Your dad must be so proud of you

396
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:43,406
that you are like him.

397
00:47:46,622 --> 00:47:48,886
You were on a plane all night long.

398
00:47:49,086 --> 00:47:50,646
You just got off from the plane.

399
00:47:51,124 --> 00:47:54,566
I don't know if you have the time to stay with your brother for a night.

400
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:56,126
I don't think I can stay over.

401
00:47:56,436 --> 00:47:58,066
I think I can have a meal.

402
00:47:58,182 --> 00:47:59,782
Let me greet him first.

403
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,326
Do you think I wouldn't know

404
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:23,486
where you've been hiding?

405
00:48:41,366 --> 00:48:42,486
A souvenir.

406
00:48:49,246 --> 00:48:50,886
I thought you wouldn't come in time.

407
00:48:54,909 --> 00:48:57,646
Thank you for flying over there to run my errand.

408
00:49:01,366 --> 00:49:04,126
I called you this morning. Which girl did you stay over with?

409
00:49:05,478 --> 00:49:07,246
You said you hated Thai women.

410
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,120
I didn't want to come back

411
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,560
as I'll meet someone who's onto me like you.

412
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:20,406
I thought you would be bored with Western food.

413
00:49:21,046 --> 00:49:23,406
So, I asked them to prepare Thai food.

414
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:25,246
A souvenir.

415
00:49:36,229 --> 00:49:38,446
Do you still have time to think of me?

416
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,806
Next time,

417
00:49:42,966 --> 00:49:44,446
I'll take you to choose it yourself.

418
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,966
I smell some woman's perfume.

419
00:49:57,446 --> 00:50:01,246
When you're this nice to me, did you do something?

420
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:03,813
I want to do something like that,

421
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,486
but my heart told me to stop.

422
00:50:07,646 --> 00:50:09,326
I don't have time to look at anyone.

423
00:50:12,405 --> 00:50:14,766
You don't have time or don't have your mind?

424
00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:18,126
You forgot to change your watch to match Thai local time.

425
00:50:20,886 --> 00:50:23,246
That's why they prepared a huge breakfast.

426
00:50:23,773 --> 00:50:25,406
It's already time for lunch.

427
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:43,390
You can stop calling.

428
00:50:43,629 --> 00:50:45,246
Mr. Sansern said Saikhim

429
00:50:45,374 --> 00:50:46,446
is coming.

430
00:50:46,531 --> 00:50:48,326
She's probably on board right now.

431
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:50,006
Then, that's okay.

432
00:50:50,304 --> 00:50:52,006
I'm afraid she might not arrive in time.

433
00:50:52,158 --> 00:50:53,158
Thaenthai,

434
00:50:53,254 --> 00:50:55,686
this is the opening of her own hotel.

435
00:50:55,846 --> 00:50:57,406
How would Khim miss it?

436
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:10,566
You're finding your date for tonight?

437
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,406
How is he? Is he cool?

438
00:51:21,318 --> 00:51:22,686
A man isn't a prop.

439
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:24,686
If you use him to brag about your status,

440
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:27,406
no one would give you any thoughts.

441
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,126
We're here for work.

442
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:30,486
Understand?

443
00:51:32,534 --> 00:51:35,326
Don't act like you don't have any ulterior motive.

444
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:40,806
Would you like to see the menu?

445
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,166
- Yes, please. - Please.

446
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:47,406
Thank you.

447
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:06,806
I'll be back for your order in a moment, Sir.

448
00:52:10,155 --> 00:52:11,366
What's with you?

449
00:52:11,726 --> 00:52:12,966
Aren't you hungry?

450
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,160
So, you do know how to do something like this,

451
00:52:25,246 --> 00:52:26,526
Thaenthai.

452
00:52:27,464 --> 00:52:30,606
Let me see how you would propose to Saikhim.

453
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:46,846
Now, think of me as Saikhim.

454
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,406
Don't be shy.

455
00:52:58,046 --> 00:52:59,326
Is this a joke?

456
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:26,206
He wrote a script? Seriously?

457
00:53:34,348 --> 00:53:35,406
Khim.

458
00:53:36,976 --> 00:53:38,166
Thaen.

459
00:53:41,602 --> 00:53:43,366
Where did you get that?

460
00:53:45,878 --> 00:53:48,926
I was clumsy and crashed my head on the plane's window.

461
00:53:49,742 --> 00:53:52,686
I called you all day yesterday, but you turned off your phone.

462
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:54,006
Were you busy?

463
00:53:55,446 --> 00:53:58,486
I lost my phone, Thaen.

464
00:53:58,646 --> 00:54:01,006
But I have a new one now.

465
00:54:04,343 --> 00:54:07,686
It's almost time. I think you should go rest upstairs.

466
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:09,006
- Yes. - Let's go.

467
00:54:20,286 --> 00:54:21,286
So,

468
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,606
he's really Kaokla.

469
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,926
And he looked extremely furious.

470
00:54:26,046 --> 00:54:28,046
Why would he be furious at you?

471
00:54:28,341 --> 00:54:29,686
That he is still alive?

472
00:54:29,886 --> 00:54:31,686
You should be shocked, not him.

473
00:54:31,926 --> 00:54:33,086
Yeah.

474
00:54:34,902 --> 00:54:36,566
Since he's still here,

475
00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:38,606
why haven't I heard anything about him

476
00:54:38,924 --> 00:54:40,566
during these past seven years?

477
00:54:49,534 --> 00:54:51,106
How was he?

478
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,366
Did he look rough like before?

479
00:54:56,574 --> 00:54:57,646
He...

480
00:54:58,084 --> 00:54:59,606
He looks weird.

481
00:55:00,126 --> 00:55:02,566
Both his personality and his way of speaking.

482
00:55:04,966 --> 00:55:06,606
He's in prison for a long time.

483
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:10,766
He didn't say anything because he might not be able to face you.

484
00:55:35,853 --> 00:55:38,166
He's already the past.

485
00:55:38,493 --> 00:55:42,006
Even if he is still alive, he can't reach you anymore.

486
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:44,846
He must have known by now

487
00:55:45,332 --> 00:55:47,675
that he isn't worthy of Saikhim.

488
00:55:48,453 --> 00:55:49,726
And today,

489
00:55:51,117 --> 00:55:53,646
you already have your real hero with you.

490
00:55:59,286 --> 00:56:00,886
Ta-dah.

491
00:56:18,285 --> 00:56:19,406
Are you ready?

492
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:22,726
Yes.

493
00:56:23,382 --> 00:56:26,086
I can say that there'll be a surprise tonight.

494
00:56:28,126 --> 00:56:30,926
She's ready. She's as ready as possible.

495
00:56:47,357 --> 00:56:48,846
Ladies and gentlemen,

496
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:54,412
please let me take this opportunity to welcome all of you special guests

497
00:56:54,606 --> 00:56:58,057
to the grand opening ceremony of the Elite Hotel in Hong Kong.

498
00:56:58,229 --> 00:57:00,849
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me to welcome

499
00:57:00,967 --> 00:57:03,886
Ms. Saikhim and Mr. Charlie.

500
00:57:24,446 --> 00:57:28,206
She's the interior designer for this hotel.

501
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,166
Business reporters probably aren't interested

502
00:58:03,342 --> 00:58:05,086
in the designer.

503
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,526
Since this event is a business event,

504
00:58:08,741 --> 00:58:11,646
you shouldn't steal Khim's spotlight.

505
00:58:12,006 --> 00:58:13,286
Do you know

506
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:16,406
that Khim doesn't like to mix personal and business matters?

507
00:58:16,886 --> 00:58:20,126
If you kneel in front of her and propose to her here...

508
00:58:22,726 --> 00:58:24,326
Your CEO image will be gone.

509
00:58:26,094 --> 00:58:27,526
They'll know because of you.

510
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,246
Hey.

511
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:34,966
I meant well for you. You should be thankful to me.

512
00:58:35,126 --> 00:58:37,446
It's better if you stop sticking your nose in my business.

513
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:40,726
Right. One more thing.

514
00:58:41,249 --> 00:58:42,326
Thaen.

515
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:47,246
Say that instead. Don't use your script.

516
00:59:12,277 --> 00:59:13,517
Thank you.

517
00:59:17,109 --> 00:59:18,349
Ladies and gentlemen,

518
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:20,926
now please join us to welcome Ms. Claire,

519
00:59:21,068 --> 00:59:22,765
Asia's top super model.

520
01:00:35,086 --> 01:00:36,126
Khim.

521
01:00:36,998 --> 01:00:38,086
Khim.

522
01:00:42,078 --> 01:00:44,180
Have you got anything new about Kaokla?

523
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:47,966
From my latest information, it's the same as I told you.

524
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:51,281
His brain was dead while he was serving his sentence.

525
01:00:51,421 --> 01:00:53,726
And there is no information about him after that.

526
01:00:55,309 --> 01:00:59,606
Does this mean there hasn't been any submission for a death certificate?

527
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:04,326
I think he forged his record.

528
01:01:04,646 --> 01:01:08,246
(We don't know where he has been during these few years.)

529
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,686
Even for his relatives,

530
01:01:11,621 --> 01:01:13,526
we can't check any information about them.

531
01:01:16,054 --> 01:01:19,326
What about your love? What is your status now?

532
01:01:24,103 --> 01:01:25,126
Well...

533
01:01:29,258 --> 01:01:32,726
Wow. Today we have a big surprise.

534
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,078
He...

535
01:01:56,205 --> 01:01:57,366
What's wrong?

536
01:02:01,996 --> 01:02:03,406
He's here.

537
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:04,686
Who?

538
01:02:04,926 --> 01:02:06,286
Kaokla.

539
01:02:07,606 --> 01:02:09,366
Kaokla is in today's event.

540
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,846
Is it really him?

541
01:02:10,965 --> 01:02:13,606
I think there must be something going on.

542
01:02:51,566 --> 01:02:53,446
This is probably going to be big news.

543
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:55,806
It's probably global news.

544
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:58,317
Claire revealed her lover in this event.

545
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:10,006
Thaen, have you known them before?

546
01:03:10,288 --> 01:03:11,686
I don't know them.

547
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:15,406
I don't follow celebrity's news that much.

548
01:03:16,114 --> 01:03:21,766
But that man looks like he might be a celebrity or an athlete.

549
01:03:32,581 --> 01:03:36,046
Khim, you don't mind that they stole your spotlight, do you?

550
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:48,196
Khim.

551
01:03:50,966 --> 01:03:53,526
This is good. We can celebrate your success with us two.

552
01:03:58,221 --> 01:04:00,014
How did you come here? You haven't told me.

553
01:04:00,252 --> 01:04:01,486
I'm here to surprise you.

554
01:04:01,647 --> 01:04:02,935
You're the cutest.

555
01:04:03,046 --> 01:04:04,166
Do you like the flowers?

556
01:04:05,246 --> 01:04:06,606
I love it.

557
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:16,726
Khim.

558
01:04:17,244 --> 01:04:18,526
Are you tired?

559
01:04:20,126 --> 01:04:21,126
I...

560
01:04:21,478 --> 01:04:23,926
I saw that you've been working hard for this hotel.

561
01:04:25,526 --> 01:04:27,086
Have your wish come true now?

562
01:04:30,966 --> 01:04:32,366
I'm curious...

563
01:04:33,326 --> 01:04:36,206
Is there something else you still want in your life?

564
01:04:39,991 --> 01:04:41,206
I don't know.

565
01:04:44,421 --> 01:04:47,341
There are always a lot of problems in this world.

566
01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:53,726
I want to be a part of your success.

567
01:04:54,718 --> 01:04:58,646
I want to invite you to invest in our lives together.

568
01:05:02,755 --> 01:05:03,755
Khim.

569
01:05:04,366 --> 01:05:05,646
I'm sorry, Khim.

570
01:05:06,398 --> 01:05:08,086
It's alright, Thaen.

571
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:09,406
I'll wipe it for you.

572
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:12,926
Thaen, it's all dirty.

573
01:05:13,787 --> 01:05:14,966
What's this?

574
01:05:19,446 --> 01:05:20,526
It's nothing.

575
01:05:32,917 --> 01:05:34,166
What's that?

576
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,536
I thought I would quietly propose.

577
01:05:46,877 --> 01:05:48,166
I want to be a part

578
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:50,326
of all your success.

579
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:51,886
Like today.

580
01:05:52,492 --> 01:05:55,246
I'll be waiting for you in a small and dark corner.

581
01:06:03,006 --> 01:06:04,326
Please marry me.

582
01:06:06,461 --> 01:06:07,606
I...

583
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:31,566
Let's go see the fireworks.

584
01:06:40,054 --> 01:06:41,406
They're celebrating for us.

585
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:25,429
I forgot.

586
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:27,526
I have someone to introduce you to.

587
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:39,326
Ms. Khim.

588
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:45,406
He's Carl.

589
01:07:49,246 --> 01:07:52,446
- Carl? - Carl Raman. He's half-Thai, half-Kazakstan.

590
01:07:56,014 --> 01:07:58,286
Carl came from his Thai name, Kaokla.

591
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:01,606
Nice to meet you,

592
01:08:02,085 --> 01:08:03,246
Mr. Carl.

593
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:09,806
Ms. Saikhim, you're this project's head.

594
01:08:09,966 --> 01:08:11,606
This hotel is pretty

595
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:13,646
because of her.

596
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:18,526
Nice to meet you.

597
01:08:30,998 --> 01:08:33,318
And congratulations for the bride-to-be.

598
01:08:34,606 --> 01:08:35,766
What's going on?

599
01:08:38,902 --> 01:08:40,606
You're a lucky man.

600
01:08:40,846 --> 01:08:42,126
Really lucky.

601
01:08:46,686 --> 01:08:48,206
I didn't know you have good news.

602
01:08:48,342 --> 01:08:50,126
Congratulations, Ms. Khim.

603
01:08:55,869 --> 01:08:58,126
I'm jealous when I see you like this.

604
01:08:58,445 --> 01:09:00,486
I don't know when I'll have the chance.

605
01:09:01,981 --> 01:09:03,286
Why are you jealous?

606
01:09:03,926 --> 01:09:07,406
Someone told me a good man is rarer than a ring.

607
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:09,166
A good man

608
01:09:10,886 --> 01:09:14,446
is rarer than a ring. If I have a good husband,

609
01:09:16,565 --> 01:09:18,406
I don't want any ring.

610
01:09:21,101 --> 01:09:24,053
The one who said that must be extremely optimistic.

611
01:09:24,974 --> 01:09:27,606
If they aren't optimistic, they must be

612
01:09:27,798 --> 01:09:31,206
a hypocrite who is only good with their words. Don't you think so?

613
01:09:31,453 --> 01:09:32,566
What are you saying?

614
01:09:34,206 --> 01:09:35,566
Let's go.

615
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:41,446
How is this possible? How could he come this far?

616
01:09:42,023 --> 01:09:44,246
He changed his name and surname.

617
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,046
That's why we couldn't find him.

618
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:48,966
What did he do to be able to date Claire?

619
01:09:50,206 --> 01:09:51,366
I don't know.

620
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:11,606
He's trying to blackmail me.

621
01:10:17,523 --> 01:10:20,286
Khim, are you sure you're alright?

622
01:10:22,262 --> 01:10:24,262
You're all red. Did you drink a lot?

623
01:10:24,418 --> 01:10:25,646
I'm fine.

624
01:10:26,046 --> 01:10:27,606
I have to talk with him.

625
01:10:29,566 --> 01:10:30,966
Wait, Khim.

626
01:10:48,573 --> 01:10:49,686
Why did you send the photo?

627
01:10:53,846 --> 01:10:57,326
No matter how many times you change your phone, you can't hide the past.

628
01:10:57,726 --> 01:10:59,446
I can still restore them if you delete them.

629
01:11:00,141 --> 01:11:02,486
I can't believe I still remember your password.

630
01:11:03,486 --> 01:11:06,646
If you don't want anyone to dig up your past, be more careful.

631
01:11:11,749 --> 01:11:13,086
You look alarmed.

632
01:11:13,709 --> 01:11:16,046
Are you that scared of people knowing our past?

633
01:11:17,629 --> 01:11:19,206
There's no such thing as our past.

634
01:11:20,021 --> 01:11:22,206
It was just silly stuff when I was young.

635
01:11:35,966 --> 01:11:37,206
Don't let me go.

636
01:11:40,277 --> 01:11:41,566
Pull me up.

637
01:11:41,736 --> 01:11:43,326
Now, you beg for your life.

638
01:11:44,206 --> 01:11:46,486
Don't you remember what you did to me?

639
01:11:47,213 --> 01:11:48,966
- Khim. - You left me with no choice.

640
01:11:55,695 --> 01:11:56,967
Are you going to get back at me?

641
01:11:57,406 --> 01:11:58,706
You almost killed me back then.

642
01:11:58,926 --> 01:12:00,086
I helped you.

643
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:01,686
I'll gladly pay you back now.

644
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:22,406
Don't let go of me.

645
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,366
Khim!

646
01:12:35,446 --> 01:12:37,766
Your handbag is in the water now. Such a waste.

647
01:12:38,446 --> 01:12:39,886
It's probably worth more than you.

648
01:12:41,029 --> 01:12:42,086
Kla!

649
01:12:43,766 --> 01:12:44,846
Khim.

650
01:12:47,806 --> 01:12:48,966
Thaen.

651
01:12:52,349 --> 01:12:53,846
- Thaen. - Khim.

652
01:12:56,637 --> 01:12:57,686
Khim.

653
01:13:03,006 --> 01:13:04,086
There.

654
01:13:04,701 --> 01:13:06,246
Your phone is still in there.

655
01:13:12,999 --> 01:13:14,086
Khim.

656
01:13:18,013 --> 01:13:19,326
Just forget it, Thaen.

657
01:13:30,246 --> 01:13:32,006
- You're hosting a pool party? - You...

658
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:37,646
Let's go.

659
01:13:42,726 --> 01:13:44,126
Excuse me. Please make way.

660
01:13:53,965 --> 01:13:55,006
Wait.

661
01:13:56,013 --> 01:13:57,366
Your girlfriend forgot this.

662
01:13:58,248 --> 01:13:59,286
Thank you.

663
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:06,906
What happened?

664
01:14:07,966 --> 01:14:10,006
- Was she drunk? - I don't know.

665
01:14:11,134 --> 01:14:12,486
Love is blind, I guess.

666
01:14:18,055 --> 01:14:20,686
He pushed you into the water. Such a prick.

667
01:14:20,926 --> 01:14:22,846
He's back to take revenge against me.

668
01:14:23,006 --> 01:14:24,326
Who does he think he is?

669
01:14:29,862 --> 01:14:31,206
Claire is staying in that room.

670
01:14:32,006 --> 01:14:33,406
Let's find a clue

671
01:14:33,726 --> 01:14:35,648
to see who Carl actually is.

672
01:14:40,784 --> 01:14:42,046
Fern, quick.

673
01:15:01,686 --> 01:15:03,366
You go in first. I'll look out for you.

674
01:16:23,127 --> 01:16:24,326
Khim.

675
01:16:24,462 --> 01:16:26,846
Oh, Thaen. Are you done with the reporters?

676
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:28,886
- Where is Khim? - Khim?

677
01:16:30,326 --> 01:16:31,686
Khim is in the room.

678
01:16:32,606 --> 01:16:34,566
I rang the bell to call her, but

679
01:16:34,837 --> 01:16:36,126
she didn't hear it.

680
01:16:36,663 --> 01:16:39,096
I thought Khim couldn't get in because I have the keycard.

681
01:16:49,014 --> 01:16:50,133
What's wrong?

682
01:16:52,286 --> 01:16:53,446
Let's go inside.

683
01:16:55,246 --> 01:16:56,246
Khim.

684
01:16:56,412 --> 01:16:57,666
Khim.

685
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,326
I've talked with the reporters.

686
01:16:59,437 --> 01:17:01,646
They've all gone back.

687
01:17:04,318 --> 01:17:05,846
Khim is still taking a shower.

688
01:17:06,494 --> 01:17:08,566
Thaen, do you want to go change first?

689
01:17:09,647 --> 01:17:11,846
Khim said she lost her old phone.

690
01:17:12,726 --> 01:17:14,166
Why was it in the pool?

691
01:17:16,134 --> 01:17:18,286
(He's back to take revenge against me.)

692
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:12,686
Thaen.

693
01:18:13,007 --> 01:18:15,886
Wash your hair first. Dry yourself.

694
01:18:28,477 --> 01:18:29,558
What are you doing?

695
01:18:33,221 --> 01:18:34,966
I want to return Khim's phone to Khim.

696
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,846
Khim said she lost her old phone.

697
01:18:41,286 --> 01:18:42,446
What's this then?

698
01:18:46,869 --> 01:18:47,926
Oh...

699
01:18:49,126 --> 01:18:50,886
Khim was probably confused.

700
01:18:51,181 --> 01:18:52,886
She has worked too hard lately.

701
01:18:53,006 --> 01:18:55,806
She might feel a little distracted. Don't make that face.

702
01:18:57,744 --> 01:19:00,886
Or are you jealous, Thaenthai?

703
01:19:02,365 --> 01:19:06,286
Do you think Khim has two phones for talking with other men?

704
01:19:08,926 --> 01:19:11,046
Nonsense. Khim wouldn't do that.

705
01:19:25,084 --> 01:19:26,206
Go.

706
01:19:53,749 --> 01:19:54,846
What are you looking for?

707
01:19:57,054 --> 01:19:58,646
Look at it yourself then.

708
01:20:10,933 --> 01:20:12,886
A rich woman also likes to be nosy.

709
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:16,806
No word of apology.

710
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:19,046
Your family haven't taught you manners.

711
01:20:23,286 --> 01:20:25,166
The one who should apologize

712
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:26,966
is you.

713
01:20:27,501 --> 01:20:29,126
You intentionally humiliated me.

714
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:31,166
Oh.

715
01:20:31,318 --> 01:20:33,006
I thought you wanted to relive the past.

716
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,126
That's why you're bothering me.

717
01:20:35,646 --> 01:20:36,766
Who?

718
01:20:38,565 --> 01:20:39,806
Who's bothering you?

719
01:20:40,526 --> 01:20:41,926
You did it once last night.

720
01:20:44,182 --> 01:20:45,726
You broke into my room today.

721
01:20:51,102 --> 01:20:52,766
The last time we were drunk together,

722
01:20:53,037 --> 01:20:55,117
do you remember what you went through?

723
01:21:00,909 --> 01:21:02,646
I don't know what you've been through.

724
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:05,046
But being richer

725
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:08,926
doesn't make you a better person.

726
01:21:09,446 --> 01:21:10,874
Your personality is worse.

727
01:21:12,494 --> 01:21:14,126
I don't know what hatred you have,

728
01:21:14,487 --> 01:21:15,879
but don't take it out on me.

729
01:21:28,061 --> 01:21:29,366
I haven't done anything.

730
01:21:29,574 --> 01:21:31,934
What you're getting is called karma.

731
01:21:40,701 --> 01:21:42,886
Khim, do you want something hot?

732
01:21:43,007 --> 01:21:44,246
I'll order one for you.

733
01:21:45,773 --> 01:21:47,206
Khim, can you hear me?

734
01:21:48,286 --> 01:21:49,486
Why is she silent?

735
01:21:51,246 --> 01:21:52,566
Khim might...

736
01:21:53,766 --> 01:21:54,766
Khim.

737
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:57,486
Khim.

738
01:22:08,926 --> 01:22:11,806
Khim, can you hear me? Thaen is back. Come out now.

739
01:22:19,086 --> 01:22:20,366
Why is your face so red?

740
01:22:21,246 --> 01:22:23,126
Khim, Khim.

741
01:22:23,326 --> 01:22:24,966
What are you doing? Come out.

742
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:34,541
Back off.

743
01:22:35,846 --> 01:22:37,046
Why?

744
01:22:37,524 --> 01:22:39,046
Are you afraid I would do something?

745
01:22:39,933 --> 01:22:41,133
I know

746
01:22:41,855 --> 01:22:43,855
that you're back to take revenge against me.

747
01:22:46,646 --> 01:22:47,846
Khim isn't in the room.

748
01:22:53,341 --> 01:22:54,566
You're paranoid like this.

749
01:22:55,285 --> 01:22:58,846
It means you had some record. You knew what you had done.

750
01:22:59,446 --> 01:23:00,806
You're crazy.

751
01:23:01,413 --> 01:23:02,619
Why wouldn't I be afraid?

752
01:23:02,741 --> 01:23:04,086
Be afraid of your own heart.

753
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,040
I think a woman like you is more dangerous.

754
01:23:06,998 --> 01:23:10,006
Khim, Thaen is back. Come out now, Khim.

755
01:23:13,694 --> 01:23:15,766
- What are you doing? - I told you

756
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:17,886
you couldn't kill me.

757
01:23:18,302 --> 01:23:19,566
So, this time,

758
01:23:19,967 --> 01:23:21,326
it's my turn.

759
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:23,686
You really don't mean well.

760
01:23:26,357 --> 01:23:28,006
I can't breathe.

761
01:23:31,152 --> 01:23:33,326
Are you trying to kill me?

762
01:23:39,797 --> 01:23:40,846
Hey.

763
01:23:50,342 --> 01:23:51,422
Khim.

764
01:23:54,233 --> 01:23:55,406
What's wrong, Khim?

765
01:23:56,806 --> 01:23:58,046
Khim, what's wrong?

766
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:01,886
Khim.

767
01:24:02,726 --> 01:24:03,726
Khim.

768
01:24:03,935 --> 01:24:05,025
What happened?

769
01:24:06,638 --> 01:24:10,006
Thaen, help me. I can't breathe.

770
01:24:12,206 --> 01:24:13,406
What happened to you?

771
01:24:13,724 --> 01:24:14,886
Why is her skin this red?

772
01:24:15,046 --> 01:24:16,646
Take Khim to a hospital first.

773
01:24:18,646 --> 01:24:20,126
Let's take her to a hospital.

774
01:24:22,926 --> 01:24:24,366
Let's go.

775
01:24:39,606 --> 01:24:42,046
The doctor said Khim had an allergic reaction to pollen.

776
01:24:42,605 --> 01:24:43,886
She has to stay here tonight.

777
01:24:44,926 --> 01:24:48,246
Pollen? Where did the pollen come from?

778
01:24:48,493 --> 01:24:49,850
I don't know what flower it is.

779
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:52,366
The doctor said she's only allergic to some.

780
01:24:54,604 --> 01:24:57,566
And has Khim woken up?

781
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:00,046
She feels better.

782
01:25:00,309 --> 01:25:01,886
They're taking her to her room.

783
01:25:09,509 --> 01:25:11,509
Just go if you have an appointment with someone.

784
01:25:12,029 --> 01:25:13,286
We can handle it here.

785
01:25:25,982 --> 01:25:27,246
You told me this.

786
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:30,046
What can't kill us makes us stronger.

787
01:25:37,871 --> 01:25:40,366
It's your fault that you couldn't kill me.

788
01:25:40,814 --> 01:25:42,406
That's why I'm able to get back at you.

789
01:25:44,301 --> 01:25:45,726
Those bees.

790
01:25:47,246 --> 01:25:48,606
Those flowers.

791
01:25:52,006 --> 01:25:53,126
What are you doing?

792
01:25:58,846 --> 01:26:00,526
It's not a coincidence.

793
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:04,789
(Two years ago)

794
01:26:45,495 --> 01:26:46,495
Miss.

795
01:26:46,766 --> 01:26:47,926
Are you okay?

796
01:26:48,821 --> 01:26:50,086
Are you okay?

797
01:26:51,735 --> 01:26:52,966
- Okay. - I have allergy.

798
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:55,846
Okay. Please lay down.

799
01:26:56,058 --> 01:26:57,726
Slowly, please lay down here.

800
01:26:57,839 --> 01:26:59,406
Okay, be careful.

801
01:26:59,705 --> 01:27:02,406
Are you okay? Do you need anything?

802
01:27:18,926 --> 01:27:20,046
Yes.

803
01:27:34,975 --> 01:27:36,606
It's really him.

804
01:27:40,086 --> 01:27:42,166
You've been watching my life.

805
01:27:52,729 --> 01:27:54,126
You're back to kill me?

806
01:28:01,182 --> 01:28:04,926
(I believe the love between Romeo and Juliet is so sentimental)

807
01:28:05,326 --> 01:28:07,486
(because both of them died.)

808
01:28:07,806 --> 01:28:10,566
(If they didn't kill themselves because of misunderstanding,)

809
01:28:10,798 --> 01:28:14,366
(their love might not even last that long.)

810
01:28:19,286 --> 01:28:20,486
They said you were dead.

811
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,206
I'm afraid I'm tenacious.

812
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:24,244
Why did you come here?

813
01:28:24,356 --> 01:28:25,717
To watch my enemy die.

814
01:28:26,316 --> 01:28:28,410
I've never wanted to do any sin

815
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:31,286
until I want to curse you to death today!

816
01:28:31,658 --> 01:28:33,126
So we don't have to meet again.

817
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:34,230
Who's that woman?

818
01:28:34,326 --> 01:28:35,606
Khim didn't care this much.

819
01:28:35,726 --> 01:28:38,270
Because she doesn't know you're double dating.

820
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:41,366
If you want a friend to accompany you, you can call me.

821
01:28:41,574 --> 01:28:42,886
What is Prompt doing?

822
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:44,926
He asked his people to investigate Kaokla.

823
01:28:45,022 --> 01:28:46,126
Don't go in.

824
01:28:46,373 --> 01:28:47,526
It might be his plan.

825
01:28:47,686 --> 01:28:49,446
He made us suspect something.

826
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,600
When we break into it, he'll put a charge against us.

827
01:28:51,734 --> 01:28:53,726
I'm not stupid enough to get caught like you.

828
01:28:54,086 --> 01:28:56,286
- Kloy. - Don't worry.

829
01:28:56,461 --> 01:28:59,166
I'm still alive. My fate hasn't ended yet.
