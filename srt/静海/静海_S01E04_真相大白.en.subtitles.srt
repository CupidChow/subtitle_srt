WATER DISTRIBUTION STATION

3
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,943
DO NOT DISCRIMINATE
DISTRIBUTE FAIRLY

4
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,949
Please take part
in the abolition of the classification.

5
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,492
We need your signature, sir.

6
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,502
We need your signature.

7
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,088
We need your signature.

8
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:48,757
Thank you.

9
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:10,153
This is an announcement for all patients
of the Third National Medical Center.

10
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,824
The Third National Medical Center
promises to provide

11
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,745
the best care in order for you
to return to your daily lives.

12
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:23,083
If you have any questions
during your stay, feel free to…

13
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,587
You'll need a higher water classification
to stop her condition from worsening.

14
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,006
If her condition worsens,

15
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,801
she may lose her legs forever.

16
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,097
There isn't much we can do

17
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,975
with the class you currently hold.

18
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,916
THE TRUTH COMES OUT

19
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,667
That's water.

20
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,544
It's water.

21
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,922
It's ordinary, yet it's unusual.

22
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,885
What's ordinary about it
and what's unusual?

23
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,595
Its solubility, surface tension,

24
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,722
and other characteristics are like water.

25
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,933
But the mass and the density aren't.

26
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,353
There was no microorganism found,
so it's closer to distilled water.

27
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,106
Yet it's bigger in atomic weight
like heavy water.

28
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,524
But it's not heavy water.

29
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,152
It froze at a temperature
much lower than water.

30
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
It froze at about
minus 80 degrees Celsius.

31
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,657
It became less active
as the temperature dropped.

32
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,910
But it's still water.

33
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,999
BALHAE LUNAR RESEARCH STATION

34
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,650
I'm way too frightened to watch this.

35
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,404
Make sure your anchor is rock solid.

36
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,031
It'll be over if you slip.

37
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,912
Once you're there,
you'll see the power to the mechanism.

38
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,124
Once you turn that off,
I'll begin revising the protocol.

39
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,710
You can replace the panel while I do that,

40
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,170
and once I give you a sign…

41
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,634
Hey.

42
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,261
What's happening?

43
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,184
That's…

44
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,603
-Try to do whatever it takes to stop it.
-I'm trying.

45
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,401
What? Why's the elevator moving?

46
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,487
It's completely out of control.

47
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,072
Captain, you have to avoid it.

48
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,246
Put the emergency brake on.

49
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,247
Yes, sir.

50
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,800
The emergency brake is down too.

51
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,595
Captain, you need to move!

52
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,679
Wait, no!

53
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,226
-You need to move, sir!
-Captain!

54
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,736
Captain. Are you okay?

55
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,881
What?

56
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,342
What's going on?

57
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,766
Is it working now?

58
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,143
I think so.

59
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,982
Captain.

60
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,192
I'm fine.

61
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,653
What happened?

62
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,363
I'm not sure, Captain.

63
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,740
It may be malfunctioning
due to the unstable power.

64
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,952
I thought the elevator wasn't working.
Why would it suddenly do that?

65
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,329
Captain. Are you okay?

66
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,290
I'll go to you, Captain.

67
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,541
Drop the rope.

68
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,905
Throw the rope.

69
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,407
-Pardon, Captain?
-Throw the whole thing down!

70
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,284
What's going on? Captain?

71
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,038
What?

72
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,666
Captain!

73
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,210
-Captain!
-Captain!

74
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,753
-Sir!
-No!

75
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,708
-Damage detected in the oxygen system.
-Captain.

76
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,378
-Can you hear me, sir?
-Damage detected in the oxygen system.

77
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:10,967
Sir!

78
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,803
Sir?

79
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,847
Captain! Are you okay?

80
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,727
You have to come to your senses!

81
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,188
Answer us, Captain!

82
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,527
Captain!

83
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,949
Are you okay, sir?

84
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,576
I'm fine.

85
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,703
What a relief, sir.

86
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,581
I was worried something
might have happened to you.

87
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,292
I'll finish up and return.

88
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:41,432
Oxygen level at nine percent.
Impairment to thermoregulatory control.

89
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,391
Captain,

90
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,060
you can't proceed any further.

91
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,479
You'd better return.

92
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,446
I'm okay.

93
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,250
Damage detected in the oxygen system.

94
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,172
Damage detected in the oxygen system.

95
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,178
I found it. What's next?

96
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,807
Pull down the bottom lever
to replace the device,

97
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,226
then turn off the power switch
on the upper right.

98
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,821
Signal detected. Revising the protocol.

99
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,947
Rebooting.

100
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,078
One minute until the system reboots.
Please replace the panel.

101
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,872
It's the second panel from the left.

102
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,054
Damage detected in the oxygen system.

103
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,017
Damage detected in the oxygen system.

104
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,106
Damage detected in the oxygen system.

105
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,460
Panel replaced.

106
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,879
Thirty seconds until the system reboots.

107
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,382
But of all elevators,

108
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,469
why on earth
did the elevator in that shaft move?

109
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,722
Exactly. I can't control it
or spot the error.

110
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,183
This place has bad feng shui.

111
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,435
Things went haywire from the start.

112
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,354
Connect life support system immediately.

113
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,775
Connect life support system immediately.

114
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,818
You need to come back right now, sir.

115
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,945
System rebooted.

116
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,198
Turn on the switch and lever
in reverse order.

117
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,326
Connect life support system immediately.

118
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,243
Sir.

119
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,914
You have to come back. Can you make it?

120
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,667
Connect life support system immediately.

121
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,050
You need to come up now, sir.

122
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,846
Connect life support system immediately.

123
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,440
Connect life support system immediately.

124
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,360
-Captain.
-Captain!

125
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,278
-Sir!
-Are you all right?

126
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,738
Oh, no.

127
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,365
Chief Gong!

128
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,282
Captain!

129
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,992
Do you see the Captain, Chief Gong?

130
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:47,993
Captain!

131
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,537
Sir!

132
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,458
Even if its molecular structure is
different from Earth's water, it's water.

133
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,961
And we saw obvious signs
of drowning in the bodies.

134
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,381
But how was that much water
stored in his body?

135
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,340
Exactly.

136
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,760
At first, I thought
it could be secondary drowning.

137
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,428
But think of Soochan. No way.

138
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,638
Secondary drowning?

139
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,807
There are different types of drowning?

140
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,517
The water that gets into your lungs

141
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,937
can cause pulmonary edema, brain damage,
respiratory distress, and more.

142
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,023
It's when you get water in your lungs,
but you don't realize it.

143
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,191
It causes death later.

144
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,445
Does that mean you drown
because of the water in your body?

145
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,656
How long does it take

146
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,200
for secondary drowning to show symptoms?

147
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,910
It differs by case.

148
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,912
It could show in under an hour.

149
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,833
At times, people collapse
in a day or two with difficulty breathing.

150
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,045
But the amount of water Soochan threw up…

151
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:44,341
Yes, it's way too much
to say it was all in his lungs.

152
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,553
How can the amount of water
in his body explode in quantity

153
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,514
and infiltrate his throat and lungs?
That's impossible.

154
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,765
But the water

155
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,811
did not increase in quantity
after his death.

156
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,190
So?

157
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,320
It multiplies rapidly
once the host is infected,

158
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,073
then it stops its activity
when the host dies.

159
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,919
Are you saying this water is a virus?

160
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,927
Captain.

161
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,431
Captain, are you all right?

162
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,398
What happened?

163
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,609
You lost consciousness
due to lack of oxygen.

164
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,820
Why don't you stop by the infirmary first?

165
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,822
I'm fine.

166
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,020
-And the comms?
-We're trying.

167
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:41,375
Are those all types of viruses and germs?

168
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,627
Nothing matches.

169
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,089
I'm sure he was infected by something.

170
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,887
If it's not in our data, it's more likely
to be a type of extraterrestrial virus.

171
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,889
Even if it is an extraterrestrial virus,

172
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,017
did it really kill everyone
five years ago?

173
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,353
The others are all fine.

174
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:06,316
That means it can't be airborne.
He likely caught it through contact.

175
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,654
So how did it spread so quickly
five years ago?

176
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,842
What's wrong?

177
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,596
I can't remember the last time
I've seen such clear water.

178
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,314
Captain.

179
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,274
Are you all right?

180
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,027
How are things going?

181
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,488
Comms are still down.

182
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,655
It doesn't work?

183
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,701
The DU wasn't the problem?

184
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,286
The panel was replaced,

185
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,622
and the system was rebooted
without a problem.

186
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,374
Yes. The system shows
that everything is fine,

187
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,710
but there's no exchange of signals.

188
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,669
Maybe…

189
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,673
The system itself could've been damaged
because of the accident.

190
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,425
You said the system was fine.

191
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,054
Even if there's a problem,
the system may not be able to detect it.

192
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,056
At the moment,

193
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,601
it's impossible
to send or receive any signals.

194
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,019
Any backup radios?

195
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:29,358
Every single communication device
in this station is down.

196
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,028
I've been searching
for a signal internally,

197
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114
but I haven't detected anything yet.

198
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,117
I should've checked that first.

199
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,119
Don't mention it.

200
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,413
I should do whatever I can.
I couldn't just space out.

201
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,790
UNKNOWN SIGNAL DETECTED

202
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,416
What's that?

203
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,961
Wait, we got something.

204
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,671
We caught a signal.

205
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,592
UNKNOWN SIGNAL DETECTED

206
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,304
Could it be one
of our communication devices?

207
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,222
No.

208
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,392
It's clearly coming in from the outside.

209
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,270
But none of us are
out there right now. Right?

210
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,147
Where's it being sent?

211
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,277
Storage Three.

212
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,073
The murderer always returns
to the scene of the crime.

213
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,538
Who's sending the signal from the outside?

214
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,041
I'm sure those jerks are with
the rat hiding in the station.

215
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,794
If the intruder had
a separate communication device,

216
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,380
our situation is
most likely exposed to them.

217
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,578
Why is nobody here?

218
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,908
Why does he have something like that?

219
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,811
I didn't like him
from the moment I saw him.

220
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,313
But why did the intruder kill him?

221
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,899
You're right.
Aren't they on the same side?

222
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,277
I don't know what all this
is about anymore.

223
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,904
Can you find out who sent these?

224
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,573
I think he used an older model
for security reasons.

225
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,701
It's not likely, but I'll give it a try.

226
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,411
I've seen the men of RX using these.

227
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,873
Can we communicate with Earth using this?

228
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,292
Yes, it's more than possible.

229
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,877
Let's try to contact Director Choi.

230
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,172
Yes, sir.

231
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,515
He probably fiddled with
the biosignal to lose you two.

232
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,475
And I fell for it.

233
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,271
Did you find anything
on the cause of their deaths?

234
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:58,358
They all died due to the rapid increase
of water from inside their bodies.

235
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,944
We're still trying to find the cause.

236
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,824
This is odd.

237
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,785
Everything is connected.

238
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,996
This is really odd.

239
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,539
There is no reason for--

240
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,000
It's connected. We're connected.

241
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:16,918
CONNECTION ACCEPTED

242
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,795
Captain, we're connected.

243
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,548
We'll talk again.

244
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:45,405
Three died, and one of them was a spy?

245
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,618
It's the worst report I can imagine.

246
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:53,663
You're the one who approved the co-pilot
to be changed right before we departed.

247
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,042
Once the Inspection Department
hears of this,

248
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,545
they'll conduct a thorough investigation
on the reasons for the replacement.

249
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,215
Of course, it'll include me.

250
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,470
Is there a possibility that other members
could be in league with him?

251
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,138
It cannot be excluded.

252
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,851
What's important is

253
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,147
catching the intruder
who took that sample.

254
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:24,903
Is it more important to stop the intruder
than to retrieve the samples?

255
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,156
You of all people should know
how valuable these samples are.

256
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,494
I wouldn't have started this
if I'd let anyone else have it.

257
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,624
We need access to level-one areas
to conduct a thorough search.

258
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,521
CLOSED

259
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,026
ENTER THE CODE

260
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,574
Dr. Song, where are you?

261
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,535
Oh, right.

262
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,828
I'll be there soon.

263
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,001
They've been talking for a long time.

264
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,130
"We sent a rescue ship.
Return as soon as possible."

265
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,757
I hope that's what she says.

266
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,884
It's all fucked up, man.

267
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,311
A survivor?

268
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,522
I don't agree with Dr. Song's theory,

269
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,692
but there were questionable aspects
when the co-pilot was killed.

270
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,987
What do you mean, Captain Han?

271
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,909
There are no signs
of radiation leaks in the station.

272
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,080
Were you already aware of this?

273
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,165
What?

274
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:52,008
You seemed to be very shocked
when I mentioned the spy,

275
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,761
but you seemed indifferent
when I mentioned

276
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,638
that there could be a survivor.

277
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,480
You're the first person who told me

278
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,441
that there are
no signs of radiation leakage.

279
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,277
And…

280
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,197
it's because you mentioned
someone could be alive.

281
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,659
Although it was closed for five years.

282
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:25,584
Captain Han, perhaps you're starting
to believe Dr. Song's absurd theory.

283
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,088
If you're hiding any information
that could jeopardize my crew's safety,

284
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,051
the success of this operation
is no longer my interest.

285
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,053
As…

286
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,391
the chief officer of this mission,

287
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,853
I wish for the crew's safe return
more than anybody.

288
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,481
There's no reason
for me to hide anything from you.

289
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,526
You must complete
the mission successfully.

290
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,613
Not only will it save your daughter,

291
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,157
it could also save

292
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,076
all of us.

293
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,882
There is absolutely no virus
in this thing.

294
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,427
This is the last one.

295
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,429
The last what?

296
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,099
How long do we have to do this?

297
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,774
Why?

298
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,900
One second.

299
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,942
What is it?

300
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,198
What are you doing?

301
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,455
I want to try something.

302
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:09,979
What's this?

303
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,232
Why is it doing that?

304
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,149
It's dividing.

305
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,444
What is this? Is something wrong?

306
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,489
-Move back. Step back.
-Why is it doing that?

307
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,448
One second.

308
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,590
Wait.

309
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,634
It stopped multiplying.

310
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,263
What is this?

311
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,597
Why…

312
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,849
Why did it do that?

313
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,814
Blood stays alive
for a while out of the body.

314
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,774
That's why it showed a reaction.

315
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,610
This must be what caused Soochan's death.

316
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,654
Once the host died,

317
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,865
it stopped multiplying.

318
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,287
Water that multiplies…

319
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,055
Then, is there a delay
in schedule for the rescue ship?

320
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,975
Yes, we need more time
to find the intruder and the sample.

321
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,519
How should we capture the intruder?

322
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,981
They should be kept alive,
but if you retrieve the sample,

323
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,900
you may kill the intruder.

324
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,111
We'll search for the intruder.

325
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,322
-Taesuk and Sun, come with--
-Captain.

326
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,491
She's doing this

327
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,827
because we have no lander to take us back.

328
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,829
She's threatening us with the rescue ship.

329
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,373
This isn't how she should ask us
to extend our mission.

330
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,958
It's not how things are done.

331
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,509
Then what do you suggest?

332
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,514
I'm not saying I have a particular plan.

333
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,599
Let's stay focused.

334
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,935
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

335
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,239
Is it water?

336
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,367
The sample we're here to retrieve.

337
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,619
Is it water?

338
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,003
You knew.

339
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,301
I'm sure you are aware of

340
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,346
the space resource development
that countries were competing over.

341
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,391
Nobody was interested in the Moon.

342
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,854
Nothing in particular was found,
so most countries had pulled out.

343
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,689
However,

344
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,860
there is a reason why
we never gave up on the Moon.

345
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,907
We actually found

346
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,411
something very profound.

347
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,539
What is it?

348
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,836
Water.

349
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,007
It was a perfect chance for us

350
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:28,887
to catch up to other developed countries
as a newcomer in the industry.

351
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,309
Dr. Song Wonkyung called it…

352
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,104
lunar water.

353
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,280
Balhae Station was a place
where they studied the lunar water.

354
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,117
Is there really water on the Moon?

355
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,120
That's everything Director Choi told me.

356
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,831
She said we found water on the Moon,

357
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,625
and if this research is a success,

358
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,294
we could save all of humanity.

359
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,879
Why did you hide this from us?

360
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,300
Why did you go so far
to keep this a secret from us?

361
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,470
It's obvious what would happen
if this information is leaked.

362
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,389
Lee Gisu is dead,
but someone is bound to come after us.

363
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,685
No, the real reason why Director Choi
didn't tell us about the sample

364
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,481
is because that water is
what killed everyone at Balhae Station

365
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,524
as well as Soochan.

366
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,366
What do you mean?

367
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,496
I think we know why Soochan died.

368
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,956
It looks like

369
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,834
Soochan was exposed to the lunar water.

370
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,212
We aren't completely sure,

371
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,382
but the lunar water
seems to act like a virus.

372
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,718
It multiplies
until it takes the host's life.

373
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,719
It multiplies?

374
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,931
The water multiplies?

375
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,516
Yes.

376
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,560
It multiplies endlessly.

377
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,606
I'm sure it seemed like
an amazing resource.

378
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,317
If we could control its multiplication,

379
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,403
if we could commercialize it,

380
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,572
they probably thought
it could save mankind.

381
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,741
If that's possible,

382
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,827
it should happen.

383
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,545
That's what my sister wanted.

384
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,174
Dr. Song Wonkyung.

385
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,677
Yes, Dr. Song Wonkyung.

386
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,016
My sister

387
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,309
wanted that too.

388
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,021
Hey.

389
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,147
It's the Moon.

390
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,111
Do you see those dark spots?

391
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,282
It's called "The Silent Sea."

392
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,492
Long ago,

393
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,662
Galileo thought that was a sea.

394
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,540
That's why he named it the silent sea.

395
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,085
But once we got to the Moon,

396
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,587
there was no sea.

397
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,340
Just like how it is here.

398
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,846
I heard all of this used to be
the sea a long time ago.

399
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,767
The Earth will end up like the Moon.

400
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,061
Right?

401
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,854
Don't worry.

402
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,901
One day, I'll fill up this entire place
and turn it back into the sea.

403
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,153
You will?

404
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,488
Yes.

405
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:35,990
Wait and see.

406
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,700
One day,

407
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,702
it'll happen.

408
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,633
I can see why everyone risks their lives
to come and get it.

409
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,553
If you succeed,
you'd make a fortune, right?

410
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,098
But it still can't be controlled.

411
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,517
No, it can't be controlled.

412
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,561
We don't even know
how you can get infected.

413
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,564
What about us? Are we all right?

414
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,233
No.

415
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,654
Whatever.

416
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,284
I'm just going to hold out
until the rescue ship comes and go home.

417
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,412
If we can keep the lunar water
under control,

418
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,459
we'll get to live in a world
without any water classification cards.

419
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,503
How are we going to create
a world like that?

420
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,713
She never told us a thing
about our mission,

421
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,382
so we ended up losing Soochan.

422
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,350
I was told it's still under research,
so the substance is very unstable.

423
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:48,104
It's susceptible to external stimulus,
so it had to be kept at a low temperature.

424
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,772
That external stimulus

425
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,151
is coming in contact
with a living organism.

426
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,239
The researchers here were
infected by the lunar water and died,

427
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:02,618
but the government covered up everything
to hide the existence of lunar water.

428
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,167
We don't know the symptoms
or how you get infected.

429
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,210
There are too many things we don't know.

430
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,339
I'm not angry at you or blaming you.

431
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,175
I just want information.

432
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,303
I was against it.

433
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,601
I found out you were Dr. Song's sister

434
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,644
and was reluctant to have you on my team.

435
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,731
Why did you come here?

436
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,777
My sister called me here.

437
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,365
What do you mean?

438
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,450
You said

439
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,370
Director Choi gave you
the code to restricted areas.

440
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,375
The data storage of Balhae Station

441
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,670
is inside the main lab.

442
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,800
And I need level-one access
to get in there.

443
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,557
I mean, her sister was the chief here.

444
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,518
How can she not know a thing
about lunar water?

445
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,231
Are you suspicious of her?

446
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,900
No, that's not what I meant.

447
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,610
I'm just saying,

448
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,196
I don't get

449
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,074
why she took up this mission.

450
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,120
She would've been curious,
and it would have felt unfair.

451
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,922
If your family died
and you don't know the reason,

452
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,841
if their death is deemed meaningless
and nothing changes,

453
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,677
I would find everything futile.

454
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,554
And Soochan

455
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,474
would also feel it's unfair.

456
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,605
But I'm not saying

457
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,233
I'll put that before my mission.

458
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,602
How did you know about this?

459
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,024
I just got lucky.

460
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,111
Do you think
you’ll find something in here?

461
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,072
The answer.

462
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,076
You cannot enter the data storage
without authorization.

463
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,161
I know that.

464
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,496
So let me go inside by myself.

465
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,261
I don't trust you yet.

466
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,235
CLOSED
CODE VERIFIED

467
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,615
OPEN

468
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,517
This is a huge amount of data.

469
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,894
There should be a browser somewhere.

470
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,864
What is this?

471
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,312
These are plants.
