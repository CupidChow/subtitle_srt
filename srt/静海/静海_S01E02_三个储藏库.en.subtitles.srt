MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

4
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,165
Jian.

5
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,920
Do you see those dark spots?

6
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,381
It's called "The Silent Sea."

7
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,744
THREE STORAGES

8
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,834
Captain, we need to switch out
our life support system.

9
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,087
Connect to life support system
immediately.

10
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,893
Man, that feels much better.

11
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,485
I thought I was really going to die.

12
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,198
Are we all doing okay?

13
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,366
Fuck, finally.

14
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,953
Begin the pressurization.

15
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,800
AIR LOCK AIR PRESSURE

17
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,253
We're going into the station.

18
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,309
Let's restore power first.

19
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,354
Let's get to the command center.
We'll find the main power supply there.

20
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,666
Tell me if you feel dizzy or nauseated.

21
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,127
-Okay.
-I can't feel my feet.

22
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,054
What the hell did they do here? Fuck.

23
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,181
Fuck. What the hell?

24
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,183
-What's that?
-What is it?

25
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,395
Everyone, step back.

26
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,547
-Chief Gong.
-Yes, sir.

27
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,591
Record the scene.
Report as soon as comms are back up.

28
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,717
Yes, sir.

29
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,637
E1. The scanner.

30
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:19,021
There were a few attempts of breaking
and entering since the shutdown.

31
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,816
His weapon and suit
suggests he's a mercenary.

32
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,071
I don't think we could identify him.

33
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,908
Doesn't it seem a little odd?

34
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,369
It seems like he drowned to death.

35
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,872
Drowned to death? Here?

36
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,749
That makes no sense.

37
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,376
That's why it's odd.

38
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,797
But I see mucus foam
around his mouth and nose,

39
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,757
and his lungs are swollen.

40
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,261
Those are typical characteristics
of a drowned body.

41
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,640
We'll know for sure after an autopsy.

42
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,851
I'm jealous.

43
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,936
I know he's a dead man,

44
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,481
but at least he had
as much water as he wanted.

45
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,656
Let's move.

46
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,493
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

47
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,791
Where do you think
that dead man came from?

48
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,671
The US? Russia?

49
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,257
Maybe he's with RX.

50
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,760
You mean that transnational corporation?

51
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,973
What was the rest?

52
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,266
Oh, the rest?

53
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,187
That's it. RX.

54
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,105
That's right.

55
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,440
They've been messing
with every single country.

56
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,859
They're like the resource Mafia.

57
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,251
It's huge.

58
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,337
I can't see the end of it.

59
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,132
What did they do in here?

60
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,718
Something that we don't know about.

61
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,304
This station cost a fortune.

62
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,432
This is weird.

63
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,600
What's wrong?

64
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,852
What is?

65
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,106
-The radiation level.
-Isn't it odd?

66
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,401
Isn't this at a normal level?
It's similar to other areas.

67
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,487
I guess this wasn't the area
where radiation leaked.

68
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,699
I know it'd vary depending
on the area, but this low?

69
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,783
It's odd.

70
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,453
What if the government report wasn't true?

71
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,164
What do you mean?

72
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:27,043
We don't know what kind of
radioactive substance killed the crew,

73
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,170
or how it was leaked out and from where.

74
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,922
Nothing has been revealed to this day.

75
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,885
Are you suggesting that a radiation leak
may not be the cause of the accident?

76
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,595
That's what the number says.

77
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,514
And that man didn't look like

78
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,101
he was killed due to radiation exposure.

79
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,313
Is there a problem?

80
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,941
The radiation level is at a normal range.

81
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,569
And other detectors?

82
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,657
They're the same.
It's not a problem with the detector.

83
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,909
How far are we from the command center?

84
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,871
You can use the staircase 20m to the north
and go down one level.

85
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,917
Let's go. Our priority is
to reach the command center.

86
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:09,919
Captain Han.

87
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,632
There are too many oddities here.

88
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,262
We must conduct an autopsy on that body
to find out the exact cause of his death.

89
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,932
-Didn't you hear what I said?
-I did.

90
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,101
The radiation level doesn't look right,

91
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,478
and the cause of his death is uncertain.

92
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,271
We cannot just let this go.

93
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,149
I decide what our priority is.

94
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,466
This place is huge.

95
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,099
Let's see.

96
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,476
CLOSED

97
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,479
OPENED

98
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,522
It worked.

99
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,571
Wow. Look at that view.

100
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,368
-E2, check the left side.
-Yes, sir.

101
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,787
E1, this side.

102
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,747
Yes, sir.

103
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,052
All clear on the left side.

104
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,846
All clear, sir.

105
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,350
All clear, sir.

106
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,109
Look at all this equipment.

107
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,194
Wow.

108
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,864
I'll activate the main power supply.

109
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,160
E1, E2, check the equipment.

110
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,495
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

111
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,211
This is impressive.

112
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,507
No wonder everyone was
talking about this place. It's huge.

113
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,772
Captain. Communications are still down.

114
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,275
They're probably looking for a way too.

115
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,236
It'll take some time
for the rescue ship to arrive,

116
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,613
so focus on our mission.

117
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,614
Yes, Captain.

118
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,201
All levels related to survival are fine.

119
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,413
Radiation is at a normal level too.

120
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,499
Even the supposedly
contaminated area seems fine too.

121
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,587
If anything, the filter breakdown
was a big fat lie.

122
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,465
Why did they shut down
this perfectly fine station?

123
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,301
Like I said,

124
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,345
Director Choi and everyone
at the SAA don't know a thing.

125
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,515
Are you sure all is safe
within the station?

126
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,225
That's what the numbers say.

127
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,813
Doc Hong, so we can take these off?

128
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,774
Well, theoretically speaking, yes.

129
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,320
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

130
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,372
It looks like the numbers
are at a normal level.

131
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,043
But in order to carry out our mission,

132
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,504
we must make
a full inspection of the station.

133
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,898
Our mission isn't to investigate the cause
of the accident at Balhae Station.

134
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,405
Take off your life support systems.

135
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,824
Right now?

136
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,368
Yes, sir.

137
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,915
Soochan, check the system
according to the manual.

138
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,961
Yes, sir. I will activate
the air purification system first.

139
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,755
Take off your equipment.

140
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,057
AIR PURIFICATION SYSTEM, PREPARING

141
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,312
AIR PURIFICATION SYSTEM, ACTIVATED

142
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,571
PURIFICATION INITIATED

143
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,566
How are you breathing?

144
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,901
Why does my throat feel sore?

145
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,653
I'm not breathing right now.

146
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,905
Is it working?

147
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,240
It's better than breathing.

148
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,909
Soochan, stop chitchatting
and focus on your mission.

149
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,578
Don't get cute and cause trouble.

150
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,663
-Okay, fine.
-You can't ask me for--

151
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,416
Stop nagging. You came to do this, right?

152
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,085
That's enough of your nagging. Okay?

153
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,547
You're just like Dad.

154
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,640
Red areas are restricted areas

155
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,227
and require authorization level one
or higher to access.

156
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:46,315
As you can see,
it doesn't show what those facilities are.

157
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,277
Which means the crew members here
couldn't have known where everything was.

158
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,113
Why is everything so mysterious?

159
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,698
And oddly enough,

160
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:59,536
the supposed areas that were shut down
due to extreme contamination

161
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,414
were mostly these restricted
level-one areas.

162
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,625
Well, let's say it's just a coincidence.

163
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,668
Where are the samples?

164
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,590
There are three storages where the samples
are most likely to remain secure.

165
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:15,469
The closest one is Storage Two,
north of the command center.

166
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,553
STORAGE 2

167
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,779
Supporting facilities surround
the command center and the main lab

168
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,197
in the station.

169
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,284
There are a total of eight gates
in Balhae Station.

170
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,912
In order to avoid contaminated areas,

171
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:46,208
it'll be safest to take a detour
to the machine room from the main gate.

172
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,804
We're splitting up.

173
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,516
Doc Hong, E2, and I
are going to Storage One.

174
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,643
Taesuk, Sun, Soochan, and E1, Storage Two.

175
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,563
Chief Gong, Dr. Song, and Gisu,
Storage Three.

176
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:09,940
Dr. Song?

177
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:17,823
Yes. As soon as you locate the capsule,
you must check the thermoregulator first.

178
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,742
If the capsule maintained
its extremely low temperature,

179
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,663
the status screen on the top
will be lit up in green.

180
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,667
If you see a red light, do not touch it.

181
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,919
Keep reporting your team's location,

182
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,255
and if the sample you find seems unusual,

183
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,923
contact Dr. Song immediately.

184
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,341
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

185
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,057
Why did he clap?

186
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,475
-No idea.
-Soochan.

187
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,352
Yes, Dr. Song.

188
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:54,109
The crew members of Balhae Station
had biometric chips in them, right?

189
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,527
Yes, they did.

190
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,535
Can you access them from the main system?

191
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:08,123
We could probably find
the victims' identities and locations.

192
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,629
I gave it a try, but I think
the accident caused the chips to go dead.

193
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,255
Why do you ask?

194
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,591
It's nothing.

195
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,509
I just got curious.

196
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,346
We can't let the bereaved families know,
so there's no use.

197
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,266
See you later.

198
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,271
Let's find them and go home.

199
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,062
Both the Moon and Mars
aren't adequate for human survival.

200
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,774
I feel bad for saying this
about someone who died,

201
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:02,279
but only tenacious people like Mr. Hwang
can last a few years at a place like this.

202
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,197
How can anybody do this?

203
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,866
It'd drive you insane.

204
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,952
I'm sure it's all the same
for everyone who ended up here.

205
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,205
It's all because of the fucking water.

206
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,915
For Han Yunjae too.

207
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,752
He acts all haughty
as the legendary figure of the SAA,

208
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,713
but he only came back to get water.

209
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,841
He recently quit working there,

210
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,844
but Director Choi called him back
in an emergency.

211
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,764
He fell for the offer
to get a higher water class.

212
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,515
You must know him very well.

213
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,476
Yes, of course. I know him very well.

214
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,520
Accepted and graduated from
the military academy top of his class.

215
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,147
He's a legend.

216
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,859
I get that he's competent and talented.

217
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,070
But he's not someone good to work with.

218
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,864
He has an awful temper
and is completely inflexible.

219
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,783
Hey, is it this way?

220
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,036
I mean, every other family
loses their kid in this day and age.

221
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,590
One out of every ten kids born after
the Great Drought dies within five years.

222
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,385
His daughter held out
for a long time thanks to her dad.

223
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,636
I'm sorry.

224
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,721
I don't care for that information.

225
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,099
How rude.

226
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,984
Lieutenant Ryu,
I heard you used to be a pilot too.

227
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:23,902
Yes.

228
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,071
Then you became
a chief engineer right away?

229
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,030
Yes.

230
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,534
It felt suffocating
to stick around at headquarters.

231
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,536
Oh, so it felt suffocating?

232
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,329
So you came to get some air.

233
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,708
-You're amazing.
-Right? Isn't he?

234
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,170
It took Soochan about three, four years
to become a chief engineer.

235
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,214
Lieutenant Ryu is just exceptional.

236
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,174
I would've done it sooner if I wanted to.

237
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,385
-My gosh.
-What? Why?

238
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,097
-Damn.
-My gosh.

239
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,933
Why would anyone draw something here?

240
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,228
-Let's go.
-Didn't they have anything better to do?

241
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,482
It's just a drawing. Yes.

242
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,153
Wait up.

243
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,906
What?

244
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,991
It's not opening?

245
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,265
Soochan, the gate won't open.
Can you check the security setting?

246
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,685
The system looked fine.

247
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,645
It might be a mechanical problem.

248
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,147
Should we force it open?

249
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:43,982
Get on it.

250
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,113
One, two, three.

251
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,953
One, two, three.

252
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,793
One, two, three.

253
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,871
It must've been a tough decision
for you to join this mission.

254
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,631
What can we leave behind
for the next generation?

255
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,555
Mr. Hwang,

256
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,307
do you know anything about Luna?

257
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,187
It's just…

258
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,900
Director Choi mentioned it
while I was in a meeting with her.

259
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,280
I highly doubt she'd mention Luna.

260
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,342
Luna is the data storage
at Balhae Station.

261
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,449
Why are you so startled?

262
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,744
I guess something's down there?

263
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,052
Wait, one second.

264
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,012
Captain, it looks like

265
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,306
something is stuck.

266
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,351
Something is in there.

267
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,545
Captain, did you open it?

268
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,217
Captain?

269
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,260
Is something wrong?

270
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,970
We found bodies.

271
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,348
They seem to be
Balhae Station crew members.

272
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,869
Captain, is everything okay?

273
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,831
We're fine.
We'll record the site and keep moving.

274
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,961
Why? It won't open?

275
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,214
Not a damn thing
works smoothly in this station.

276
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,928
Dr. Hong, can you show me
what the scene looks like?

277
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,097
Sure, give me a second.

278
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,116
I see traces of them
trying to make an escape.

279
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,412
It looks like the area
was shut down in an emergency

280
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,165
right after the accident.

281
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,459
That's really weird.

282
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,296
The government stated
they all died before the shutdown.

283
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:19,799
You're right. What exactly happened here?

284
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,430
Report when you find the sample.

285
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,390
We'll head over to Storage One soon.

286
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,184
Wait.

287
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,563
I don't see any burn scars
on the dead bodies.

288
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,148
Right.

289
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,028
They all have the characteristics
of drowned bodies.

290
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,198
What in the world happened here?

291
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,241
Captain Han,

292
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,286
if we cannot conduct an autopsy now,

293
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:52,665
why don't we stop by the infirmary
and check their medical records?

294
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,585
I thought we were done discussing this.

295
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,630
Since the situation has changed,

296
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,965
I'm simply sharing my opinion again.

297
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,468
What has changed?

298
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:07,430
We found many more suspicious elements
on more dead bodies.

299
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,849
If we can collect some tissue
from the crew,

300
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,935
we might be able to find a lead.

301
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:15,063
Can you focus on the mission
instead of your personal curiosity?

302
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,781
What do you mean by that?

303
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,074
You heard me.

304
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,260
Have some water.

305
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,892
To be honest, I was a little surprised.

306
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,897
It couldn't have been easy,
after what happened to your sister.

307
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,533
It's belated,

308
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,160
but the bodies of the crew
will be retrieved

309
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,248
before Balhae Station
is permanently shut down.

310
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,127
That's why…

311
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,425
I think it'd be better for everyone
if other crew members don't know

312
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:29,178
that you're bereaved family
until the mission is over.

313
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,057
I agree.

314
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,269
It'd be burdensome on them too.

315
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,234
But why did you…

316
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,530
ask me to join this mission?

317
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,834
We've arrived at Storage One.

318
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,011
It worked.

319
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,763
CLOSED

320
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,680
OPEN

321
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,849
Storage Two, open.

322
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,690
Storage One, open.

323
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,663
Entering Storage Two.

324
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,541
What's all this?

325
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,461
All of these are…

326
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,258
Why is everything red?

327
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,512
It looks like someone
cleaned this place out.

328
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,558
Captain, I don't think there are

329
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,977
any samples left here.

330
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,627
It looks like someone searched the place.

331
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,676
See if there are any intact.

332
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,011
Yes, sir.

333
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,247
Both teams didn't find any samples.

334
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,207
We should hurry.

335
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:25,938
Nothing?

336
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,609
-Gosh.
-I found one.

337
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,277
-What?
-A dead body.

338
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,198
What's wrong? You okay?

339
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,116
Yes, I'm fine. I'm okay.

340
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,662
He was a crew member, right?

341
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,166
The radiation level in here is fine too.

342
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,962
That means they didn't die
because of the radiation.

343
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,382
That one's empty too.

344
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,427
They're all empty.

345
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,221
Damn it.

346
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,430
Let's keep looking.

347
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:00,932
Okay.

348
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:03,976
What's this?

349
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,023
-I have no idea.
-What?

350
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,697
Hey.

351
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,011
All of these are empty too.

352
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,888
There's nothing here.

353
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,604
Wait.

354
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,483
An unknown biosignal has been detected.

355
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,288
Is it a malfunction?

356
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,748
No, it's working fine.

357
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,337
It's moving solo.

358
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,464
I don't think it's one of us.

359
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,178
Does this mean someone besides us is here?

360
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,180
I'll go check.

361
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,098
You two should wait here.

362
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,985
What the heck is going on
in this cursed station?

363
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:41,741
We need to know what happened
to be prepared to face things like this.

364
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,582
Dr. Song.

365
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,629
We should go.

366
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,130
To where?

367
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,298
You know,

368
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,301
to the main infirmary, as you mentioned.

369
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,553
I gave it some thought,

370
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,139
and I think what you said is right.

371
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,976
We need to know what happened here
to be thoroughly prepared.

372
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,479
But they won't

373
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,315
tell us anything.

374
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,821
I'll make up an excuse for Chief Gong.
You should hurry.

375
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,617
This is probably your only chance.

376
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,949
I'm sorry. My gosh. I'm so sorry.

377
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,575
What are you sorry about?

378
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,245
-One second.
-You found one?

379
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,291
Damn it.

380
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,917
It's empty.

381
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,795
All that for nothing.

382
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,630
Let's return.

383
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,965
Okay.

384
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:21,966
All right.

385
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,052
Fuck, they're empty.

386
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,809
Fuck. They're all gone.

387
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,791
This damn station is seriously cursed.

388
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,646
Goddamnit.

389
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,524
Everything is trouble.

390
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,443
Where are you?

391
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,709
Why did it go in so deep?

392
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,309
All right, baby.

393
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,061
Daddy will give you new batteries.

394
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,521
Stay still.

395
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,236
Fuck. What the hell?

396
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,928
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, NAMES, AND INCIDENTS
