1
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,163
I also had a dog.

2
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,665
It was named Umul.

3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,793
It died in the Great Drought.

4
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,296
What brings you here?

5
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,385
It's not on the door. It's on the floor.

6
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,055
Sorry?

7
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,142
The sign for the data storage
at Balhae Station

8
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,186
is on the floor.

9
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,413
CAUSE OF DEATH

10
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,153
Dr. Song.

11
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,203
Yes?

12
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,916
Mr. Lee Gisu is not responding
to the radio. Are you with him?

13
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,880
He's on standby at the entrance, and I'm

14
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,507
taking a look around the surrounding area.

15
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,344
Oh, what about the biosignal?

16
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,973
I'm searching the nearby area,
but it seems like there was an error.

17
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,404
I'll be returning shortly.
Join Mr. Lee immediately.

18
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,406
Please do not

19
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,992
act independently.

20
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,036
Okay. I'll go back.

21
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,282
What?

22
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,033
It's water?

23
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,716
Team Two returning to command center.

24
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,393
Chief Gong, where are you?

25
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,896
It looks like an error on the machine.
I'm returning to the storage.

26
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,273
Where's Dr. Song?

27
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,692
She left the area,
but she's returning now.

28
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,489
We're going to Storage Three.

29
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,574
Yes, sir.

30
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,748
Gisu.

31
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,220
Damn it.

32
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,797
Gisu.

33
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,524
Gisu!

34
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,830
Dr. Song.

35
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,164
The immediate cause of his death
is a cervical spine fracture.

36
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,666
He died on the spot.

37
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,293
He has a fractured skull,
right arm, ankles…

38
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,088
His entire body is damaged.

39
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,218
Even if he fell from the ceiling,

40
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,221
he couldn't have been injured this badly.

41
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,849
It means he didn't simply die
from the fall.

42
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,227
Do you believe what Dr. Song said?

43
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,775
Well, in any case,

44
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,944
the state of his body

45
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,613
coincides with what she said.

46
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,955
Soohyuk and I will take care of the rest.
Please return to the command center.

47
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,374
Okay.

48
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,543
Don't let your guard down on the way.

49
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,628
Yes. I understand, Captain.

50
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,958
Why was the co-pilot in the storage alone?

51
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,629
Why didn't you report as you deviated?

52
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,757
Are you interrogating me?

53
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,592
Once communications are restored,

54
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:38,471
I must report back on the reasons why
I lost two crew members in under an hour.

55
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,349
So I need to know exactly what happened.

56
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,737
I was just…

57
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,949
looking around the area.

58
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,452
It's my fault for not reporting. I'm--

59
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,870
I don't need an excuse.

60
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,123
I'll know once I check your bodycam.

61
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,771
Forget the mission.

62
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,067
We'll spend all our time moving the corpses.

63
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,947
Back when I was a kid,
I'd look up to the moon and make wishes.

64
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,158
But this is one hell of an eerie place.

65
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:47,081
And what's going on with Dr. Song?
What is she trying to do?

66
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,668
At first, she made us nervous
over their cause of death,

67
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,420
then she roamed about on her own.

68
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,798
Who does she think she is
to create such trouble?

69
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,926
She wasn't trying to cause trouble.

70
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,470
She just shared her opinion
as a scientist.

71
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,807
I was talking to myself.

72
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,100
And think about it.

73
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,894
The least we can do
is work together as a whole.

74
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,772
But she nitpicks over everything
and keeps bringing us down.

75
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,857
Tell me about it.

76
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,361
Who could've known that there wouldn't be
any intact samples left in the storages?

77
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,574
Our captain isn't the type
who'd give up like this.

78
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,660
We'll end up searching
through the entire station.

79
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,833
SONG JIAN

80
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,094
Gisu.

81
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,183
Did you see that?

82
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,560
He was dragged in by something.

83
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,364
Gisu!

84
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,035
Wait, right here. Now.

85
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,914
Isn't that a sample?

86
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,666
The capsule is intact.

87
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,671
It looks like it was kept
in some kind of solution.

88
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,424
Wait.

89
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,616
This is Balhae Station. Control, respond.

90
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,826
This is Balhae Station.

91
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,208
Our comms got smashed,
and the station's won't work.

92
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,668
What now? What do we do?

93
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,672
I don't think there's a problem
with the internal system.

94
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,925
There might be a problem
with the radio tower outside.

95
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,427
They would still send
a rescue ship, right?

96
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,804
Of course they will.

97
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,099
I'm sure they're trying
to come up with a measure.

98
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,643
Goodness.

99
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,568
Look at that punk. He's asleep.

100
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,904
Soochan.

101
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,990
Are you asleep?

102
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,826
Man, I can't believe you can…

103
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,744
Hey.

104
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,205
What's wrong with you?

105
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,584
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

106
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,711
Are you sick? Hey.

107
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,071
What could it be?

108
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,781
It didn't seem human, sir.

109
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,661
But it took the sample.

110
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,707
If that creature was
aware of the sample's value,

111
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,543
it's most likely human.

112
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:29,428
Then it could be an intruder,
like that dead mercenary at the gate.

113
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,847
We'll catch it and find out.

114
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,645
It's curved at the end.

115
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,742
The passage seems to continue.
Should we go after it right away?

116
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,369
It couldn't have gone far.

117
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,538
Captain, where are you?

118
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,166
It's Soochan. Soochan just collapsed!

119
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:24,900
What now?

120
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,946
Doc Hong, where are you?

121
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,740
I'm almost there!

122
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,617
Do not come into contact with him!

123
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,285
Put on hazmat suits and wait!

124
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,767
What's taking her so long?

125
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,020
Don't worry, Soochan. She'll be here soon.

126
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,648
-Get out! Get out of here, all of you!
-Doc Hong.

127
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,317
-Stay outside. Get out.
-What's happening?

128
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,069
-Let's go.
-Damn it.

129
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,665
What's happening to him?

130
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,083
-Captain.
-What happened?

131
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:05,853
Soochan.

132
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:08,856
Soochan.

133
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,316
Soochan, hang in there.

134
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,368
-You can't go in.
-No, let go.

135
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,621
One second. Will you let me go?

136
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,959
Soochan! Hang in there.

137
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,254
Gong Soochan. Hang in there.

138
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,339
Soochan, hang in there.

139
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,346
Please hang in there.

140
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,519
Hang in there.

141
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,861
Soochan, stay with me.

142
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,446
Gong Soochan!

143
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,707
Gong Soochan!

144
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,959
Stay with me, Soochan!

145
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,391
Gong Soochan!

146
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,563
Doc Hong.

147
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,689
Doc Hong.

148
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,483
What's going on?

149
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,735
Soochan.

150
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,740
Wake up, Soochan.

151
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,618
Soochan!

152
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,495
Wake up, Soochan!

153
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,764
Air purification system activated.

154
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:27,869
Doc Hong.

155
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,581
Have you seen anything like this?

156
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,293
I've never seen anything like this before.

157
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,504
At this point…

158
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,800
we have to keep him quarantined

159
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,971
until we find the exact cause of death.
It's too dangerous for the others.

160
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,766
We should move him
to the main lab infirmary,

161
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,728
and I'll have to do an autopsy right away.

162
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,984
Should I talk to Chief Gong?

163
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,778
I'll talk to him.

164
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,495
Air purification complete.

165
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,522
I'm sorry.

166
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,863
We have to do an autopsy
to find out the exact cause…

167
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,096
Dr. Hong.

168
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,306
Yes?

169
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,144
If there's a way to find out everything
that happened here, what would you do?

170
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,689
What do you mean?

171
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,276
There's a data storage…

172
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,905
somewhere in this station.

173
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,413
How long will it take?

174
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,833
The autopsy itself
will take one to two hours.

175
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,045
But it'll take me quite a while
to find the exact cause of death.

176
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:46,091
I'd like to inspect
the medical records and the other bodies.

177
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,926
And?

178
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,137
Do you need anything else?

179
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,682
No, I just need your permission
to conduct an investigation.

180
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,725
I thought you didn't need my permission.

181
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,228
You've been doing as you like.

182
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,400
Don't you get it by now?

183
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,988
How can we get answers
if we don't ask any questions?

184
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,258
I know this is tough.

185
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,802
But our mission stands the same

186
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,054
until we reconnect with Earth.

187
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,183
Captain… can we call it quits?

188
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,645
We don't know why he died
or what killed him.

189
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,359
The intruder got away
through ventilation shaft INP-07.

190
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,070
It passes through
all key facilities of this station.

191
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,825
Soohyuk and E2,
you'll search the shaft with me.

192
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,995
Taesuk and Sun,
get us reconnected at any cost.

193
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:01,249
We'll either call for backup
or halt the operation after that.

194
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,959
Yes, Captain.

195
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,767
It has to be tough on the captain too.

196
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,562
But for now,

197
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,857
we have no other choice
but to do our jobs.

198
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,104
I have to take a look at the mainboard.

199
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,689
Comms are still down.

200
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,489
Is that made from a real meteorite?

201
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,160
They look like rocks, right?

202
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,037
But these are real.

203
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,083
It's like a superstition.

204
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,794
Meteorites fall on Earth,

205
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,630
but they're fine.

206
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,051
So we wear this to bid for our survival
no matter where we crash-land.

207
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,970
It's a form of prayer
to the deity of the universe.

208
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,892
I got this with Soochan,

209
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,144
but only I survived.

210
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,854
Why couldn't we both live?

211
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,607
Why would you believe such a thing?

212
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,860
-What?
-Think about it.

213
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,365
If you die, you die.
If you live, you live.

214
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,408
There's no such thing as a deity.

215
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,873
The machine room is the closest.

216
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,209
The west wing of the dorm
is down the hall.

217
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,837
I'll take the lead.
E2, you watch our backs.

218
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,922
Yes, sir.

219
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,208
There are logs up until
right before the accident,

220
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,335
but I don't see any particular leads.

221
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,213
In that case,

222
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,883
don't you think they really died
of a radiation leak?

223
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,442
SONG WONKYUNG, LEVEL 1

224
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,404
SONG WONKYUNG, LEVEL 1

225
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,495
Oh, I can't watch this.

226
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,875
Have you found anything?

227
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,296
Some files are locked.

228
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,381
I see.

229
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,301
You probably can't look up
the records of the higher-ups.

230
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,427
I guess not.

231
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,935
Showing the same symptoms,
all on the same day…

232
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,980
It progresses rapidly

233
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,149
and has high fatality.

234
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,951
We need to secure tissue samples
from other bodies as much as we can.

235
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:51,080
And I'll trace back to when
Soochan's symptoms broke out.

236
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,501
You're going to check the bodies?

237
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,339
I can go alone.
You can stay here with Dr. Hong.

238
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,804
No, you cannot move independently.

239
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,013
I'll come with you.

240
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,817
Would it be okay
if we left you alone for a moment?

241
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,401
Sure.

242
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,611
I'll see you later.

243
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,876
Captain.

244
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,226
Captain.

245
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,854
A biosignal is approaching us
from the front.

246
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,860
Are you sure?

247
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,363
Yes, it's right ahead of us.

248
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,289
It just passed by.

249
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,758
It's moving back forward!

250
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,845
Left. To the left, sir.

251
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,905
He didn't look well.

252
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,573
He was sweating profusely

253
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,575
and he kept falling behind.

254
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,745
He'd space out and stare at the wall.

255
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,499
Come to think of it, it was a bit odd.

256
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,126
Wait.

257
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,421
I think I came in contact with him too.

258
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,925
This isn't contagious or anything, is it?

259
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,261
Dr. Song, I need you here for a second.

260
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,516
Why? I'm still collecting samples.

261
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,519
-It won't take long.
-I'll be there right away.

262
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,398
I don't need you.
I just need Dr. Song here for a moment.

263
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,400
You can stay and collect samples.

264
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,069
Well, I don't have much to do here, so--

265
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,278
I'll be back soon.

266
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:10,947
Dr. Song.

267
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,828
Make it quick!

268
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,683
Dr. Song.

269
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,106
What was it about this time?

270
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,607
It's nothing.

271
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,067
Let's go.

272
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,446
Anyway, Dr. Song.
This really isn't contagious, right?

273
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,448
I suddenly feel itchy all over.

274
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,834
What's in here?

275
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,878
There are no indicators
for Level One facilities.

276
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,423
It's located right next
to the machine room.

277
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:38,845
Captain.

278
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,889
Are comms back up?

279
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,561
I found a way to fix it,
but things don't look too good.

280
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,313
Okay.

281
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,608
Let's head back to the command center.

282
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,985
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

283
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,534
I'm sure everyone here

284
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,954
came down with some kind of sickness.

285
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,916
How else would they have
ended up like this overnight?

286
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,267
Thank you, Dr. Hong.

287
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,772
I figured we should look
into as many things as we can.

288
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:20,154
Anyway, the result came out as I expected.

289
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,741
I found mucus foam
around the airway and bronchial tubes.

290
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,995
And there were signs of water
seeping through his internal organs.

291
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,248
That means his body was filled with water.

292
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,207
Then,

293
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,501
he did drown to death.

294
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,461
Yes.

295
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,047
There's no sign of external damage.

296
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,884
That means the water rose up
from the inside,

297
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:46,013
and it happened so quickly
that his bronchial tubes are swollen.

298
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,475
Other bodies shared similar symptoms.

299
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,646
I've never seen anything like this.

300
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,317
Where did that much water come from?
Have you ever seen anything like this?

301
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,089
There's nothing.

302
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,135
What's not there?

303
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,387
Nothing is out of the ordinary.

304
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,933
There are no infectious particles
such as viruses or bacteria,

305
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,477
or toxins related to organ damage.

306
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,522
The crew members were all in good health.

307
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,994
Look at this.

308
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,496
This is Soochan's blood.

309
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,751
There's another layer.

310
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,837
In the blood? What is this?

311
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,720
There's a problem with the digital unit
connected to the communications tower.

312
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,640
We need someone outside
to switch the equipment

313
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,768
while another edits the protocol inside.

314
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,102
Then we reboot the system.

315
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,063
But I'm the only engineer here,

316
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,273
so I can't cover both ends at once.

317
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,361
Is this the digital unit?

318
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,446
Yes. But there's a problem.

319
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,824
While the station was up,
you could just use the elevator

320
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,536
to the common wing of the building,
but it's currently out of order.

321
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,915
The station was neglected
for five years after the accident,

322
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,625
so there seem to be some problems.

323
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,003
The only way to get there
is to go out to the gate,

324
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,673
grab the elevator rail outside,
then climb down. But that's--

325
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,009
We can set up an anchor and get down.

326
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,888
It won't be hard.

327
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:51,972
No, you can't.

328
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,266
It's better to wait
until the rescue ship comes.

329
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,185
-It's way too dangerous.
-I'll do it.

330
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,191
Tell me what I need to do
when I get there.

331
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,776
Will you be all right?

332
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,197
I have to reach Director Choi
as soon as I can.

333
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,519
Did you find the cause?

334
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,689
We're analyzing the substance
we found in Soochan's blood.

335
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,775
Once comms are up,

336
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,237
I'll make a request to Director Choi
for a reinvestigation of the accident.

337
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,074
Only if we can find samples
and have enough time.

338
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,995
And to do that, it's important
to find out why Soochan died.

339
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,830
Understood.

340
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,124
Captain.

341
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,376
Are you really going out there?

342
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,253
Yes.

343
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:09,967
Wait.

344
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,183
There's something that concerns me.

345
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,270
It's the intruder.

346
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,356
It didn't try to hurt me.

347
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,234
How can you be sure of that?

348
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,403
There's something called
critical distance.

349
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,240
When animals find intruders
in their territory,

350
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,825
they watch them first.

351
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,787
Then they attack the intruder
when they come within a certain distance.

352
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,583
That's why it's very important
to keep an appropriate distance.

353
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,920
On top of that,
it moves by using the shafts,

354
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,048
and it always manages to escape
because it's always a step ahead.

355
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,133
It seems like it's familiar

356
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,427
with the internal structure.

357
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,846
Do you think it could be a survivor?

358
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,145
The government would have known
if there had been a survivor.

359
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,524
Above all, it has been over five years.

360
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,526
How could there be a survivor?

361
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,528
It's not completely impossible.

362
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,031
The radiation level in here
turned out to be normal,

363
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,034
so if they rationed food and water,

364
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,328
there could well be a survivor.

365
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,289
Then why haven't they
informed us to this day?

366
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,293
And if it wasn't an intruder,
there's no reason to steal the sample.

367
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,920
If it really was a survivor,

368
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,507
they should be welcoming us
instead of attacking.
