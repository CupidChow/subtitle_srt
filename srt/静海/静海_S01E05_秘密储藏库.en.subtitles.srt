What could this be for?

11
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,921
We'll find out once we get down there.

12
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,506
E1 and I will climb down first to check.

13
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,637
Stay here.
Contact us if something happens.

14
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,721
Yes, sir.

15
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,695
What is this?

16
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,072
How can there be so many plants here?

17
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,253
There's a storage room here.

18
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,304
Why are there so many plants here?

19
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,142
Are you sure it's okay for us
to just walk in like this?

20
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,561
This storage wasn't on the map.

21
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,364
Look at these stems.
How does this make any sense?

22
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,783
Tell me about it.

23
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,953
You don't see anything
this large back on Earth.

24
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,000
How did they grow all this?

25
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,506
Man, this place is amazing.

26
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,345
It looks like there are multiple storages.

27
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,199
Wow, isn't the mission a success
if we retrieved just one?

28
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,117
Look at how many there are.

29
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,707
They're all green.

30
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,212
That means they're all
in good condition, right?

31
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,804
They hid them all down here?

32
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,353
It seems like the system

33
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,439
for this facility
is separate from where we were.

34
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,191
What is this?

35
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,861
A lunar water capsule broke.

36
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,534
How can all these plants grow
with this little water? It makes no sense.

37
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,661
You're right. If we use this,

38
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,705
we'll never have to worry
about water again.

39
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,542
Only if we can keep it under control.

40
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,879
-Begin the retrieval.
-Yes, Captain.

41
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,923
-Chief Gong, search the premises.
-Yes, sir.

42
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,758
E1, Sun.

43
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,676
Yes, sir.

44
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,391
How many capsules is this?

45
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,150
Hurry. It's been neglected,
so we don't know what state it's in.

46
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,277
Yes, Captain.

47
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,409
Chief Gong, how does
the other storage look?

48
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,910
The situation is similar.

49
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,579
Most of the samples are fine.

50
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,539
These samples are full too.

51
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,376
We'll have to use a rover to carry these.

52
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,670
Let's go home already, please.

53
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,589
-What's that?
-What?

54
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,007
Hold on.

55
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,655
What is this?

56
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,742
What's wrong? What's going on?

57
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,910
Get it!

58
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,370
Look out, E1!

59
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,999
Wait here.

60
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,650
Are you all right?

61
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,984
I'm fine, sir.

62
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,673
E1.

63
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,802
Get back inside!

64
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,355
Watch out!

65
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,361
It's headed your way, E2!

66
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,538
Captain.

67
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,380
We have to get out of here. Now!

68
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,465
Evacuate, now!

69
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,342
Samples. I'll grab the samples.

70
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,386
I will. I'll grab them.
You should go first.

71
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,013
What about E1?

72
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,723
-We have to get out now.
-Let's go.

73
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,974
-Come on.
-No, wait.

74
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:29,975
Let's go!

75
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,530
Warning. Thermoregulator anomaly detected.

76
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,200
Warning. Thermoregulator anomaly detected.

77
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,998

78
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,792
Warning.

79
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,211
-Thermoregulator anomaly detected.
-Get over here!

80
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,028
I need help!

81
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,488
E2.

82
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,866
-E2!
-We have a man down here!

83
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,286
-We need to get him to the infirmary.
-What?

84
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,288
Give me a hand. Lift him.

85
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,180
There's blood in his lungs and pleurae.

86
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,850
His heart rate is at 146,
and his BP is 75 over 43.

87
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,060
I need to open him up. Sterilized gauze.

88
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,986
Scalpel.

89
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,963
His BP is way too low.

90
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,050
Can you grab all type B blood bags
in the medical kit?

91
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,724
We have two.

92
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,769
That's not enough. Can you ask the others?

93
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,064
We need more type B blood.

94
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,650
I'm type O. You can draw my blood.

95
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,454
Do you feel dizzy?

96
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,789
No, I'm fine.

97
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,708
Let me know right away
if you feel dizzy or unusual.

98
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,709
Okay.

99
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,727
She ripped off his arm.

100
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,648
Then she crawled all over the ceiling.
What is this…

101
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,861
First, some water killed people,
and then a monster shows up too.

102
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,447
Could she be the one who killed Lee Gisu?

103
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,365
Yes.

104
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,366
I think so.

105
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,120
Why is she following us around?

106
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,914
-To kill us all?
-I think it's because of the lunar water.

107
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,251
What?

108
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,753
I think that's why she killed Gisu,

109
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,672
and attacked us.

110
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,342
She keeps showing up
where the lunar water is.

111
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,013
She's after the same thing as us.

112
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,308
Is it really possible
that she's a survivor?

113
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,435
A survivor?

114
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:04,023
How can she be a survivor?
A kid can't live here for five years.

115
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,066
She was a kid, right? Wasn't she?

116
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,776
She was. She seemed like a child

117
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,321
who wanted to keep what's hers,
who didn't want us to take it away.

118
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,282
It may sound odd…

119
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,911
but that was the behavior of a child.

120
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,873
Are you saying we're the intruders?

121
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,856
Like with Gisu,

122
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,068
she may be using only
ventilation shafts to get around.

123
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,653
You can get anywhere you like

124
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,364
by using shaft INP-07. You're right.

125
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,533
We're connected to the SAA.

126
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,951
RECEIVING SIGNAL

127
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,745
Did you find the intruder?

128
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,289
The intruder's whereabouts
are still unknown.

129
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,961
What about the samples?

130
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,639
We may lose more lives at this rate.
Do we have to continue?

131
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,807
As I mentioned before,

132
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,560
this operation will be a failure
if anybody else gets the lunar water.

133
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,773
I don't care if you kill the intruder.
You must catch them.

134
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,486
Also, make sure you retrieve
the lunar water that was taken.

135
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,821
It was a kid.

136
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,572
What?

137
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,534
The intruder seemed like a little kid.

138
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,203
The kid was wearing a lab coat too.

139
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,788
So what?

140
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,791
Is there a possibility
that this kid's a survivor?

141
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:54,675
Stop trying to make things
more complicated than they should be.

142
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,010
That's not what's important.

143
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,720
Why does the kid's identity matter?

144
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,014
That won't change your mission.

145
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:05,811
I…

146
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,230
sometimes

147
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,400
dream of standing in the rain.

148
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,779
When I wake up from that wonderful dream,

149
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,283
it's painful beyond words to wake up

150
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,452
to this horrendous and sad reality.

151
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,829
We must

152
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,040
make sure it rains,

153
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,209
once again,

154
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,173
over this land, so that water
may flow abundantly on Earth.

155
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:39,428
We must recreate that world again.

156
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,932
I'll send you backup very soon.

157
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,727
Hold out just a little longer.

158
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,989
PHOTOS

159
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,624
Is it because of Director Choi?

160
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,877
Why can't I go back into the data storage?

161
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,587
It's too dangerous to go back.

162
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,049
We don't know what happened
to the lunar water after it leaked.

163
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,759
I finally found it.

164
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,511
I can't give up like this.

165
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,096
It's dangerous, and that's it.

166
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,230
I can't condone more deaths.

167
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,359
There were 117 crew members
here at Balhae Station.

168
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,277
None of them survived.

169
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,613
If we take the lunar water back now,

170
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,449
we may end up sacrificing more.

171
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,578
It doesn't matter what you find out.

172
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,413
The lunar water will be taken back

173
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,415
with that kid.

174
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,336
Then that's all the more reason
to get to the data in the data storage.

175
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,547
Now that we know the danger
that lies in the lunar water,

176
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,716
we need to investigate as much as we can.

177
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,179
I don't care if you don't trust me.

178
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,848
I'm not doing this
for personal reasons only.

179
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,396
Captain, we're ready to make a search.

180
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,900
Okay. I'll be there.

181
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,529
I know you'll go even if I say no.

182
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,782
Go with Doc Hong. You can't go alone.

183
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,662
If you find anything on the lunar water
or that child, report back right away.

184
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,039
Okay.

185
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,718
I'm at Storage Three.

186
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,512
We're still on our way
to the facility hallway.

187
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,640
-Get into the shaft there and take a look.
-Yes, sir.

188
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,851
I'll start searching here and move there.

189
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,060
Yes, sir.

190
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,815
It'll take a while.

191
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,569
If it ends before we get back,
call for me. I'll come for you.

192
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,779
Okay, Doc.

193
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,697
Are you sure

194
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,491
you two will be okay?

195
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,201
What's the worst that could happen?

196
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,330
Why? Anything to say?

197
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,040
Do you think

198
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,668
the lunar water research data is in there?

199
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,089
I hope so.

200
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,465
I really do.

201
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,926
I'll be back.

202
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:06,843
Okay.

203
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,189
Damn, that thing is here again.

204
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,733
Those eyes keep popping up.

205
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,029
She must like to draw.

206
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,825
Captain, we've arrived
at the shaft of the facility hallway.

207
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,413
The cover is still intact.
I don't think she escaped through here.

208
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,166
Chief.

209
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,988
Damn it!

210
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,053
It looks fine, right?

211
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,680
Yes.

212
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,557
Let's go.

213
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,785
DATA BRICK SEARCH

214
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,417
SEARCHING DATA BRICK

215
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,892
SEARCHING DATA BRICK

216
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,395
What was Dr. Song Wonkyung like?

217
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,158
I had no idea she had been working here.

218
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,913
I only found out after the accident
at Balhae Station was made known.

219
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,752
I thought you two were
by yourselves without parents.

220
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,672
How could she keep you in the dark?

221
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,509
Back then, something else
was more important to her than me.

222
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,557
There was this one time

223
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,894
when she contacted me first.

224
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,940
It was right before the accident.

225
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,400
SONG WONKYUNG

226
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,410
If I had

227
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,748
picked up her call…

228
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,672
would it have changed anything?

229
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,975
Captain, we're inside
the facility hallway.

230
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,065
This area is not on the map,

231
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,817
but it looks like…

232
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,322
this leads to the dorms.

233
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,829
We'll expand our search
and check the dorms too.

234
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,039
Okay. Be careful.

235
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,795
I'm sick of this.

236
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,325
It worked. It's open.

237
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,746
SEARCHING DATA BRICK

238
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,372
DATA BRICK SEARCH COMPLETE

239
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,290
What?

240
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,334
This is impossible.

241
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,252
There's nothing in here.

242
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,088
Wait, did someone erase everything?

243
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,758
DATA BRICK SEARCH COMPLETE

244
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,636
It looks like
the data was erased on purpose.

245
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,534
Damn it.

246
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:28,952
Captain.

247
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,996
Why are you two here?

248
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,915
What about searching the dorms?

249
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,750
I see why people can die

250
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,086
when they're too shocked.

251
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,256
This doesn't seem right.

252
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,927
It looked like this hallway
would lead us into the dorms.

253
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,972
It feels like we've been
circling the same area.

254
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,390
Exactly.

255
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,767
It's like playing tag.

256
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,479
She knows exactly where we are
and always manages to avoid us.

257
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,190
She knows her way around here
much better than we do.

258
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,534
Who could have deleted this?

259
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,160
Why? For what reason?

260
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,988
I told you to call me.

261
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,035
No, I'm fine.
What happened to the research data?

262
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,661
Why did you take them out?

263
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,665
Aren't you supposed to join the search?

264
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,667
Oh, you haven't heard.

265
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,545
We decided to stop the search
and meet at the command center.

266
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:06,215
There could be a safety issue
if we leave these here.

267
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,844
So I'll move the samples
back to the command center.

268
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,054
Why?

269
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,057
Was it Captain Han's order?

270
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,852
You said

271
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,898
that monster seems to be
after the lunar water like we are.

272
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,442
Don't worry.

273
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:28,112
We're only being careful,
just in case anything happens.

274
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,448
No.

275
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,826
I make the decisions
when it comes to the samples.

276
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,913
We'll keep the lunar water
and the kit here.

277
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,628
All right, then.

278
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,423
Let me know right away
if anything happens.

279
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,810
Did we miss a passage
on the holographic map?

280
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,480
I'm sorry. I'll check once again
when we get to the command center.

281
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,440
But that girl…

282
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,109
That monster?

283
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,570
What do we call her? Whatever.
But why is she so important?

284
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,948
We should head home
now that we found the sample.

285
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,441
Captain.

286
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,776
Captain, she's here.

287
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,695
What do you mean?

288
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,697
Doc Hong, respond.

289
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,621
Captain.

290
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,560
Wait!

291
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,378
Dr. Song, step back.

292
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,255
One second.

293
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,549
Don't get near me. Give me a second.

294
