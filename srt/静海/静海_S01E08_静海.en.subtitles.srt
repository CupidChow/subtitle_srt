1
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,931
Activating gate closure.

2
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:19,644
All members,
evacuate to a safe zone immediately.

3
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,438
We have to get out of here!

4
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,690
-Activating gate closure.
-What's happening?

5
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,733
Hurry!

6
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,777
-Come on!
-What's going on?

7
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,742
We have to go!

8
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,621
Warning. Thermoregulator anomaly detected.

9
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,376
Warning. Thermoregulator anomaly detected.

10
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,813
All members,
evacuate to a safe zone immediately.

11
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,442
Activating gate closure.

12
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,821
All members,
evacuate to a safe zone immediately.

13
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,283
Activating gate closure.

14
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,881
Hey! Open the damn gate!

15
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,806
Why are you doing this?

16
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,307
Who's in charge?

17
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,352
Close the gate.

18
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,353
Please help us!

19
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,354
Close the gate!

20
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,000
Did you want to see me?

21
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,587
Is there a chance that any
of the crew members at Balhae Station

22
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,466
will survive?

23
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,135
Sorry?

24
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,347
Never mind.

25
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,018
Let me know as soon as you have an update.

26
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,770
Yes, ma'am.

27
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,536
THE SILENT SEA

28
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,613
So she really doesn't die even if
she comes in contact with lunar water?

29
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,366
It looks like it.

30
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,994
The lunar water has
similar characteristics to viruses.

31
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,955
Viruses continuously evolve
as they come in contact with humans.

32
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:54,544
It seems like there was a change
after it came in contact with her,

33
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,964
contact with something
unknown in her body.

34
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,549
Researchers at Balhae Station

35
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,137
chose to study
genetic recombination or cell fusion

36
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,181
to make humans adapt to the lunar water.

37
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,311
And Luna must be an organism created

38
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,646
during the process.

39
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,152
Human experimentation using clones

40
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,863
is a criminal activity.

41
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,035
So the station was shut down
five years ago

42
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,078
because the government was more focused on

43
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,123
hiding what happened here
rather than retrieving the lunar water.

44
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,834
If it had gotten out,
it would've made a mess.

45
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,921
It's considered a serious act of treason
to disclose state secrets

46
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,548
you come to know during a mission.

47
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,929
Even if we say we won't speak of this,

48
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,557
do you think
the higher-ups will believe us?

49
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,186
We'll be under surveillance
for the rest of our lives,

50
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,189
or even end up dead
like the crew members here!

51
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,483
That's why Director Choi chose me.

52
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:05,448
She probably thought
I wouldn't be able to disclose

53
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,745
the atrocities my sister committed
as the chief researcher here.

54
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,464
What happened to Ryu Taesuk?

55
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,970
We have to get out of here.
Something doesn't seem right.

56
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,889
What do you mean?

57
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,100
A shaft blew up
while I was engaged with him,

58
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,894
and it was filled with water.

59
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,867
Dr. Song.

60
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,422
What's wrong?

61
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,927
Dr. Song!

62
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,193
What's wrong?

63
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,278
Dr. Song.

64
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,155
Open the door.

65
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,197
Open it.

66
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,660
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,414
Are you sick?

68
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,040
Dr. Song!

69
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,917
Wait, I…

70
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,544
Dr. Song!

71
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,922
What's the problem? Open up!

72
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,800
Open the door, Dr. Song!

73
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,773
Jian.

74
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,778
I thought it was something I had to do

75
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:54,033
for the sake of everyone's future.

76
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,690
Excuse me. Over here. Hey…

77
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,318
Close the gate.

78
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,611
Excuse me!

79
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,871
We have to get out of here!

80
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,333
-Where are you going?
-Help us!

81
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,878
Help!

82
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,965
What's happening?

83
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:21,912
Jian.

84
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,711
I wanted to show you the sea.

85
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,509
Jian.

86
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,831
-Are you okay?
-What happened?

87
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,294
You were infected with the lunar water,

88
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,797
but your symptoms are getting better.

89
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,681
I think

90
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,894
her mutated genes

91
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,647
act as a sort of antibody.

92
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,109
It suppresses the multiplication
of the lunar water in your body.

93
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,444
Or you might have just been lucky.

94
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,655
I'll have to keep my eyes on you.

95
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:44,036
I think she might be able to save us all.

96
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,420
Luna.

97
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,797
What?

98
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,717
That's her name.

99
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,969
Luna.

100
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,387
The co-pilot and Lieutenant Ryu

101
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,431
were both working with RX.

102
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,558
Let's go to Gate Seven.

103
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,020
Shouldn't we wait
until our backup arrives?

104
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,021
We have no time.

105
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,359
I need to get in touch with Mr. Kim.

106
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,869
The backup from SAA
has entered the landing orbit.

107
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,662
Just as you mentioned,

108
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:13,000
we spotted another spacecraft
also entering orbit around the same time.

109
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,421
It's probably a small transport starship
often used by RX mercenaries.

110
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,009
We need more time
to retrieve the capsules.

111
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,304
We'll have no way of saving them
once RX mercenaries arrive.

112
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,808
Please give us a hand
in delaying their spacecraft from landing.

113
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,269
Yes, I…

114
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,439
-Yes, I understand.
-What will happen to Luna?

115
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,736
What will happen to her
after she's brought to Earth?

116
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,074
Lunar water and Subject 073
do not officially exist in this world.

117
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,286
She'll be sent to a grade one facility
at the Ministry of National Defense.

118
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,412
And our government

119
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,917
will continue with
the experiments conducted there.

120
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,210
That's too dangerous.

121
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,129
The lunar water is still very unstable.

122
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,799
It can put the entire Earth in danger.

123
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,218
And if she's sent there,

124
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:08,347
Luna will only be used
as a tool to study the lunar water.

125
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,189
What about my request?

126
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,573
Unfortunately,

127
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,909
Director Choi holds
a strong political position,

128
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,787
so everyone is hesitant to step up.

129
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,457
What is he talking about?

130
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,126
Captain Han asked me to contact

131
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,921
a higher official who can keep
Director Choi under control.

132
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,509
The lunar water and Subject 073
cannot be monopolized by anybody.

133
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,428
Captain Han and I agreed upon that.

134
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,723
Thankfully, more people in the SAA

135
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,601
are starting to see the problem in this.

136
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,270
I will come up with a measure

137
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,439
before you return to Earth.

138
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,112
The International Institute
of Space Biology.

139
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,532
We cannot return to Earth.

140
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,327
The IISB.

141
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,663
We should be safe there.

142
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,211
This must be studied in a neutral area

143
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,340
to stop anybody
from monopolizing the lunar water.

144
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,845
I'll take Luna there myself.

145
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,726
First, we'll take
the capsules from Ryu Taesuk

146
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,354
and lead the rescue ship to Gate Seven.

147
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,818
Stay away, you freaking bastard.

148
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,912
People have to know why Soochan died.

149
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,095
It's a location tracker.

150
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,013
Just in case.

151
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,774
You should give it to her yourself.

152
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,554
If you press this,

153
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,806
I'll fly over to save you.

154
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,433
Wow.

155
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,521
That means I can always
come home thanks to you.

156
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:09,857
That's right.

157
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,901
Can I come with you?

158
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,698
I want to see the Moon too.

159
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,079
Once I get back,
I'll never go away again. I promise.

160
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,291
Liar.

161
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,168
I'm not lying.

162
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,629
Once I get back,
I'm going to teach you how to swim.

163
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,756
Swim?

164
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,927
It's a way to move
freely underwater, like fish.

165
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,306
But fish are all dead.

166
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,637
She's not wary of you anymore.

167
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,891
Everything is ready.

168
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,392
We can leave now.

169
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,151
If she goes to Earth,

170
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,153
she'll die in a lab.

171
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,073
People won't give up on the lunar water.

172
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,117
Her fate won't be any different
no matter where she goes.

173
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,286
Luna is coming to Earth with us.

174
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,288
You're calling her Luna now.

175
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,210
Just as you said, we're desperate,

176
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,170
and we end up making the wrong decisions.

177
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,839
And those decisions
always come with a price.

178
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,841
We cannot repeat the same mistake.

179
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,014
The only choice I can make right now

180
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,392
is to complete this mission
for my daughter's sake.

181
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,395
Hey.

182
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,314
What's wrong?

183
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,361
What are you doing?

184
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,452
What's she doing?

185
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,317
Luna, what's wrong?

186
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,118
Luna.

187
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,044
I think she wants us to follow her.

188
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:21,381
Call her back here.
This is the fastest route to Gate Seven.

189
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:24,926
Let's follow her.

190
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,220
Let's follow Luna.

191
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,389
I'm sure there is
a reason for her behavior.

192
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,495
Water. Run!

193
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,787
Let's go.

194
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,463
Luna!

195
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,549
-This way.
-Hurry!

196
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,284
What's wrong?

197
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,906
Ryu Taesuk.

198
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,410
You've been infected.

199
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,162
It's over.

200
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,123
I keep seeing their faces.

201
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,252
-What?
-I didn't want to do it.

202
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,838
I really didn't want to.

203
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,305
-Taesuk, don't--
-Stay away from me!

204
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,190
You knew everything, didn't you?

205
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,943
You knew what we did.

206
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,739
Why did you pretend not to know?

207
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,285
Why did you pretend not to know?
Why did you do that?

208
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,078
Why?

209
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,751
Lieutenant Ryu, why are you doing this?

210
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,171
We don't deserve the lunar water.

211
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,595
I'm sorry, Dr. Song.

212
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,683
I'm sorry, Dr. Song. I'm sorry.

213
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,146
I'm sorry, Dr. Song.

214
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,775
We have to get out of here now!

215
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,031
Your rescue ship isn't coming.

216
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,745
-Let's get this over with.
-Yes, sir.

217
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,539
-Please help us.
-What's going on?

218
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,458
-Help us.
-Put down your weapons. Please.

219
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,466
Ryu Taesuk, what are you doing?
Close the gate.

220
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,093
Ryu Taesuk!

221
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,347
Close the gate!

222
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,598
Ryu Taesuk!

223
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,789
We didn't save anybody.

224
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,836
It wasn't part of the plan to begin with.

225
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,730
Lieutenant Ryu.

226
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,401
Doc Hong, shut the door!

227
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,505
Chief Gong.

228
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,429
There's no time.
I don't think I can hold out for long.

229
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,602
Are you okay?

230
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,153
Ryu Taesuk.

231
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,553
Luna!

232
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,880
Captain, we must get to the airlock now.

233
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,433
Chief Gong.

234
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,601
Stay with me.

235
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,152
Stay with me, Chief Gong.

236
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,198
Don't fall asleep.

237
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,625
You can't fall asleep.

238
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,668
Stay with me.

239
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,600
You're all good now. Let's go.

240
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,521
Chief Gong.

241
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,473
Get ready to go.

242
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,563
PRESS ENTER
TO BEGIN AIRLOCK DEPRESSURIZATION

243
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,334
Where are you?

244
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,003
What are you doing?

245
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,671
You should go first.

246
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,090
No.

247
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,258
No.

248
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,384
No, we can't.

249
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,303
You said we'd go back together!

250
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,388
No, wait. Open this.

251
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,891
Hold on! Stop this thing!

252
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,270
You said you'd complete
this mission for your daughter!

253
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,231
No, you…

254
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,028
Captain! You can't stay here!

255
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,456
Wherever Luna goes…

256
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,211
please be there with her.

257
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,379
No…

258
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,299
Don't do this.

259
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,343
Luna.

260
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,346
We have to go.

261
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,816
Where are you?

262
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,584
Luna.

263
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,034
Luna.

264
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,641
She's not here.

265
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,144
I don't see her.

266
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,326
Luna.

267
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,724
Survivors have been rescued
and samples secured.

268
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,059
What condition are they in?

269
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,227
Yet to confirm.

270
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,479
Have a safe flight back.

271
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,732
Switching to autonomous navigation system.

272
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,025
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, NAMES, AND INCIDENTS

273
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,276
ARE PRODUCTS OF THE IMAGINATION
OR USED FICTITIOUSLY.

274
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,486
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REALITY
IS ENTIRELY COINCIDENTAL.

275
