Captain.

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,816
Captain, I found…

4
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,652
I found E2. E2 is…

5
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,404
E2 is dead.

6
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,906
What?

7
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,658
Say that again?

8
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,204
There's a gunshot wound on his chest.

9
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,457
I think he was murdered.

10
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,251
Where's Lieutenant Ryu?

11
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,003
I haven't

12
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,755
found him yet.

13
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,132
And the lunar water samples are gone.

14
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,718
I understand.
Head over to the command center.

15
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,595
Yes, Captain.

16
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,891

Kim Sun! Have you arrived
at the command center?

24
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,973
Yes, I just got in.

25
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,892
Find Ryu Taesuk
and Dr. Song's location immediately.

26
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,645
Yes, sir. I'll check on them right away.

27
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,355
Okay.

28
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,650
Fuck. Why is everyone dying?

29
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,319
Dr. Song.

Lieutenant Ryu.

Lieutenant Ryu.

35
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,394
Lieutenant Ryu.

36
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,478
Turn around.

37
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,910
Did you kill him?

38
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,745
Why are you looking for Dr. Song?

39
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,123
Why are you doing this?

40
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,669
Aw, fuck!

41
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,713
Why did you kill him?

42
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,594
Answer me.

43
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,310
Dr. Song went after that kid.

44
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,375
Kim Sun! Answer me, Kim Sun!

45
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,087
Let's split up.

46
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,630
You continue with the search.

47
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,841
I'll check on Kim Sun.

48
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,050
Captain,

49
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,429
the lunar water Dr. Song has is
the only sample we have at the moment.

50
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,599
We should focus on retrieving
the sample and finding Dr. Song.

51
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,519
If Dr. Song also lost the lunar water,
we must secure the ones in the main lab.

52
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,857
The only one who could've killed E2
and taken the lunar water

53
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,234
was Ryu Taesuk.

54
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,363
Are you certain

55
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,241
it was Lieutenant Ryu?

56
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,747
Let's find out.
Be on standby once you find Dr. Song.

57
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,624
Yes, sir.

58
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,837
If the target shows any signs of danger,

59
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,381
I will shoot her
in order to complete the mission.

60
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,261
But I will make sure
Dr. Song comes back alive.

61
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,747
You crazy bastard.

62
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,457
You shouldn't be doing this.

63
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,170
Damn it.

64
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,142
I'm alive.

65
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,520
I'm still alive.

66
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,899
We need to stay alive.

67
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,568
We can all go home alive.

68
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,736
Let's go home alive.

69
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,905
Let's just go home.

70
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,911
Did Dr. Song find out something
about that monster?

71
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,373
You're the monster here, you bastard.

72
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,749
Fuck.

73
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,877
What the heck is this anyway?

74
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,171
Is this that valuable?

75
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,009
Why would you take someone's life
over something like this, you asshole?

76
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,136
Seriously! Fuck!

77
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,515
Okay, stop it.

78
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,352
Let's all go back home alive.

79
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,855
Put that down.

80
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,150
Put it down.

81
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,359
Stop coming at me.

82
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,738
Put it down, you motherfucker.

83
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,323
You fucker!

84
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,824
Stop right there!

85
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,870
I'll pour this fucking thing all over you.

86
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,581
I'll pour this and kill you, fuck!

87
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,766
Please let me live.

88
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,315
I got this… Damn it.

89
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,656
Lieutenant Ryu, please let me live.

90
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,324
Lieutenant Ryu…

91
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,409
Help me.

92
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,302
Hey, help me…

93
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,012
Hey, man.

94
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,266
I just want to go home.

95
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,268
I just…

96
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,605
Lieutenant Ryu…

97
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,369
Lieutenant…

98
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,044
What…

99
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,379
What's this?

100
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:47,201
LUNAR WATER RESPONSE TEST

101
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,746
Luna.

102
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,106
Doc Hong, what's going on?

103
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,164
Captain.

104
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,957
I fell

105
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,210
from the ventilation shaft.

106
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,212
Where are you?

107
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,508
I…

108
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,678
I'm not sure where I am.

109
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,139
It seems like a storage room.

110
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,225
Lunar water injected.

111
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,686
I will proceed with
the first test on a human body.

112
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,075
Luna 001 shows no sign of life.

113
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,162
What have they done?

114
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,488
Luna 027, failed.

115
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,574
Luna 037, failed.

116
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,286
Luna 041, failed.

117
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,625
Luna 054 shows no sign of life.

118
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,663
Luna 073, all vital signs are stable.

119
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,541
No multiplication of lunar water detected.

120
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,003
No adverse reaction in the body cells.

121
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,561
Are you all right?

122
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:43,896
Yes.

123
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,919
The sun rises and falls once every month.

124
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,339
So it feels like I'm living
a really long day

125
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,550
where time passes by slowly.

126
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,096
It has been two years already,

127
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,891
but I'm yet to find out
what exactly the lunar water is.

128
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,185
The higher-ups

129
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,940
are making a big fuss
and urging us to test it on human bodies.

130
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,152
Figures.

131
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,696
If this succeeds,

132
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,533
it could save humanity.

133
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,495
Why?

134
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,414
Why did you do that?

135
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,989
It wasn't an easy decision.

136
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,283
I know it was very cruel to you too.

137
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,412
But I thought
it was something I had to do…

138
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,917
for the sake of everyone's future.

139
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,128
I wanted to…

140
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,757
explain everything to you one day.

141
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,512
Why did you call me here?

142
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,974
What do you want me to do?

143
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,314
Jian.

144
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,530
I wanted to show you the sea.

145
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,618
You're such a fool.

146
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,246
Jian. What…

147
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,333
What have I done?

148
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,168
Why…

149
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,338
Why didn't you just stay by my side?

150
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,510
I'm sorry I didn't pick up your call.

151
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,389
I miss you.

152
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,658

Yes?

167
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,240
We have to go.

168
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,033

Doc Hong, get to the main lab

171
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,507
Yes, sir.

172
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,174
That's Earth.

173
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,262
Do you know what Earth is?

00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,147
Ea…

175
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,193
Eart…

176
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,672
Drop your gun, Chief Gong.

177
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,132
Move aside, Dr. Song.

178
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,677
I can calm her down.

179
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,053
It's all right.

180
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,348
You've seen what she did
to our crew members. Move aside.

181
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,351
I was with her all along,
but she never attacked me.

182
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,144
She won't attack us anymore.

183
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,815
Please drop the gun.

184
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,066
Chief Gong.

185
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,903
I found Dr. Song and the target.

186
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,410
I failed to secure the capsule.

187
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,911
Ryu Taesuk is headed there.

188
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,871
Escort both to the main lab.

189
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,874
You must not kill her.
She must be brought alive.

190
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,292
Can you do as I say?

191
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,189
Luna!

192
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,649
Luna!

193
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,735
This way.

194
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,031
We have to go this way.

195
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,200
Come here.

196
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,702
Luna.

197
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,971
Let's go this way.

198
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,147
Taesuk.

199
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,776
Why are you doing this?

200
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,153
Captain.

201
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,989
You don't know anything.

202
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,580
You have no idea what happened here

203
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,082
and what the lunar water is.

204
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,118
