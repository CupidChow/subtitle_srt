1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,550
Come here and help.

2
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,427
-Are you okay?
-Warning.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,762
Internal pressure loss
detected in landing module.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,473
-Mr. Hwang, are you okay?
-Oxygen levels unstable.

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,558
Warning…

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,227
Be careful. E1, check the equipment.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,647
-Oxygen levels unstable.
-He has internal injuries, so be careful.

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,525
Can you breathe, Mr. Hwang?

9
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:29,154
Warning. Internal pressure loss
detected in landing module.

10
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,989
Oxygen levels unstable.

11
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,075
-E2, check the equipment!
-Yes, sir!

12
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,370
Oxygen levels unstable.

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,146
Captain,

14
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,857
all engines are inoperative right now.

15
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,525
What's our location?

16
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,945
We're 7.6km northwest of Balhae Station.

17
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,535
And the fire detection system?

18
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,038
I can't check on it.

19
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,624
Fuck. Nothing in here fucking works.

20
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,376
We're about to lose power too.

21
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,963
Send out a distress signal,
and get ready to leave.

22
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,675
Control, this is Lieutenant Ryu Taesuk
of Nuri 11. Do you copy?

23
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,596
Control, do you copy?

24
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,973
This is Nuri 11. Control!

25
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,810
Control, do you copy?

26
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,728
Control.

27
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,231
This is Nuri 11. Control!

28
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,441
Dr. Song.

29
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,193
Dr. Song, are you all right?

30
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,319
Yes.

31
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,781
-Doc Hong, how is he?
-One second.

32
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,493
He fractured his left ribs.

33
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,499
All I can do right now

34
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,251
is give him painkillers.

35
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,710
Check if he can move.

36
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,338
-Turn him over.
-E1, E2, check the weapons and equipment.

37
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,339
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

38
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,507
Can you move?

39
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,301
One second.

40
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,681
Communications are still down.

41
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,100
The system is shutting down.

42
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,275
The water is leaking.

43
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,564
BALHAE LUNAR RESEARCH STATION

44
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,460
According to
the National Institute of Statistics,

45
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,673
infant mortality rate hit
an all-time high this year.

46
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,759
Among the main causes mentioned are
various infections and diseases

47
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,762
caused by the consumption
of contaminated water.

48
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,058
Governmental and private enterprises
are vigorously making investments

49
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,103
in mega vertical farms,
which can drastically reduce water usage.

50
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,649
In the midst of this global food shortage
caused by water shortage,

51
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,776
many anticipate the possibility

52
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,322
of mega vertical farming
becoming the solution for this problem.

53
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,575
Illegal pet-keeping is becoming
more and more serious by the day.

54
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,202
The government is offering a fine waiver

55
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,414
and euthanasia support
during this amnesty period,

56
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,875
but only a small minority
has utilized this program.

57
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:38,463
Meanwhile, the Fair Water Distribution Act
was rejected yet again in the Assembly.

58
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,591
The demand for the abolition
of the water supply regulation grows

59
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,718
as the inequalities
in access to water deepens,

60
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,511
but there seems to be no end in sight.

61
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,848
-Abolish the regulation!
-Abolish!

62
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,475
Abolish the regulation!

63
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,393
-Abolish!
-Abolish!

64
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,270
Distribute water fairly!

65
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,147
-For fairness!
-For fairness!

66
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,607
-Abolish!
-Abolish!

67
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,567
Abolish the regulation!

68
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,277
-Abolish!
-Abolish!

69
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,371

ENVIRONMENT FOR HUMAN SURVIVAL
RESEARCH CENTER

72
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,083
Mr. Kim,

73
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,211
I heard your water grade
was upgraded to Class B.

74
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,546
Congratulations.

75
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,798
It's not a huge increase, though.

76
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,009
The researchers here
probably have higher classes.

77
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,010
I see.

78
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,263
What's Dr. Song Jian like?

79
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,181
She's a scientist.

80
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,184
Smart, boring, conceited,
and condescending.

81
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,354
So why do we need an ethologist
for this mission?

82
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,731
She used to be a big-name astrobiologist.

83
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,902
Then why did she quit
and go into ethology?

84
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,655
No idea. I guess it paid better.

85
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,075
Have you met her before?

86
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,661
Five years ago. Just once.

87
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,497
What's that?

88
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,630
Mr. Kim, you got a new pair of glasses.

89
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,757
You used to wear brown horn-rimmed ones.

90
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,760
Yes, you have an amazing memory.

91
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,720
That was five years ago.

92
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,765
So what are you here for?

93
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:40,645
Your papers on astrobiology
have recently been gaining more attention.

94
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,230
Amazing work.

95
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,067
Are you here because of the Mars Project?

96
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,904
I'm no longer interested in astrobiology.

97
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,739
I see, but…

98
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,326
There's nothing in space.

99
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,872
I came to visit you today

100
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,543
because we need an astrobiologist
to take part in an important mission.

101
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,754
Director Choi also
recommended you for the position.

102
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,838
Director Choi did?

103
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,759
What's the mission?

104
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,304
I can only share details
after you accept our offer.

105
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,644
Are there any scientists
who fall for what you just said?

106
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,940
You might change your mind

107
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,317
once you hear the destination.

108
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,488
Where is it?

109
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,323
Balhae Station.

110
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,676
CONDOLENCES
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

111
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,221
SONG WONKYUNG

112
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,219
You must've been thirsty.

SPACE AND AERONAUTICS ADMINISTRATION

114
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:03,663
This memorial is to remember the 117 crew
members who lost their lives 5 years ago

115
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:09,418
at Balhae Station, a lunar station
built by the Republic of Korea SAA.

116
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,505
Through independent efforts, the SAA…

117
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,923
Dr. Song Jian?

118
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,385
Yes?

119
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,013
-I hear you're going to Balhae Station.
-Who are you?

120
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,016
Han Yunjae, the captain.

121
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,559
I see.

122
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,687
I'm Song Jian.

123
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,189
I've heard a lot about you.

124
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,024
You got here early.

125
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,069
Yes, I just wanted to come

126
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,613
and see this.

127
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,619
This memorial is to remember…

128
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,248
Things still seem very gloomy here.

129
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:51,544
…five years ago at Balhae Station.

130
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,965
Through independent efforts, the SAA was…

131
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,591
Why don't you reconsider?

132
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,595
Reconsider what?

133
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,097
Going to Balhae Station.

134
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,558
You should reconsider.

135
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,769
Captain!

136
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,854
Salute!

137
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,606
Hello.

138
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,985
This always breaks my heart.

139
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,904
They should've at least had
the names of the deceased engraved.

140
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,199
Exactly. It's always the crew
that gets mistreated.

141
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,326
Long time no see, sir.

142
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,287
Hey, it's you. Ryu Taesuk.

143
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,707
Oh, this is Lieutenant Ryu Taesuk!

144
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,501
The famous elite soldier of the military.

145
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,754
I have a good feeling about this mission.

146
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,714
-Nice to meet you.
-Same.

147
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,467
I'm Gong Soochan, sir. Salute!

148
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,135
-Yes, hello.
-Nice to meet you.

149
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:44,680
-I'm Top Gun of SAA, Kim Sun.
-Yes, nice to meet you.

150
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,309
What?

151
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,436
How does he call himself the Top Gun?

152
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,439
You little rascal.
He never even served in the army.

153
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,942
Okay, then. He got dumped last week
because he's so ugly.

154
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,487
-It's not because I'm ugly.
-Then what?

155
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,365
Hello, I'm Eun Jiyoung,
appointed as the co-pilot of this mission.

156
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:04,909
I see.

157
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,327
Nice to meet you.

158
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,580
I'm Kim Heesun, the Top Gun of SAA.

159
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,874
Yes, I know who you are, sir.

160
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,167
How do you know who I am?

161
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,172
Wow, I'm really looking forward
to this mission.

162
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,806
Whoa, the golden card.

163
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,766
Wow.

164
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,812
I've never seen one in person before.

165
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,648
I see.

166
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,483
You must be nervous.

167
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,277
It's like that at first.

168
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,655
But you'll get used to it soon enough.

169
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,449
When you're in outer space,

170
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,202
one day together feels like
a year spent together on Earth.

171
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,584
So in my opinion, the looks
of the crew members are very important.

172
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,545
Think about it.

173
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:02,716
You're stuck in a tiny spacecraft
staring at the same faces every day.

174
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,053
Without eye candy to look at,
it gets pretty tough.

175
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,058
Oh, I'm the team doctor for this mission,
Hong Gayoung.

176
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,519
Just call me Doc Hong.

177
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,356
-Nice to meet you, I'm--
-I know, Dr. Song Jian.

178
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,608
Well. You're very famous.

179
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,734
Can I speak casually?

180
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,694
No.

181
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,737
I see.

182
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,656
I guess you prefer to keep a distance.

183
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,368
How should I address you, then?
Dr. Song? Ms. Jian?

184
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,708
I like Dr. Song better.

185
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,335
You're a gold member,
so Dr. Song suits you better.

186
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,715
The higher-ups are here. Hello.

187
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,719
It's been a while, Dr. Song.

188
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,475
Balhae Station was temporarily closed
for five years after the radiation leak.

189
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,352
We decided to close it permanently.

190
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,731
Your mission is
to retrieve an important sample

191
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:03,068
before the permanent closure
of the station and return to Earth.

192
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,030
Once you land on the Moon,
your allotted mission time

193
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,781
will be 24 hours.

194
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,790
The sample you are to retrieve
is in this capsule you see right here.

195
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,085
This capsule was designed
to maintain a very low temperature

196
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,504
to protect its contents.

197
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,342
If the capsule is in good condition,
you won't have a problem in the retrieval.

198
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,761
However, if you find
even the smallest defect

199
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,013
on the outer shell
or in its thermoregulator,

200
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,681
you must pay particular attention.

201
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,976
Yes, Dr. Song?

202
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:41,023
What specifically is this substance
we're to retrieve?

203
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,943
Why does it have to be transported
under very low temperatures?

204
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,112
Well…

205
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,408
The information was lost in the accident,
so we do not know for sure.

206
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,785
Please continue.

207
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:58,958
There are a total of three locations
where we believe the samples are left.

208
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,628
The station was in extreme disorder
at the time of the accident,

209
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,006
so we do not know to what degree
these samples have been damaged.

210
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,927
There is no need to retrieve
a large amount of the samples.

211
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,512
Our main focus

212
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,973
is on the safe retrieval
of at least one sample.

213
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:19,561
Aw, you're asking for too much.
We deserve to know more than that.

214
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,731
We aren't a delivery service
who just travels to pick up parcels.

215
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,609
It's like any other mission.

216
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,320
We just have to do as we're told.

217
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,993
The SAA was also given
very minimal information,

218
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,829
so please understand the lack of details.

219
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,707
If we do not know
what this dangerous substance is,

220
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,084
how are we going to retrieve it safely?

221
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,629
I wonder, do you really want
this mission to be a success?

222
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,259
That's why we need you, Dr. Song.

223
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,719
Dr. Song.

224
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,723
It seems like you believe

225
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,892
we're hiding some crucial information.

226
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,939
But sadly, we also don't know anything.

227
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,234
That's why we needed

228
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:11,363
a talented astrobiologist like you
in this troubling situation.

229
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:12,865
Or…

230
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,326
did I get it wrong?

231
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,081
Captain Han is in charge of the operation,

232
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,126
but your decision will be prioritized

233
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,712
when it comes to the sample.

234
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,257
Please bear that in mind.

235
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,601
5 YEARS AGO

236
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:44,021
You'll never have to worry
about water again.

237
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,607
Rather than government compensation,

238
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,318
please consider this
your sister's last present.

239
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,911
Go away.

240
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,900
Captain Han.

241
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,321
Are all your missions conducted like this?

242
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,576
It makes no sense to restrict
necessary information for the mission.

243
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,497
Are you always that passionate?

244
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,834
There's less than 10% probability
our whole crew will survive.

245
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,669
If you're worried about their safety,

246
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,338
you should reduce the uncertainty
as much as you can.

247
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,009
Uncertainty lies everywhere,
be it outer space or Earth.

248
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,721
So I shouldn't ask any questions
and just do as I'm told?

249
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,183
The outlook is quite bleak.

250
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,439
Aren't scientists people who find a way

251
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,940
in such situations?

252
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,322
Are you sure you still want to come?

253
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,325
Now that you mentioned my work ethic,

254
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,868
I can't back out.

255
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,667
I will ask for your opinion
when I deem it necessary.

256
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,062
Aw…

257
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,523
Why did you bring so much stuff?

258
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,901
Did you bring your entire lab here?

259
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,944
It's just that

260
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,821
I didn't know what I might need.

261
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,209
Wow, look at everyone hard at work.

262
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,044
Reporting for duty.

263
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,879
I'm Lee Gisu, the co-pilot.

264
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,800
Nice to meet you.
I look forward to working with you.

265
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,599
I've never seen him before.
Why was she switched out?

266
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,020
I can't believe how they treat us.

267
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,481
We have a little something
called teamwork.

268
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,858
We aren't replaceable mechanical parts.

269
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,237
They can't just bring a new co-pilot
right before takeoff.

270
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,614
It's five minutes to docking.
Should I dismiss him?

271
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,826
No, I'll make a great team with him.

272
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,331
PULL TO OPERATE

273
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,545
You seem really nervous.

274
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,046
Relax.

275
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,179
Nothing like sweets to help you relax.

276
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,309
What are you doing?

277
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,311
Mind your own business.

278
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:56,982
Okay? Mr. Nosy,
if you fail to land this thing smoothly,

279
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,693
I'm going to throw up
on the back of your head.

280
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,002
Have we met?

281
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:17,961
No.

282
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,922
You seem familiar.

283
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,093
Well, I have an ordinary face.

284
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,386
Nice to meet you.

285
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,151
Oh, Dr. Song.

286
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,280
I heard EHSRC gives you
a good grade for water access.

287
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,948
What's yours? B?

288
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,410
No way, is it higher? Class A?

289
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,245
Why do you care if she's a B or C?

290
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,790
Why are you so curious?

291
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,751
We'll all get promoted
to Class A after this mission.

292
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,088
Come on, we're as good as family now.

293
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:05,133
I was just being friendly.
You're always too harsh on me, Doc.

294
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,301
It feels like

295
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,137
you're all going on a trip or something.

296
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,973
We're all just pretending.

297
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,560
What else can we do?
We're already on board.

298
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,777
All crew members, put your helmets on.

299
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:30,075
Nuri 11. One minute to docking.

300
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,412
Preparing to dock.

301
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:06,278
Countdown begins. Ten, nine, eight, seven,

302
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:11,241
main engine, ignited,
five, four, three, two,

303
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,869
vernier engine, ignited. Liftoff.

304
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,691
Control, this is Nuri 11.

305
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,402
We have entered the orbit as scheduled.

306
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,366
Nuri 11 is in orbit as scheduled.

307
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,537
I now have control.
Switching to autonomous navigation system.

308
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,580
Copy that.

309
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:10,967
Autonomous navigation confirmed.
Flight orbit and speed, optimal.

310
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,269
When will we be in the Moon's orbit?

311
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,565
It's scheduled for 9:06 a.m.

312
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,110
We will not be able to reach Control
for two hours due to a meteorite shower.

313
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,072
Ask for the revised data when we're back.
Keep an eye out.

314
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,073
Yes, sir.

315
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,673
Mr. Hwang made a big contribution
during the construction of Balhae Station.

316
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:53,885
He also stayed there for a long time
as a part of the research team.

317
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,471
He decided to cooperate with us

318
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,348
as an advisor for this mission.

319
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:07,023
But don't you think Mr. Hwang
is almost a little too quiet?

320
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,068
Has anybody heard him talk? I haven't.

321
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,444
Is that just who he is?

322
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,531
Yes, he definitely talks
much less than you do.

323
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,868
He's the only one here
who has been to Balhae Station.

324
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,246
I have millions of questions for him.

325
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,373
What really happened there?

326
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,459
I'm dying to know. Should I ask? I will.

327
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,086
Hey, Soochan.

328
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,254
Don't.

329
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,380
In my opinion,

330
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:36,052
both Mr. Hwang and Director Choi
don't really know anything in particular.

331
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,930
I can hear you.

332
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,183
If I can hear you, anybody can, right?

333
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:36,529
Anomaly detected in spacecraft exterior.

334
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,699
-What's the problem?
-The system is… One second.

335
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,077
It's the docking system.

336
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,163
The locking bolt won't last if we get into the landing orbit.

337
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,623
Ah, fuck.

338
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,460
If the locking bolt falls off,
it'll hit the engine.

339
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,296
We can't reach SAA Control.

340
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,924
It'll take 20 minutes to reach them again.

341
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,093
-The bolt is shaking harder.
-Fuck.

342
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,761
How long until we land?

343
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,681
We'll enter the landing orbit
in seven minutes.

344
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,265
It's going to come off.

345
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,310
Release the module.

346
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,728
-Sorry?
-What?

347
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,064
If we do, the point of entry changes.

348
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,733
We'll save the landing module
before it's too late.

349
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,903
Release the module.
We have to land no matter what.

350
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,366
All crew members, check your seatbelts!

351
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,535
Prepare yourselves for impact!

352
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:37,132
Switching to module release mode.

353
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,341
Releasing the module.

354
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,058
Ignite main engine!

355
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,438
Fuck! The main engine won't ignite!

356
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,738
Prepare for thrust control.

357
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,617
Three!

358
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,078
Two!

359
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,747
One!

360
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,082
Igniting the thrust control engine!

361
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,135
At this rate, we're going to crash!

362
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,515
Straighten the fuselage!

363
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,059
Please work! Please!

364
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,439
Brace for impact.

365
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,450
-Fuck!
-We're crashing!

366
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,015
The spacecraft is tipping.
We have to escape.

367
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,519
Let's go.

368
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,789
Step aside.

369
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,959
Watch out!

370
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,135
Is everyone okay?

371
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,270
Hang on tight!

372
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,524
Dr. Song!

373
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,158
Dr. Song, hang on!

374
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,494
Captain!

375
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,063
The satellite communication system
has been destroyed.

376
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,648
We can't communicate with the SAA.

377
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:08,361
They probably saw everything
back on Earth.

378
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,156
Mr. Hwang, it'll be tough
for you to breathe

379
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,450
because your fractured rib
is pushing down on your lung.

380
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,660
You have to stay strong.

381
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,829
Yes, I'm all right.

382
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,017
Step aside.

383
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,985
How far are we from Balhae Station?

384
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,738
We're about 7.6km away.

385
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,993
I just got the chills.

386
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:40,912
Me too.

387
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,916
Does that mean we're astronauts
without a spacecraft now?

388
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,084
What do we do now?

389
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,795
What do you think?
Wait until the rescue ship gets here.

390
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,514
Let's head to Balhae Station.

391
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,682
Let's go.

392
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,583
Captain, do you think we could
complete the mission in 24 hours now?

393
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,127
Forget about the mission.

394
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,214
Do we even have enough oxygen
to get to the station?

395
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,757
I'm so anxious.

396
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,344
You'll definitely get there
if you shut your mouth.

397
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,390
Once we get there, we'll contact Earth
to rearrange our mission.

398
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,850
Mr. Hwang.

399
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,439
Are you all right, Mr. Hwang?

400
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,863
Dr. Song, don't wait for us. Keep going.

401
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,749
Dr. Song, you have to keep moving.

402
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,052
Get moving.

403
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,891
Can you keep walking?

404
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,227
-Can you?
-Yes, I can.

405
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,535
Is that

406
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,037
Balhae Station?

407
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,790
It looks much bigger than we expected.

408
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,254
We have to hurry.

409
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,716
We'll run out of oxygen at this rate.

410
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:30,433
The southern region has a bit of slope,
but we could get to the station faster.

411
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,730
Captain.

412
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,777
Are you sure Mr. Hwang can make it?

413
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,572
Mr. Hwang, hang in there.
We're almost there.

414
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,052
His blood pressure keeps dropping.

415
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,596
It seems the bone fragments
punctured his lungs.

416
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,514
We have to get to the station quickly.

417
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,770
Water.

418
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,315
What did you say?

419
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,154
Water.

420
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,530
Water?

421
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,497
Water.

422
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,582
He's out of water.

423
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,335
Bring some water.

424
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,637
Here you go, sir.

425
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,443
Mr. Hwang.

426
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,079
The water…

427
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,377
Don't…

428
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,055
Captain.

429
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,318
We'll take him with us when we return.

430
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,904
Yes, sir.

431
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,585
Let's go.

432
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,807
