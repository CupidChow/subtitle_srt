1
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:11,011
How does it feel to be a part
of the mission on Balhae Station?

2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,140
I don't know. I'm not sure.

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,018
It's great.

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,187
What was the training like?

5
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,523
Good.

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,985
Isn't it tough?

7
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:27,986
No.

8
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,282
Do you stay in touch with your family?

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,368
I feel more comfortable alone.

10
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,457
5TH PSYCHOTHERAPY SESSION

11
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,419
How do you feel today?

12
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,462
Good.

13
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,718
Don't you think you might regret
taking part in this mission?

14
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,262
No.

15
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,268
What kind of thoughts help you
bear through a tough situation?

16
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,604
I don't think about anything.

17
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,732
What about your family?

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,237
My parents passed away when I was young,

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,074
and my older sister died
in an accident five years ago.

20
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,996
What does your older sister mean to you?

21
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,417
I'm not sure.

22
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,462
I think I relied on her a lot
when I was a kid.

23
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,137
10TH PSYCHOTHERAPY SESSION

24
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,473
Why did your older sister leave?

25
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,102
I don't know.

26
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,355
But I'm sure she had a reason.

27
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,444
What does your older sister mean to you?

28
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,835
KEY TO SALVATION

29
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,062
How are the capsules?

30
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,106
The internal temperature is unstable,
so I'll have to see.

31
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,151
Let's try not to move these around

32
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,362
until we transfer them outside.

33
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,367
What were you thinking?

34
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,285
What?

35
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,038
Did you think she wouldn't attack us
if you gave her the lunar water?

36
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,040
I only

37
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,667
wanted to show her

38
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,712
that I won't hurt her.

39
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,507
That I'm not trying
to take the capsule from her.

40
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,051
I thought she'd feel that too.

41
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,014
If you expose yourself to danger,
you burden the whole team.

42
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,475
You saw her.

43
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,896
You saw how
the lunar water reacts with her.

44
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,982
We all saw it.

45
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,194
Yes, her cheek opened and closed.

46
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,696
And her wounds were healed in an instant.

47
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,282
How is that possible?

48
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,287
Dr. Song, do you have any idea
what kind of being she may be?

49
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,666
I don't know.

50
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,127
But what I do know is

51
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,547
the lunar water won't kill her.

52
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,591
He'll be fine.

53
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,385
His cut isn't too deep.

54
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,345
Anyway, what was that girl?

55
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,056
Did the lunar water bring
some kind of change to her body?

56
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,478
It seemed like her body
adapted to the lunar water.

57
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,521
Adapted?

58
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,440
She didn't simply adapt to it.

59
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,569
Her physical ability… and the speed
of recovery showed it's more than that.

60
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,406
She may have been born
with antibodies for it,

61
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,908
or it may be
a special case of genetic mutation

62
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,994
caused by different environmental factors.

63
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,666
What we do know is she's a danger to us.

64
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,004
We should resume the search
and catch her even if we must kill--

65
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,547
No, we can't kill her.

66
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,760
We need to kill her or whatever
to put an end to this and go home.

67
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,179
We can't kill her.

68
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,601
She may be the only key
to the secret of the lunar water.

69
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,899
She might just be everyone's hope.

70
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,735
This is just…

71
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,161
You're a bit feverish.

72
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,580
It might be the wrong antibiotics.

73
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,209
There's nothing we can use here,
so I'll check another lab.

74
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,543
I'll find something.

75
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,175
Are you all right?

76
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,426
I'm okay, sir.

77
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,637
I'm sorry to make you worried.

78
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,722
Don't mind the mission.
Look after yourself.

79
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,049
Hello, Captain Han.

80
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,635
I heard the situation isn't looking great.

81
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,886
Are you all right?

82
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,014
I'd like to ask you a question.

83
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,642
Are you there alone?

84
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,979
Yes, this is a secure channel.
Please go ahead.

85
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,649
How much do you know
about this series of events?

86
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,447
It was Director Choi's decision
to shut down Balhae Station.

87
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,534
There are some who question that decision.

88
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,537
What about you?

89
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,626
Is there anything else
I should know regarding Balhae Station?

90
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,215
You're the one…
who's there at the station now.

91
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,675
What do you mean?

92
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,344
Please have a talk with Dr. Song.

93
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,346
The truth lies there,

94
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,557
not here.

95
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:24,832
Current outdoor temperature, 23 degrees.
Humidity, 36 percent.

96
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,251
-Air quality is at Level D.
-Doctor.

97
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,919
Did you say Hajin is gone?

98
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,380
We just found her.

99
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,716
What happened?

100
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,051
I'm not sure.

101
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,511
She must've had a bad dream.

102
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,182
She kept looking for her dad
and barely managed to fall asleep.

103
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,230
Stop!

104
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,190
I said stop!

105
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:32,942
Stop!

106
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,319
I'm warning you!

107
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,205
Stand back.

108
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,583
This is a warning.
Return to your original places.

109
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,503
We will fire if you do not stand back.

110
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,462
Stand back.

111
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,633
Mom…

112
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,553
Mom…

113
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,639
I suddenly remember
the time I went to a swimming pool.

114
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,643
I got on a slide
and fell right into the water.

115
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,645
It was so damn fun.

116
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,022
Right?

117
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,066
You've done that, haven't you?

118
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,029
If this mission is a success,

119
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,783
we could see a pool once again.

120
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,719
We'll lure her out and capture her alive.

121
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,432
Map of the ventilation shafts.

122
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,850
Show INP-07.

123
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,190
The shaft INP-07 leads
to many key facilities in the station.

124
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,903
If we lure her
with this lunar water capsule

125
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,155
and block off this intersection of INP-07…

126
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,867
right here,

127
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,121
she'll have to come out through the vent
in the hallway of the machine room.

128
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,708
Then we'll shut both ends of the hallway.

129
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,543
Like hare coursing.

130
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,214
So we want to chase her down
and trap her. But there's a problem.

131
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,423
That hare can

132
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,676
easily rip a person to pieces.

133
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,637
He's right.

134
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,723
Even if we get lucky
and trap her in the hallway,

135
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,185
it's still too dangerous
to subdue her and catch her alive.

136
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,024
That's why we need Dr. Song.

137
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,685
Captain.

138
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,021
We can't use guns.

139
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,567
Please don't provoke her
as long as we must

140
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,902
until I calm her down.

141
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,697
That's my decision to make on the scene.

142
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,221
Even within the SAA,

143
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,725
some people were against
moving the lunar water to Earth.

144
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,770
If we carry something back
without confirming its safety,

145
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,856
it could pose a danger for everyone.

146
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,858
But Director Choi or other higher-ups

147
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,611
probably thought it's more important

148
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,697
not to let anyone else
get their hands on the lunar water.

149
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,827
Knowing everyone in this station
was killed by that very lunar water?

150
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,914
There are enough reasons
to take this risk.

151
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,219
I think…

152
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,015
my sister deleted all the research data.

153
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,977
Perhaps she hoped no one
would find out about the lunar water.

154
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,987
Then why do you think
she left you that message?

155
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,406
In the end,

156
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,701
she probably thought
someone had to do this.

157
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,453
Wouldn't that be why she called you here?

158
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,538
I'm not sure.

159
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,839
Once I find out the entire truth,

160
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,801
what am I really supposed to do?

161
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,181
I have no idea.

162
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,093
My device.

163
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,437
Drop your gun.

164
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,316
Why are you doing this?

165
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,194
Drop your gun!

166
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,783
Dr. Song, are you ready?

167
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,411
Yes.

168
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,497
To your position.

169
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,708
Yes, sir.

170
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,793
Let's get ready.

171
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,181
Lieutenant Ryu, can you hear me?

172
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,349
Lieutenant Ryu, where are you?

173
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,684
Lieutenant Ryu.

174
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,103
Doc Hong, what's going on?

175
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,024
Lieutenant Ryu and E2 are both missing.

176
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,109
I'm not sure where they are.

177
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,111
What do you mean, they're both missing?

178
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,447
Did E2 regain consciousness?

179
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,490
No, he hasn't come back.

180
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,910
Even if he did,
he can't move in that condition.

181
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,122
I understand. Please be on standby.

182
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,750
-We'll be there as soon as--
-Captain.

183
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,099
She's here.

184
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:48,890
Now.

185
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,026
Dr. Song, come on out.

186
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:31,975
No.

187
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,560
No.

188
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,104
Don't move.

189
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,690
You'll get more hurt.

190
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,210
Luna?

191
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,756
Luna 073?

192
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,653
This is the best we can do for her.

193
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,034
Dr. Song…

194
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,709
Are you okay?

195
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,808
We got her, Doc Hong.

196
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,935
We finally got that monster.

197
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,812
What? You got her?

198
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,481
Okay.

199
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,318
Are E2 and Lieutenant Ryu with you?

200
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,652
What a relief.

201
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,322
We can go home now.

202
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,490
Yes, okay.

203
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,743
So are E2 and Lieutenant Ryu with you?

204
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,037
No, that's why I'm heading over there now.

205
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,040
No, don't come back here.

206
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,501
Go to the command center
and find their locations.

207
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,710
I'll stay here.

208
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,212
They might come back.

209
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,796
All right, then.

210
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,193
Captain.

211
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,405
Is everyone all right?

212
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,703
I'll get her ready to be transported.

213
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,964
Let's get her treated first.

214
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,600
Do we hand her over to the backup
as soon as they get here?

215
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,313
They will take her to Earth, won't they?

216
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,190
Do you know what will happen to her

217
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,067
and where she'll go?

218
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,829
GATE CLOSURE

219
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,831
Activating gate closure.

220
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,126
Activating machine room gate closure.

221
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,472
Dr. Song, no!

222
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,647
Darn it, what's going on?

223
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,902
What is this?

224
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,487
What the heck is going on?

225
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,323
Damn it.

226
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,763
Dr. Song!

227
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,018
Dr. Song…

228
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:43,453
Activating gate closure. All members,
evacuate from the machine room.

229
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,330
Captain, we have to move now.

230
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,583
-This way.
-Evacuate from the machine room.

231
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,311
Activating main lab closure.

232
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,647
Activating main lab closure.

233
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,692
All members, evacuate from the main lab.

234
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,945
Activating main lab closure.

235
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,114
Activating main lab closure.

236
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,200
All members, evacuate from the main lab.

237
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,286
Activating main lab closure.

238
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,622
Activating main lab closure.

239
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,667
All members, evacuate from the main lab.

240
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,461
Captain.

241
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,296
Captain!

242
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,506
We're now…

243
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,758
The main lab is shut down.

244
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,220
The fire door just shut off the area.
What's going on? Is everyone okay?

245
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,305
We're trying to get
a grasp of the situation.

246
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,558
Kim Sun, where are you?

247
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,727
I barely escaped.

248
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,187
I'm on my way to the command center.

249
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,942
Check the system when you get there,
and locate the crew.

250
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:56,943
Yes, sir.

251
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:08,997
Captain.

252
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,332
Captain, can you hear me?

253
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,604
Shutdown complete.

254
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,648
It won't open.

255
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:48,161
Captain, I don't think
the entire station was shut down.

256
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,746
Just a few areas.

257
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,083
Doc, have you found E2 and Taesuk?

258
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,919
No, I can't reach them.

259
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:57,921
For now,

260
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,758
I'll pick up the lunar water samples
and find a way out of here.

261
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,487
They're probably still in the shaft.

262
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,574
This is AP-4,
connected to the outside of the station.

263
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,662
We can come across where Dr. Song is
at the second intersection.

264
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:31,996
Ryu Taesuk…

265
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,166
He volunteered for this mission, right?

266
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,505
Yes, that's what I confirmed.

267
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,962
GATE CLOSURE

268
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,821
Where did you go?

269
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:03,796
Were you

270
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,758
waiting for me?

271
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,659
Are you okay?

272
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,666
Does your leg hurt?

273
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,254
Have you been

274
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,632
living here all along?

275
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,438
Do you

276
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,356
want to try this?

277
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,707
Here.

278
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,814
No, no.

279
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,107
Not like that.

280
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,617
Right.

281
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,065
