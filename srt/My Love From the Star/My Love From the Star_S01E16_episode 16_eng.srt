1
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,050

2
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,280
You don't seem to be aware of this yet,
 so I'm going to  tell you clearly.

3
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,940
I also no longer like you.

4
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,760
I dislike you even more after this.

5
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,160
So do me a favor and disappear from my sight...
No, from my life.

6
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,630
Please.

7
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,060
Also . . . just how selfish you are . . .

8
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,560
I would like you to be aware.

9
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,340
What are you doing

10
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,400
right now?

11
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,160
The most selfish act

12
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,560
that I am capable of doing to you.

13
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,220
You, Do Min Joon!

14
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,140
There is really nothing that you can't do.

15
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,860
You're really the best.

16
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,290
Why?

17
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,410
Do you like me?

18
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,680
Do you like me?

19
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,510
You really aren't capable of lying.

20
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,870
You could have just said you liked me in this situation.

21
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,720
Is this how it is on your star? Do you just
 randomly kiss women that you don't even like?

22
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,930
On our star,

23
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,050
this isn't right.

24
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,380
The men on our planet only do this to women they like!

25
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,610
This isn't right.

26
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,150
Won't you agree, Do Min Joon?

27
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,860
Aw my...  darn it!

28
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,170
Do Min Joon?!

29
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,570
Come to your senses! Why are you doing this to me?!

30
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,320
What good is having supernatural powers?!
He passes out every time we kiss!

31
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,550
The key? Where is the key?

32
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,000
-Pocket.
-Pocket?

33
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,970
You really...

34
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,150
What star did you come from?

35
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,260
 My Love From the Star
 Episode 16

36
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,950
Hey, move it!

37
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,750
Can't you see it's urgent?

38
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,370
Hey, you better move over! Someone is dying over here.

39
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,860
Hey there chunky white one (SUV in front)!
Will you move over?
Can't you see that we're in a hurry?!

40
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,910
Go slowly. We might die getting there at this rate.

41
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,370
Can't you see that I am doing everything possible to save you?

42
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,770
Are you alright, Do Min Joon? Are you alright?

43
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,520
Watch the fron...

44
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,060
What? What did you say?

45
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,610
Do Min Joon, say it.

46
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,380
Front... please watch ahead of you!

47
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,530
I almost hit them.

48
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,670
Are you alright?

49
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,430
Tell me! This isn't coincidence, is it?

50
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,650
What?

51
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,100
That kiss... You passed out after that kiss. 
This time you fainted, too.

52
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,920
What is it? What causes it?

53
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,130
Don't act like you didn't hear me and just tell me. 
What's the secret?

54
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,760
Is it more shocking than being an alien?

55
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,800
There seems to be a problem with any personal contact.

56
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,850
Yet there wasn't any problem when we held hands.
 But a kiss isn't possible?

57
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,280
What, am I right?

58
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,470
Be quiet.

59
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,060
No, if it's true what you say about being an alien,

60
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,400
then you're a different species from me.

61
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,180
You are an alien male and I'm a human female.

62
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,420
So, what is really going on?

63
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,900
Regardless, I need to know what is and isn't possible. 
What I need to be cautious of.

64
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,090
To what degree is something doable and what isn't.

65
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,350
So then ...

66
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,110
Nothing is doable starting from a kiss?

67
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,490
Nothing else after that?

68
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,710
Please.

69
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,050
What is there that you can't tell me since you've already
 come out and admitted to being an alien?

70
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,210
What is possible and what isn't?

71
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,670
This is alright.

72
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,410
Since I know it's alright,

73
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,930
let go of me.

74
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,460
I said to let go.

75
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,760
This guy really doesn't listen.

76
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,120
I have no choice, then.

77
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,360
But... let's do some organizing.

78
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,800
Since the last time when I

79
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,470
asked you what you thought of me as a woman,

80
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,380
your ignoring me completely goes without saying,

81
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,060
and then you brought up the owner of the hairpin, and said

82
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,880
that you were only interested in me
 because I resembled that girl and all that.

83
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,240
Did you or did you not say that you wouldn't be interested
in me unless I was that woman?

84
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,560
In any case, that's why I gave up on my feelings for you.

85
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,950
But you appeared out of nowhere today, 
and kissed me without my permission.

86
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,110
From my perspective, there isn't any way possible  
 that I wouldn't be curious.

87
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,730
That kiss ...

88
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,660
To whom did you do it?

89
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,460
Was it to me

90
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,600
or did you kiss the girl that looks like me?

91
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,770
Do you know what's the most complicated 
three way relationship in the world?

92
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,000
It is that the third party is a girl from the past.

93
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,450
If it was a woman from  the present, 
then I could know what kind of woman she is.

94
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,130
I could compete with her without frustration.

95
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,050
How does one win against the beautiful memory
of a girl from the past?

96
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,540
However, I still want to know.

97
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,590
The kiss earlier... Who were you kissing?

98
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,630
Was it me... or that woman?

99
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,230
Hmm?

100
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,590
Huh?

101
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,770
It was Cheon Song Yi.

102
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,720
Who?

103
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,070
Cheon Song Yi.

104
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,350
What did you say?

105
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,550
Who?

106
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,720
Cheon Song Yi.

107
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,630
Me?

108
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,870
Yes, you.

109
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,770
What is this?

110
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,420
Hello?

111
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,270
 What time is it right now?

112
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,840
I'm just now reaching the parking garage after filming all night.

113
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,440
I'm coming in right now.

114
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,480
Oh, I know what you're thinking right now.

115
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,850
- But it isn't like that.
-You were filming all night?

116
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,480
Oh, this could look misleading.

117
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,470
It's not anything like  that .

118
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,290
Come follow me!

119
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,380
Were you really in that guy's house all night?

120
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,440
Are you out of your mind?

121
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,520
I told you...

122
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,910
It's not what you think.

123
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,160
I'm telling you he was in no condition to do that kind of stuff.

124
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,990
What's so important about the condition?

125
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,270
All the guys are same, you idiot!

126
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,960
No.

127
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,280
The sun goes down. The walls are enclosing,
and there's a roof overhead...

128
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,450
Then that's the end!

129
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,600
What is?

130
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,760
These are the essential requirements for men.

131
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,800
It's dark, you're surrounded by walls and there's a roof.

132
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,750
Then there is only

133
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,820
one thought.

134
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,750
He isn't like that at all.

135
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,560
He..

136
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,850
is sick.

137
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,860
Is a sick man not a man?

138
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,600
If he was sick, then he must have been under a blanket too?

139
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,120
If you were under the blanket together,
 then it's really game over.

140
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,260
Aww... this makes me angrier the more I think about it.

141
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,630
Yah, you rascal.

142
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,580
I couldn't do anything. Nothing at all.

143
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,710
The sun went down, there were walls, a roof and even blankets.

144
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,660
But, the things you're thinking,

145
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,160
I couldn't do any of it at all.

146
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,380
Nothing!

147
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,540
 I didn't know your brother would be at the accident site that day.

148
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,930
 If possibly he saw me there...

149
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,010
Oh Hyung! Long time no see.

150
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,770
When did Hui Kyeong wake up?

151
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,600
A little earlier, before noon.

152
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,680
Quick tests have been run as well.

153
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,740
Is he alright?

154
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,220
There isn't any sign of paralysis.

155
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,290
There doesn't seem to be any problem with his motor skills.

156
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,150
It appears that he will be released in a few days.

157
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,420
What did I say?

158
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,720
I told you that nothing would go wrong.

159
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,090
Look at how he's completely fine.

160
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,380
You... Are you okay?

161
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,190
I get a little dizzy, but... ah.

162
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,050
By the way, Doc.  What's that (procedure you did)
where you don't shave the head and...

163
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,050
The cranial...

164
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,560
It's called a Cranial Trepanation.

165
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,680
Oh yes, for suturing me up so nicely,

166
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,030
I am very thankful.

167
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,660
However, he doesn't remember the day of the accident.

168
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,160
Yes.

169
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,830
I remember things like reserving the caterer

170
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,430
to send food to Song Yi's filming site.  You see?

171
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,040
However,

172
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,760
I can't recall the day of the accident.

173
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,540
Is that so?

174
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,920
The fact that you had a cerebral hemorrhage means
you had a concussion as well.

175
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,680
It is possible to have a momentary lapse in memory
due to a concussion.

176
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,600
Why does it matter if he doesn't remember just that day.

177
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,500
That's possible.

178
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,410
By the way, Hyung,

179
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,410
my Song Yi was discharged because she recovered, right?

180
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,130
You're worrying about that wench in the midst of this disaster?

181
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,990
Worry about yourself.

182
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,480
Mom! Don't call my Song Yi "that wench."

183
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,680
You must be alright,

184
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,920
since you're only saying unpleasant things
 every time you open your mouth.

185
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,500
This won't do.

186
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,920
Where's my phone?

187
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,990
I want to call my Song Yi.

188
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,520
There's no change in his expression.

189
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,260
He shows no telltale sign of what he's thinking.

190
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,000
 You say Han Yoo Ra and I were in an intimate relationship?

191
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,680
 I said we were not in such a relationship 
because it was a vague one, to be honest.

192
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,060
 Does that become a problem?

193
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,880
 Tell us precisely.

194
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,700
 Were you not intimately involved with Han Yoo Ra?

195
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,250
 It wasn't for me.

196
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,650
 Although Han Yoo Ra might have thought that way.

197
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,700
 We met a few times due to work reasons.

198
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,410
 We also met a few times because she asked to dine together.

199
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,440
 I believe that you would have already looked into my love life.

200
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,420
 I have not had a lasting relationship with 
any one woman since the divorce.

201
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,750
 Are you still in contact with your former wife?

202
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,070
 We have parted ways (so why would we contact each other).

203
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,750
 Are you aware of where she is right now?

204
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,430
 I heard that she was in England, but

205
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,790
 what does that have to do with this case?

206
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,410
 From what we've discovered,

207
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,080
 Han Yoo Ra had met with your former wife.

208
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,940
 Ah... Is that so?

209
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,810
 Then...

210
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,870
 Does that mean that my ex-wife is in Korea, or

211
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,000
 did Han Yoo Ra go to England to meet her?

212
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,880
Look at the expression in his eyes.

213
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,800
He really shows his curiosity for the answer here.

214
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,360
Compared to the guy that talks nonsense about his teleportation,

215
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,040
100 times more rational look.

216
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,290
For now, let's put all our efforts into locating his former wife.

217
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,550
It seems like she knows something.

218
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,550
That place in the video looks like 
a mental hospital somewhere, so

219
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,840
we have people searching everywhere for it.
But the place hasn't been found.

220
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,350
We're looking through the insurance disbursement records, but...

221
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,300
there isn't any record of her going into a hospital either.

222
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,460
What about her residences?

223
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,590
Here... She has a house in Gangnam under her name,

224
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,280
but they say that no one lives there.

225
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,110
 Deed of land for registration and other information.
Owner: Yang Min Joo, Gangnam, Seoul.

226
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,360
Prosecutor, the Assistant Prosecutor General
 is asking  to see you.

227
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,160
What's this sudden transfer to the criminal trial department?

228
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,120
I can understand, as a newbie,  that you're overzealous.

229
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,450
I left you alone since you looked like you were working hard.

230
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,670
But why would you go around and do unnecessary things?

231
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,610
Han Yoo Ra's case could be a murder case and not a suicide.

232
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:24,260
Who? The S &amp; C heir?

233
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,610
Use your common sense to think about it.

234
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,040
He's got everything. So why would he

235
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,450
do such a thing?

236
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,110
That will become clear once we proceed further with the case-

237
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,930
It's a suicide.

238
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,760
It's already clear that it's a suicide case.

239
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,890
Close the case.

240
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,720
The actress that died.

241
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,060
Were you dating her?

242
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,290
How did you manage to be summoned
 to the Prosecutor's Office?

243
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,760
I went with them and told the truth.

244
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,680
We didn't have an especially close relationship.

245
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,500
That's right. You are

246
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,650
not a child who make mistakes.

247
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,180
Don't forget.

248
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,070
After your brother died suddenly like that,

249
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,830
now, my hope is on you.

250
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,720
Without any mistakes and without any flaws.

251
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,830
Don't you know you are my successor?!

252
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,100
Yes.

253
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,960
What is it?

254
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,900
Did my sister sleep here last night?

255
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,080
She didn't sleep, but...

256
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,290
Excuse me for a moment.

257
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,200
What kind of siblings treat

258
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,730
someone else's house as if it's their own.

259
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,420
Sit comfortably.

260
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,640
I'm comfortable. This is my house.

261
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,110
I've thought something was going on ever since
 the kimchi container incident.

262
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,230
But it ended up being like this?

263
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,860
I'll ask you as one man to another.

264
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,350
Do you like my sister?

265
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,350
What's your name?

266
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,710
Cheon Yoon Jae.

267
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,000
That is not important right now.

268
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,720
I asked you if you like my noona?

269
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,200
Are you laughing?

270
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,670
You sit a person in front of you, and then you laugh?

271
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,900
It wasn't me who sat you down there.

272
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,740
You came in on your own and sat down yourself.

273
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,730
That's true, of course.

274
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,670
Man to man, male to male, I've come to ask you.

275
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,290
I'm asking you if you like my sister?

276
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,930
Would you like some chocolate milk?

277
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,770
Do you have some?

278
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,930
Lots of guys have chased my sister 
from the time she was a student,

279
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,100
so I was busy finishing them off.

280
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,950
It's her first time liking a guy.

281
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,880
I really don't know why, but...

282
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,990

283
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,690
 This  is a refraction telescope, isn't it?!

284
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,550
Yeah.

285
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,240
How far can you see with this?

286
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,640
You can see to Jupiter and Saturn.

287
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,920
Awesome!

288
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,430
And this...

289
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,760
Limiting magnitude of 13.28 and light gathering power of 816.32.

290
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,700
It's a reflecting telescope that can view 
the Andromeda Galaxy, nebulae, and even star clusters.

291
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,450
Are these all yours, Hyung?

292
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,990
Yeah.

293
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,730
Can I ask for just one favor?

294
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,490
Go ahead.

295
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,650
Can I take a selfie next to this 'guy'?

296
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,410
Take some.

297
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,260
If you like stars, do you want these pictures?

298
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,470
This...

299
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,830
That's right, Atacama Desert.

300
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,770
Atacama Desert in Chile. When I earn money, 
my wish is to go there.

301
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,990
That is my most favorite place on earth.

302
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,940
Maximum sunlight, dry, and the sky is so clear

303
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,260
that at night it makes one feel as if the stars are falling.

304
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,180
Like I said earlier, in March of 2014,

305
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,830
don't believe the story that the asteroid "2003 QQ47"
will collide with Earth

306
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,130
and bring about Earth's destruction.

307
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,650
And don't say that you're going to give up studying because of that, either.

308
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,710
I heard it from NASA, so I thought it was for real.

309
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,440
It isn't true?

310
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,180
At the time of discovery, NASA forecast the odds

311
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,030
of collision at 1 in 250,000, but

312
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,130
they announced the probability of collision was nil, immediately after.

313
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,800
I see.

314
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,760
I'll trust you and make sure I won't quit studying
just because the asteroids are colliding.

315
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,280
I'm really stoked to have met someone who speaks
the same language as me on a rare chance.

316
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,540
My sister... lacks in many ways,

317
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:52,080
and comes up really short against you, 
but please treat her well.

318
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,520
I would like to say something with that in mind.

319
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,330
May I visit again?

320
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,900
Yes?

321
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,660
My Song Yi is here.

322
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,020
Come here.

323
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,720
What's the matter?

324
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,420
My heart is racing and I might faint again.

325
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,410
Dummy.

326
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,790
What if you had died?

327
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,810
Why did you do that?

328
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,170
How could I die and leave you?

329
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,610
If something had happened to you, 
I wouldn't have been able to live with myself.

330
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,170
How could I live? 
Why would you... for me?

331
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,950
I've never done anything for you.

332
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,880
Hey, Cheon Song Yi, you allowed me to love you.

333
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,090
Let's see. You're not scarred or hurt anywhere?

334
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,490
Hui Kyeong,

335
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,300
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,380
Don't cry.

337
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:48,870
Even if you do this for me, 
there's still nothing that I can do for you.

338
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,070
I think I'm making you unhappy.

339
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,550
I...

340
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,620
like Do Min Joon.

341
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,920
I can't help it.

342
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,550
I know. I can't help myself either, though.

343
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:17,600
Hey, stop that.
 I'm really going to be miserable then.

344
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,020
I don't know if I can live without my friend, Lee Hui Kyeong,

345
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,770
but I don't think this is right.

346
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,250
- Let's....
- Chance!

347
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,590
 Let's go.

348
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,250
 Hui Kyeong, are you alright?

349
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,230
 Chance!

350
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,750
 Hey, what is this "chance" in a situation like this?

351
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,170
 Why, you said you were thankful!

352
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,440
 Let me get one "chance" to use later.

353
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,170
 Who told you to get involved?

354
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:57,160
 Whether boys bother me or not, 
why are you getting involved and ending up like this?

355
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,680
 This can't be.

356
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,920
 Anyone who bothers you will be dead by me!

357
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,150
 It continues the same from now on.

358
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,680
 Seriously.

359
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,900
 Are you alright?

360
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,670
 If you're sorry, I told you to just let me have one "chance" in return.

361
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,330
 What "chance?"

362
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:27,260
 Later, if I ask you for just one wish, 
please do it for me.

363
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,230
 Okay.

364
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,200
 Really?

365
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
 Sign.

366
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,950
 Sealed.

367
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,250
Do you remember?

368
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,720
That we put a seal on it.

369
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,060
Yeah, I remember.

370
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,390
I really wanted to use that wish,

371
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,320
but I patiently saved it up, you know, right?

372
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,350
What's your wish?

373
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,220
What you were about to say, don't say it.

374
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:22,960
Of course, I know that while I love you, 
you can't love me back,

375
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,730
and I'm a little unhappy.

376
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,540
But still, if you weren't beside me, 
I'd really be unhappy.

377
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,530
So, don't say it.

378
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,310
What you were about to say.

379
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,640
The care nurse said that Song Yi had come by.

380
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,030
Yeah.

381
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,520
 Actually, he came by and kept asking.

382
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,560
 So I told him.

383
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,680
 That you were Yoo Ra unni's boyfriend.

384
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,270
 But did you tell that to anyone other than the detective?

385
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,580
 Other than Hui Kyeong...

386
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,320
Oh, yeah,

387
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,430
Song Yi said that she had said something 
to you regarding the deceased Han Yoo Ra.

388
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,360
Yeah, she did.

389
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,170
What did she say?

390
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,100
Their relationship wasn't good. 
And that it was tiring because of Han Yoo Ra.

391
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,300
That she talked a lot of trash about Song Yi behind her back.

392
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,360
And, what else?

393
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,010
What else?

394
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,140
What?

395
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,270
Did she not mention anything specific about 
Han Yoo Ra's incident?

396
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,000
Did she say something?

397
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,750
About what?

398
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,310
Just that Han Yoo Ra's suicide wasn't because of her
 and that she felt wronged.

399
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,020
She did say something about it, but other than that, well...

400
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,930
I must have hit something wrong when I fell.

401
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,460
My recent memory feels like it's shattered in places.

402
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,390
When I try to remember, I get dizzy.

403
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,830
Yeah, there's no need to exert yourself.

404
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,910
Get some rest.

405
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,280
Okay.

406
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,950
The hyung next door seems like a decent person.

407
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,770
What?

408
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,060
There are no bad people among people who love stars.

409
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:59,350
If it's the kind of person who installs astronomical telescopes
at home and observes the stars, it goes without saying.

410
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,960
That person isn't looking at the stars,

411
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,020
but rather, he came from there.

412
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,280
What?

413
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,410
Don't worry about it.

414
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,600
Do you think there's such things as aliens?

415
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,550
Of course there are, you don't think so?

416
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,380
To put it bluntly, I think an alien could be living next door.

417
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,610
I'm the kind of person who believes that.

418
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,160
You're a genius.

419
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,340
Do Min Joon.

420
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,690
What?

421
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,940
Awesome!

422
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,000
Why did you call?

423
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,620
To see whether you can actually hear or not.

424
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,650
Are you kidding?

425
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,020
Ah, Do Min Joon! Do Min Joon!

426
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,070
Even still, you can just go back in like that?

427
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,170
I didn't call you to see if you heard it or not.

428
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,630
But, because I want to see you.

429
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,610
I called you because I wanted to see you.

430
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,700
Okay?

431
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,350
I said I called you because I missed you.

432
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,390
He's rather petty and narrow-minded. Seriously.

433
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,930
You scared me.

434
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,620
How on earth....

435
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,810
I can never get used to this no matter 
how many times I see it.

436
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,940
Petty? Narrow-minded?

437
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,000
No, I didn't mean...

438
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,170
Let go. Let me go!

439
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,610
Let go.

440
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,310
I told you to let go! Seriously!

441
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,200
Let go! Let go!

442
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,820
You aren't going to give that to me?

443
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,460
You don't need coffee since you're young!

444
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Then why are there two cups?

445
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,160
I'm going to drink them all. 
I have to memorize my lines, but I'm sleepy.

446
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,120
Why?

447
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,370
By the way...

448
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:24,090
Did your father also come from another star, just like you?

449
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,640
Father?

450
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,610
Ah.

451
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,860
Truthfully, he isn't my father.

452
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,350
He is someone like my father.

453
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,630
He's not your real father?

454
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,690
No.

455
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,750
Then you don't have any family?

456
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,370
You know that's not possible.

457
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,450
I see.

458
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,400
You lived by yourself for such a long time
 without any family, then?

459
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,320
I have happy news.

460
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,100
I met my father this time.

461
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,050
Because of the accident, I was shocked and
 had a hard time. But,

462
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,070
thanks to that, I met my father again.

463
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,060
It isn't like I can live together with him right now, but...

464
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:18,130
Being able to see him whenever I call
 gives me a strange sense of security.

465
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,020
Something that was once heavy on my heart

466
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,560
feels like it disappeared.

467
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,220
That is a relief.

468
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,150
Do Min Joon,

469
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:40,100
you have me now.

470
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,470
I will stay by your side for a long long time,

471
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:47,250
without running away.

472
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,440
What?

473
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,530
Why are you like that?

474
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,200
But Do Min Joon...

475
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,280
Will your face stay like this?

476
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,350
Huh?

477
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,430
I guess so.

478
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,980
Even when I saw the picture from 100 years ago, only your 
hairstyle was different and your face was exactly as it is.

479
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,730
What will happen (to your face)?

480
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,310
Time on our star

481
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,070
and time here are very different.

482
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,880
The rate of aging as well.

483
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,200
Then what will I do?

484
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,480
My skin will sag and I'll get wrinkles,

485
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,270
I'll get more gray hair and my back will become more bent.
 I'll become a little old grandmother!

486
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,140
Calm down. You will be pretty even if you get old.

487
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,870
Forget it! This is why women in vampire movies
 have their necks bitten in order to become vampires too.

488
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:47,090
Men don't age and look cool. But women keep aging, 
so even if they're together, it isn't a happy ending!

489
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,190
Cheon Song Yi!

490
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,360
I don't want to hear anything now. I will go in first.

491
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,460
The cold air can age my skin faster.

492
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,330
Will this be enough?

493
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,280
I am ruined.

494
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,710
I can't (get old).

495
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,860
I can't!

496
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,550
I'm almost thirty.

497
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,300
What should I do?

498
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,420
 Today, for the aging prevention special, we have 45-year old
 "young face beauty," Ms. Park Min Hee on our show.

499
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,240
 You brought a rubber glove.
 What do you do with this?

500
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:48,620
 When you blow air into a rubber glove like this, 
your lung capacity increases and free radical oxygen is removed,

501
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,090
 which helps prevent aging skin.

502
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,920
 Wow, so that's why...

503
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,120
I suppose Cheon Song Yi could think 
like that from her perspective.

504
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,760
But that's not what's important, is it?

505
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,360
After a month, you will soon....

506
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:34,270
  I think there is a tap on your bag.

507
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:37,640
  Please talk naturally.

508
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,520
By the way,

509
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,540
I met Managing Director Lee Jae Kyeong.

510
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,800
Ah, is that so?

511
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,790
 He asked me to help him. That he'd watch my back.

512
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,300
So what did you say to him?

513
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,730
I told him I would think about it.

514
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,920
I didn't think it was a bad offer.

515
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,140
Because I just need to protect Cheon Song Yi in any case.

516
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,190
Even then...

517
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,690
I...

518
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:14,140
put out a condition that he would stay quiet and 
not harm anyone for the time being.

519
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:21,060
I plan to be of assistance if that promise is kept.

520
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,770
  Really?

521
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,620
Ah, well,

522
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,820
if you say so,

523
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,170
then that

524
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,720
is worth thinking about.

525
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,860
I was totally surprised when I got word 
that the contract was canceled.

526
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,420
They said that Do Min Joon deposited 
three times the contract fee.

527
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,040
Min Joon Hyung did?

528
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,120
Min Joon Hyung?

529
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,020
He is a really cool hyung.

530
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,320
If Noona dates that hyung, 
I approve unconditionally!

531
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,590
Hey, I don't like it! When there's Hui Kyeong.

532
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,890
And as for Manager Do,

533
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,060
the father is a big zero!

534
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,660
By the way, Hui Kyeong is getting discharged tomorrow, right?

535
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,050
I'll ride in Hyung's car.

536
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,580
I am going to stop by Song Yi's house.

537
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,250
How about dinner?

538
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,600
I made plans to eat with Song Yi.

539
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,190
Drop me off there before you go.

540
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,720
Let's do that.

541
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,350
To have gone through brain surgery
 but still be so immature...

542
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,810
Nothing's changed.

543
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,740
Let's go.

544
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,750
Long time no see.

545
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,990
I think I saw you when I went to
 my brother's office the other day.

546
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,170
Excuse me?

547
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,470
I came in as a new employee a few days ago.

548
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:58,290
Oh, is that so?

549
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,560
Nice to meet you.

550
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:06,220
I can't remember people, so I keep making mistakes.

551
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,690
Your condition isn't back to normal yet.

552
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,060
Be careful.

553
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,060
Yes.

554
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,530
Tell Song Yi

555
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,860
hello for me.

556
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,760
I will do that. Go.

557
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,860
Okay.

558
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,780
So,

559
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,560
the crane is brought in from a contractor,

560
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,630
and the special effects team takes care of the pulleys, right?

561
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,370
Yes.

562
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,330
Then...

563
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,270
who's in charge of checking and installing the pulleys?

564
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,380
Our team takes care of that, too.

565
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,680
By the way, are you okay?

566
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,490
I worried a lot.

567
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,580
I'm okay now.

568
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,500
That kind of accident doesn't usually happen. This is the one that was used at that time.

569
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,740
This pulley bolt was worn down.

570
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,960
It should have been carefully checked over.

571
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,890
It was our oversight.

572
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,320
I am really sorry.

573
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,120
No.

574
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,820
I'm not here to place blame. I was just curious.

575
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,370
Has the special effects team always consisted of the same members?

576
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,430
No.

577
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,890
We sometimes ask for help from other teams
 when we're short-staffed.

578
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,000
And there are times when we use part-time help, too.

579
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,200
That day...

580
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,800
There were a few part-timers.

581
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,160
Do you have a list?

582
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,170
Just a moment.

583
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,510
Ah, Hyung, you came?

584
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,810
Is your noona not ready yet?

585
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,630
Hey, Cheon Song Yi, hurry up and come out!

586
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,610
Min Joon Hyung is waiting!  Gosh.

587
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,540
- But...
- Yes?

588
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,200
I'm wondering if you aren't being a little rude to your noona.

589
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,430
Ah, was I?

590
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,680
I'll correct it, Hyung.

591
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:26,890

592
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,960
Why?

593
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,270
What is this?  Are you in high school?

594
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,560
Is it weird?

595
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,650
Yeah.

596
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,420
Aieesh.

597
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,290
My sister

598
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,800
is lacking in many respects.

599
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:55,100
Do you know what's ridiculous? They got rid of
 the scene I was waiting for all day last time.

600
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,620
If they were going to do that, why did they
 make me wait all day in the first place?

601
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,220
What scene are you shooting today?

602
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,160
An action scene and... a kiss scene.

603
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,260
What?

604
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,890
An action scene and a kiss scene.

605
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,340
- Use a stand-in. 
- For the action scene?

606
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,190
- No, for the kiss scene.
- Does that make sense?

607
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,040
What actor uses a stand-in for a kiss scene these days?

608
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,060
That's why I'm saying to try using one.

609
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,660
Why do you always have to do what other people do?

610
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,430
Shouldn't you try to be a more unique and creative actress?

611
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,690
Is using a stand-in for a kissing scene a unique thing to do?

612
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,360
Do Min Joon, you really are old-fashioned.

613
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,700
It's not that I'm old-fashioned. It just doesn't make sense.

614
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,360
It's a lie.

615
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,120
I don't have anything but action scenes.

616
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,280
Running, sliding, hanging on, rolling.

617
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,310
Use a stand-in for that, too.

618
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:40,770
- What now?
- Didn't you hear what the doctor said?

619
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,010
You had a ruptured spleen and pulmonary edema,
so if you don't rest enough,

620
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,940
you can either bleed again or get a secondary infection.

621
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,470
Then should I just ask them to change to kiss scenes?

622
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,160
Hey!

623
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,640
Do Min Joon, watch over me.

624
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,000
"That Cheon Song Yi, who wouldn't even consider
a role if it wasn't a lead.

625
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,030
Look at her now!" I know there are a lot of people
who would laugh at me like that.

626
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:08,250
But I think I'm happier now than when I was playing a lead role.

627
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,640
Because Do Min Joon who watches over me is by my side.

628
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,470
Going forward, keep watching over me.

629
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:23,030
It might take some time, 
but see me return to my place.

630
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,090
 - Did you bring the script?
- Yes, I got it.

631
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,680
It's been a while, Professor.

632
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,370
Yes. It's been a long time.

633
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,620
What brings you here?

634
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,170
How else would he come here, he accompanied me.

635
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,740
Why did you accompany her here?

636
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,440
I came as Cheon Song Yi's manager.

637
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,160
Ah, yes.

638
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,470
Song Yi, it turned out well.

639
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,330
I was thinking that it would be difficult for you
 without an agency.

640
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:14,850
My mom had said that you were contracting with S &amp; C,

641
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,950
- but that isn't so?
- No, it isn't so.

642
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,930
Right. The Midnight Entertainment News crew
 is here for an interview.

643
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,800
They want to interview us, as best friends.

644
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,080
Huh?

645
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,860
Best what?

646
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,680
Hello, Yoo Se Mi and Cheon Song Yi.
The two of you who are filming the movie  The Witness  together.

647
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,130
It's been well known that you guys are best friends.

648
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:42,450
Oh, yeah, not too long ago, regarding Cheon Song Yi and a second-generation chaebol,

649
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:45,820
there was a scandal.  Could you briefly tell us....

650
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:51,310
We're just friends. 
Of course, he's a friend that I really like and cherish.

651
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,740
There seems to be endless scandals
 regarding Cheon Song Yi,

652
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,240
but why is it so quiet with Yoo Se Mi? 
 Is there no news of a boyfriend?

653
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,110
I know, right?

654
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:08,650
Song Yi has always had boys
 who liked her from the time she was young.

655
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:11,610
That's why, two-timing, three-timing...

656
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,760
Hey!  When did I...?

657
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,750
Oh, hey, it was a joke.

658
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:21,030
Miss Cheon Song Yi, why don't you take this time to

659
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,080
tell Yoo Se Mi your secret to being so popular?

660
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,040
You just need to be pretty!

661
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,980
I see.

662
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:35,750
Yoo Se Mi. You took on a lead role this time.
How do you feel about it?

663
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,760
Well, honestly, I'm a little stressed.

664
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,550
But, doing it together with Song Yi 
makes me comfortable.

665
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,590
Why would that be, Miss Cheon Song Yi?

666
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,540
I wonder why, too.

667
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,090
When she was playing a lead role 
and I, a supporting role,

668
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:52,270
Song Yi always took good care of me, you see.

669
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:55,190
This time, shouldn't it be my turn?

670
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:59,180
Gosh, she is always the angelic Yoo Se Mi.

671
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:03,020
Miss Cheon Song Yi, it must be nice
 to have a friend like this.

672
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,200
Then, if that's the case, please say
 something you'd like to say to each other.

673
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,360
Miss Yoo Se Mi?

674
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,820
Song Yi,

675
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,120
our friendship won't ever change, right?

676
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,870
What?

677
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,880
Are you trying to make a comeback or not?

678
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,780
Acting all coy and superficial as needed, like Yoo Se Mi.
Can't you do that?

679
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,650
You've been taking Se Mi's side since the last time!

680
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:41,120
I'm not taking her side...

681
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,780
Miss Song Yi, you're here?

682
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:47,910
Oh, Director, what happened last time? When you have someone waiting, you need to let the person know you're leaving.

683
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,920
What am I supposed to do if you all  just leave
 without anyone letting me know?

684
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,610
Did we?

685
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,240
Hey, I told you to get in touch with her.

686
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,900
Uh, did Yeong Cheol not get in touch with you?

687
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,110
Ah, that's right. I was going to call, but completely forgot.

688
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,450
Hey, rascal!  Pay some attention.

689
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,140
Song Yi, please be understanding. Okay?

690
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,330
Where the heck is the lighting team?

691
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,660
Why aren't they coming? These people.

692
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,090
Unbelievable, seriously.

693
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:23,000
They used to not even be able to look me in the eyes before.

694
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,360
 I'm sorry that I didn't relay the message.

695
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,760
 Hey, it's okay, it's okay. Good job.

696
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,490
 Really, why?

697
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,320
 Do you know how many times Cheon Song Yi rejected my scripts?

698
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,790
 She used to be so cocky and look at her now!

699
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:47,910
 Director, all the Cheon Song Yi's scenes that are
scheduled first, should I spread them apart?

700
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,100
 Our first and last scenes today are Cheon Song Yi's, okay?

701
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,530
 Let her wait to her heart's content today.

702
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,840
What are you doing, Manager Do?

703
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,290
Cut!  NG! (no good)

704
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,890
Hey, Miss Song Yi, your expression isn't coming to life!

705
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,760
You know, look a little more desperate!

706
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm extremely desperate, Director.

707
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,240
No, no. It was weak.

708
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,810
Let's go one more time!

709
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,750
Spread some more leaves! Leaves!

710
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,320
 Oh, since it's dangerous.

711
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,900
Tell them to use a stand-in.

712
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,440
I can't, how can I use a stand-in for a tight shot?

713
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,440
Did you not hear the doctor?

714
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,240
You might either bleed again or have a secondary infection, 
since you ruptured your spleen and had pulmonary edema.

715
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,200
It'll be done soon. I've done this tons of times since I was young.

716
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,460
It was fine, I don't know what he said was weird.

717
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,450
Just a minute.

718
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,700
Cut! NG!

719
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:07,540
Cut! NG!

720
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,390
Oh, the feeling isn't alive, isn't alive!

721
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,700
NG!

722
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,410
Clear away your hair.

723
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:22,330
NG! Let's try again.

724
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,680
Again, again!

725
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,530
Cut!

726
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,500
This is good  now, isn't it?

727
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:43,600
Just... the first one is the best.  We'll use that one.

728
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,710
Let's move! Okay!

729
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,440
 - Move!
- We'll move!

730
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,120
 Move the lighting equipment!

731
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,250
 Yes!

732
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,040
You worked hard.

733
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:05,270
Ow, that hurts! I'm dying here!

734
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:07,400
What is this, what is this?

735
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,530
Are you okay?

736
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:10,690
Hold on to me.

737
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,580
You should have been careful!

738
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,310
Ow!

739
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,440
Yah.. who pushed me? Who just pushed me?

740
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,880
Yah, come here you...

741
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,390
 - Are you okay?
- Oh, my back!

742
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,030
It was you earlier, right?

743
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,050
What?

744
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:37,750
Earlier, making the Director and the Assistant Director fall down.

745
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,350
It was you, Manager Do, right?

746
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,130
I did what?

747
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,290
It was you!

748
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,530
I don't know what you are saying.

749
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,180
What are you doing?

750
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,750
Why? There is no one looking anyway.

751
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,920
But it is really nice to have an alien manager.

752
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,210
For all sorts of things. What can you do?

753
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,600
Aren't you cold?

754
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,230
Of course, I am cold. I am totally cold.

755
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,830
By chance, you can do that kind of thing?

756
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,910
Having fire come, "poof," out of your hand and stuff like that.

757
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:14,110
You know, when you flip your finger like this, 
it starts fires like that.

758
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,430
It'll start a forest fire.

759
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:18,730
Ah, that's right.

760
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,510
But you can do it?

761
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,170
Am I Vectorman?

762
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,590
You can't do it, huh?

763
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:29,360
I told you it is cold. Can't you make it warmer?

764
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,240
You don't have the ability to make me warm?

765
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,790
It is totally warm.

766
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,720
Turn it.

767
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,760
Now, they say that the next scenes will be pushed back an hour!

768
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,030
 Geez.

769
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:00,230
 An hour?

770
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:05,480
When they say one hour, it'll actually be at least three hours.

771
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,350
I will be bored during that time. What should I do?

772
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:14,090
You saw it, right? Asa!

773
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,920
I think something came inside my body.

774
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,360
Even I think it's amazing that I'm playing so well!

775
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,580
I threw this down, but

776
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:32,920
if I get the bird from here, I seriously have the ghost power!

777
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,100
Oh what should I do? What should I do?

778
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,860
What are you going to do?

779
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,140
The bird!

780
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,780
The bird! It's the bird!

781
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,330
Okay okay... I think I made too much,
so I'll sell my Gwangs.

782
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,460
Sell them, sell them.
- Please give me.

783
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,670
Could it be...?

784
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:58,680
No way.  
 -It is 5 Gwang. (Gwang is good in Go stop game).

785
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,850
Oh my...
- Wow!

786
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:04,170
What is that?
- Are you a master, Cheon Song Yi?

787
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:09,320
Call me Master Cheon.

788
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,090
Aigo, what is this?  Aigoo!

789
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,710
Aigoo.

790
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:34,160
Aigo Aigo. How could this be....

791
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,610
I won. I won. I won.

792
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,620
I won.

793
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:47,510
Pay me. Pay me. 
 Thank you. Thank you.

794
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:49,990
Thank you.

795
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,880
I haven't lived long,

796
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,810
but I've never had so much fun waiting.

797
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,480
I don't think I'll care even if I have to wait all night.

798
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:16,410
But... what are we going do for our 100th day celebration?

799
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,530
I am asking you what we are going to do on the 100th day?

800
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,660
-100th day? 
- Yes.

801
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:32,890
I used to laugh at those things,

802
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:36,500
but now that I'm in this situation, I feel differently about it.

803
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,680
It's cheesy, but I'll have to take it step by step.

804
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:47,180
100 days, 1 year, 1000 days, I want to celebrate these kinds of anniversaries.

805
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:51,940
But, starting from what day should we have our date?

806
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:57,530
Since it's been a bit ambiguous until now, should we say today's the first day?

807
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,780
What do you want to do on those anniversaries?

808
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,340
We should do everything that other people do.

809
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:07,220
First, on our 100th anniversary day, 
couple rings and couple t-shirts.

810
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:11,850
And when you go to the top of Namsan Tower,
 you know the restaurant that goes 'round and 'round?

811
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,880
I want to go eat dinner there, while looking at the night view.

812
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,240
And below that, there's a place where people put locks.

813
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,730
I went there once to film,

814
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:24,210
so I want to go there later with my boyfriend to make a wish

815
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,410
and put on a lock, I thought.

816
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:32,010
And when it's a year, we have to eat ice cream.

817
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,370
Ice cream?

818
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:38,620
You know, when inside the ice cream there is a ring?

819
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,450
And an anniversary trip or so?

820
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:44,160
For 1000 days, what should we do?

821
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,970
Is 1000 days about three years?

822
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,550
Do you want to go on a backpacking trip to Europe then?

823
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:53,210
Taking about a month or a month and a half, what do you think?

824
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,840
Why?

825
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:08,700
Cheon Song Yi.

826
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,840
What now?

827
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,100
What is it?

828
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,840
Aren't we dating?

829
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,340
Did I go overboard by myself again?

830
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,420
That's why you said that at that time?

831
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,030
That you're doing something selfish to me or whatever it was?

832
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:28,950
Cheon Song Yi, the things that you want to do...

833
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,180
Let's do everything in advance.

834
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,540
In advance?

835
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,920
Yeah, in advance.

836
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,510
Let's do everything in one month.

837
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,950
Why?

838
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,950
Why do we have to do everything in one month?

839
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,860
Huh?

840
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,380
Why?

841
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,620
Why do we have to do that?

842
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,160
I...

843
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,200
have to leave.

844
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,180
What do you mean?

845
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,330
Leave where?

846
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:26,200
Where?

847
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,130
Where are you going?

848
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:38,460
To the place... where I originally came from.

849
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:48,230
After one month,

850
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,960
to the place where I came from...

851
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:59,080
I have to go back.

852
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:10,780
 ♫ Because I can’t do
anything else but that ♫

853
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:17,890
 ♫ Every moment of you,
I hope it’ll be me ♫

854
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:27,480
 ♫ Just thinking of it overwhelms
me, filling me with you ♫

855
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:33,540
 100 days later

856
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:42,030
 ♫ When I’m looking at you, you
seem faraway like a dream ♫

857
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:51,070
 ♫ A star  that has flown to me for
several light-years is you right now ♫

858
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:58,980
 ♫ Because you stayed there,
because it’s you ♫

859
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:05,560
 ♫ Because you sometimes
quietly lean on my shoulder ♫

860
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:11,100
 ♫ I’m really, wholly thankful
I follow you as
time flows and stops ♫
