1
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,550

2
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,440
For my sake,

3
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,760
please exist somewhere.

4
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,970
For my sake,

5
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,200
don't die.

6
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,140
Please exist somewhere.

7
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,150
What I am saying is . . .

8
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,730
Go . . .

9
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,100
to the place where you used to live.

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,770
Didn't you say you had to go?

11
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,820
Didn't you say otherwise you would die?

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,750
Didn't you say you were having a hard time even now?

13
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,100
So I am telling you to go.

14
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,380
Cheon Song Yi,

15
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,600
I've already made up my mind.

16
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,510
I will stay by your side.

17
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,480
I have also made up my mind.

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,560
If you die while being by my side,

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,280
I will die as well.

20
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,670
Don't you know what I am saying?

21
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,860
Because I like you much more than

22
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,480
you think,

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,260
I think I can live

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,730
just by knowing you are alive somewhere.

25
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,510
That would be easier for me

26
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,560
than you not being anywhere in the universe,

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,140
I won't do that.

28
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,530
I won't let you be alone.

29
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,260
There will be a way.

30
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,670
I will find it.

31
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,640
 An unbelievable event took place in broad daylight
in the middle of Seoul.

32
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,210
 A mysterious man has been spotted. 
- What are you watching?

33
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,330
  Hallyu goddess Cheon Song Yi disappeared suddenly.

34
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,530
Wow, already?
 accompanied by a mystery man...

35
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,190
They have only just collected the information...

36
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,540
They are fast.

37
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,510
His name is Do Min Joon.

38
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,920
 However, there are a number of people coming
 forward remembering him by different names.

39
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,080
 Gang Sam Shik (89)
A witness who believes Do Min Joon is Kim Moo San.
He looks very much like Kim Mu San!

40
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,140
 This was a guy who I always beat
 playing mah-jong,

41
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,040
 Chief Kim Tae Sung: Astronomy observatory in Injae.
He looks very much like Han Seo Jin.

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,850
But I know that man most definitely died.

43
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,810
 Owner Hong Hye In: Do Min Joon's favorite Manga Cafe
His acquaintances seem to esteem him.

44
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,290
  What kind of person was Do Min Joon?  
 He was a very decisive person and

45
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,230
didn't buy anything easily.

46
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,780
  Did you know that he was in a relationship
 with Cheon Song Yi? 
I don't believe so.

47
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,360
 Let's just stick with the facts.

48
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,390
 I'm a little hesitant to say this, but

49
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,610
 the truth is that Do Min Joon ...

50
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,670
 We have something going on...

51
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,970
 Does he truly possess supernatural power?

52
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,480
 Or was everyone deceived by a mere 
ordinary person's publicity stunt?

53
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,600
  If not, could he possibly be an alien who came from another star?

54
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,270
Aiyoo, I've been pestered all day by those darn reporters.

55
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,310
Am I his father?

56
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,990
Why did they keep asking me where he went?

57
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,160
I didn't know he'd do that where everyone was watching.

58
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,530
I know, huh?

59
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,130
As in "The King has Donkey Ears,"
(A Silla dynasty fable about a hat maker keeping the King's secret)

60
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,970
we kept his secret for him.

61
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,240
But in one instant...

62
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,850
But...

63
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,320
Do Min Joon....

64
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,640
where on earth would he be now?

65
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,070
Are you asleep?

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,280
Why?

67
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,110
I thought hard about

68
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,770
how to send you away.

69
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,620
Shall I say I'm tired of you?

70
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,330
Or shall I tell you "Since I will live well with Hui Kyeong,

71
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,500
don't worry about me and go."

72
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,200
Because I was scared.

73
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,720
I was afraid of not having you by my side,

74
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,910
but I was more scared of not having you
 anywhere in the  universe.

75
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,860
Aren't you afraid

76
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,500
of dying?

77
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,270
I've witnessed so much of

78
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,140
a person being born,

79
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,500
growing and aging,

80
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,000
then dying.

81
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,530
So I thought that

82
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,070
the end is death anyway.  So

83
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,320
why do earthlings try so hard?

84
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,100
Except for the differing sequence of events,

85
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,090
in the end, they would all age, wrinkle, and disappear.

86
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,900
Why would they struggle and live so tenaciously,

87
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,410
as if they're experiencing a war?

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,750
An earthling's life, when observed by an outsider,

89
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,260
felt pathetic and futile.

90
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,590
But,

91
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,850
after thinking about dying,

92
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,450
I've come to a realization.

93
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,230
There is no one who lives for death.

94
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,720
What's important is living in that moment.

95
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,830
Thus, even if the end has been determined,

96
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,340
we can still be happy

97
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,610
and can continue to live.

98
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,680
It's simple.  Yet, it took me a long time to realize it.

99
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,850
  My Love From the Star 
 Chronicle 20

100
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,690
 Hot issue video: Actress Cheon Song Yi
 teleporting with her lover?

101
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,280
Cheon Song Yi....

102
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,750
How can this be?

103
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:20,900
Right there is true friendship.  Look at how she cries over
her friend, worried that something may have happened to her.

104
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,730
I've come to reassess Owner Hong

105
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,980
in a new light.

106
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,100
Sir. Do Min Joon...

107
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,910
is my man.

108
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,530
What should I do?

109
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,360
No. She wasn't kidnapped.

110
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,540
I am telling you they are in a relationship.

111
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,450
Then where are they now?

112
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,070
They will be somewhere.

113
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,860
 Mr. Do Min Joon, who assisted in the on-site arrest
of Director Lee Jae Kyeong,  has

114
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,200
 suddenly disappeared together
with the actress, Cheon Song Yi,

115
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,490
 and has  been cut off  from contact thus far.

116
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,140
Ajusshi, can you please turn off the radio?

117
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,530
Ah, yes.

118
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,310
Yes, it is correct. I am Cheon Song Yi.

119
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,890
Are you feeling okay?

120
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,330
I am okay.

121
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,180
But...

122
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,490
why didn't you tell me about Jae Kyeong honestly?

123
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,840
Reveal that to a hot-tempered person like you?

124
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,620
To someone who can't hide her thoughts
 for even 5 minutes?

125
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,400
Hui Kyeong must be having a hard time.

126
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,970
How is it you're here?

127
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,470
Your mother called me

128
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,820
saying you had been just sleeping for past several days.

129
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,640
Since I am okay, you can go now.

130
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,540
Why? Will I eat you?

131
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,670
Because I want to be alone.

132
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,230
Hui Kyeong,

133
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,880
I hated Song Yi very much.

134
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,150
I wanted to see her fall.

135
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,100
Whenever Song Yi lost something,

136
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,240
I felt gleeful and happy.

137
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,110
But...

138
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:31,630
when I reflected upon it,
 the one who lost the most was ... me.

139
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,090
To Song Yi, who trusted me as her closest friend,

140
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,070
and to you, who called me angelic,

141
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,810
I couldn't be honest.

142
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,490
Since I couldn't vent sincerely

143
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,850
to anyone,

144
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,030
my sincerity festered and became useless.

145
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,320
Now I plan to

146
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,010
let you go completely.

147
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,380
Because I have to live.

148
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,700
I have to let go of you so that
 I can go back to being your friend.

149
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,280
Then I'll, at least, be able to

150
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,610
tell you truthfully what I'm thinking.

151
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,400
I know that you've had a hard time 
because of what's happened.

152
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,030
Don't just keep it all inside.

153
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,630
And tell me.

154
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,190
You can tell me,

155
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,870
and cry in front of me, Hui Kyeong.

156
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,340
At the validity test of my arrest warrant,

157
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,090
do your best to request an investigation without detention.

158
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,730
I'm the Managing Director of S&amp;C Group.

159
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,540
Please emphasize the fact that 
the likelihood of flight

160
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,630
by a person with this level of 
social standing is nonexistent.

161
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,620
Also, I was interrogated under coercive circumstances 
 which led to my confession and

162
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,160
the Prosecution set up an entrapment.

163
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,500
Make a point of that in your argument as well.

164
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,750
We also can't let the fact that they selected
and submitted illegal CCTV material as evidence

165
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,450
just slide.

166
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,230
Please  base  your argument on 
suspect's right to defense.

167
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,540
Excuse me a moment.

168
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,120
Hello?

169
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,870
Yes, I'll call you right back.

170
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,400
Help me get out of here as quickly as you can. 
There are things that I must take care of.

171
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,720
There cannot be an in-custody investigation. 
 Is that understood?

172
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,980
Yes.

173
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,610
 It's already after 2:30 and they're not here.
It's almost 3 o'clock.

174
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,960
We're here.

175
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,900
Yes, just a moment, please.

176
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,150
--Don't be nervous, Do Min Joon.
--I'm not.

177
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,350
Don't shake (in nervousness) or chicken out either.

178
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,380
You told me before to only hide 
when I've done something wrong.

179
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,400
So, look assertive. You haven't done anything wrong.

180
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,350
I know. So don't you chicken out yourself.

181
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,030
Why would I?

182
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

183
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,790
For now, I'll get out first.

184
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,910
Let's get out together.

185
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,150
I've experienced this a lot.
Just trust me, Do Min Joon.

186
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,410
What are you planning to do?

187
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,240
Oh, as soon as I get out of the car, 
the reporters are going to come crowding around me.

188
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,560
They won't be able to look past me once they spot me.

189
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,700
You penetrate into the building in that moment.

190
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,520
Not for any reason,

191
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,920
should you use your powers again.

192
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,600
Lately, you're not even in the best condition.

193
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,730
It might become more conspicuous, okay?

194
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,550
Don't be nervous, huh? Okay?

195
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,890
Oh, oh, oh, thanks.

196
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,670
Now, ready and action.

197
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,170
It's Cheon Song Yi!
 It's Cheon Song Yi!

198
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,940
Miss Song Yi, where are you coming from?

199
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,110
What happened?  Were you kidnapped?

200
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,630
I'll tell you everything.
 I wasn't kidnapped.

201
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,060
Then what happened?

202
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,350
Where is Do Min Joon?

203
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,910
Tell us the truth.

204
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,170
-It's Do Min Joon!
-Do Min Joon!

205
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,280
Do Min Joon, is it true that you
 kidnapped Cheon Song Yi?

206
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,090
-Excuse me, excuse me!
- How did you disappear so suddenly earlier?

207
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,750
Everyone, I'm doing an interview!
 I'm Cheon Song Yi.

208
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,050
 A word, please!
What is the nature of your relationship?

209
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,550
A moment, please.

210
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,610
Please don't take pictures. Please don't take pictures.

211
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,300
Don't take pictures. Don't take pictures!

212
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,250
Take pictures of me. Me!

213
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,230
Put away your cameras!

214
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,750
Wasn't this all a set-up?

215
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,380
 -Ah, who...
-Aigoo.

216
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,510
Do Min Joon?

217
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,630
Let's go together.

218
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,330
I'll tell you everything. I wasn't kidnapped.

219
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,650
You can tell us at the station. 
Let's go.

220
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,660
By the way, let this go and talk.
 Missing Cheon Song Yi returns with Manager Do

221
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,230
 Cheon Song Yi, who had disappeared, 
reappeared along with her manager.

222
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,710
 Cheon Song Yi stated that she was
 Mr. Do Min Joon's fiancee,

223
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,700
 and was not kidnapped.

224
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,420
 In regards to how she disappeared, she 
said "no comment" and refused to speak.

225
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,650
What? Engaged? Is she crazy?

226
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,750
According to whom?

227
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,920
And that wench didn't even hurt a finger.

228
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,390
That wretched wench!
 Denial of kidnapping.  Mr. Do is fiancee.

229
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,750
If she was safe, why didn't she call home?

230
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,260
Is my hyung, Min Joon, being taken 
into the police station right now?

231
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,320
That's not good for him.

232
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,750
Not good for him?  It's even worse for your sister!
She's an actress, for god's sake.

233
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,920
Which police station is that?

234
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,180
What? You're leaving?

235
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,400
But, your daughter is at the police station...

236
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,180
She's returned safely,  so it's fine.

237
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,320
When she arrives home, tell her to give me a call.

238
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,220
No...

239
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,130
When she comes, you should eat together before going.

240
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,570
Isn't that so?

241
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,880
Why ask me that?

242
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,860
Eat before you go.

243
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,270
 You can't come in.

244
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,800
The investigation with you will take some time,
so go on in please, Mr. Do Min Joon.

245
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,950
As for you, Ms. Cheon Song Yi, 
please make your statement here.

246
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,220
Why? Why can't we go in together?

247
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,270
What are you going to do to him?

248
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,540
What will I "Do" to him?

249
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,950
Then, talk here fair and square.
I told you on our way here that

250
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,780
I'm Do Min Joon's fiancee and I wasn't kidnapped.

251
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,540
-I really won't stay put...
-Cheon Song Yi.

252
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,900
Huh?

253
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,170
It's okay.

254
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,880
Okay. But,

255
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,940
if you think he's going to do something fishy,
 come out right away or scream.

256
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,910
I'll be right here to protect you, Do Min Joon.

257
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,830
Aigoo, really...
What kind of person do you see me as?

258
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,370
Let's go.

259
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,580
(How can you think that can happen) in this day and age?

260
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,740
If it doesn't feel right, then don't respond and just call!

261
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,480
Wait, I don't have my phone, right?

262
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,950
Anyway, if anything's forced on you, call 119...

263
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,790
Oh, that's right, this is the police station.

264
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,970
Let's discuss the kidnapping of Cheon Song Yi first.

265
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,190
But...how did you do that?

266
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,270
Disappearing right in front of us?

267
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,710
Is it really a supernatural power...?

268
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,470
It's not that, right?

269
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,760
For whatever reason I disappeared,

270
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,060
does that count as breaking the law?

271
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,440
Do you have a specific clause you can apply it to?

272
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,180
As for that, well...
This is a first, so...

273
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,000
If that act (of disappearing) itself isn't breaking the law,

274
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,930
then investigate the specific actions that
pertain to breaking of the law first.

275
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,100
I'm not sitting here to satisfy your personal curiosity.

276
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,040
Do you want some Jjanjjangmyun?

277
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,440
Are you, at least, feeding Do Min Joon 
while you investigate him?

278
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,770
I heard that he refused food.

279
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,100
I won't eat either.

280
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,620
Cheon Song Yi!

281
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,730
You're that detective who came to see me, right?

282
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,440
Yes. Ah, you remember...

283
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,350
Oh yeah, Do Min Joon is inside, right?

284
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,090
--Sunbaenim!
--Hey!

285
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,490
I informed you that I would be joining
 the investigation of Mr. Do Min Joon.

286
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,650
Why did you not get back to me?
 Didn't you hear me?

287
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,310
Well, it's because the Han Guk Hospital is in our jurisdiction...

288
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,650
No, no!

289
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:32,450
You know that the hotel from which Mr. Do Min Joon
 first disappeared, is in my jurisdiction.

290
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,110
AND, this is a split off from my original investigation too.

291
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,040
Well, that is true...

292
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,370
And I have a lot of background information about that guy,
Do Min Joon, you see.

293
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,720
This is a guy whose background I've been digging around in.

294
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,420
This jerk, really...

295
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,600
Look at him eavesdropping...

296
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,310
I'll investigate this, flat out.

297
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,170
So, don't worry and hand the case over 
to our jurisdiction. Okay?

298
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,840
I will go, first, to check if the reporters are there,
 so follow after me.

299
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,650

300
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,100
Excuse me, an autograph, please.

301
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,750
I'm a bit busy right now...
Your name is...?

302
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,280
Are you... really disappearing like that
 using supernatural power?

303
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,180
There's a theory that it was a magic show too.

304
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,810
He isn't a person to give autographs.

305
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,750
If you can't give an autograph, how about a picture...?

306
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,880
Then, maybe a handshake, at least.

307
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,890
Handshake? No, you can't.

308
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,840
Our child saw the video and loved it, so...

309
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,090
- My child thinks you're Superman. 
- You have a child?

310
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,110
You're married.
Go ahead and do it.

311
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,610
Her child likes you, she says.

312
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,430
There are no reporters here.

313
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,920
Ms. Cheon Song Yi, I told you that you can leave now.

314
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,800
I don't want to. I'm going to stay together with him.

315
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,160
We're going for interrogation, not to have fun.

316
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,540
This is not a place where just anyone can come in.

317
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,030
While on our way, we'll drop you off at home.

318
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,460
- No way.
- Cheong Song Yi.

319
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,800
On this issue, no matter what you say,
 I'm not leaving. I'm going to stay by your side.

320
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,440
I will wait in front of the interrogation room.
Since that is up to me to decide.

321
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,740

322
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,760
Do you or don't you know that it's illegal 
to practice medicine without a license?

323
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,610
However, Cheon Song Yi's condition was
 extremely dangerous at the time, and

324
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,150
if her treatment had been delayed even a little,
 she could have been critical.

325
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:55,750
In addition, all is well with Cheon Song Yi,
 who received the procedure.

326
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,550
It was an emergency situation.

327
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,210
And, his actions were not done to make profit.

328
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,640
Then I guess we have to apply mitigating circumstance.

329
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,280
I think we're going to have to.

330
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,370
However, there's still an issue remaining.

331
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,420
What are you going to do about the 'destruction of property
charge' at the restaurant, eh?

332
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,110
A dozen extremely expensive plates were broken.

333
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,300
And that business has experienced a huge loss.

334
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,990
Even so, as no one is reported to be hurt,

335
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,840
couldn't we look at it as a minor offense?

336
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,060
Really?

337
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,570
Wow, Do Min Joon, you are very lucky.

338
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:35,040
If you just make a settlement with the owner, 
you can get off with a monetary penalty.

339
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,290
What else is there?

340
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,050
The assault on Lee Jae Kyeong!

341
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,010
He deserved to be hit though.

342
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,660
What are you doing right now?

343
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,350
Don't you see? We're minimizing the scale of incidents.

344
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,430
Do Min Joon, why did you do it?

345
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,030
What are you referring to?

346
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,680
Throughout the time you lived as Heo Yoon, Han Seo Jin,

347
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,480
and Do Min Joon,

348
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,290
you must have had something you 
definitely wanted to protect.

349
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,310
Why, in a single moment, did you make it all in vain?

350
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,640
I'm curious as to what the reason is.

351
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,230
Don't you two also have

352
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,110
someone precious to you?

353
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,890
It's only that I also have such a person.

354
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:44,190
 The thought that I might lose that person
 simply took me out of my mind.

355
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,810
 I couldn't think of doing any calculation.

356
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,320
 In that moment,

357
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,820
 I only did whatever I could do.

358
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,020
As I reflect upon it, everyone

359
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,940
fights, becomes injured, and suffers loss

360
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,550
in order to protect the person important only to him/her

361
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,510
and is living intensely.

362
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,970
I now have

363
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,010
a person like that, is all.

364
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,100
Is it all over?

365
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,520
Let's go home.

366
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,110
She hasn't come yet. The investigation isn't over yet.

367
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,600
I mean, the reporters are all camping out everywhere,
be it in front of our front door or at the parking lot.

368
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,500
How can they come home without passing through?

369
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,380
Tele-por-tation?

370
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,640
Are you kidding right now? 
There's no way he could really do that.

371
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,090
Anyway, she hasn't come yet,

372
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,490
- and it isn't like they'd come home necessarily... 
- What happened?

373
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,140
--I'm sorry. I couldn't control it well.
--I'm hanging up.

374
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,680
This wench!

375
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,250
-Do Min Joon!
-Min Joon Hyung!

376
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,510
What is it? What is Manager Do's identity?

377
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,510
What?

378
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,320
Even when people went on about it on TV, 
I didn't believe it.

379
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,800
But right now, how did you come in?

380
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,740
I almost had a heart attack, my girl!

381
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,710
Let's talk later. Later.

382
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,330
What are you going to do if he turns out to be weird?

383
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,320
Yoon Jae seemed to know something.

384
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,360
If you don't tell me, I'm going to grill Yoon Jae!
- Mom.

385
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,270
He is the only one in the universe

386
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,910
that I love.

387
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,360
There was no one before him
and there won't be anyone after him.

388
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,060
Though he may not

389
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,720
be an ordinary person,

390
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,370
to me he is just the person I love.

391
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,000
So, give Do Min Joon

392
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,200
something to eat, please.

393
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,340
What did you make?

394
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,370
Ah, you broiled a dried yellow corvina!
Good thing.  My Do Min Joon likes...

395
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,820
Hey, everyone gets one each.

396
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,120
I'm not giving you this because I like you,
but only because it's time to eat.

397
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,860
I'll eat well.

398
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,580
I'll eat well too, Song Yi's mother.

399
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,530
Well...

400
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,810
Do Min Joon, my family gathering and eating together . . .

401
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,940
It's the first in 12 years.

402
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,550
Hey, why are you eating like that?  
Scoop it up by the spoonful!

403
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,640
It's up to me.

404
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,340
Try to enjoy it, Yoon Jae.

405
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,340
Yes, Hyung.

406
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,620
Mom, don't make soup. 
 What's with the seasoning?

407
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,410
I think it's fine. Why?

408
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,890
Why you little unappreciative wench! Always pointing out 
other people's faults when she can't even cook!

409
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,880
Manager Do, how is it?

410
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,430
-Sorry?
-How is the soup?

411
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,570
It's strange.

412
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,860
See! Do Min Joon, don't eat it.  
You'll ruin your appetite.

413
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,920
You know I never eat Mom's soup.

414
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,480
Don't eat it at all!  Ridiculous kids!  Seriously...

415
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,020
It was...

416
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,860
the first time I ate a meal

417
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,390
with people called "family."

418
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:07,700
How did it feel?

419
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,340
I felt like I was relieved

420
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,240
to have people like these

421
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,570
nearby Cheon Song Yi. About that much.

422
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,920
I, too,

423
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,810
wanted to continue being with them.

424
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,430
Well, that sort of thought.

425
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:43,260
Oh my!  It's so late!

426
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,420
You should go before the taxis stop running.

427
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,140
Yes, okay.

428
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,270
Dad will go, my daughter.

429
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,240
Go carefully, Mom.

430
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,550
You want me to leave too?

431
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,370
To do what?

432
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,480
It's not that we're trying to do something. But
it's just that Min Joon Hyung will be inconvenienced is all.

433
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,680
- We'll hang out among ourselves. 
- Why don't you take off with Mom too?

434
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,070
- Me too?
- You're the most offensive.  You are.

435
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,780
- What did I do?
- You keep being covetous with my Do Min Joon!

436
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,470
Why? One should say what should be said.

437
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,740
Is Hyung Min Joon yours?!

438
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,830
Of course, he's mine! Is he yours, then?
 Stop being annoying, hurry up and go.

439
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,580
Who does she take after to be so easy?

440
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,560
Hey, as I see it, you're the one who's acting most covetous.

441
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,590
If a woman does that, she loses her charm!

442
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,620
Forget it. I'm an exception because I'm pretty.

443
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,890
Isn't that so, Do Min Joon?

444
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,480
Yeah. Put that in the middle.

445
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,600
I'm saying you should place the prettiest picture
in the center, huh?

446
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,950
I'm busy. Why are you telling me to come and go?

447
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,370
Aigoo, Mother. I haven't seen you in a while,
 but your face is glowing.

448
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,630
- What's up?
- I've deliberated over this matter.

449
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,160
Our Song Yi.

450
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,060
How we can stage a comeback for Song Yi,
whom I've raised since her time as a child actor?

451
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,860
After sleepless nights and worries,

452
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,880
I have finally decided.

453
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,770
To do what?

454
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,160
Hold onto my hand, and let's go together, Mother!

455
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,990
Go? What nonsense.

456
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:24,080
Where did the President Ahn, who proclaimed
 the contract with Cheon Song Yi is now over, go?

457
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,920
I did? Did I say that?

458
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,120
Where are you going?

459
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,490
I'm busy.  Many agencies are asking to see me.

460
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,800
Don't be like that.

461
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,300
How about we sign the contract with 
the same signing bonus that I originally offered?

462
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,960
Shall we?

463
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,200
And also,

464
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,920
this.

465
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,360
What is this?

466
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,040
A proposal?

467
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,830
Is this my Song Yi's?

468
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,170
Ah, this isn't it.

469
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:58,270
I was wondering if you could pass this on to Do Min Joon. 
 Since I don't have a way to get in touch with him.

470
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,000
What is this?

471
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,980
Are you saying you're trying to sign in Do Min Joon?

472
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,380
Is he some celebrity?

473
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,720
Is being a celebrity the issue right now?!

474
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,640
He's a person that can teleport like "whoosh whoosh."

475
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,500
If we do a world tour magic show just once ...

476
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,430
It will be an incredible "item"!

477
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:21,640
An item?  Is Do Min Joon an item?

478
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,560
I suppose you once thought of my Song Yi as an item, too.

479
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,510
That's why you could keep her when it was good, 
and then abandon her when it was bad.

480
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:34,130
Look for an item when you're playing a game.

481
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:39,110
As for me, I'm going to look for a company 
who will manage a person.

482
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,960
Why is that woman acting so self-righteous all of a sudden?

483
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,270
Mother, did I call her an item?

484
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,580
I made a mistake!

485
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,170
Ay geez, why be so stubborn?  
I said that I'd take you there.

486
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,420
If you were to appear at the set now,
that will cause a complete chaos.

487
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,110
I'll just go and come back quickly.

488
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:04,790
You're not letting me come because you have kissing or
 back-hugging scenes or anything, are you?

489
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,150
It isn't that.

490
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,550
If there's something like that,
 I'm saying tell them that you'll use a stand-in.

491
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,760
- Song Yi!
- Oh, Hui Kyeong.

492
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,000
Aiyoo, my Song Yi!

493
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:24,100
Hey, why does your face look so gaunt?

494
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,200
You must have suffered a lot 
following Do Min Joon around.

495
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,570
What is it?

496
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,220
Oh, I was going to take Song Yi to the set.

497
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,190
I thought it would still be difficult for you to be out now.

498
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,800
There are a lot of watchful eyes, too.

499
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,610
Oh yeah, you lost your cellphone, didn't you?

500
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,490
What is this? 
 I was going to go and buy one today anyway.

501
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,510
I changed your number.  
The last numbers are the same as mine.

502
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,030
That's a good thing. 
I always forget my number anyway.

503
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,940
But I have your number memorized.

504
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,770
I think I forgot my wallet.  Just a minute.

505
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,800
Is this getting to you?

506
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,260
No.

507
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,370
Not at all.

508
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,130
I'm not sitting still because I'm acknowledging you.

509
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,420
It's just that Song Yi likes you so much right now,

510
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,930
so I'm leaving things alone for now.

511
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,980
But

512
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,130
I haven't given up.

513
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,870
If

514
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,480
you suddenly disappear from her side,

515
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,850
or leave her alone,

516
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,850
just know that the place by her side is going to be mine.

517
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,160
At that time,

518
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,530
I'll never let her go.

519
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,570
Song Yi,

520
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,990
about my brother . . .

521
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,610
I know.

522
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,660
I heard.

523
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,970
Making you go through that several times,

524
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,710
I'm sorry.

525
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,540
Hui Kyeong, even though you're smiling now,

526
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,320
there are no words for how you feel, are there?

527
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,870
That's how I feel.

528
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,580
As if nothing's wrong, I eat,

529
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,480
I act in front of cameras,

530
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,140
but there are no words for how I feel.

531
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,090
What's wrong?

532
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,140
It seems like the whole world

533
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,930
is happy except for me.

534
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,130
It's been a long time.

535
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,370
The set is really noisy because of you,

536
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,710
since there are so many reporters.

537
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,590
Well, I am 'hot,' you know.

538
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:03,160
It's not you, but your manager 
that everyone is looking for.

539
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,600
Did Do Min Joon not come?

540
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,700
Don't concern yourself with my man.

541
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,420
Our director's the only one who's benefiting
 from all of this, thanks to that incident.

542
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,920
There are rumors that it was a show to promote our movie.

543
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,640
Thanks to me, it looks like your first leading role 
in a movie is going to do well.

544
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,760
The script was revised suddenly.

545
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,130
Your role has increased by a lot.

546
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,460
Well, you know I'm a scene stealer.

547
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:32,510
I shoot down all rumors about me and steer the focus towards my great acting skills, and in the process, earn more screen time.

548
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,680
Hey. Your acting has been horrible for 15 years. 
How is it possible for it to improve in one day?

549
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,240
It's not because of that. It's because you got a lot
 of sympathy after the Han Yoo Ra case was solved.

550
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,980
And, you have some weird aura of mystery around you
 due to what happened with Do Min Joon...

551
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,580
So you are reading everything about me.

552
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,150
You're reading all the reports about me right now.

553
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,640
I wonder if you didn't leave mean comments
 below the articles.

554
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,710
I'm going to sue all those mean commenters someday.

555
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:03,390
If you don't want to be embarrassed meeting me
at a police station, you'd better stop it.

556
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,010
What did I do?

557
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,480
Do you have some time right now?

558
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,810
No.

559
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:25,430
I wanted to talk to you for a little bit while Song Yi wasn't here.

560
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,380
I see.

561
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,980
I heard briefly from Yoon Jae.

562
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:35,120
It's so ridiculous and it makes no sense.

563
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,520
I mean, an alie...

564
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,770
Is that true?

565
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,830
Yes.

566
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,350
No way!

567
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,130
Manager Do, perhaps...

568
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:50,580
Have you received psychological treatment?
 Is it not something like that?

569
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,620
No, ma'am.  It might be hard to believe,

570
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,820
but it's true.

571
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,970
But your skin isn't coming off.

572
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,480
What about your parents?

573
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,100
I mean, you said that that man wasn't your real father.

574
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,190
Then, what about your real parents?

575
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,490
Do they live on your star?

576
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,790
By chance, is your family planning

577
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,770
to suddenly move here or anything like that?

578
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:29,880
That world is a bit different from here.

579
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,690
So family, friends or spouses . . .

580
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,500
They don't exist.

581
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,240
Okay. I get it.

582
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,370
Go and rest.

583
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,340
Do Min Joon!

584
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:41,500
Where did he go? He shouldn't be out now.

585
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,250
 So, if he doesn't go,

586
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,560
 will he really die?

587
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,020
 How would I know?

588
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:05,390
 There's a plant in his home that
 he's been growing for a long time now.

589
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,870
 But, starting not too long ago,  the root of that plant

590
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,500
 seems to be rotting.

591
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,870
 Are you saying that

592
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,400
 it is related to Do Min Joon?

593
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,820
 I believe so.

594
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,120
Do Min Joon.

595
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,130
What are you doing?

596
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:47,330
Are you already sleeping?

597
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,320
Even though we're in the same house now,

598
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,510
you're not the least bit excited any more.

599
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,100
Is that it?

600
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,070
Do Min Joon.

601
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,450
Don't be like this. Don't scare me like this.

602
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,800
You can't!

603
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,850
You can't!

604
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,340
You can't!

605
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,830
You can't!

606
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,940
Have you regained consciousness?

607
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,540
When you're so loud like this,

608
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,890
how can I not come back to my senses?

609
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,450
I thought that you had died.

610
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:46,930
I thought that you had died.

611
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,520
So...

612
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,640
How many days are left now?

613
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,070
Until the day that you have to leave?

614
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,470
About a week.

615
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,590
It's too short.

616
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:33,250
The days that we have left, we can't waste them

617
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,710
fighting about you leaving or not leaving.

618
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,920
You saw me earlier, right?

619
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:44,000
If you die while being next to me,

620
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,740
I'm going to cry like earlier.

621
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:52,800
For many days and weeks, no,
 many months, no,  many years...

622
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,980
Perhaps, until I die, I'm going to blame myself.

623
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,800
That you died because of me, I'm going to be in pain.

624
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,410
Do you want that for me?

625
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,300
Then, what about me?

626
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:15,610
During all the long, long time,

627
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,760
if I want to see you, what am I to do?

628
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,030
No matter how much time passes, if I can't forget you,

629
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,520
then, what should I do?

630
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,630
We took a lot of pictures together.

631
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:39,150
Can you not take those with you?

632
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,620
Every time I want to see you,

633
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,240
I'll look at your pictures a lot.

634
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,220
I'll listen to the song that you sang for me,

635
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,280
and I'll think of you.

636
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,420
You do that, too.

637
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:13,520
And we still have a lot of time left.

638
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,320
We'll spend a week as if it is like 7 years . . .

639
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,380
As if it's like 70 years . . .

640
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,510
We'll spend the time enjoying it.

641
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,040
In that sense,

642
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,600
do you love me?

643
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,270
Go wash your face. You've become ugly.

644
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,640
So,

645
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,320
was that one week very special?

646
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:14,310
It was more boring and normal than any other week.

647
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,220
That doesn't make sense!

648
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,750
That's home adventure, that is.

649
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,740
Home advantage.

650
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,720
That's right, that.

651
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,100
You can't do anything?

652
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,670
What can I do?

653
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,120
Oh, you can't even do that?

654
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,800
That... that's unfair.

655
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,780
This is not the time to be like this. I'm going to have to order Chi-Mek (shortened abbreviation for Chicken-Mekjoo  ).

656
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,230
I told you not to drink.

657
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,130
Just one glass.

658
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:44,470
You can't. One glass becomes two glasses, 
and two glasses become three glasses.

659
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:47,160
You're going to get drunk when I'm not around
 and go into just anyone's house?

660
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,750
You can't. Use this opportunity to quit drinking.

661
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,490
"Anyway, isn't life a choice?"

662
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:04,740
"I have to decide between that woman and you..."

663
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,970
Why are the lines in this script like this?!

664
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:14,040
Do Min Joon, if I and Lawyer Jang fall into the water, 
who are you going to save first?

665
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,310
What is this out of the blue?

666
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:19,760
Who are you going to save? Choose. 
Huh? Who?

667
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,560
You.

668
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,840
Really?

669
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,330
Lawyer Jang is an ex-Marine.

670
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,720
He would be more than able to swim out.

671
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,170
That's the only reason?

672
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:31,720
It's not because you "something something" me?

673
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,900
What's "something something?"

674
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,760
There are things like that.

675
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,170
That's fine. I feel petty and dirty.

676
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,030
Don't wake me.

677
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,300
Do you want to go eat ice cream?

678
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:51,010
You buy.

679
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,750
It's strange.

680
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,810
Come on, really.

681
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,690
What's strange?

682
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,200
Sam Kwang and Godori. (system of points in Go-Stop game)

683
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,250
Stop.

684
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,120
Something is strange.

685
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,970
You're not using your abilities, right?

686
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,900
I'm the ghost who always wins points. 
How can this be?

687
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,910
Your strength isn't even that good. You're not wasting
 your abilities on things like this, right?

688
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:24,200
It's my skill. I said 'Stop,' so clear your forehead.

689
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,510
Aiyoo, you're really going to hit me?
 (penalty for certain games can be assigned as forehead strikes)

690
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:32,230
How can you hit me so hard like that?!

691
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,820
You watch out today, I'm going to give you a deep kiss.

692
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,110
Get ready to pass out completely today.

693
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,900
 Comet Deep South Comes to Earth Tomorrow.

694
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,440
 'A space show seen once in 400 Years.'

695
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,680
 Do Min Joon.

696
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,690
Yes.

697
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,250
 Come here for a minute.

698
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,210
Omo.

699
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,650
Isn't he the person that was on TV?

700
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:31,270
The one who can teleport?

701
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,020
Really?

702
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,740
Do Min Joon. Where did you go?

703
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,780
I forgot to bring socks.

704
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,940
Aren't your feet cold?

705
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:42,880
What are we going to do? 
That it's so uncontrollable?

706
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,090
How surprised must you have been?

707
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,420
Lawyer Jang.

708
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,020
Yes.

709
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,840
That day too,

710
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,350
I think it was this park.

711
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:58,320
Yes. The day I almost died.

712
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,840
You saved me.

713
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:06,530
After that you bought me a bowl of soup with rice,
 then, you brought me here.

714
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,910
 Buckwheat jelly.

715
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,200
 Sticky rice cake.

716
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,400
 Thank you... for holding onto me.

717
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,040
 I don't know  what kind of abilities you have, but

718
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,520
 you saved me and my mother.

719
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,030
 Please pay it back.

720
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,860
 Seeing that the first resolution you came up with
for lacking money was committing suicide,

721
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,550
 I don't think you are that smart, so

722
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:42,420
  I don't know how on earth 
 you will pass the bar examination.

723
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,670
 But in any case,

724
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,780
 please pay back after you pass.

725
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,110
  How could you (lend me) . . . believing in me for what?

726
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:53,060
  I am not giving it to you because I trust you.

727
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,330
  I don't trust anyone.

728
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,330
  Then, why?

729
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:02,580
 Although I don't want any ties to begin with anyone,

730
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,770
  even so,

731
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,150
  let's think of it as destiny.

732
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,320
  Thank you.

733
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,990
  Thank you, sir.

734
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,890
  Thank you.

735
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:24,840
  Thank you, sir. Thank you.

736
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:36,210
Is it okay for me to touch your hand for once?

737
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,810
Sir, I...

738
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:55,410
don't want to send you away from my side.

739
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,080
You might say that it's ridiculous, but

740
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,480
I truly feel

741
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,350
as if I'm a parent

742
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:08,500
who is sending off a child.

743
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:15,270
Lawyer Jang.

744
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,740
Yes.

745
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,640
A very long time ago,

746
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,580
someone said this.

747
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,390
"Goodbye" is something you say in advance.

748
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:35,340
When the end really comes,

749
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,240
you can't say

750
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,200
things like goodbye.

751
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,280
I am very grateful.

752
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,180
I won't forget you.

753
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,640
Are you okay?

754
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,150
Come here.

755
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:50,230
  ♫ Your fragrance permeates the air ♫

756
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:56,730
  ♫ when I come to the front of your house ♫

757
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:04,610
  ♫ I hesitated a long time. As the first time I held your hand, ♫

758
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:11,100
  ♫ The thrill of that day is still there ♫

759
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,120
We are

760
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,080
getting married today.

761
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,540
What?

762
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,020
We can't get divorced

763
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,520
because you are leaving tomorrow.

764
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,870
Cheon Song Yi.

765
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,700
I won't get a divorce and

766
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,200
you will die if you cheat on me over there. Seriously.

767
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,180
You know a woman's intuition, don't you?
 Just know that a woman's intuition is

768
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,570
more powerful than your supernatural abilities.

769
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:46,300
When you proposed to me, 
you gave me a ring as a gift.

770
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:50,260
Due to rent and utilities, I don't really have money.

771
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:00,010
So, this is my proposal gift . . .

772
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,170
If you watch it now, I will be embarrassed.
 So, look at it later when you are alone.

773
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,130
Watch it whenever you miss me.

774
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:13,680
Watch it until it becomes worn out.

775
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,670
And since you

776
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:23,090
don't seem to have the thought of saying that you love me,

777
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,050
I will even say your part.

778
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,460
I love you, Do Min Joon.

779
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,700
As you live way longer than me,

780
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,890
you will forget eventually, but

781
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:44,080
a perfect woman such as me

782
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,320
really loved you a lot and

783
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,140
liked you.

784
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,680
Don't forget and

785
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,660
feel proud about it.

786
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:07,910
 ♫  Crying like a fool I turn around ♫

787
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:14,260
The greatest power that I possess

788
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,460
is stopping time.

789
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,350
You know how to do that?

790
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:19,930
Of course.

791
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:24,350
I am a much more capable guy than you think.

792
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,090
For an uncountable number of times, I stopped time,

793
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,800
and during those times that you do not know of,

794
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,540
I said this.

795
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,270
"I love you, Cheon Song Yi."

796
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:47,230
Because if I told you while time was flowing by,

797
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,060
I felt that everything would flow away

798
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,960
and disappear.

799
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,010
So...

800
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,020
I told you while time was stopped.

801
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,970
I love you, Cheon Song Yi.

802
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:12,080
I love you.

803
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:18,760

804
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,820
  Hey! Why do I have to hold this kind of thing?!

805
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,960
 Help me to get married.

806
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,470
  ♫ It is a beautiful night. 
We are looking for something dumb to do. ♫

807
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:57,070
  ♫ Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you. ♫

808
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:00,420
  ♫ Don't say no, no, no, no-no. ♫

809
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,840
  ♫ Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah. ♫

810
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:10,330
  ♫ And we'll go, go, go, go-go if you're ready, like I'm ready. ♫

811
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:16,880
  ♫ Cause it is a beautiful night, 
we are looking for something dumb to do. ♫

812
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,750
  ♫ Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you. ♫

813
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:29,480
  ♫ Is it the look in your eyes? 
Or is it these dancing shoes? ♫

814
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:34,220
  ♫ Who cares, baby, I think I wanna marry you. ♫

815
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,710
  Do Min Joon,

816
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,310
  will you marry me?
