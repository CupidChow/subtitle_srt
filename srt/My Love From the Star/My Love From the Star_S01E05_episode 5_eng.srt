1
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,700

2
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,050
♫  Inside the memories of the past    ♫

3
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:58,400
♫ Calling you from inside that pain  ♫

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,860
♫  You are my destiny, you are   ♫

5
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:12,390
♫  You are my destiny, you are   ♫

6
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,460
You're crazy.

7
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,190
- Cheon Song Yi, that's-
- Shhhh . . .

8
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,050
When you come into someone's dream,

9
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,150
you shouldn't talk.

10
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,430
That's right.

11
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,280
During all this time, I was very lonely.

12
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,120
My body was also tired. 
 Now I'm even having erotic dreams.

13
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,910
It's time for me to marry, too.

14
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,450
Hormones don't lie.

15
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:54,670
  ♫ You are my eternal love. ♫

16
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,440
Rascal.

17
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,430
Come into my dream often and 
 give me an arm pillow.

18
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,300
I'm cold.

19
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:16,530
 ♫ I am calling you. ♫

20
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,330
 It ended well.

21
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,270
 No one saw?

22
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,090
 No.

23
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,460
Greed is always a problem.

24
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,090
If she hadn't gotten greedy,

25
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,170
I wouldn't have had to do these tedious things.

26
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,450
I can't believe I dreamed this kind
 of a ridiculous dream.

27
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,170
If it's a dream that I appeared in,
 what sort of a dream was it?

28
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,940
Why do you want to know that?

29
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,930
It seems to have been an erotic dream.

30
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,590
What do I lack?

31
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,720
I'm a woman who even kissed 
Jo In Sung last month.

32
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,430
In a movie.

33
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,930
Did I say anything?

34
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,840
Seems like you know Jo In Sung.

35
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,280
If you know Jo In Sung, why didn't you 
 know Cheon Song Yi?

36
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,500
You, who even have a TV right here.

37
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,230
If you turn on the TV, I show up just like that.

38
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,090
Dramas, CF's . . .

39
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,990
Turn it on and I'm on, so my 
 nickname is 'Faucet.'

40
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,020
I only watch the news.

41
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,640
Oh look, it's the news that you like so much.

42
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,000
 This evening, at 7 pm, a UFO
 appeared over Gwanghwamun.

43
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,910
What the? A UFO?

44
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,660
Oh, complete bullshit.

45
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,720
Wait.

46
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,130
You like this sort of stuff?

47
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,050
UFO's and aliens? That sort of stuff?

48
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,050
Oh my, are you an elementary school kid?

49
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,040
 Description of the flying object
is consistent with a UFO.

50
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,740
 Unlike a regular airplane, 
there was no reflection...

51
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,180
 Gangwon Provincial Office

52
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,870
 A fortnight ago, in broad daylight, 
a large gourd-shaped looking object,

53
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,800
 like a dish or face-washing basin,

54
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
 was flying in the sky and mystifying people,
Lee Hyeog Wook, Gangwon Governor

55
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,840
 Last night, once again, something 
looking like a grain of rice,

56
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,140
 flew across the night sky 
while emitting blue lights.

57
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,050
 The people are uneasy.

58
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,070
 They must have misperceived a bird.

59
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,270
 It wasn't a bird, Sir.

60
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,960
 How can a bird emit lights

61
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,390
 and fly in the sky at such a fast speed!

62
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,110
 So, you officers . . .

63
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,210
 Are you telling me now to inform the King of this?

64
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,080
 Then, you will not?

65
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,010
  Look here, Lord Yoo.

66
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,370
 Right now, in an ordinary night sky,

67
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,110
 suddenly something that looks like a dish,

68
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,420
 a gourd-shaped and wash basin shaped object appeared,

69
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,680
 and was giving off light. Just ... just ...

70
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,330
 and was flying in the sky!

71
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,540
 It's not even a bird!

72
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,250
 How am I suppose to say this to the King?

73
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,430
 Since his reign has only recently started, 
the atmosphere is very strained.

74
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,060
 His Majesty is also very much on edge.

75
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,320
 Sir, this is truly ominous.

76
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,480
 Even more so, the people are uneasy.

77
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,270
 Is is your first day doing business?

78
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,740
 Public sentiment is meant to be turned.
One incident is covered by another incident.

79
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,760
 If there is another more major incident, 
public sentiment will lean towards it.

80
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,490
 It's the eternal truth.

81
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,710
 So, as I was saying,

82
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,390
 is there anything else?

83
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,250
 In our jurisdiction,

84
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,940
 there is a strange rumor going around.

85
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,710
 What is it?

86
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,580
 A child of the Seo Family, who became
 a widow at 15 years old, was sent to Hanyang.

87
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,090
 She recently committed suicide.  
So, her in-laws, to receive the monument of virtuous woman,

88
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,070
  apparently reported it to the court, 
but the child was alive.

89
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,720
 She was seen alive and returning 
to her parents' home,

90
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,370
 together with another man!

91
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,330
 Then, are you saying that she committed a fake suicide
 in order to receive the 'A Virtuous Lady' monument ?

92
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,930
 There are various and great benefits to be 
received along with being granted the monument.

93
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,880
 So, I've even heard of people

94
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,310
 staging a fake suicide.

95
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,590
 If that is true, it will serve dual purposes.

96
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,820
 Listen, Lord Choi!

97
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,090
 Ransack the house of the Seo family,

98
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,970
 arrest and bring the girl who pretended
 to be a virtuous lady.

99
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,520
 How dare you do this?!

100
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,770
 Do you know where you are?

101
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,510
 We heard that your daughter
 is hidden in this house!

102
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,550
 There can be no falsifying a suicide 
in order to claim a false honor and

103
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,430
 besmirching the court and the king with contempt!

104
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,890
 Bring her out immediately!

105
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,900
 My daughter already died.

106
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,730
 Are you trying to dig up the dead child and behead her?!

107
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,860
 Search the house thoroughly!

108
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,110
 If you do find her,
 tie her up and bring her here.

109
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,850
 Yes, sir!

110
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,810
 Wife.

111
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,430
 Sir, our Yi Hwa ...

112
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,820
  Did she run away safely?

113
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,640
 You told me to kill her.

114
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,460
 How could a father kill his daughter?

115
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,270
 I trusted you . . .

116
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,670
 to send our Yi Hwa away to safety.

117
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,090
 She went to the guy she came with.

118
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,920
 She said she cannot let the one 
who saved her die like that.

119
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,810
 Please wake up!

120
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,620
 Weren't you a Grim Reaper?

121
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,140
 Weren't you a goblin?

122
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,410
 How come you're just 
lying down like this?

123
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,220
 Please open your eyes!

124
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,850
 You said you would protect me.

125
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,030
 Sir!

126
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,720
 Move away!

127
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,970
 Go Back!

128
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,620
 No one is inside!

129
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,050
 L..look!

130
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,440
If they're UFO's, as the news say,

131
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,520
why aren't there aliens?

132
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,940
There should really exist the guys like Superman.

133
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,590
Defeating the bad people 
 and helping pititful people.

134
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,170
Why do aliens have to help Earthlings?

135
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,930
It's not their planet.

136
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,190
Do you not know the meaning of an alien?

137
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,710
An intelligent creature that 
may exist outside the earth.

138
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:26,350
Superman is also an alien who came 
 from a planet called Krypton.

139
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,300
Why do they have to risk our lives for strangers
 just because we have powers?

140
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,950
I think extreme altruism is also a mental disorder.

141
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,760
I mean... So what I'm saying is...

142
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,050
You should help yourselves.

143
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,870
Why ask aliens for help?

144
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,500
Are you an alien?!

145
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
- No.
-- Do you have super power?!

146
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,530
That's not possible.

147
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,680
Well then, why do you have such a grim face?!
Did I ask you to help me?!

148
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,000
 Man From The Stars 
Episode 5

149
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,580
 The world is beautiful because of me.

150
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,740
Do you know why I moved here?

151
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,070
So, I can see that spot well.

152
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,500
That's the most expensive spot in this country.

153
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,320
To put an advertisement up there, 
it costs as much as $100,000 . . .

154
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,950
per month.

155
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,930
That's why only the face of the
 current hottest star is put up there.

156
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,420
And now,

157
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,340
that's me.

158
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,160
I didn't know there was even such a thing,
 until today.

159
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,850
It's probably because you're so out of it 
that you didn't recognize me.

160
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,630
It took 12 years for me to get to that spot.

161
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,100
Before I go to sleep . . .

162
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,780
And, when I wake up in the morning too.

163
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:10,360
When I'm depressed . . . 
When I'm hungry, but can't eat anything 
because I'm on a diet . . .

164
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,090
If I look at that,

165
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,410
it makes me feel better. . . 
It also makes me feel kind of full.

166
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,570
Also, when I'm hurt by others.

167
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,630
If I see myself smiling prettily like that,

168
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,680
it comforts me a little.

169
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,090
That's how I am.

170
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,630
Do you want to know the method
 to not be hurt by people?

171
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,190
Don't give or take anything.
 Don't expect anything either.

172
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,390
Then, you won't be disappointed or hurt.

173
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,960
Where is the fun in living then?

174
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,270
You've never had a guest at home, right?

175
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,230
Just by looking at you,
 you don't seem to have friends either.

176
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,370
Do you have a family?

177
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,650
Living like an island like this,

178
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,830
aren't you lonely?

179
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,320
There are over 10 reporters who are
waiting for you in front of your door.

180
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,050
Of all the people living down there, 
more than half of them

181
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,360
would know you well. . .

182
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,280
Your manager, coordinator, fans. . .

183
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,830
There are always a lot of people around you, 
but you are here alone.

184
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Why am I alone? We are here together.

185
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,370
Wow. . . If our photo were taken right now,
 it would be a huge deal.

186
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,490
Aiyoo. . . Fools . . .

187
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,370
Look here!
 Look what Cheon Song Yi is doo~ing right now!

188
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,510
1 meter!

189
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,960
You are so petty . . .

190
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,290
Aiyoo. . . Although, it's the first time meeting you, 
I will eat it well (enjoy the treat).

191
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,160
Don't mention it. Eat a lot.

192
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,030
Thank you.

193
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,830
By the way, nothing's been revealed yet.

194
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,540
It might not be a suicide either. 
Well, let's say it was a suicide.

195
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,990
There are so many female actresses 
who don't get along well with each other.

196
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,010
What kind of idiot would jump into the water just 
because they don't get along with a fellow actress?

197
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,690
Also, that day. . . Han Yoo Ra even
 caught Noh Seo Yeong's bouquet.

198
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,830
Would such a person have wanted to kill herself?

199
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,570
How do you know that? Did you see it?

200
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,520
I didn't see. . . it, myself. But I heard from 
 a person who was invited to the wedding.

201
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:57,450
What's important here is that I'm saying 
 Ms. Cheon Song Yi has nothing to do with this case.

202
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,730
What can we do even if she has 
nothing to do with this?

203
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,520
People want to believe that she's involved.

204
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,380
Aiyoo. . . Are you are a rookie? 
People don't want to know the facts.

205
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,280
They just need someone to blame.

206
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,270
Since someone has to take responsibility
 for this unfortunate incidence.

207
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,180
Then, what about Cheon Song Yi?

208
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,800
If Cheon Song Yi is not at fault, 
what will happen to her?

209
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,590
Who's going to be responsible for that?

210
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,420
You. . . Where are you from, again?

211
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,020
I think I've seen you somewhere.

212
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,050
Well. . . You won't know it.

213
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,050
Yes. . .

214
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,220
Oh! This chicken. . . It looks so delicious.

215
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,490
 Umm!

216
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,690
Lee Hui Kyeong, what is he doing out of the blue 
 eating chicken over there?

217
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,690
Should we order some too?
How about chicken and beer?

218
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,900
When I'm depressed, I always 
eat chicken and beer.

219
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,210
Just go to sleep. Don't be noisy.

220
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,550
By the way. . .

221
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,700
What was that?

222
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,260
Last 3 months or something. . .

223
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,400
I mean, I'm sorry I read your diary by accident.  
But,

224
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,460
are you going somewhere?

225
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,430
Or, do you have an incurable disease?

226
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,170
I said don't ask me any questions, didn't I?

227
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,520
Ah, seriously. . .

228
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,530
I don't know whether I will be able to
 sleep on the sofa.

229
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,400
I mean, I have insomnia.

230
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,390
Just saying, artists are usually like that because

231
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,140
they are naturally sensitive. 
On top of that, it's someone else's home.

232
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,450
I am a bit sensitive changing beds.

233
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,810
Well, you can give me some books.

234
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,510
 Once upon a time, there was a rabbit 
made out of ceramics.

235
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,460
 The rabbit loved the little girl and

236
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,690
 it watched her die.

237
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:32,530

238
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,050
 That rabbit

239
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,940
 swore to not make the mistake of falling in love,

240
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,770
 again.

241
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,970
 I. . . like you, my Lord.

242
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,210
 I want to grow up quickly,

243
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,450
 and become a beautiful young maiden. . .

244
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,670
 I would like to show you, my Lord.

245
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,100
 However, try to answer.

246
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,980
 When there's no love,

247
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,160
 how can a story have a happy ending?

248
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,450
I've looked everywhere!

249
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,080
I looked everywhere yesterday. 
However, there weren't any notes or letters. . .

250
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,170
 What's going on?

251
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,410
 Hello?
Detective Park

252
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,440
 Ms. Han Yoo Seon. 
Ms. Han Yoo Seon!

253
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,320
 Is something there? Did you find something?

254
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,820
Whoa. Ah, Hyung. . .

255
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,650
You are going to work already?

256
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,820
- Did you stay out overnight?
 -- Shhhh. . .

257
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,460
I went to Song Yi's house.
 But there were so many reporters.

258
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,760
She couldn't even come out, but
 there was nothing I could do . . .

259
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,240
I told you. Just wait and see 
since it's being investigated.

260
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,950
If someone recognizes you, it will get even more complicated. Why did you go there?

261
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,500
If, by chance, the investigation reveals it to be
 a suicide, will Han Yoo Ra's death be

262
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,620
attributed to my Song Yi?

263
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,280
Then, what's going to happen to my Song Yi?

264
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
If something does happen to her, 
what do you think you're going to do?!!

265
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,780
Then, I will leave now.

266
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,680
Ah, okay, then.

267
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,060
Then, I will also leave now.

268
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,070
You stay right there!

269
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,520
Why does it involve you whether 
that child is doing fine or not?

270
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,050
What are you going to do about it?!

271
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,950
Honey, this bastard.

272
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,730
3 years ago, when I went to the prosecutor's office, in a wheel chair, to be examined for their investigation,

273
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,660
what was he doing again?

274
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,750
Cheon Song Yi or Man Song Yi, that girl . . .

275
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,230
He was chasing around her tail 
at her photoshoot in Milan.

276
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,610
This boy.

277
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,130
I should have just cut off all ties with him then.

278
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,270
Exactly why do you live like that?

279
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,650
Why?!

280
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,600
It's love, Father.

281
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,320
I normally don't make requests like this. 
But can't you use your influence this time?

282
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,380
Use what?

283
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,830
Is there anything a chaebeol, in Korea,
 cannot get done?

284
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,640
Whether it's using influence/strength, 
money or connections,

285
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,820
please solve this problem with whatever it takes.

286
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,250
I really ...

287
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,120
Thinking about how my girl is having 
 a difficult time,

288
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,680
just hurts my heart.

289
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,920
Ah,

290
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,810
I also think that this is when people use the phrase,
 "My heart feels like it's being torn apart."

291
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,760
So, please think of it as saving your son-

292
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,180
Honey.

293
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,010
Yes?

294
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,290
Bring the new golf club that I bought.

295
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,440
Let us just think of one of our sons as being dead.

296
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Why are you being like this?

297
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,910
You just go upstairs and wash up.

298
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,910
Aigoo, you smell.

299
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,530
I can't leave my Song Yi like this.

300
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,840
How much she must be suffering.

301
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,950
Ah, you smell!

302
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,290
Good morning!

303
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,770
Actually, I guess it can't be a good morning.

304
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,550
You weren't able to sleep because of me
 since your heart was fluttering, right?

305
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,520
If that happened, then sorry. Sorry.

306
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,670
What are you doing right now? It's so scary.

307
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,630
I ate ramen last night, so my legs are swollen.

308
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,930
Do you want to do it together? 
It's the best way to decrease swelling.

309
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:02,760
Only one person slept here last night.

310
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,860
Yet, it looks like a completely different house.

311
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,060
Right? Isn't the atmosphere definitely 
different because a woman is in the house?

312
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,570
You don't really know what it is, but 
there's a refreshing lightness to it, right?

313
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,350
I really detest my house being messy.

314
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,040
Get up right now and clean it up.

315
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,990
Ah, right. 1111.

316
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,210
What?

317
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,470
The password to my house is 1111.

318
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,850
I kept forgetting it, so I changed it to the simplest one,

319
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,300
and now it pops into my brain.

320
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,070
Of course. It feels like my brain is improving 
because the blood is going to my head.

321
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,690
Aish. You're dead!

322
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,950
Hey! Hey! Hey!

323
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,030
Father!

324
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,920
Yes, sir?

325
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,670
I mean, yeah?  I  (using the humble form of speech)  was...

326
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,200
I-I, I came in so suddenly 
without even ringing the bell,

327
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,940
you were really sh-shocked, right?

328
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,390
I came in and you were with a woman.

329
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,580
And, to see that the woman is

330
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:26,610
Cheon Song Yi, I am very taken aback.

331
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,390
Ah, you're his father, I see. 
You were very shocked, right?

332
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,560
I am his next-door neighbor, Cheon Song Yi.

333
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,120
Your son has quite a lot of compassion.

334
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,380
Seeing as how he took me in
 during my difficult situation.

335
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,830
He said he couldn't bear to see 
a neighbor suffering like that.

336
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,130
So he told me to come in for a bit.

337
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,570
There's no need to misunderstand, Father.

338
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,780
Yes, I wouldn't.

339
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,650
But, what's in there?

340
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,150
Ah, this.

341
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,990
This, my wife...

342
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,220
His mom made some side dishes.

343
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,560
Side dishes? What kind of side dishes?

344
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,880
I told you I don't eat with anyone!

345
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,190
Your father came to your home.
 It's your father!

346
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,380
It's all right that you're normally rude, 
but this is nonsense.

347
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,630
Isn't that right, Father?

348
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,260
Well, it does seem that way.

349
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,090
Why don't you eat together with us?
 (talking down)

350
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,160
I don't know how long it's been 
since I've had a home-cooked meal!

351
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,670
I will eat well, Father.

352
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,870
Mother's cooking is amazing!

353
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,420
It's so delicious!

354
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,980
Close your mouth when you eat.

355
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,230
How would I eat with my mouth closed?

356
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,620
Right, Father?

357
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,740
Ah, yes. That's difficult no matter what the situation is.

358
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,310
What's this with  'father' when you just met him?

359
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,020
He's young, so he doesn't know anything.

360
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,870
A friend's dad is my dad, and a 
neighbor's dad is also my dad.

361
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,370
It's all the same.

362
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,900
You haven't lived long enough. You haven't.

363
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,510
I've probably lived longer than you.

364
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:24,010
So, show your ID card, your ID card!

365
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,120
You're not supposed to flip the fish when you eat it.

366
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,290
What?

367
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,130
If you flip over the fish to eat it, 
 a boat at sea will also flip over.

368
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,260
Who says ridiculous things like-

369
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,220
My dad.

370
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,450
So just leave it there and eat it calmly.

371
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,600
Aigoo, will the answer come around
 just because you look at it all night?

372
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,400
I called the CCTV manufacturer.

373
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,060
But they said there's no way to edit the recordings.

374
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,740
It's possible if someone deliberately made
 a backup copy and edited it.

375
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,580
Fabricating the time is also possible.

376
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,900
But the problem is that what we saw is the original.

377
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,650
And it is not possible to do that kind
 of joke on the original.

378
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,960
Well, this or that,

379
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,260
I think the case has been closed.

380
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,840
What?

381
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,570
This is why it's no use just sitting behind your desk.

382
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,810
Instead, you should do the leg-work.

383
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,510
Early this morning, Han Yoo Ra's younger sister, 
Han Yu Sun, found something.

384
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:49,070
And, I just came from there.  This is what came out.

385
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,090
Look, it's a suicide note.

386
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,360
"It is truly a suicide, so why did you 
have to do autopsy against our will?"

387
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,870
I received a lot of hate from her family.

388
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,760
Also, the autopsy results are out.

389
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,290
If you look at the blood test, oh wait, pardon me.

390
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:12,060
That's right. Amitriptyline and Chlorpheniramine.

391
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,390
They said portions of tranquilizers, analgesics, 
and antidepressants were detected.

392
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,270
It's also true that she was prescribed and 
had been taking them all along.

393
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,770
Also, the blood levels did not pose a danger to her, so they say that it's unrelated to her death.

394
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,090
It's confirmed that the direct cause of death is by drowning.

395
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,900
Moreover, the suicide note is right here.

396
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,500
It's "game over" now.

397
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,080
First, request a handwriting analysis by the
 National Forensic Service.

398
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,880
Until the results come out,
 keep this secure from the media.

399
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,570
Do you think her family will stay still?

400
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,170
The younger sister was going crazy

401
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,490
saying it was her older sister's handwriting for sure.

402
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,370
Everything is matching up perfectly.

403
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,860
I think it's weird because everything
 is getting pieced together so perfectly.

404
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,500
Even up to yesterday, you said that there
 was nothing, such as a note, found.

405
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,350
So are you suspecting homicide right now?

406
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,790
Usually, when you suspect homicide,

407
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:07,910
you have to wonder and look for

408
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,650
who would benefit from that death.

409
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,460
But, there is no such person in this death.

410
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,830
With Han Yoo Ra's death,

411
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,070
there is no person who would benefit.

412
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,430
That is all.

413
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,190
Yes. You've prepared well.

414
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,160
'2014 Five Western European Nation Information
 and Business Plan Research Data'
 Until when will CSY keep silent?

415
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,030
This is a great amount of research done.

416
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,420
Who did this all?

417
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,800
Ah, yes. I...

418
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,480
Damn.

419
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,580
I received a lot of assistance from Lee Hui Kyeong.

420
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,470
Assistant Manager Jo, I understand that Lee Hui Kyeong has only been working at the office for 15 days.

421
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,620
I really received a lot of help within those 15 days.

422
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,490
Aigoo, our Lee Hui Kyeong.

423
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,390
Is there something difficult going on? 
Your expression doesn't look so good.

424
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,980
No, it's fine.

425
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,950
But I haven't seen Chief Yoo Joon Sang at all these days.

426
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:20,410
Ah, Chief Yoo was transferred by me to 
a far distant region of Gyeongnam.

427
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,210
And also because there was that
 disgraceful incident from last time.

428
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,920
Pardon?

429
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,660
But, why?

430
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,110
Nothing, nothing.

431
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,770
From the start, he didn't know his place,
 so I thought I should put him in his place for good.

432
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,560
I had been thinking about that.

433
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,130
Anyway, if you're ever having a hard time 
with anything, be sure to tell me whenever.

434
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,460
And if there's someone who gets in your way,

435
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,230
be sure to tell me. 
Fighting.

436
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,750
Fighting.

437
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,670
Chief Yoo seemed like a nice guy.
 It's a great pity.

438
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,080
Normally, when the family of the deceased 
doesn't want an autopsy and

439
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,150
there is sufficient evidence, they would 
have concluded it as a suicide. But,

440
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,870
I hear he's a newly appointed prosecutor . . .

441
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:07,810
It seems he is snooping around not knowing
 what to do, but he won't be able to find any other clues.

442
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,380
What's that prosecutor's name?

443
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,100
Our Prosecutor Yoo Seok?

444
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,540
Did you stay up the whole night?
 Your face looks so much skinnier.

445
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,080
I'm fine.

446
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,830
That's why I told you to just be an announcer.

447
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,870
Your face is exactly an announcer-type face.

448
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,840
After watching your father your whole life, 
you still want to be a prosecutor?

449
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,740
I have to go back to work again as soon as I change, Mother.

450
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,060
So what's this first case you're in charge of?

451
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,780
Oh, it's the actress Han Yoo Ra's case.

452
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,830
What? Really?

453
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,100
Hey! Why are you only telling me that now?

454
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,560
Why is our mom so loud again?

455
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,610
Hey, your brother is like this. Your brother is in 
charge of Han Yoo Ra's suicide case.

456
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,940
It hasn't been confirmed to be a suicide.

457
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,990
Why not? That's what everyone on television is saying.

458
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:07,540
That's why Cheon Song Yi is being cursed at
 every which way now.

459
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,630
How do you think it'll turn out?

460
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,750
Since the investigation is on-going, 
I can't tell you right now.

461
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,790
What does it matter when it's between family?

462
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,900
Only mom will know about it. You know that your 
mom can keep her secrets well, right? What is it?

463
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,480
I can't tell you, Mother.

464
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:33,550
That night was absolutely crazy! 
The lighting stands were broken, too!

465
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,740
Those two fought physically?

466
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,380
Yes! Right?

467
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,270
Didn't the light stand break because
 Cheon Song Yi pushed Han Yoo Ra?

468
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,710
Oh, right. I think that's how it happened.

469
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,170
What is "I think that's how it happened?" 
Is that how it really happened or is it not?

470
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,140
We were in the makeup lounge, 
so we came out afterwards ...

471
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,430
Then you didn't see it for yourselves. If so, how can you be interviewed on TV, as if you actually saw the occurence?

472
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,090
Can we see the CCTV recording?

473
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,970
What is this? The one throwing stuff 
was Han Yoo Ra.

474
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,070
The lights broke by themselves, too.

475
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,960
It's him, right? That guy...

476
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,610
Toothbrush, floss, hand cream...

477
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,770
False eyelashes?

478
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,640
And, this is why I'm asking why she 
would need these things at home.

479
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,130
Do they even sell cell phone chargers in places like this?

480
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,660
What is it?

481
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:34,720
Is this the tuna you told me to buy earlier?

482
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,750
OH, honey, should I buy Yang Jo 
soy sauce or Joseon soy sauce?

483
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,020
All right, Honey.

484
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,540
What is it that you want to say?

485
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:49,640
I just think that you two have gotten closer during this time.

486
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,280
Well, honestly, I've known you for over 30 years.

487
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,690
But isn't today the first time we've
 ever had a meal together?

488
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:02,210
I think you've misunderstood.  I wasn't doing 
that because I had other intentions.

489
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:05,210
I simply wanted to confirm it.

490
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,570
I wanted to see if there really was a connection between Yi Hwa and that person or if they merely looked alike.

491
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,460
It's really no more or no less than-

492
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,730
False eyelashes, over there.

493
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:32,930

494
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,440
How can you only tell us now?

495
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,510
We'll go right now. Please text me first.

496
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,670
Oh, you're here?

497
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,610
I told you not to do that; the thing that
 makes you look like some upside-down ghost.

498
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,830
You bought the cell phone charger, right?

499
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,690
Okay.

500
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,360
- Are the reporters still outside?
- Huh?

501
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,770
How many?

502
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,310
Well, just a few.

503
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:29,130
Ugh, it's like those people have no home.

504
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,710
Aigoo, I can't even go outside. 
Agh, I'm so frustrated, I could die.

505
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,210
Where are you going?

506
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,650
What do you mean where?

507
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,650
I want to see how our nation's goddess 
has fared through the night.

508
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,510
In the night, I'm mysteriously sexy, 
but in the during the day time, I'm simply innocent.

509
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,610
Do you want to see it together?

510
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,660
That broke.

511
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,920
Why did it suddenly break?

512
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,390
Why are you standing there and looking at it?
 Hurry and clean it up.

513
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,220
What if I step on the broken glass.

514
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,000
Me?

515
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,200
Yup. And be sure to wear rubber gloves, too.

516
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,480
Aren't you getting a text?

517
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,100
Oh, I can just look at that later. 
It's because I turned it off yesterday.

518
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:23,020
Since it's noisy, just answer the phone.

519
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:27,090
Are you my mother-in-law? 
You sure do interfere a lot.

520
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:35,400
Yeah, Beom. I didn't have any charge
 left on my battery.

521
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,460
What is it?

522
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,890
 I think Han Yoo Ra's younger sister revealed
 the suicide note she found.

523
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:44,930
 The prosecutor's office says it can't be confirmed yet, 
but the reporters are already going crazy.

524
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,080
 At this rate, it seems like it's going to be laid all on you.

525
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,230
 What should we do?

526
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,710
For now, let's hang up.

527
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,950
What is it?

528
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,140
I'll be going.

529
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,650
I have something to say to the reporters.

530
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,100
I'm going to tell them that it's not because of me.

531
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,890
Why do I have to hide here? 
What wrong did I do?

532
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,490
Are you okay?

533
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,260
Of course I'm okay. Why? 
Because it's not my fault.

534
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,970
Heaven knows, earth knows, I know.

535
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,830
And, even the dead Han Yoo Ra knows.

536
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,060
So it's fine.

537
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,220
It's not that.

538
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,050
Don't move.

539
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,510
It really can't be because of me, can it?

540
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,310
If it's really because of me, what do I do?

541
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,680
It's not because of you. 
So, don't think weird things.

542
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,550
Don't move a muscle and just stay put.

543
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,420
I said let's rest a little, first.

544
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,150
This isn't a bad place. Can you not believe me?

545
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,780
I'm sorry. I have to go to academy.

546
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,840
Hey, kids. Are you going to come in or not?

547
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,450
Wait a moment. I'm talking right now.

548
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:37,790
Because of you. . . Multiplication, division, and whatnot. I can't concentrate on anything these days.

549
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:43,170
I...Do I like you? 
 ♬  I regret that I turned away from you.  ♬

550
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,840
I'm sorry. I can't accept your feelings.
 ♬  I was too young back then.  ♬

551
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,940
Right now, I have to go finish my workbook and 
I've procrastinated on writing my diary for 3 days.

552
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:55,650
And I even have to copy what I got wrong on my test 100 times. It's not time for me to worry about trivial things like love.

553
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:04,760
♬  I’m saying that I can only seeyou,
 I’m saying that I love you.  ♬

554
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,580
Cheer up.

555
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,590
Is life this difficult, Noona?

556
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,830
- How about jjajangmyun for today? 
- Nah, jjamppong is better.

557
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,740
Jjamjjamyun?
 (Half jjajang and half jjamppong)

558
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,830
If you want to live comfortably, 
then it can be totally comfortable.

559
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:28,450
But if you want to live the hard way, 
then it can be extremely hard.

560
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,040
Give me a saline solution to disinfect a wound, 
an irrigation syringe,

561
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,490
and alcohol (ethanol) and betadine, please.

562
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,240
Also, give me some sterilized gauze and cotton. 
Oh, do you have transparent films?

563
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,430
If you don't, give me hydrocolloid bandages.

564
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:44,340
Can you please speak slowly?

565
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,470
A saline solution to disinfect the wound.

566
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,540
 I'm comfortable if I live loving myself.

567
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:56,430
 But if I start liking someone else, 
life becomes difficult and complicated.

568
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,410
Why is there so much stuff? 
All I need is a band-aid.

569
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,360
We have to disinfect it.

570
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,370
Disinfect?

571
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,820
Hey!

572
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,640
Give it to me!

573
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,790
It's all done.

574
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,180
And,

575
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,750
the reporters are gone.

576
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,140
Thanks for letting me sleep here.

577
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:57,060
And, also for telling me that it's not because of me.

578
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,970
 It hits you like that at once. Puff.

579
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,930
It's usually like that.

580
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,020
There is no time to prepare your mind.

581
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,840
Suddenly, randomly, absurdly,

582
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,640
it just hits you.

583
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,520
Noona, how do you know that so well?

584
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,980
Anyway, I know how you feel.

585
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,290
First love is usually the most perplexing.

586
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,680
It's like, "Did I eat something wrong?"

587
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,500
"Am I crazy?"

588
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:05,210
♫  If I'm allowed once again

589
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,470
♫  If I could see you again,

590
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:19,580
♫  In my past memories,

591
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,670
♫  Within that pain,

592
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:28,150
♫  I call you.

593
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:35,300
♫  You are my destiny, you are.

594
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:43,120
♫  You are my destiny, you are.

595
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,270
♫  You are my everything.

596
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:58,150
♫  While only looking at you, 
I call out to you silently.

597
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:05,620
♫  You’re the one my love, you are.

598
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:13,090
♫  You’re the one my love, you are. ♫

599
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,600
Am I nuts?

600
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,770
What am I doing?

601
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:24,510
♫  You are my love.   ♫

602
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,250
We really didn't say anything.

603
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,480
We were playing amongst ourselves.

604
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,860
Just putting up comments on the internet.

605
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,700
When you were quietly putting up comments 
online amongst yourselves,

606
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,860
the PC room part-timer just attacked and hit you?

607
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,360
- All 3 of you like this?
 -- Yes.

608
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,300
That's why it's absurd. 
What did he say while he was beating us up?

609
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,980
"What do you know about Cheon Song Yi?"

610
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,460
That's what he said.

611
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,580
He must be Cheon Song Yi's die-hard fan.

612
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,240
Name.

613
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,790
You don't have a name?

614
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,580
Are you really Cheong Song Yi's die-hard fan?

615
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:01,420
What do you intent to do 
by glaring at me like that?

616
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,850
Why did you do it?

617
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:07,810
Was it really  because you didn't like hearing 
Cheon Song Yi being cursed at?

618
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,740
He's young, young.

619
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,370
Why would you fight for a celebrity?

620
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,300
The Cheon Song Yi  that you like . . .

621
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,530
Well, she's 'out' now.

622
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,080
I heard she had a cat fight at a hair salon
 because of a man.

623
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,210
Just with a glance, one can see that 
she seems to have a bad personality.

624
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,990
Anyway, parenting is important.

625
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,980
You shouldn't say such things.

626
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,840
Who are you?

627
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,870
I will allow that these kids can say such
 absurd things because they are immature.

628
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,590
But, you, who is old enough to know better, 
shouldn't say such things.

629
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,240
What do you mean she had a cat fight
 at a hair salon because of a man?

630
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,970
Did you see it? Do you have evidence?

631
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,900
Isn't this equivalent to a misuse 
of governmental authority

632
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,320
and spreading a false rumor, right now?

633
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,730
I asked who you are.

634
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,450
Cheon Song Yi's die-hard fan.

635
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:16,410
My "fu-bro", have you had dinner?

636
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,670
- Fu-bro?
-- Future brother-in-law.

637
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,250
Your mum called.

638
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,980
Mother asked me to come here instead of her, 
because her face is known to the public.

639
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,820
It would be troublesome if someone recognized her.

640
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,640
Wise up. My mom has another secret intention.

641
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,170
- And, what's that? 
-- She's trying to set you up with my sister, no matter what.

642
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,910
That's a very joyful secret intention to hear.

643
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,480
Don't misunderstand.

644
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,120
If you weren't a son of a chaebol, 
you wouldn't have had a chance.

645
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:51,070
That's why it's such a relief that I'm the 
son of a chaebol household.

646
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:54,160
My family. . . 
I don't think we will go bankrupt easily.

647
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,270
Then, Mother will keep liking me.

648
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,190
You know your sister's having a hard time, right?

649
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,920
I will take care of Mother and
 my future brother-in-law.

650
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,800
So, if there's any problem, 
tell me everything. Okay?

651
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,020
Really! I said, don't!

652
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,110
Ah, that punk.

653
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,300
Yoon Jae! Let's go to eat dinner!

654
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,800
Eat a lot, okay? I only had a short time to prepare.
So there's not much.

655
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,370
No, not at all! 
I'll eat well, Mother.

656
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,710
Did you cook for a feast?

657
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:31,160
Do we have something to celebrate or something?

658
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,110
I talked to my Song Yi earlier on the phone.

659
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,810
She sounded so weak. . .

660
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,810
I asked her, 
"Shall I make some porridge and bring it to you?"

661
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:45,300
She said she'd like to rest today.

662
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,150
Starting tomorrow, she said that she'll 
resume her normal schedule.

663
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,160
Already? She should rest a little longer...

664
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,290
She has a strong sense of responsibility.

665
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,030
Things Song Yi has inherited from me . . .

666
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,200
It isn't just the beauty.

667
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,380
Strong mind.

668
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,150
She got that from my side, too.

669
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,800
Hey, Yoon Jae...

670
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,490
I know my daughter well.

671
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:17,900
Even if she acts strong, 
she's really frail on the inside.

672
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,050
I know.

673
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,500
I'm saying that this is an opportunity.

674
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,440
What?

675
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,830
Aiyoo, seriously. . . 
You are so innocent. What should I do?

676
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,790
A woman is meant to be swayed by a man who holds out his hand when she's going through the hardest time.

677
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,750
"Even if everyone in the world is against me, 
this man will protect me."

678
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,960
Then the heart is meant to rush towards that person.

679
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:46,070
So, this is a golden opportunity.

680
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,600
Understand?

681
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,410
 Hae Shin Cosmetics called and said that they're 
cancelling today's CF (commercial film) shooting,

682
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:17,450
 which was scheduled for this morning.

683
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,230
 I'm going mad.

684
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,540
 After pestering us for her to model,

685
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,650
 how much did we raise their sales? 
And, they are cancelling on us now?

686
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,610
These jerks! I mean why-

687
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:35,710
Why did you come out so soon?
 You should have rested a little longer...

688
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,030
I have the Hae Shin Cosmetics CF shoot
 scheduled for this morning.

689
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,220
That...

690
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,310
- Tell them I can't do it.
 -- What?

691
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,350
Magical cream, my ass. . .

692
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,350
I've used it myself.

693
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,470
My face felt dry.

694
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:58,430
- Dry? 
- Seriously dry.

695
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:03,720
Are you saying that I should hold such a low quality thing 
and say "It feels so moist" now?

696
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,490
I shouldn't do that to people, who are trusting me, 
to go buy this product, should I?

697
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:10,000
You shouldn't do that.

698
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,230
Tell them clearly,

699
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:16,400
to not even dream of me modelling for their shabby products.

700
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,480
That I'm not filming that CF.

701
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,020
I...

702
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,060
cancelled on them.

703
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,380
By the way, Unni, 
the main character is set to be a poor orphan.

704
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,730
She's even kicked out of her house because
 she can't afford the monthly rent.

705
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,100
Don't you think you look a bit luxurious?

706
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,980
Hey, you should get over your prejudice. 
Can't an orphan wear pretty clothes?

707
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,220
Also, why do you think this character is unable to pay her monthly rent when she has so many part-time jobs?

708
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,060
It's all because of the clothes and bags.

709
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:49,050
But, while they're preparing, the whole day
 will be gone. What are they doing?

710
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,770
Does this make any sense? 
We didn't receive any phone call!

711
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:55,330
We couldn't tell you in advance.
They've only just made the decision.

712
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,190
But she's the main character! 
Without even a not-

713
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:59,640
You're too much!

714
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,730
What wrong have I done?

715
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,690
I'm just a person who relays what the higher up's decide.

716
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,060
So, what. How are you going to take care of this matter?

717
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,400
Last week, that scene where she made a surprise announcement that she's going to study abroad-

718
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,060
So. . . You're going to handle it by making it
 as if she's gone to study abroad?

719
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,610
That's what I think will happen.

720
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,400
Tell her well, please.

721
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,240
How do I tell her something like that "well"?!

722
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,470
How is that something to say "well"?!

723
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,520
I don't know!

724
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:35,430
Beom, start the car.

725
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:38,500
I read the script. Is the author having
 family trouble or something?

726
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,070
Why is the condition of the script like that?!

727
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:47,380
Are you telling me to act from that miserly script?

728
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:51,250
Go and give the this message,
 "Cheon Song Yi can't do this drama."

729
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:55,280
"Cheon Song Yi, rejects this drama."

730
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,180
You, go back in and tell them clearly.

731
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,640
I won't be going to this salon again.

732
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,850
I rejected them.

733
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,070
I won't do a pictorial with that photographer ever again.

734
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,350
Don't follow us and go tell him again.

735
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:19,660
"I am not doing it. I'm rejecting it."

736
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,830
Is there anything else to reject?

737
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:27,620
After rejecting all day long,
 I'm so hungry that I could die.

738
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,100
I don't have any appointments tomorrow, right?

739
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,390
Yes.

740
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,200
That's good. There's no schedule.

741
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,230
Go and order chicken and beer.

742
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,940
If you order now, it should arrive by the time I arrive.

743
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,590
Yes.

744
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:47,680
Hello. This is Golden Palace A #2301.

745
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,220
Chicken and beer. . .

746
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,210
Ah. . . You can't?

747
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,350
I understand.

748
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,300
Why? Was it rejected?

749
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,980
Was I just rejected by chicken, too?!

750
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,400
Why? Are they saying they can't sell
 to a person like me?!

751
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,370
No, it's not like that.

752
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,430
They have orders that are backed up. So, right now. . .

753
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,930
They can't (deliver).

754
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:19,610

755
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,440
So, it was Cheon Song Yi?

756
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,840
Don't eat, you have a shoot tomorrow.

757
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,050
You got my text, right?

758
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:54,430
My brother is the prosecutor in charge.

759
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:58,420
There's nothing that's been confirmed, they say.

760
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,160
After the investigation, it will all pass.

761
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,380
Thank you. I have no one else other than my friend.

762
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,860
Isn't everyone being too much?

763
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,390
Even if the public sentiments aren't good, how could they cut off the leading lady just like that?

764
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,050
What are they trying to do?

765
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,820
 Se Mi, there's something I have to urgently discuss 
with you regarding a change to the lead actress role.

766
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,650
 Can you come into the broadcast station?

767
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,010
Why? What message is it?

768
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,930
Yeah.

769
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:33,040
My mom fell on a patch of ice.

770
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,700
She fractured her ankle.

771
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,020
Hey, then you should go quickly.

772
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,110
Let's go.

773
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,650
I could hear the other table talking crap about me, which has been bothering me anyway.

774
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:50,190
I was supposed to sleep over at your place. I'm sorry.

775
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:51,860
Will you be okay alone?

776
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,550
Of course, let's go.

777
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,870
 Oppa Jae Kyeong

778
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,430
 Jae Kyeong Oppa?

779
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:13,500
Yes, Song Yi. Where are you?

780
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,470
Are you at home?

781
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:16,200
Yes.

782
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,650
What's the matter, at this late hour?

783
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,250
I heard you moved to Gold Palace.

784
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,640
I heard from Hui Kyeong.

785
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,670
Yes, that's right.

786
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,740
My friend's house is in the same building.

787
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,910
Since I'm stopping by for some business, 
I figured I should come by and see you too.

788
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,380
Then, can you wait for a bit?
I will come down.

789
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,000
No.

790
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,660
Your house is #2301,

791
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,210
right?

792
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,110
But then, how did you know about my house?

793
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:48,560
You said that reporters were camping out
 in front of your house a few days ago.

794
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,680
So, everyone, in the neighborhood,

795
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,540
knows your house.

796
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,410
Naturally, so does my friend.

797
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,520
That's right. I guess so.

798
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,170
Can I have some coffee when I go?

799
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:04,560
I have something I must say.

800
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,880
Mr. Do Min Joon.

801
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:32,530
Yes, who are you?

802
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,890
I'm from the Yeongdeungpo Police Station.

803
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:36,820
What's the matter?

804
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,090
Ah. Yes.

805
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,000
You've heard of the case on the death
 of actress Han Yoo Ra, right?

806
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,350
I have something to ask you about the case.

807
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:47,600
You should be summoned as a witness, but

808
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,630
this case is very urgent.

809
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:51,540
There's no time.

810
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,130
It will be quick. Let's talk.

811
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:59,310
I understand.

812
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,700
Where do I need to go?

813
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,670
I hear you are a professor.

814
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,630
I'm a lecturer.

815
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:18,060
Aren't all college teachers, professors?

816
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:22,110
I stopped by your school this morning 
to check on various things.

817
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:26,810
But, then I heard you're not taking on 
any classes for the next term.

818
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,310
Are you going somewhere?

819
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:29,920
It's a personal matter.

820
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,090
Ahhh. . .

821
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,190
But I heard you went to Harvard.

822
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:40,480
It's my first time riding with a person from Harvard.

823
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,460
Wow.

824
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:01,480
This chronic traffic jam...

825
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:33,890
Can I come in?

826
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:38,630
Of course, come in.

827
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,790
But then let me ask you this?

828
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:55,590
Where were you on the day of Han Yoo Ra's accident?

829
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,650
How were you able to board the cruise boat,

830
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:00,860
without an invitation?

831
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,920
He's the culprit, alright! Hey!

832
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,260
Mr. Do Min Joon!

833
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:22,920
 When they get a picture of this,
it'll be a really big hit. Fools.

834
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:30,320
 Over here! It's Cheon Song Yi! 
I'm doing thi~is!

835
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,600
 1 meter!

836
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,020
 So petty!

837
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:45,510
 If it's 1 meter, you can come closer than that.

838
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:48,700
 Ah, I don't know whose house's daughter that is,

839
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,220
 but she's pretty!!

840
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,920
 Really pretty.

841
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,950
 How can she look like that.

842
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,050
 Don't you see my child is getting hurt?

843
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,440
 What are you doing now?

844
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,250
 Hide only if you have done something wrong.
Don't hide just any time.

845
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,380
 Can't you consider having two jobs?

846
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,420
 How about being my manager?

847
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:21,130
 I don't know what you're thinking 
regarding my Song Yi, but don't do it.

848
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:23,080
 Cheon Song Yi is my woman.

849
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,090
 If the time comes that I'm ready to leave. . .

850
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,520
 I thought I would be able to leave without any regrets.

851
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,110
 But there is one remaining person.

852
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:31,530
 The person that I thought had forever 
disappeared.

853
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,750
 After roaming through this long lifetime, 
in front of me...

854
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:37,320
 Can it be that she's appeared again?
