00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,780
She wore the shoes to the cruise at last?

3
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,460
Yes.

4
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,110
Why are you here?

5
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,280
It’s okay if you don’t go?

6
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,440
Lawyer Jang.

7
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,020
Yes.

8
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,630
I’ve lived here for 400 years

9
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,640
and met a lot of things,

10
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,310
including some unimaginable and shocking events.

11
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,330
Mother, father.

12
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,490
I’m back.

13
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,380
Mother.

14
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,580
Miss Seo.

15
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,450
Master, Miss Seo is back.

16
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,680
The deceased Miss Seo is back.

17
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,510
Master, please come and look.

18
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,810
Master.

19
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,720
Mother.

20
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,650
What’s going on?

21
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,600
I thought you were dead and prayed for you.

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,120
Let me take a look at you.

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,440
Mother, I was almost dead.

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,940
The husband’s family intended to kill me

25
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,870
just for the paragon monument.

26
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,260
Oh my god!

27
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,670
Did you get hurt?

28
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,600
No, father, I’m fine.

29
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:03,770
The man over there saved my life

30
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,010
and sent me back.

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,720
Thank you for helping and saving my daughter.

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,310
Take the house as your home

33
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,380
and please enjoy.

34
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,320
Mother.

35
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,909
Why?

36
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:43,990
You’d better die instead of being alive impurely

37
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,920
with the fame of the family ruined.

38
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,200
You shouldn’t have returned.

39
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,140
Mother.

40
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,170
Die.

41
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,490
Anyway, I’ve considered you as being dead.

42
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,660
Please die.

43
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,800
Help. Help.

44
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,280
Run for your life.

45
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,550
Go.

46
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,659
We both will die if your father comes back.

47
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:45,990
I asked him to let me kill you if he has to.

48
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,520
Go quickly.

49
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,100
Find a place and conceal your identity.

50
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,970
Mother.

51
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:08,900
It’s all because you took a man back.

52
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:16,030
Family honor is more important than his children.

53
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,050
Why don’t you understand?

54
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,780
He’s just the one who saved my life.

55
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,850
Mother, how is he?

56
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,780
Why is he still alive? What’s going on?

57
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,550
Nobody can alive

58
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,900
after having the food contained arsenic.

59
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,120
But he doesn’t die?

60
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,370
We don’t know why.

61
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:17,950
As time goes by, the pain you thought

62
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,550
you’d never forget also has gone.

63
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,720
I didn’t live that long, so I have no idea about it.

64
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,940
I have another thought about life.

65
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,130
Human beings try very hard to live

66
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,130
although they know they will die and leave one day.

67
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:45,130
While in love, they take the day as the last day.

68
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,860
This is mankind.

69
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,560
As time goes by, things may become better.

70
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,000
People may forget this kind of thing.

71
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,580
However, the result is important,

72
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:06,120
but the present is also important.

73
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,990
If something really happens,

74
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,950
you sure you’ll let it be?

75
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,520
Cheon Song-yi became famous since the ad.

76
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,970
She made her debut

77
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,890
in historic play which is even hard for adult actors.

78
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,450
She acted the childhood of the leading role

79
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,000
at her early age but with mature image,

80
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,290
thus was called the most promising new star.

81
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,220
All TV series and films she played

82
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,110
had extraordinary audience rating.

83
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,290
She’s been the National Goddess for a long time.

84
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,190
First love?

85
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,100
It’s really not a good question.

86
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,420
About first love…

87
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,820
I had a few dates,

88
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,730
but no one can be called first love.

89
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,470
There was an accident when I was young.

90
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,220
An uncle saved me.

91
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,290
But I can’t remember his face.

92
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,120
He’s tall and warm.

93
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,670
The greatest one.

94
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,000
It’s a very short moment,

95
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,910
but it’s mysterious and soft.

96
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,400
I still remember him.

97
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,420
Maybe he remembers me, too.

98
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:57,030
I can recognize him once I see him.

99
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,360
It’s like destiny.

[60 hours later]

During the cruise party, top actress was missing.

The whole country has been shocked for four days.

103
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,590
Four o’clock this afternoon, Han-kang Team

104
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,450
found a corpse at south Seo-kang bridge.

105

They’re confirming its identity.

106

[My Love from the Star Record 4]

108

Is the identity confirmed?

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,330
It’s under investigation.

110
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,880
Okay. Well.

111
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,510
Please excuse us.

112
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,720
Obviously, it’s suicide.

People at site said

117

she was very drunk.

118
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,800
There is no doubt that the top actress

119
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,250
committed suicide after drunk

120

The detective is new and energetic.

123

He may intend to try hard to investigate.

124
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,430
Why did it happen within my jurisdiction?

125
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,450
I really can’t handle these reporters.

126
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,120
We have to solve the case soon.

127

What are you doing?

128

Yes.

Nice to meet you. I…

I know you are Detective Yoo Seo.

However, it’s better to close the case quickly.

Also her families didn’t want an autopsy.

It’s obvious.

According to my experience…

140
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,320
Check the CCTV first.

00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,470
S&C Group only has two sons, right?

174
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,430
You and Hee-kyung.

175
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,540
I won’t marry her.

176
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,770
I even don’t know who she is.

177
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,980
Han Yoo-ra is a model of our department store

178
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,590
I only met her once.

179
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,860
Really?

180
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,770
I know she was lying.

181
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,640
She is really good at lying.

182
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,430
It’ll be better if she has good acting skills.

183
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,220
People are looking at you.

184
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,010
There are many rumors about you and Han Yoo-ra.

185
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,890
Those are truth.

186
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,130
Where is the bride lounge? I’d take a look.

187
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,590
Soo-yeong.

188
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,240
Hello.

189
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,400
Haven’t you been busy with the wedding?

190
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,740
How did you have time for plastic surgery?

191
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,730
I really should learn from you.

192
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,580
It’s a small surgery. Is it okay?

193
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,580
Too young. Maybe Soo-ji wants to be your friend.

194
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,680
Really?

195
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,740
Congratulations, Soo-yeong.

196
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,590
Thank you.

197
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,720
I will get your bouquet.

198
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,440
But I agreed Na-rin to give it to her.

199
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,260
She broke up with her boyfriend.

200
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,360
How about you? Dating someone?

201
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,620
Getting married?

202
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,270
We will let off fireworks tonight.

203
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,760
Oh.

204
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,360
Surprise

205
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,410
coming soon.

206
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:22,010
Why are you catching people’s eyes
on others’ wedding?

207
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,440
You have to wear shoes similar to mine?

208
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,230
It’s not similar.

209
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,000
Mine is the first pair all over the country.

210
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,980
Why do you fight every time when you meet?

211
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,030
Come here. Let’s take some photos.

212
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,210
Please take a photo for us.

213
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,500
Okay.

214
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,500
Closer to the bride, okay?

215
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,170
Great.

216
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,640
What are you doing?

217
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,720
Take it, now.

218
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,349
Oh. Eyes closed.

219
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,900
One more.

220
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,240
Congratulations.

221
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,810
Everybody.

222
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,480
One, two, three.

223
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,560
Where is Han Yoo-ra?

224
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,790
We didn’t see her. What’s wrong?

225
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,580
I met her in the washroom.

226
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,520
She left it there.

227
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,150
Did you fight again?

228
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,950
I don’t like fighting that much.

229
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,350
I’m hungry.

230
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,640
We only have these dishes?

231
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,030
Do you want to eat something else?

232
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,460
Foie gras and caviar as well.

233
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,360
Enjoy yourself.

234
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,230
Waiter?

235
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,020
Do you have some unicinctus?

236
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,430
What?

237
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,500
Hey, why do you want that?

238
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,870
Why? We surely can eat it while on the sea.

239
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,860
Unicinctus and liquor is perfect good match.

240
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,980
You think it’s embarrassing?

241
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,640
Director Park.

242
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,570
Hello.

243
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,300
Hello.

244
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,420
Does your new play begin?

245
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,100
I’ve read the play. It’s great.

246
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,460
How can you get the script?

247
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,480
It’s confidential.

248
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,130
Is it?

249
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,690
You gave it to Song-yi.

250
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:20,570
I saw it while she recited the script.

251
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,100
I want to join.

252
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,130
It depends.

253
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:32,470
Come for drink when it’s convenient.

254
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,230
What?

255
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,670
You said you want to join.

256
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,750
Come to me when I ask.

257
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,110
Are you sure you’ll get investment?

258
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,180
You can’t make a film without investment, right?

259
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,640
It’s said only stars

260
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,760
having no contract with S&C

261
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,300
can act in Director Park’s film.

262
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,710
Who are you?

263
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:04,180
Lee Hee-kyung, young brother of Director Lee.

264
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,340
It’s my brother who decides the investment.

265
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,820
But he has no idea about films.

266
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,600
It’s me who tells him which one is interesting.

267
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,930
After reading the script,

268
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,710
I don’t think it’s fun.

269
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,290
So I want to stop him.

270
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,290
Why did you treat him like that?

271
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,830
You tell me why.

272
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,030
You heard of nothing about him?

273
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,150
He’s a rascal.

274
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,570
Never talk to him, you know?

275
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,250
I see. Let go of me.

276
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,860
Moreover,

277
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,880
all men except me are lady-killers.

278
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,390
When you fall in love with someone, tell me.

279
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,030
You can’t date him if I don’t agree.

280
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,780
Who do you think you are?

281
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,370
I,

282
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,590
am,

283
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,040
the future husband of your best friend.

284
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,200
By the way, where is she?

285
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,100
She is taking some wine.

286
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,440
Again?

287
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,530
So she thinks she is the goddess of wine?

288
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,610
She never stops while drinking.

289
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,380
Goodness!

290
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,120
Song-yi. It’s dangerous.

291
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,210
Hey, be careful.

292
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,650
Are you alright?

293
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,930
I’m fine.

294
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,750
Where is Song-yi?

295
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,000
You said she went for wine.

296
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,650
She was there just now.

297
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,070
What happened?

298
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,320
It’ll be end an hour later.

299
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,580
I don’t know. It seems someone is missing.

300
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,940
Someone? Who?

301
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,980
Hey.

302
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,160
Se-mi, what happened?

303
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,080
Song-yi is missing.

304
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,420
I can’t find her.

305
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,770
Song-yi…

306
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,410
Yoo-ra is missing too.

307
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,450
People are looking for them now.

308
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,710
What?

309
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,910
What should we do?

310
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,240
Cheon Song-yi.

311
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,850
This way.

312
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,060
How much have you drunk?

313
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,750
It’s 01:42 a.m.

314
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,570
Cheon Song-yi was the last one left the ship.

315
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,300
We’ve kept searching after that,

316
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,780
but we didn’t find Han Yoo-ra.

317
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,890
When is the death time?

318
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,550
Let me see.

319
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:40,140
People saw her in the washroom,

320
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,100
and she was with Cheon Song-yi.

321
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,510
According to our investigation, they quarreled.

322
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,430
It’s about 23:30.

323
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,960
People found Han Yoo-ra missing at about 24:30.

324
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,320
Something must have happened within the hour.

325
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,480
God.

326
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,060
Detective, reporters keep calling.

327
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,290
Everyone is asking if Han Yoo-ra’s death
is related to Cheon Song-yi.

328
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,470
Why is Han Yoo-ra’s death related to Cheon Song-yi?

329
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,670
I don’t know either.

330
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,500
It’s said they’ve been of bad relationship.

331
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,400
Everyone says like that.

332
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,630
Bad news spread fast.

333
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:27,460
In ancient times,
the well is a place rumors begin to spread.

334
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,040
In modern times,
the well is automatic coffee machine,

335
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,890
Coffee shop, hotel, gas station, website, blog.

336
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,720
Rumors begin in all places

337
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,790
for people’s leisure and entertainment.

338
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:46,380
Some bad rumors may kill people.

339
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,510
Did you hear

340
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,320
that Han Yoo-ra killed herself for depression

341
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,020
because she was bullied by Cheon Song-yi?

342
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,950
Cheon Song-yi always bullied her.

343
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,270
Really?

344
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,420
Cheon Song-yi didn’t come today, right?

345
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,760
It’s weird if she came after doing that thing.

346

Have you watched the videos?

347

351
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,130
-I didn’t know she is such kind of person.
-It’s good. Appraising me or scolding me,

352
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,980
it’s better than the series with a rating of 4%.

353
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,800
People even don’t know who the actress is.

354
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,160
Oh. Your last series only had a rating of 4%.

Excuse me. Do you know your neighbor Ms. Cheon?

Are you at home safely now?

473

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,240
and there is even no telephone.

478
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,020
He really isolates himself from the world.

479

480

What?

485
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,110
Many people asked about Cheon Song-yi,

486
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,290
so I have to power off.

487
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,220
I didn’t contact her.

488
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,470
Really? It makes me worried.

489
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,500
Where is my brother?

490

He’s been busy recently.

491
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,470
It’s amazing.

492
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,200
Why?

493
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,590
I visited the fortune-teller

494
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,320
and he said

495
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,320
Song-yi would have big problems this year

496
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,430
and would no longer be popular.

497
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,969
She doesn’t have a chance anymore.

498
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:12,810
But it’s different for you.

499
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,820
Her bad luck is your good luck.

500
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,199
Mom, you make me disappointed.

501
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:19,969
Why?

502
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:22,659
We are friends.

503
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:27,100
Sometimes, she really made me upset.

504
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,060
But I won’t be happy to listen to this.

505
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,500
Furthermore, she is not your daughter.

506
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,690
Why did you ask for fortune for her?

507
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:42,030
So are you willing

508
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,670
to be a supporting role forever?

509
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,250
But I’m not. Since you are

510
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,260
the supporting role, I have to be one too.

511
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,120
Mom.

512
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,230
You know? Life is amazing

513
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,949
because it’s unpredictable.

514
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,850
Nobody knows what happens next.

515
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,890
You fell in love with Hee-kyung long time ago.

516
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,840
Why don’t you try harder to get him

517
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,760
and accept the programs especially for you?

518
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,910
I really hope you will succeed one day.

519
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,820
Why are they making it a mess?

520
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,650
It’s under investigation.

521
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,700
They know nothing about the truth.

522
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,220
But why are they so anxious?

523
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,580
Please don’t worry. I will settle it.

524
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,270
President An.

525
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,740
I’m busy now.

526
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,430
The advertisers are unsatisfied.

527
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,050
Yes?

528
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,970
They are asking for compensation.

529
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,280
Ah.

530
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,320
Some other advertisers intend to file a suit.

531
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,300
Ah.

532
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,730
The TV series too.

533
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,150
What?

534
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,280
It’s said the comments board breaks down.

535
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,550
Ah.

536
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,590
Anyway, we will deal with it. Please go back.

537
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,170
I have to handle some urgent things. Excuse me.

538
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,180
President An.

539
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,530
About renewal of the contract,

540
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:07,040
it’s said to be signed a month ahead.

541
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,150
I agree.

542
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,220
Ah.

543
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,060
I will sign it.

544
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,310
It’s been years.

545
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:19,220
No matter what Je-guk and Panton offer,

546
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,660
I won’t leave.

547
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,640
When will you sign it?

548
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,450
Since I’m here today, let’s sign it.

549
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,080
Mrs. Cheon, the contract isn’t ready.

550
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,780
Let’s talk about it later.

551
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,250
Excuse me.

552
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,720
The subscriber you dial is power off.

553
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,400
What is she doing?

554
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,750
What a bad guy!

555
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,960
I am famished!

556
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,770
He will never come back?

557
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,500
What a cold-blooded guy!

558
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,040
The devil comes.

559
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,420
Speaking of the devil, here he comes.

560
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,020
Oh.

561
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,230
How about eating ramen together?

562
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,620
Then you just sit in front of me.

563
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,940
Why?

564
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,700
I don’t want to have meal alone.

565
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,390
I lose my appetite while being alone.

566
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,120
What a bad guy!

567
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,170
He’s like an alien.

568
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,760
I was almost begging him,

569
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,700
but he just ignore it.

570
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,430
What’s going on?

571
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,630
I’ve finished all noodles.

572
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,930
I intended to stop early.

573
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,720
Oh my god!

574
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,810
Where is the washroom?

575
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,580
The paintings look tasty.

576
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,770
How could he pretend these are real ones?

577
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,210
Wow, what’re all these?

578
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,290
The records upon the last three months on Earth.

579
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,920
-What are you doing?
-You scared me.

580
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,580
You scared me.

581
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,460
What are you doing?

582
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,170
You really scared me.

583
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,100
When did you come in?

584
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,060
I want to ask you the same question.

585
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,410
When did you come in?

586
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,820
What for?

587
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,450
I was finding the washroom.

588
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,970
But,

589
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,070
where is this place?

590
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,860
What are all the things?

591
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,350
You do investment?

592
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,880
I mean buying antiques

593
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,570
such as old books or paintings.

594
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,700
Come.

595
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,580
Get out.

596
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,660
Sorry to disturb you,

597
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,670
but now

598
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,780
how can I get out?

599
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,740
It’s up to you!

600
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,540
People are eager for ruining me.

601
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,080
They will surely try all their best to do it.

602
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,840
If they see I get out from a man’s house,

603
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,910
I will be killed by the rumors.

604
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,220
It’s none of my business.

605
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,290
I’m thinking

606
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,820
you should take care of me

607
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,660
since you are my teacher.

608
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,700
Maybe people in the world

609
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,620
won’t care too much about others.

610
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,640
But teachers will help when the student suffers.

611
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,310
Who’s your teacher?

612
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,770
You.

613
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:40,310
I never admit that.

614
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,180
Get out

615
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,810
if you don’t want me to pull you out.

616
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,670
You.

617
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,440
You?

618
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,700
Let go of my hand.

619
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,400
What?

620
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,310
You don’t admit you are my teacher.

621
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,490
Then I won’t be so polite.

622
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,240
I will talk in my real way.

623
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,200
Hey, Cheon Song-yi.

624
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,300
What’s wrong, Do Min-joon?

625
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,280
We’ve almost made it clear.

626
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,610
Show me your ID card.

627
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,290
You must be younger than me.

628
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,590
If I get out from this house,

629
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,040
I’m not the only one to be ruined.

630
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,210
Mr. Do will get involved in it too.

631
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,350
Why?

632
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:12,620
Every piece of news will be titled

633
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,570
“Cheon Song-yi’s Hidden Man”.

634
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,290
Everyone will see your face.

635
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,310
Everything of you will be opened to the public.

636
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,550
That’s more horrible than imagination.

637
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,840
Let me stay for a while.

638
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,320
Please.

639
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:34,930
First,

640
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,990
don’t touch anything

641
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,740
in the house.

642
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,550
Okay.

643
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,380
Okay.

644
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,730
Second,

645
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,530
don’t ask any questions.

646
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,100
Okay.

647
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,410
Okay.

648
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,140
To show my appreciation,

649
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,920
let’s shake hands.

650
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,990
Third,

651
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,620
don’t stay close to me.

652
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,240
Oh my god!

653
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,680
You should be stay away from me.

654
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,180
People I usually touch and work together

655
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,660
are all superstars.

656
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,560
They all like me very much.

657
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,190
It’s weird.

658
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,210
Why doesn’t he like to stay with me?

659
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,520
Does he like someone special…

660
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,630
The families didn’t want an autopsy.

661
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,400
The police may conclude it as suicide.

662
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,410
The public opinion is also at this direction.

663
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,860
The case may end in this way.

664
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,770
But,

665
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:41,350
Han Yoo-ra’s diary said there are
some videos and call records.

666
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,320
I’ve destroyed the notebook.

667
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,610
But it seems there is a copy.

668
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,850
Where is it?

669
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,870
According to the car DVR,

670
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,230
she put the disk in her handbag,

671
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,190
the one she took to the wedding.

672
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,000
Have you found it?

673
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,410
No.

674
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:57,640
Not yet on the ship.

675
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,020
Check the CCTV

676
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,830
to find out

677
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,820
who took it.

678
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,320
Yes.

679
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,310
Jae-kyung.

680
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,670
Please leave.

681
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:09,600
Yes.

682
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,140
What’s wrong?

683
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,750
Did you watch the news?

684
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,970
Han Yoo-ra died.
How can they blame it on Song-yi?

685
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,330
I’m almost crazy.

686
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,040
Please give me the number of reporters you know.

687
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,700
Maybe it’s not suicide

688
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,660
but an accident.

689
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,550
To be honest,

690
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,260
she might be killed.

691
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,630
Many cases are like this abroad.

692
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,380
Murdering is disguised as suicide on a boat.

693
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,000
It’s under investigation.

694
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,240
The truth will be found out.

695
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,600
I can’t trust them.

696
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,180
You mean…

697
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,370
What are they doing?

698
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,930
Hey.

699
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,690
Which magazine are you from?

700
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,650
I’m Kim Hyeog-soo from Daehan Ilbo.

701
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,300
La Jae-u from Only.

702
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,080
She won’t get out.

703
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,420
We’ve ringed a lot.

704
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,310
If Cheon Song-yi’s boyfriend shows up,

705
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,910
it'll be a great news.

706
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,520
Hey, stop standing there.

707
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,350
Have some dumplings with us.

708
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,480
It’s okay.

709
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,350
She won’t come out now.

710
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,330
Come.

711
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,490
-Here you are.
-Yes.

712
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,480
Are you sure she is in?

713
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,820
Absolutely.

714
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,590
The manager tried to take her away but failed.

715
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,230
Then the girl…

716
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,800
Cheon Song-yi didn’t

717
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,580
eat anything inside?

718
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:41,790
Cheon Song-yi,

719
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,990
did Han Yoo-ra really die for your reason?

720
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,480
You met her in the beauty room, didn’t you?

721
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,260
Han Yoo-ra will never commit suicide

722
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,480
in order to avoid me.

723
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,330
She said she would get married

724
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,340
the last time I saw her.

725
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,640
She was very pleased and showing off.

726
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,330
She is just 30.

727
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,110
What made all that happen?

728
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,480
I didn’t do anything wrong,

729
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,990
but I really feel sorry for it.

730
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,890
When was the last time you saw her?

731
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,260
Last time…

732
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,620
[23:30 on the night of the crime]

733
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,040
Why can’t I say anything?

734
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,980
What’s it?

735
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,110
I am wondering

736
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,140
why we can’t tell others our relationship.

737
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,370
Han Yoo-ra.

738
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,330
Get in.

739
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,850
Almost all my friends

740
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:23,040
and your friends are here.

741
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,180
Just wait and see,

742
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:27,520
I will say something important

743
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:32,030
to them.

744
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,280
You may be scared

745
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:37,960
after listening that.

746
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,960
Yoo-ra.

747
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,580
Yes.

748
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,150
How’s your depression?

749
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,600
It depends on you.

750
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,910
I stopped taking medicine not long ago.

751
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,910
You know I like you, right?

752
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,680
Take care of yourself.

753
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,370
Why?

754
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:06,230
They are truly dating.

755
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,590
Why didn’t Jae-kyung admit?

756
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,180
Oh my god!

757
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,910
You scared me!

758
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,200
What are you doing?

759
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,140
Did you

760
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,440
hear anything?

761
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,880
A few words.

762
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,640
Today I will declare our marriage.

763
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,260
Is he the only choice?

764
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,760
What do you mean?

765
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,550
Nothing special.

766
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:42,290
You are not my type.

767
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:47,650
But maybe many men will be attracted by you.

768
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:49,640
You mean

769
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,810
Jae-kyung doesn’t like me

770
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,650
but I love him on my own?

771
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:56,210
It seems to be true.

772
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,630
Don’t be rude.

773
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,820
There is a reason.

774
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:05,360
He has to marry me.

775
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,850
What’s it?

776
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,290
You think I should tell you that?

777
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,540
No, I’m not that curious.

778
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,530
I will retreat after getting married.

779
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,240
At that time, the world is all yours.

780
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,920
No, thanks.

781
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,660
I’ve done very well now.

782
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,510
What a rude girl!

783
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:32,840
You never be gentle.

784
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,670
The words may fit you better.

785
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,420
Oh.

786
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,140
Why did she forget it again?

787
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:59,430
That’s the last time I saw her.

788
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:04,910
I tried to find her and give the bag back.

789
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,490
Later, I got drunk and I can’t remember it.

790
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:15,220
What’s wrong?

791
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,410
Actually,

792
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,200
something strange really happened that day.

793
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:27,600
We almost finished. Time to go home.

794
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,570
It’s obvious.

795
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,820
Stop struggling.

796
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:37,310
Who is this man?

797
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,220
He isn’t in the list.

798
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,970
Which one?

799
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,580
This one?

800
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,520
Which one?

801
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,840
Cheon Song-yi?

802
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,470
No.

803
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,070
The one beside.

804
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,610
It seems I fell asleep on the ship.

805
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:07,770
I made a dream.

806
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,120
You were in the dream.

807
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:19,650
It’s so real. I almost can’t tell it.

808
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:31,410
It’s true.

809
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:33,780
He’s not in the list of guests

810
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,410
nor of workers.

811
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:37,920
Who is he?

812
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,040
What’s going on?

813
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,010
What happened?

814
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,780
Where is he?

815
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,240
Yes.

816
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,640
It’s scary.

817
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,630
Is he a ghost?

818
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,880
He must be a ghost.

819
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,890
Did you do something to the screen?

820
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:06,440
Will it be a ghost from the sea?

821
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,350
It’s scary.

822
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,110
But they disappeared together.

823
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,390
What?

824
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,950
Cheon Song-yi disappeared

825
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,960
with the man.

826
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:36,000
Why did that happen?

827
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:46,150
It’s real. It’s not a dream,

828
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:52,450
Did you go there?

829
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,570
Impossible.

830
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:00,320
Yes, you’d never go there.

831
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:05,790
But I really saw you.

832
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:12,040
What did you do that day?

833
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,660
What?

834
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:01,690
Kiss?

835
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:04,320
I have the chance,

836
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,920
but I never do that.

837
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,550
To be honest, because of my face,

838
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,570
I really met a lot of tempts.

839
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,830
Why did you ask me out?

840
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:20,600
Childe.

841
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,660
This is for you.

842
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,440
Did you hear of Dan-won?

843
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,420
Dan-won Kim Hong-do?

844
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,290
He is the most well-known painter in Hanyang

845
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:40,990
and used to draw the portrait for the prince.

846
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:46,330
Please accept it.

847
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,740
And

848
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,600
this one too.

849
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,020
I can’t refuse the request

850
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,260
of the first beauty in Hanyang.

851
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,640
But,

852
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,170
I’d like to make one thing clear.

853
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:16,580
Do you know where I’m from?

854
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,850
What?

855
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:25,980
I’m from the star.

856
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:29,000
Are you still willing?

857
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:32,780
Not, right?

858
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:36,490
It’s because we are from different planets.

859
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,310
Just speak frankly if you don’t like me.

860
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,370
But you shouldn’t make up such a ridiculous

861
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:46,970
and insincere story.

862
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:50,160
It’s over the line.

863
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:06,270
-=Next=-

864
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,700
Good morning.

865
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,680
Are you crazy?

866
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,740
Let go.

867
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,670
Dad.

868
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,530
[When will Ms. Cheon speak for Han Yoo-ra case?]

869
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,330
If it’s not suicide, did Han Yoo-ra die

870
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:15,860
because of Song-yi?

871
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,280
What will happen to Song-yi?

872
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,180
It’s her last note.

873
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,550
You are too nervous.

874
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:23,670
Let me tell you how to avoid hurting by others.

875
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,790
Don’t give or take anything.

876
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,510
Don’t expect anything.

877
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:28,680
Jae-kyung.

878
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,540
How did you know where my home is?

879
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,600
Do Min-joon.

880
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,670
Do Min-joon, are you home?
