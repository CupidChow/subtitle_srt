1
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:06,370

2
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,960
Please save me. Please save me!

3
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,270
Manager Do! Manager Do!

4
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:55,010
 Manager Do! 
  Manager Do!

5
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,800
Please save me!

6
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,160
Do Min Joon!

7
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,430
Manager . . .

8
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,310
Mr. Do Min Joon.

9
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,690
Where did you go?!

10
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,400
Please come out quickly! 
I am scared.

11
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,050
Please! I beg you.

12
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,710
Hui Kyeong.

13
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,500
Why is it this hard to reach you?

14
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,430
What's the matter?

15
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,890
Where are you?

16
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,630
I don't know.

17
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,650
I don't know.

18
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,910
I'm just... There is a tree here and...

19
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,300
also a cliff. I don't know where this place is.

20
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,620
Hui Kyeong!

21
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,260
I almost died, seriously.

22
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,120
Song Yi, first, gather your wits about you and

23
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,710
turn on your cell phone tracking.

24
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,680
Do you hear me?

25
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,770
Song Yi. 
 Song Yi, are you okay?

26
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,230
"Next-door neighbor," if you brought her to the hospital, shouldn't you have watched over her carefully?

27
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,590
Do you know what happened?

28
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,560
Where did you come back from?

29
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,580
I told you I was going to the police station, didn't I?

30
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,280
Are you really coming from the police station?

31
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,400
By chance, it isn't that you had come to me?

32
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,730
What do you mean?

33
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,230
Tell me.

34
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,190
Didn't you come to the cliff earlier?

35
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,570
I clearly saw you, Mr. Do Min Joon.

36
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,490
I really don't know what you are saying.

37
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,750
Things have been resolved well
 at the police station.

38
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,200
Since you have your friend here, 
I can just leave, right?

39
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:24,060
Of course. Leave. 
 And I am not just a friend, but her boyfriend.

40
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,050
This person . . . while I am talking.....

41
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,770
What do you mean by that?

42
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,190
What are you saying that you saw at the cliff?

43
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,880
I guess I saw it wrong.

44
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,880
You were so shocked that you were seeing things...
Yeah...that can happen....

45
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:53,130
But from now on, even in your hallucinations, 
you should see me, not that "neighbor-guy."

46
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,650
Hui Kyeong,

47
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,610
thank you.

48
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,700
  I really thought I was going to die earlier.

49
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,150
 What would I have done without you?

50
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,690
 What would have happened to me, 
rather, without you? Let's go inside.

51
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,170
 My Love From The Star
Episode 8

52
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,400
Why did you make such a mistake?

53
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,170
You don't usually make them, right?

54
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,710
That . . .

55
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,740
 Who is that?

56
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,580
 What is that over there?

57
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,220
 I completely removed the master cylinder 
making the car uncontrollable...

58
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,780
 Take care of it.

59
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,110
 Yes, sir.

60
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,450
 What is that?

61
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,690
When I came to my senses, both of us were lying
by a highway far away from the scene.

62
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,300
When we returned to the spot, Cheon Song Yi 
had already disappeared from the scene.

63
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,910
Who is the guy that appeared suddenly?

64
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,250
I don't know.

65
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,740
I have no inkling whatsoever.

66
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,140
So, what drug did you inject in her that 
she has absolutely no memory of an entire hour?

67
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,140
She most certainly was kidnapped 
from Seoul to Gapyeong.

68
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,460
If she was in a state to have no memory for that time, wasn't it that she had been injected with some weird drug?

69
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,500
Ms. Cheon Song Yi, a patient, 
who suffered a vasovagal syncope fainting,

70
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,570
was not injected with anything other than 
a normal saline solution.

71
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,510
I didn't prescribe anything.

72
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,050
She's saying that someone came
 and gave her another shot!

73
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,280
Who did?

74
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,950
I don't know.

75
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,500
I just saw him wearing a doctor's lab coat, but

76
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,260
I didn't see his face.

77
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,890
For now, as for what drug was administered, we'll take 
a blood sample and request an analysis from the laboratory.

78
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,070
Where do I go if I want to review the CCTV?

79
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,870
I'm telling you, let's go to a different hospital.

80
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,430
I hate places with a lot of people. 
I will just stay home.

81
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,340
Given that the hospital CCTV was damaged,
some crazy bastard must have done this deliberately.

82
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,040
Don't worry!  I'll be sure to catch all of them.

83
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,610
As I told you earlier, 
don't report it to the police.

84
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,290
I don't like being talked about by people anymore.

85
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,630
I'm too tired and fed up.

86
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,110
What?

87
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,950
 Until when do I have to send you home alone?

88
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,030
 It makes me anxious and I feel bad for you.

89
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,880
 I really hate it.

90
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,610
I will go in and rest.

91
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,230
Okay. Call me right away
 if there is something.

92
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,930
Open the door!
It's me!

93
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,030
What happened?

94
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,700
Someone seems to have broken into my place.

95
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,430
The house is a complete mess.

96
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,240
Why?

97
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,750
Are you still going  in? 
What if they're hiding inside?

98
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,220
Do you have anywhere else to go?

99
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,940
Stay here for the time being.

100
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,340
Strangely, whenever I'm having a hard time,

101
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,120
Mr. Do Min Joon, you are always next to me.

102
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,660
By the way,

103
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,870
you weren't there earlier?

104
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,160
Where is "there"?

105
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,400
Never mind.

106
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,090
It feels like I'm becoming weirder.

107
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,390
Why is this like that?

108
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,700
Did you get hurt?

109
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,060
There was a minor traffic accident 
when I came out of the police station.

110
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,210
What kind of minor traffic accident?

111
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,230
It's nothing major. Stop bothering me, 
 just wash up quickly, and get some sleep.

112
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,120
What is the matter?

113
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,150
Why did you come out wearing so little clothing?

114
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,750
Get in fast.

115
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,790
So I left her home alone and came,

116
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,140
but it seemed like my feet were nailed to the ground.

117
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,580
If I did as I felt, I want to stick
 a bodyguard or something on her.

118
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,280
But it's obvious she'll throw a tantrum, 
saying she doesn't like it.

119
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,610
Se Mi, can't you go and sleep
 with her for one night?

120
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,740
I'll drive you there.

121
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,910
I'm not reporting this to the police
 because she doesn't want me to.

122
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,120
But I say is that any ordinary situation, now.

123
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,570
Some unknown person dragged
 my Song Yi all the way there...

124
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,110
No matter who the bastard is,
I'll really kill him if I get my hands on him.

125
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,320
Did you come to say that?

126
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,640
Are you not shocked?

127
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,430
When I'm telling you that Song Yi
 went through something like that?

128
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,700
Why should I be shocked too?

129
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,460
If she goes through something like that, 
people who'd help her are all over the place.

130
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,490
If something were to happen to Song Yi, 
would you stay put?

131
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,540
Did you fight with Song Yi?

132
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,040
She's been uneasy these days, you know.

133
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,600
Did she get mad at you again?

134
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,000
You're nice, so try to understand her.

135
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,760
Hui Kyeong, do I have to be nice?

136
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,970
I'm not really nice.

137
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,030
I'm actually a really bad person. 
But I just pretended to be nice.

138
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,660
Only then, would you...

139
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,430
Why do you say you aren't nice?

140
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,960
My Se Mi is the nicest person in the world.

141
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,720
That's why I tell you all the things 
I don't even tell Song Yi.

142
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,790
 Yoo Se Mi, I'm only telling you this.

143
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,080
 What?

144
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,160
 Actually,

145
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,650
 I'm really in love.

146
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,690
 With Cheon Song Yi.

147
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,840
 I don't understand myself either.

148
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,600
 That girl is so rude and full of herself.

149
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,320
 She puts me down in front of the other kids.

150
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,660
 Still, what can I do when
 I like her so much I could die.

151
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,320
 For now, I'd be happy just to be her friend, 
so help me get closer to her.

152
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,750
 That girl doesn't even treat me as a human.

153
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,000
 You help me, please.

154
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,020
 I'm begging you.

155
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,470
 You're nice.

156
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,200
The man from 12 years ago . . .

157
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,400
who saved Song Yi from the accident.

158
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,150
I saw that man.

159
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,070
What?

160
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,240
Where?

161
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,950
How do you know that man's face?

162
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,180
Actually, that accident...

163
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,180
I saw it too.

164
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,970
I happened to see it as well.

165
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,810
Well, let's assume that's true.

166
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,540
Who is that guy then?

167
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,790
Did he say it?

168
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,620
Did he say he's the one who
 saved Cheon Song Yi?

169
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,970
I'm sure it's that same man.

170
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,570
What if . . .

171
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,140
I tell Song Yi about this,

172
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,700
what do you think would happen?

173
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,960
Song Yi's waited for that person a long time.

174
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,010
That man . . .

175
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,800
Who is he?

176
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,670
Who is that bastard?

177
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,140

178
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,700
I'm sorry.

179
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,760
What for?

180
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,970
I've acted in a lot of movies, so I know.

181
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,210
A woman like me makes an excuse
 that she doesn't have any clothes,

182
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:09,450
So she wears a guy's loose clothing and walks 
around the house. I know what that implies.

183
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,280
What does it imply?

184
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,970
I'm sure it makes a man's heart flutter, 
but please don't misunderstand anything.

185
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,270
I'm really scared to go into my home
 to get my clothes, so I'm borrowing your clothing.

186
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,810
But, I don't have any other motive.

187
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,790
It doesn't matter to me whether 
you have a hidden agenda or not.

188
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,030
That's right. That's what you would say.

189
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,070
I hope you don't reproach yourself too much just because 
your mouth and heart are not on the same page.

190
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,010
Don't people all react the same way?

191
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,090
If they see something beautiful,

192
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,160
they like it, and their hearts flutter.

193
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,610
What do you think of this ceramic?

194
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,420
It's beautiful, right?

195
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,660
Huh? What?

196
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,320
No matter how beautiful this ceramic is,

197
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,540
you don't get butterflies by looking at it.

198
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,090
Similarly, just because a puppy is cute doesn't mean your heart flutters when you see the puppy.

199
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,600
And just because pine trees are graceful doesn't mean
 your heart flutters when you see the pine tree either.

200
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,420
What do you mean?

201
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,890
Right now, the Ms. Cheon Song Yi
 who's standing in front of me

202
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,750
is like a ceramic, a puppy

203
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,950
or a pine tree to me.

204
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,260
Therefore, you don't have to
 be sorry or worry about

205
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,850
my heart fluttering because of you.

206
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,290
You should just use the time for
 useless worries to sleep.

207
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,430
Okay.

208
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,790
I, who am no different from ceramics, 
puppies and pine trees,

209
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,540
will fall over to sleep.  Bring some blankets.

210
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,150
Go in and sleep.

211
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,000
You're telling me to sleep in the bed?

212
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,070
Only for today.

213
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,470
So...

214
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,610
I really did go through a lot today.

215
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,220
I should get a good night's sleep.

216
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,490
But, as I told you last time, I have insomnia.

217
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:01,230
Give me a book so I can fall asleep.

218
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,310
You read books in order to fall asleep?!

219
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,630
Works like magic.

220
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,790
Don't touch anything!

221
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,970
I'm not touching anything.

222
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,890
But did you read all the books here?

223
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,780
I'm asking if you've read all of them or 
are you planning to read all of them?

224
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,640
I've read all of them.

225
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,890
Then why do you pile them up here?

226
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,030
Are you showing off?

227
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:40,380
Is this to intimidate people who visit here with
the sheer quantity of volumes?

228
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,910
"I'm a professor." Is that what this is about?~

229
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,890
I really don't get it.

230
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,180
If they've all been read, why not give it to someone else or sell as used books, instead of piling them up?

231
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,590
Stop your yammering...

232
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,320
Choose one.

233
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,530
What is this?

234
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,530
Are these alien words?

235
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,830
They're not alien words,

236
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,280
but Chinese characters.

237
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,700
This is the "Myungshimbogam" I talked about last time. 
(MB: An ancient book containing lessons for cultivating character)

238
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,270
Are you joking? I said I wanted to sleep.

239
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,870
I have to be able to read it to fall asleep.

240
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,560
 Miraculous Journey . . .

241
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,610
What is this one?

242
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,740
Oh, this has drawings.

243
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,180
I like ones with drawings.

244
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,480
Good, good.

245
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,960
Edward, with a thud,

246
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,310
fell to the ground and down the long and dirty hill

247
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,540
he rolled and rolled again.

248
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,630
 Finally, when he came to a stop,

249
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,650
 he lay on his back and looked up at the sky.

250
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,600
 And he started to say the name of the constellations.

251
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,220
 He then stopped.

252
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,330
 Edward had a thought . . .

253
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,980
 "Leaving, without even a moment to say farewell...

254
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,390
 How much longer will I have to do this?"

255
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,540
 Somewhere deep in his heart, Edward felt pain.

256
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,330
 Edward wanted to cry.

257
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,940
"Open your heart. Someone will come."

258
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,410
"Someone will come for you."

259
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,650
"But first, you have to open the door to your heart."

260
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,550
 No.

261
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,200
 No. Don't believe it.

262
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,450
 You must not believe it.

263
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:46,220

264
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,310
 But, it was too late.

265
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,760
 The ceramic doll's heart...

266
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,450
 had started to open again.

267
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,590
Spoon worms - Sea cucumbers

268
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,120
You'd like to buy some spoon worms?

269
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,660
This one is in season, so it's very fresh.

270
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,760
Where did he go?

271
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,560
What is this... Leaving me alone without a word. So scary.

272
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,430
Where is an umbrella?

273
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,390
 What do you intend to do with women's shoes?

274
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,960
 I said I didn't take them!

275
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,850
Ah! Do Min Joon, seriously. I'm speechless.

276
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,320
Since dawn, where have you been?

277
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,310
Just... to buy this and that.

278
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,610
Why?

279
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,570
This. This. I think you have a little explaining to do.

280
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,950
That you didn't do this.

281
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,750
"What do you take me for?"

282
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,270
"This is why one shouldn't take in a dark haired animal."

283
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,010
"What would I do with women's shoes?!"

284
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,810
I thought our Professor Do Min Joon said those things.

285
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,360
I did?

286
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,710
Yeah. You did.

287
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,990
Spoon worms. I bought some.

288
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,090
Anyway, this well-behaved cat . . .

289
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,550
- Where does it go? 
-- A wood-burning stove.

290
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,190
Yeah, yeah, right. A wood-burning stove. It climbs up there.
( "A fair face may hide a foul heart.")

291
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,390
There's a proverb like that too.

292
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,770
If you're drawn to women's heels,
just  say you fancy them.

293
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,700
You could have told me honestly!

294
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,270
I'm a woman with enough shoes not to fall short in a comparison with Imelda Marcos.

295
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,390
I could have given you a couple of pairs.

296
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,830
- I didn't... 
- It's fine.

297
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,720
It's possible for tastes to differ for each person. 
Who would badmouth that?

298
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,740
Don't be too embarrassed.

299
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,370
If there's a certain colour and 
design you prefer, just tell me.

300
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,920
I'll give it to you as a present.

301
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,100
What the hell, ahjusshi?
How can you jump out like that?

302
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,990
I...I'm fine. Hurry and go.

303
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,860
Are you okay, ahjusshi?

304
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,610
Are you able to get up?

305
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,680
Are you really hurt?

306
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,630
Shall I call 119 for you?
 (Korean 911)

307
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,130
No. I'm fine, student.

308
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,590
Even so, I think you'll
 have to go to the hospital.

309
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,290
I...I'll take care of it. 
Th...thank you.

310
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,640
Wait...

311
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,120
 Dad! Don't go! Dad!

312
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,820
 Don't go!

313
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,040
 Live with me! Don't go!

314
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,990
You bought it well.
 You bought a very delicious one.

315
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,960
It's ok. Leave it be. I'll do it. I will.

316
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,750
How can I put to work someone who's injured his hand?

317
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,390
I can do, at least, this amount since
 I'm the one imposing.  Don't you agree?

318
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,330
In 1693, Jangheung, South Jeolla Province.

319
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,990
It's the one I fetched directly from the village 
that used to make white porcelains during the Yi Dynasty.

320
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,700
I bought it from the best artisan at the time.
Its value is...

321
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,430
priceless.

322
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,650
It's fine.

323
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,480
This plate was chipped anyway.

324
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,800
I was wondering why you were holding onto it,
instead of throwing it out.

325
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,230
When I looked in your cabinet, there were 
a great number of dishes that needed to be thrown out.

326
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,630
Do you want me to take everything out 
and throw them away?

327
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,580
Don't!

328
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,440
I will do the dishes. Move aside.

329
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,880
I said I'll do it.

330
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,940
Don't be sorry. It's fine.

331
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,570
Aigoo! I said I'll do it.

332
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,710
I'm good at cleaning.

333
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,730
Do you want to see?

334
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,090
A Yi Dynasty white porcelain

335
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,440
inscribed with Scholar Heo Gyun's handwriting.

336
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,330
Unbelievable.

337
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,640
Oops.

338
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,220
Sorry!

339
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,830
Okay, I'll buy you the exact same one.

340
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,570
No, I'll buy you a more expensive one.

341
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,760
There are lots of them. They're all over the place. 
If you go to places like Incheon rest area.

342
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,120
First, I'll do some cleaning.

343
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,290
Stay put. Don't do anything.  
Or else, I'm going to kick you out.

344
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,730
I got it.

345
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,170
So, let go.

346
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,210
Even though the charge of blackmail 
and assault were added,

347
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,360
it's a misdemeanor.  Also, he confessed freely.

348
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,760
We booked him without detention and processed 
his release after filing the report.

349
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:38,900
Having looked into this, this punk was 
a complete Han Yoo Ra stalker.

350
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,540
When Han Yoo Ra was alive, 
he was even served with a restraining order.

351
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,940
Cheon Song Yi must have suffered a lot 
because someone like him was after her.

352
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,160
But,

353
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,040
what does this mean?

354
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,470
Near Death Experience Center?

355
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,380
Han Yoo Ra went to a Near Death Experience Center?

356
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,650
Ah, that, right. He claims he saw that while following her around.

357
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:04,480
About a month ago, 
he said, Han Yoo Ra went to a Near Death Experience Center with some man.

358
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,350
To a Near Death Experience Center?

359
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:10,280
Ah, that place where you can go lie down in a coffin, 
write a suicide note, and whatnot?

360
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,900
But, why did Han Yoo Ra go there-

361
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:19,030
So, the suicide note in Han Yoo Ra's own handwriting 
was the one written then?

362
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,110
If that's true, the current suicide note isn't the real thing.

363
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,110
Aigoo! How can you believe that crazy punk's-

364
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,140
In any case, because there were some dubious points,

365
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,640
I called the Near Death Experience Center 
or something he was talking about.

366
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,860
They said they haven't seen even a trace of Han Yoo Ra.

367
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,540
You can check for us the CCTV 
for the day that man spoke of, can't you?

368
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,940
I already asked them to send us the data, but

369
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,130
it broke a month ago so they say it's impossible to verify.

370
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,990
You are thinking about that, aren't you?

371
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,330
If, by chance, Han Yoo Ra didn't 
commit suicide . . .

372
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,040
If it's not a suicide,

373
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,690
the person who will gain something from her death

374
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,000
could be the culprit.

375
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,510
He's someone who asked her to go to the Near Death
 Experience Center with him and

376
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,650
who could swipe the suicide note that she wrote there.

377
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,470
Could it be that Han Yoo Ra was seeing someone?

378
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,810
The stalker said that he clearly 
saw that man's face too.

379
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,790
So, for now, finding out what he looks like
 seems the most urgent priority.

380
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,050
What kind of guy could it be?

381
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,620
 What is this?

382
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,170
 Ah, that? A bear doll that my fan 
sent anonymously in the past.

383
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,910
 It's cute, isn't it?

384
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,380
 What are you doing right now?!

385
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,670
 We failed to recover the USB.

386
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,040
 I'm told it wasn't anywhere in Cheon Song Yi's home.

387
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,420
 I'm sorry.

388
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,050
 What are you doing?

389
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,600
 What is this?

390
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,130
 It looks like the same guy's work.

391
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,030
 First, I will look to see if there are
 more things like this elsewhere,

392
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,500
 so just get ready to go out.

393
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,850
 This is really ridiculous.

394
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,040
Aigoo. We have to wait this long?

395
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,250
How many is this?
 One, two, three. . .

396
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,530
Ask them to pull these up some.

397
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,290
I will ask them. Oh!

398
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,660
Hui Kyeong hyung!

399
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,460
Oh, hello.

400
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,840
Se Mi, see me for a minute.

401
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,690
Did you come because you were curious?

402
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,900
About who that man is?

403
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,840
Of course, I'm curious.

404
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,520
But I didn't come because of that.

405
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,790
I came to ask you for a favor.

406
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,580
What favor?

407
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,360
To me or to Song Yi. . .

408
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,800
Don't tell us.

409
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,490
Who that man is.

410
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,310
Please I ask of you.

411
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,710
Hey. You also know how I feel, don't you?

412
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,540
Because I thought it would make you feel uncomfortable, 
I wasn't going to say anything if possible, but

413
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,450
I read your interview article.

414
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,630
You said you had a man you've 
liked unrequitedly for a really long time?

415
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,970
I was disappointed.

416
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,740
How could you not tell me such a thing?

417
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,810
Who's that bastard?

418
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,960
The bastard who caused our Se Mi
 a heartache for so long.

419
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,540
Should this Oppa go and meet him?

420
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,280
You don't need to.

421
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,610
Don't be like that and just confess to him.

422
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,540
Just look at me. Cheon Song Yi, 
who looked like she won't even move an inch,

423
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,610
seemed to be wavering a bit
 because I kept confessing continuously.

424
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,660
You, too, just close your eyes and confess to him.

425
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,790
How?

426
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,430
What's so difficult about it?

427
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,140
If you think it will be hard to do it in person,
 then call him.

428
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,800
Do that, and say "Hey, you punk, I like you."

429
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,040
Say just what you need to and then hang up.

430
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,560
Honestly, if he's a man,

431
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,480
when a woman like you 
emerges saying she likes him,

432
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,840
there's no way he can't be moved.

433
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,450
Anyway, be strong. 
And my request,

434
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,120
don't forget it.

435
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,750
I left for a bit during the lunch break, 
so I have to go back. I'm going.

436
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,740
 Se Mi

437
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,550
Hey, you frustrating girl. 
Why are you calling me?

438
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,820
I'm telling you to call that bastard.

439
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,150
I'm telling you to call that bastard that you say you like!

440
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,200
--Please drink.
--Sure.

441
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,120
Last time,

442
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,570
I wasn't at leisure to introduce myself properly. . .

443
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:17,170
The layout here seems 
a bit different from Song Yi's house.

444
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,350
A lease? A monthly rental?

445
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,980
Or, did your parents bequeath this to you?

446
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,930
What brings you here. . .?

447
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,760
If you're my Song Yi's manager,

448
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,990
you'll have to maintain a close relationship 
with me as well.

449
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:34,310
That means you can be her manager
 only if I also approve of you.

450
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,900
I heard you graduated from Harvard?

451
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,430
What about your age? Of course, 
you look like you're most likely a bachelor.

452
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,020
Do you have a girlfriend? 
What does your father do?

453
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,570
Do I . . . need to answer?

454
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,620
You passed.

455
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,720
I like how you don't babble.

456
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,490
You know, the first condition of a manager is
 that he should be tight-lipped.

457
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,130
I really like that you seem like you won't
 answer easily no matter what reporters ask.

458
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,060
Well, Mother. . .?

459
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,540
This is my number. Text me 
your number to this number later.

460
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,460
When I need you, I may call you frequently.

461
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,260
I hope I can reach you 24/7.

462
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,340
Oh, right.

463
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,170
If something happens to my Song Yi, 
report it to me right away, okay?

464
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,830
Work hard.

465
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,960
Here!

466
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,860
Give us a jjondeugi (chewy candy; similar to twizzlers).
 Make it rare.

467
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,620
Isn't the octopus leg better than the jjondeugi?

468
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,790
- You know, it's more chewy. 
-- Okay.

469
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,600
Give us two octopus legs. 
Don't forget to make it rare.

470
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,280
That's right.

471
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,710
Ah, seriously. . .

472
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,060
Still?

473
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,040
Is Amanda Seyfried still hitting you up?

474
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,960
She's killing me. Really.

475
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,940
How about you? Hyuna is still. . .?

476
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,670
She follows me around nonstop, 
saying that there's no tomorrow.

477
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,460
Cheon Song Yi.

478
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,790
- Are you okay? 
 -- Yeah.

479
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,880
I came to return these.

480
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,350
Oh, I lend these to my Do Min Joon-nim (form of honor), but

481
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,510
why did you bring these?

482
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,140
My Do Min Joon-nim, my butt.
 I ordered him to rent them.

483
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,560
Hey. . .

484
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,810
Who do you think you are to order that 
statue-like (good-looking) man to rent mangas?

485
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:00,200
I didn't even know that was the case and misunderstood
 our Sir Do Min Joon as a long overdue delinquent.

486
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,770
Ah, that's enough.

487
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,020
I have something to ask you. . .

488
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,000
So you're saying that

489
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,350
some guy was inside the car 
but then was in front of you in a second.

490
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,950
Your car almost fell off the cliff, but

491
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,350
that man blocked the car with his body.
-- That's right.

492
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,410
- And he vanished in one second? 
 -- Exactly.

493
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,490
Why?

494
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,370
Go to the hospital for sure.

495
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,210
For certain!

496
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,740
Doctor, you can't tell anyone that I came here, alright?

497
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,700
It's a secret.

498
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,630
Don't worry about it.

499
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,230
Please talk at ease.

500
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,680
The first time I felt it was strange. . .

501
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,530
It felt too real to say it was a dream, but

502
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,150
to say it was real . . .

503
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,610
it didn't make any sense. 
Something like that, you know?

504
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,330
And also...

505
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,340
I'm certain that I saw it.

506
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,390
He was in the car one second, but,

507
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,890
the next second, he was rescuing me.

508
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,590
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

509
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,940
No, I don't.

510
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,800
Please continue.

511
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,910
And there was this clincher. . .

512
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,930
 Do Min Joon!

513
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,990
He appeared suddenly, you mean? 
Because the thunder struck?

514
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,310
Yes.

515
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,270
It's not like he's "thunder man."
What's more absurd is . . .

516
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,620
When I came out of the car, he suddenly disappeared.

517
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,120
You're writing down that I'm crazy, right?

518
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,320
No, I'm not. It's called visual hallucination.

519
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,340
You've been receiving too much stress lately,

520
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,710
so that's an acute reaction to stress.

521
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:11,620
I'm almost certain that these hallucinations are
 reactions due to sudden stress.

522
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,980
What is that?

523
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,760
When a person is suddenly or exceedingly stressed,

524
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,850
you begin to fear that what you have fought so hard to build up

525
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,530
might crumble and never be restored.

526
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,820
You can think of it as a disease caused by
 that fear growing bigger.

527
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,300
As a preliminary symptom, one may
 have an audio hallucination.

528
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,710
As it worsens, one may have visual hallucinations.

529
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,760
So I'm seeing illusions?

530
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,560
But why do I only always see that one person?

531
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,140
It could be a person that you recently met and

532
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:46,360
someone that you, subconsciously, wants to rely on.

533
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,640
That's why you keep seeing him.

534
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,020
Someone I would like to rely on?

535
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,430
 Yes.

536
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,660
 But then you, yourself, are having a hard time.

537
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,920
 So if you become too dependent on one person,

538
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,000
 you, Cheon Song Yi, could become a tiresome 
relationship for that person.

539
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:17,010

540
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,270
 Try not to rely on him too much.

541
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:25,920
 Think of it as letting air 
out of a full blown balloon.

542
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,910
 It would be nice for you to put effort in

543
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,810
 slowly solving your internal conflicts

544
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,810
 through conversations with others, hobbies, and so on.

545
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,330
What are you looking at?

546
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,780
What did I do?

547
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,880
Why did you come here?
 I can handle it by myself.

548
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,530
You told me to come.

549
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,200
I did? Did I?

550
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,980
I'm not a person who would rely on anyone
 for things that I can do on my own.

551
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,120
So, what I'm saying is, relying on you. . .

552
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,020
tiring out people . . .

553
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,460
I'm not that kind of woman.  
So, I hope you won't be burdened by it.

554
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,390
What are you saying?

555
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,410
I said I can handle it on my own!

556
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,710
I think someone purposely took out 
the brakes' master cylinder.

557
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,930
That's why the brakes were not working.

558
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,900
Who would. . .

559
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,100
But thankfully, you were lucky.

560
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,210
There must have been a boulder 
or something in front.

561
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,320
No, there was no such thing.

562
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,170
Then why is this damaged?

563
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,280
Or, was this part already like this too?

564
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,910
No, it wasn't.

565
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,620
You must have bumped into something for it to stop.
It can't stop on its own when the brake is not working.

566
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,920
- Mr. Kim!
- Okay.

567
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,290
No, that's impossible.

568
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:42,730
What is?

569
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,200
Nothing.

570
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,560
I have a dinner appointment with 
Hui Kyeong, so I should be going.

571
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,610
Will you be late?

572
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,660
I wish you wouldn't concern yourself
 if I will be late or not.

573
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,020
I already told you,

574
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:59,270
I'm not a woman who would rely and be a burden on someone and make him tired.

575
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:02,680
Did I say anything?
Why have you been  saying that since earlier?

576
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,780
No, I was just saying.

577
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,530
Prosecutor Yoo.

578
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,090
How could such a thing happen?

579
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,120
What's wrong?

580
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:23,150
You know that crazy helmeted-stalker?

581
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,070
He died. He died.

582
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:28,790
Pardon?

583
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,570
The road was slippery. Why would he ride 
a motorbike on Olympic Highway?

584
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,290
That road is designated for cars, right?

585
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,580
Right.

586
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,040
He was the only person who could testify
 that her suicide note was used

587
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,290
for some other purpose.

588
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,420
Song Yi.

589
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,420
You surprised me.

590
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,050
-- Oppa.
-- Why are you so surprised?

591
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,710
I know, right.

592
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:12,780
These days, I have been experiencing strange things, 
so my liver's become the size of a bean.

593
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,270
--  What about Hui Kyeong?
-- He's probably already  arrived.

594
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,110
I heard from Hui Kyeong.

595
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,880
There was an accident?

596
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:34,610
Yes.

597
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:35,750
Be careful.

598
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,440
Yes.

599
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:41,360
There are really a lot of crazy bastards
 in this world.

600
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,860
I think the person who kidnapped me and 
the one who sent the teddy bear to my house

601
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,120
to keep watch on me is 
probably the same person.

602
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,990
If it hadn't been for that person,

603
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,080
I would really have been a helpless victim.

604
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,890
Who is that person?

605
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,040
Pardon?

606
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,820
The hidden camera on the teddy bear . . .

607
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,110
The person who discovered it.

608
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,910
Who is it?

609
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,820
How did you know?

610
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,310
Huh?

611
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,610
That he was the person who 
discovered the hidden camera.

612
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,550
I never said it.

613
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,100
I'm just saying the obvious.

614
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,670
Let's go.

615
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,430
Song Yi.

616
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,640
Did Se Mi, by any chance,
 tell you anything?

617
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,440
About what?

618
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,100
Nothing.

619
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:02,010
Jae Kyeong oppa.

620
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,340
Yes.

621
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,530
Why do I keep

622
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:11,580
thinking that Yoo Ra unnie 
didn't commit suicide?

623
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,500
What are you saying all of a sudden?

624
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,820
I saw something.

625
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,220
It was a video of Yoo Ra 
meeting with a woman.

626
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,950
It was really strange.

627
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:29,650
That woman said this to Yoo Ra,

628
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:33,010
"Get away from that person. . ."

629
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,340
"if not, you will die too."

630
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,890
What?

631
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,730
Who is that person?

632
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:43,420
That, I don't know.

633
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,770
That video, where is it?

634
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,910
Get it and go to the police immediately.

635
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,100
If Han Yoo Ra's death is a murder,

636
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,030
then the suspicions about you would be cleared.

637
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,570
Don't say rash things.

638
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,240
It's already starting to subside.

639
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,080
It might reinvigorate the situation.

640
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,630
That's why. . .

641
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:09,920
Where is that video?

642
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,020
Can I see?

643
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,440
It's gone.

644
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,480
Gone?

645
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,510
It's gone.

646
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,010
I won again.

647
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,330
That's right.

648
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,430
Shall we go home now?

649
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,210
Pardon? Already?

650
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,940
What do you mean "already"?

651
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,110
It's snowing outside and the cars are backed up, 
so we should hurry and go.

652
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,850
Let's do one more round.

653
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,410
There's no one waiting at home.

654
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:56,210
Did you ever have one? Someone waiting?

655
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,340
That's right, there has always been none.

656
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,230
Cheon Song Yi was in your house. 
Did she go back to hers already?

657
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,620
No.

658
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:09,370
Well. . . 
She has a dinner appointment or whatever.

659
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:11,840
It's snowing and it's cold. . .

660
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,660
A woman who just went through a big accident. . .

661
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,930
Well . . .

662
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,210
She's roaming around on her own two feet.

663
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:20,320
What could I say?

664
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:23,130
As if I cared.

665
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,970
Cheon Song Yi must have gone

666
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,680
to see the guy who likes her, right?

667
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,790
How did you . . .?

668
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,450
It seems like you are jealous.

669
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,100
Pardon?

670
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,180
You're mistaken.

671
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,580
Now there's only two months left.

672
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:49,110
Your assets are almost settled,

673
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,960
but I can't settle your heart for you.

674
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,520
-- You're just coming in now?
-- You said you would be late.

675
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,340
I was tired. Come and sit.

676
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,020
What is all of this?

677
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,660
Can't you tell by looking at it?
It is chicken and beer.

678
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,360
You said you would be eating dinner before 
coming home. Did you not get treated out?

679
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:48,120
I don't know. I couldn't eat anything 
because  I didn't have any appetite. But,

680
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,710
I got hungry as soon as I got home, 
so I ordered it.

681
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,940
Then, eat it.

682
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,130
Where are you going?

683
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:58,910
It is not fun to eat alone. 
Let's eat together.

684
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,010
I don't drink.

685
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:02,700
There's no such thing.
 It's just that you're used to not drinking.

686
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,650
You get better at drinking if you keep trying.

687
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,280
It's not that I didn't try drinking.

688
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,720
 Year 1634, Hanyang Gisaeng House

689
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,410
 Hey, everyone. Have you heard of hondonju?
(mixture of rice wine and soju)

690
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:21,240
In the era of Yeonsangun 
(10th king of Joseon), Heo-ahm Jeong Hui Ryang (a writer)

691
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,890
said this in his poem about hondonju.

692
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:29,250
 "If you drink hondonju once, 
you can see the god.

693
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:34,850
 If you drink it again, you become
 one with nature. It's that kind of a drink."

694
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,780
 Well, let's fill everyone's bowl.

695
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:47,050
Now, let's all have this one bowl
 in a single swallow.

696
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,070
 Wait, look here, Dam On.

697
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,330
 Why aren't you drinking?

698
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,300
 I brought my horse here.

699
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,100
 Recently, due to falling asleep while riding,

700
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,970
 there's been many incidents of death 
due to falling off the horse.

701
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:10,430
 I heard that the king even prohibited drunk 
horse riding because of those incidents.

702
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,180
 Ah, this man. You worry for nothing!

703
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:19,150
 You can leave your horse here and 
call a  palanquin bearer.

704
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:25,960
 Now, don't be a wet blanket here. 
Swallow down the bowl of wine.

705
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,050
 Right, go ahead. Gulp it down.

706
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:33,410
 - Let's drink and have fun.
- Yes, drink.

707
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:48,970
 You drink well!

708
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:37,440
 Dam On. What are you doing right now?

709
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,670
 He's a goblin! 
A goblin!

710
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,020
 A goblin!
 A goblin, a goblin!

711
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:12,040

712
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,410
You really aren't going to drink?

713
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,000
How many times do I have to tell you
 that I wouldn't drink?

714
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,670
Why?

715
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:33,330
You don't drink with a ceramic piece?

716
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,970
You don't drink with a puppy? Is that it?

717
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:42,930
I guess there is no way you can 
drink with a tree.

718
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,820
Are you already drunk?

719
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,310
No. Not at all.

720
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,360
Listen to me carefully.

721
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,820
Something called "chemi" exists
 between two individuals.

722
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:06,910
It's a shortened version of some word (chemistry). 
Anyway, it means "chemical reaction".

723
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:10,100
And, I'm a lump of chemi(stry).

724
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:14,890
All the guys that see me, just go crazy. 
They're just fired up.

725
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,690
Then do I not have chemistry with girls then? 
Yes, I do.

726
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:23,060
All the girls that see me, 
they just boil with jealousy.

727
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:29,150
In one word, I am charming, jealous-worthy . . .
 a femme fatale.

728
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,500
I guess you have to go to the hospital
 if you are like this without being drunk.

729
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,780
I went. I said I went to the hospital.

730
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:41,450
This point here makes me dumbfounded and mad.

731
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:44,890
Because of you, I went to the hospital
 and got a consultation.

732
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,770
I was even diagnosed that I relied
 on to you too much.

733
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:55,160
So, how can you think of things like a porcelain, a puppy, 
and a tree when you look at me?

734
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:02,090
In Cheon Song Yi's life, nothing like this has ever happened.
 If you're human, how could you look at me and feel nothing?

735
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,590
This is not just a simple problem. I need to get back to work in the future..

736
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:13,260
If I'm like this, how can I stand in front of the public with confidence and rise to the top again?

737
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,470
This won't do.

738
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:21,010
Just give me 15 seconds.

739
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,420
What 15 seconds?

740
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,370
My nickname is '15 Second Fairy'.

741
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:31,810
I can captivate people with an ad
 that is just 15 seconds.

742
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:36,330
So, just give me 15 seconds.

743
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:42,100
I will admit it if I am still a porcelain piece, a puppy, 
or a tree after 15 seconds.

744
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,000
That I don't have any charm.

745
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:52,440
Begin.

746
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:54,620
♬  By coincidence, you come near me 
and say, "Hello."  ♬

747
00:57:54,620 --> 00:58:00,510
♬  Only in dreams, you came  ♬

748
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:05,080
♬   in front of me  ♬

749
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:11,480
♬  Love is here but you are leaving.  ♬

750
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:15,530
♬  I've been waiting for you. . .  ♬

751
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:26,310
 Your assets are almost settled, 
but I can't settle your heart for you.

752
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,050
 My heart. . .

753
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:31,550
 it can't be settled.

754
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,530
 I keep looking back at the past..

755
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:40,970
  And I continuously regret.

756
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,030
 Regret what?

757
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:50,400
 Not even once have I lived like the others.

758
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:56,500
 Sharing simple breakfast and dinner with someone. . .

759
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,120
 Going home to where someone is waiting. . .

760
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:05,720
 Expressing sincerely about
 liking someone. Those things.

761
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:12,040
 Humans, who don't even live to be
 a 100, are all doing. . .

762
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:18,430
 those trivial things that I laughed at.

763
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:24,230
 Those small and warm . . .

764
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:30,740
 The beautiful things of everyday life, 
I want to do them now.

765
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:34,200
 What should I do?
