1
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,890
When I was first left alone here,

2
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,340
the thought of when I would be returning 
to where I came from,

3
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,570
never left me, even for a moment.

4
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,540
And then there was a time 
when I started to work at Gwansanggam.

5
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,320
 Gwansanggam: the Joseon Dynasty institution in charge of astronomy, geography, divination, meteorology, &amp; waterclock.

6
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,910
 Are you still working?

7
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:12,880
 Someone might think that you're 
the only one who works in Gwansanggam.

8
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,510
 What book are you looking at so intently?

9
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,430
 It's Chiljeongsan Oepyeon by Teacher Lee Sun Ji. 
(A solar calendar following Greek tradition published in yr 1444).

10
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,640
 No matter how many times I read it,
 it's a book that I always find surprising.

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,650
 Since   divulges not only the astronomical constant,
and solar and lunar motion and eclipse,

12
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,640
 but the orbits of 5 different planets accurately as well.

13
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,650
 Are you,

14
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,560
 perhaps, going around saying strange things to others?

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,270
 What do you mean?

16
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,370
 I mean...that...our land we live on is revolving...or something.

17
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,980
 Or....that it is round or something...

18
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,280
 Yes, it's true.

19
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,850
 Ha ha, this person...

20
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,780
 If this land is spinning round and round,

21
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,720
 wouldn't our heads be so dizzy that we 
wouldn't even be able to stand?

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,000
 And that it is a circular shape,

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 exactly what is your basis for saying such a thing?

24
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,000
 But, why are you laughing?

25
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,880
 If you look from very far away,

26
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,070
 you can see it.

27
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,640
 (See) what?

28
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,840
 That how beautiful the planet Ji Won
(Ji Won: 17th century Joseon word for Earth)

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,940
 we are living on is.

30
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,970
 Is there a time you've seen it from afar?

31
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,660
Earth seen from afar is beautiful.

32
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,360
Many people from where I used to live

33
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,000
were curious about Earth and wanted to visit it.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,290
This is the method we use to come to Earth.

35
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,860
We terraformed* an asteroid to look like an ordinary comet to the Earth's inhabitants,

36
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,770
which comes to Earth only at perihelion, when its orbit is closest to the sun, when the asteroid is not visible to Earth.

37
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,540
That cycle seems to take approximately 404 years in Earth time.

38
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,910
If I miss the opportunity this time,

39
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,250
will I need to wait that long again, you ask?

40
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,250
I don't know how it will turn out.

41
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,430
The orbit could potentially change due to gravity.

42
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,190
What's more important,

43
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,940
is if I don't go back this time,

44
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,170
there's a greater probability 
that I will disappear sooner or later.

45
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,340
I will probably end up dying.

46
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,100

47
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,520
 My Love From the Star 
17th Chronicle

48
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,610
Cheon Song Yi, the things that you want to do...

49
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,170
let's do everything in advance.

50
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,530
In advance?

51
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,440
Yeah, in advance.

52
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,490
Let's do everything within one month.

53
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,150
Why?

54
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,990
Why do we have to do everything within one month?

55
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,120
Huh?

56
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,580
Why?

57
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,670
Why do we have to do that?

58
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,810
Huh?

59
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,790
I...

60
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,070
have to leave.

61
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,320
What is that you're saying?

62
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,610
Leave what?

63
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,130
Where?

64
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,250
Where are you going?

65
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,140
To the place...

66
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,380
where I was originally.

67
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,420
In one month ...

68
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,840
I must return ...

69
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,310
to the place I came from.

70
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,500
You say you're going?

71
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,280
You say you're going back?

72
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,010
Yeah...

73
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,450
Okay.

74
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,680
Go ...

75
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,940
♫  Everything was obviously different.  ♫

76
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,830
But if you leave,
 ♫  Everything was obviously different.  ♫

77
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,540
♫  My world is divided between before and after knowing you.  ♫

78
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,920
when will you return?
 ♫  My world is divided between before and after knowing you.  ♫

79
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,160
Hm?

80
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,720
Tell me.
 ♫  When you breathe, a warm breeze blows.  ♫

81
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,410
I am good at waiting.

82
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,610
♫  When you smile a brlliant sun shines.  ♫

83
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,320
Huh?
 ♫  When you smile a brlliant sun shines.  ♫

84
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,320
1 year?
 ♫  Because you are there,  ♫

85
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,420
2 years?
 ♫  Because it's you.  ♫

86
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,990
10 years?
 ♫  Because sometimes you quietly lean on my shoulder.  ♫

87
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,220
♫  I am here. I am really completely happy.  ♫

88
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,520
You're not coming back?
♫  Because it's following you, time   ♫

89
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,620
You're not coming back after you go?
♫  Because it's following you, time   ♫

90
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,180
So, you're not coming back.
♫  flows and stops.   ♫

91
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,020
Yeah...
♫   If I am allowed to gaze at you   ♫

92
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,520
Is that why you said that?
♫   I see you.   ♫

93
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,420
That you were being selfish and all that? 
♫   I can't do   ♫

94
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,890
Is that why you said that, you jerk?
♫  anything else.   ♫

95
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,860
You are really...!

96
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,520
You're the worst of all the numerous jerks I've met.
♫   I wish I could be there for your every second.   ♫

97
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,820
1 month?

98
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,850
1 month?

99
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:50,780
♫  If I could be every moment in front of you  ♫

100
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,420
You've worked hard. Good job.

101
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,290
- You've worked hard, Noona. 
- You've worked hard, Unni.

102
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,320
You're going back to Seoul, right? 
Let me get a ride.

103
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,780
I'll be going home then.

104
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,160
You've worked hard.

105
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
Hey, Cheon Song Yi.

106
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,620
Can you turn off the music?
 I'm not in the mood to listen to music.

107
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,130
Ok.

108
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,770
Excuse me, Beom Yi, but this is  My Car?

109
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,130
Sorry.

110
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,800
She said she's not in the mood to listen to music.

111
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,900
Perhaps...

112
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,020
do you have "Like being shot?"

113
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,450
No.

114
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,030
"I'll get lost, so you can live well."
No...

115
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,050
Do you have "Even if I die, I can't let you go"?

116
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,020
 This century's brightest comet "Ison" finally became extinct.

117
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,390
 As it neared the sun, Ison experienced nuclear fission

118
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,770
 and unable to escape from solar heat &amp; gravity, it was destroyed.

119
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,940
 However, "Deep South," a  comet which 
approaches the earth every 400 or so years

120
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,890
 is soon to intersect with Earth's orbit around the sun.

121
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:11,040
  According to NASA, Deep South's
 orbit is almost identical to Earth's...

122
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,840
Wait a sec!

123
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,640
 During the last ten days of this month, we're 
anticipating one of the best meteor showers in this century.

124
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,820
Hey, what's up with those sunglasses in the middle of the night?

125
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,600
Why's she like that?

126
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,120
Was she dumped by Min Joon?

127
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,210
This Manager Do, if I get my hands on him, he's dead.

128
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,420
It's true that Noona doesn't quite measure up to him.

129
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,460
Director!

130
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,960
Her phone is turned off.

131
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,870
Is Cheon Song Yi crazy?

132
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,690
Suddenly she took the submarine? 
(Did she disappear suddenly? )

133
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,870
She's doing this to take revenge for everyone
 leaving her alone all by herself last time, isn't she?

134
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,780
I think that is the case.

135
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,320
Hey, we're changing actresses.

136
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,000
I let a "has-been" have a part, and she gets sassy?

137
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,950
Who?

138
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,700
Ms. Cheon Song Yi's manager.

139
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,380
You came at a good time!

140
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,310
What are you doing now ...

141
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,920
Ms. Cheon Song Yi went to the hospital.

142
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,170
Due to the mistake this movie's 
special effects team made the last time,

143
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,840
Ms. Cheon Song Yi fell from the wire.

144
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,180
You all remember that accident, correct?

145
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,270
She had organ damage and pulmonary edema
 back then and had surgery.

146
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,030
Earlier, Director, you overworked her doing 9 no good takes.

147
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,010
While filming that action scene, for which you
 decided in the end to go with the first cut filmed,

148
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,400
it seems that her physical condition 
became worse.

149
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,720
Therefore, though she went the hospital with fever and
abdominal pain without having informed you first,

150
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,060
she is feeling extremely regretful for the fact that she 
disrupted the filming schedule.

151
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,270
Aigoo... people's physical well-being is important.

152
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,390
Things like schedules are there to be re-scheduled.

153
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,940
Let's re-schedule.

154
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,030
Yes.

155
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,750
Let's re-schedule, ok?

156

00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,470
  The number you dialed doesn't exist. 
Please check the number again...

158
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,640
Hyung, you are late.

159
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,080
Yeah.

160
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,950
Today was my volunteer day at the animal shelter.

161
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,460
I see.

162
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:48,620
Oh say ... Dad says you're winning
 an award for young business leaders.

163
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,550
Well, I'm not so qualified, but

164
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,920
it happened that way, I guess.

165
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,100
Congrats.

166
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,270
In any case, you're amazing, Hyung.

167
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,680
Oh, that's right.

168
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,100
I'm going with Mom to visit Big  Hyung's grave tomorrow.

169
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,550
If you have time, won't you go with us?

170
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,690
What a pity...

171
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,630
I have many appointments tomorrow.

172
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,800
I will go on my own later.

173
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,430
Big Hyung will be sad.

174
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,810
He liked you a lot more than me.

175
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,890
Rest up.

176
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,960
Okay.

177
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,790
 Hey, don't just keep on crying
 but open the door and let's talk.

178
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,090
  Please look at me.

179
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,130
 A grandmother's wish was granted.

180
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:07,590
 I learned how to love.

181
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,010
 That was a terrible thing.

182
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,090
 I am hurt.

183
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,660
 I am saying my heart aches.

184
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,990
 Please help me.

185
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,960
 Hey, where are you going so early in the morning?

186
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,610
 Jogging because I feel stifled.

187
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,560
Let's talk.

188
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,570
I have nothing to talk about.

189
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,320
Shouldn't you pick up your phone? 
Why didn't you pick up my call?

190
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,620
What's the use of answering your call?

191
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,750
Didn't you say you would leave? 
 Didn't you say you would leave one month from now?

192
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,620
This is why I said "We can't be together,"

193
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,560
Right, that's why I gave up first! 
I told you I won't think about you anymore.

194
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,750
But then you suddenly appeared 
and said you'd be working for me as my manager.

195
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,490
You levitated me into the air and then kissed me.

196
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,850
Who was the one who did that?!

197
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,650
It's because you got me worried.  
Why would you contract with that weirdo?

198
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,580
Why's Jae Kyeong oppa a weirdo?

199
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,250
And then there's a rumor that you're getting engaged.

200
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,440
I should just go right ahead.  Bam!

201
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,120
What?

202
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,550
Why does it matter? To the gentleman
 who will leave 1 month later.

203
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,510
On the day you leave, I'm going to grab 
whoever is around and get engaged, as if just to show you.

204
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,720
You think that makes sense now?

205
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,500
Hello.

206
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,420
 Song Yi, where are you?

207
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,080
Ah, I am jogging.

208
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,400
 Don't work so hard yet.

209
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,170
It's not that hard, where are you?

210
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,450
Stop there!

211
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,790
Professor!

212
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,380
Omo, I was right.

213
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,020
To see you in this kind of a place!

214
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,970
Who are you...

215
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,640
Hey... Don't you know me?

216
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm Go Hye Mi.

217
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,560
Last year and the year before too,
 the one who received extensions for your class...

218
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,420
After meeting you for the first time,

219
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,380
I used to say you look sooo much like my ex-boyfriend, "Samdong"

220
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,720
Oh...

221
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,560
You did?

222
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,990
I intentionally turned in a blank test paper and got an "F"
so that I could retake your class.

223
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,160
Don't you really remember me?

224
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,670
I'm not sure ...

225
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,220
No way, I feel so disappointed now.

226
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,630
I almost got kicked out of the house from getting an F.

227
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,710
Since I see you now, I feel like I kind of remember.

228
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,440
Perhaps...

229
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,680
you couldn't recognize me because I got
 a little prettier from last year.

230
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,250
I lost some baby fat,

231
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,980
and I hear that I look more mature these days.

232
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:17,110
Omo, you have something on the face. Like a baby.

233
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,230
Wait a minute...

234
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,760
I am okay.

235
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,150
Professor, are you okay?
 Aren't you hurt?

236
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,940
Yeah.

237
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,540
I am okay.

238
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,040
Professor, did you buy a cell phone? 
You were carrying around only a pager before.

239
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,520
You've progressed a lot.

240
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,280
It happened that way.

241
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,060
If so, then ...

242
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,690
Can't you let me know your number?

243
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,170
I will text you later.

244
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,220
That is a bit...

245
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,640
Please?

246
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,690
Please?

247
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,120
Please let me know.

248
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,720
Okay? Huh?

249
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,400
Please let me know. Okay?

250
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,500
010-...

251
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,560
Mr. Do Min Joon, didn't you say
 you had something to say to me?

252
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,310
Huh? Yeah.

253
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,070
What are you going to do? I have time right now.

254
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,850
Are you going to say it now or never see me again? Decide!

255
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,290
Well.... ta-take it easy.

256
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,930
What's up with that "sun-cap" ahjumma?

257
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,750
Looking like a fake Cheon Song Yi.

258
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,510
What happens if you don't leave?

259
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,880
What happens if you don't leave, I said!

260
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,660
Can't you...

261
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,540
not leave?

262
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,020
Okay.

263
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,240
I don't know where it is, let's just say 
your hometown is somewhere.

264
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,390
But is there a rule that says a person 
must live in his or her hometown?

265
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,860
They say a half of the residents 
of Seoul are not even from Seoul.

266
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:09,320
They say that though everyone has families in other cities,
they regard Seoul as their second home and live here.

267
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,070
This is not at that level.

268
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,770
I don't care, what "level" exactly is the problem.

269
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,450
I don't care.

270
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,770
I don't want to know either.

271
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,950
You've lived here for several hundred years, you said!

272
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,320
Why now, of all occasions?

273
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,610
You've lived here fine all this time,

274
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,280
and as soon as you meet me.
 Just when we're trying to do something.

275
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,090
We haven't even been able to have a proper date yet.

276
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,000
Why are you leaving now?

277
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,040
Can't you just...

278
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,530
stay here together with me?

279
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,080
If you aren't going to do that, don't make me waver.

280
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,280
if you just leave, that's that,

281
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,340
but I have to keep living here.

282
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,700
Here... in the place where you were then disappeared.

283
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,020
♫   The person calling you like that is me.  ♫

284
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,080
So...

285
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,820
If you are going to go, go quietly.
♫   The tears which are falling   ♫

286
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,590
Just leave me be.
♫  for no reason are love.  ♫

287
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:28,940
  ♫ You were always by my side  ♫

288
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,090
If you want,
 ♫  but I didn't know it was you.  ♫

289
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,990
♫ Why am I saying sad things to you,  ♫

290
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,420
I will do that.
♫  to you who were waiting?  ♫

291
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:49,550
 ♫ How many more tears like today's are left? ♫

292
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:57,930
 ♫ I don't know love or farewells, will you tell me? ♫

293
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:06,740
 ♫ Rain drops keep turning into tears, blocking my vision ♫

294
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,350
He was about my age...when oldest brother had his accident.

295
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,290
That's true.

296
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,900
I wondered if it would be possible to live after losing a child,

297
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,450
yet this much time has passed.

298
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,530
However.....wasn't oldest brother unable to drink?

299
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,260
That's how I know it to be.

300
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,830
That's right.

301
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,420
Then why did he drink and drive that night?

302
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,080
The next day was my graduation. 
He said that he would definitely be there.

303
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,940
Back then your oldest brother was suffering from depression.

304
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,370
We found out later after hearing his autopsy report.

305
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,770
Chemicals were detected.

306
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,680
It was medication for depression.

307
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,680
That was because things weren't going well with the girl he liked.

308
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:12,590
So  we suspected ... perhaps.... 
he may have made the ultimate decision.

309
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,780
The older brother I know wasn't that kind of person.

310
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,490
Something...went wrong.

311
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,930
  The country that sells weapons punished. 
U.S. states its firm position.

312
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,650
 The first son Yi Han Kyeong of "S &amp; C" group
 dies from drunk driving.

313
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:50,720
 Amitriptyline, chlorpheniramine (antidepressants)

314
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,030
 "Late Han Yoo Ra autopsy result shows
Anxiolytics and antidepressants..."

315
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,440
 Amitriptyline, chlorpheniramine (antidepressants)
allegedly used by the late actress...

316
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,490
I'm the one who called you, Lee Hui Kyeong.

317
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,200
Nice to meet you. Se Mi has told me a lot about you.

318
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,180
What is the reason for you to be telling me this?

319
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,310
In any case, he is your brother.

320
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,770
I feel the need to stop him from anything further,
 because he is my brother.

321
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,680
In order to do that, I need to know precisely

322
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,770
how far his acts have extended.

323
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,940
"Haneul" Mental Hospital
Seoul, Yongsan
Tel: 02 8752 3426

324
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,300
Here.

325
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,030
You eat all the meat.

326
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,810
I'm just gonna eat the collagen.

327
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,450
You do the oddest things.

328
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,000
Tomorrow let's go eat pork rinds.

329
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,790
I really can't get any older.

330
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,190
If that's your goal, then you shouldn't be drinking any soju.

331
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,250
I'm drinking this because I'm suffering.

332
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,810
Anyhow, you got your way back into the movie scene.

333
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,290
You met your father who you had been missing so dearly.

334
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,810
What is bothering you?

335
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,880
Let's have a drink.

336
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,410
You know I can't drink alcohol.

337
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,640
What does it matter when it's just the two of us together?

338
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,140
Don't internalize it. Drink this and let it out.

339
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,190
It would have been nice if it never started.

340
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,210
What can you do now that it has already been started?

341
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:24,390
You asked me about it some time ago,

342
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:31,720
How I lived alone for so long.

343
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,030
Was it not lonesome, you asked.

344
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,830
I did.

345
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:42,010
It wasn't that lonely when I was living alone.

346
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,100
However, after gaining a person to love for the first time,

347
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,900
realizing that I'll have to leave where she is 
now I'm truly lonely.

348
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,720
As if I were the only one left in the universe.

349
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:16,500
If I could turn back time, I would turn it back,

350
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,070
to the time I haven't met him yet,

351
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,660
then it would really be nice.

352
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:30,420
Then I wouldn't waver regardless of how
 much he tried to move me.

353
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,840
I wouldn't like him.

354
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,950
Just thinking about the day when he's not here,

355
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,370
I feel like I'm going to die from the loneliness.

356
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,270
What's going on with the lights?

357
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,640
No...Professor...

358
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,010
You should stop now.

359
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,700
It's so dark.

360
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,500
What should I.....really do?

361
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,360
Is it a blackout?

362
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,560
Yoon Jae, look for some candles.

363
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,530
What is this?

364
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,140
I shouldn't have given him any alcohol.

365
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,490
I thought he would make a couple objects levitate or something.

366
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,180
Things have gotten out of hand.

367
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,570
There isn't much time left.

368
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,240
What?

369
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,990
Why must I be here?

370
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,980
Why must I.....with you Lawyer Jang

371
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,820
waste this precious time?

372
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,080
I understand how you feel...

373
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,470
There is no need to speak in that manner.

374
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:58,560
For me, even one hour, one minute, 
and one second is precious.

375
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,190
Why am I, during this time as precious as my own blood,

376
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,990
with ... Lawyer Jang ...

377
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,510
This isn't where I want to be.

378
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,860
I'm saying it's not here!

379
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,670
Seriously, they say alcohol is the serum of truth.

380
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,660
Now I understand your true nature.

381
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,460
30 years of friendship is nothing.

382
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,540
It's useless in front of a woman.

383
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,990
Professor.

384
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,590
Why are you there?

385
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,530
What are you doing?

386
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,680
Move!

387
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,430
Huh?

388
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,790
I came out here to see Cheon Song Yi's picture once.

389
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,340
Why is  the faux-naif 100th level person there?
I said move over!

390
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,610
That's my Cheon Song Yi's spot!

391
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,740
Ah seriously, let's go inside.

392
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,420
You don't have anywhere else to spend your strength?

393
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,860
Aishh!

394
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:27,580
I shouldn't have given him alcohol. What am I going to do?

395
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,570
Move...

396
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,940
Ah, he scared me!

397
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,110
When did you come in? And with whose permission?

398
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,240
Hurry up and get up.

399
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,320
Get up now and leave.

400
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,460
One, two, three...

401
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,880
I warned you this much, yet you still don't understand?

402
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,590
Can't be helped. I did all I could.

403
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,100
What's wrong with him?

404
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,630
Didn't he say he never drinks alcohol?

405
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,280
I...

406
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,600
don't want to be with you, Lawyer Jang.

407
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,160
I...

408
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,730
I...?

409
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:57,180
I...

410
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,200
Who do you want to be with?

411
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,090
Who do you want to be with?

412
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,540
Cheon Song Yi...

413
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,560
 Downtown Gangnam Seoul: 
Blackout for One Minute Due to an Unknown Cause

414
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,570
The type of people I hate the most

415
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,250
are those who don't remember anything after drinking.

416
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:50,100
Drank so much that he's in someone else's bed,

417
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:53,830
and he can't remember what he did last night.

418
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,630
Why are humans humans?

419
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,120
It's because they have free will.

420
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,720
But, they lose themselves to a substance called "alcohol,"

421
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,760
so they do something against their will.

422
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,510
Ah...

423
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,870
 What... happened?

424
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,310
Exactly. What happened? Do Min Joon.

425
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,790
No, I remember exactly that...

426
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,960
That you drank so much that you were knocked out on my bed.

427
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,500
I don't remember that well...

428
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,600
I really did that?

429
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,060
I couldn't have...

430
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,520
I can't remember.

431
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,020
That's why you said you wouldn't drink even if you had to die, Do Min Joon.

432
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,090
Because you end up teleporting to random places,

433
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,190
and can't even remember what has happened.

434
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,260
Stay a little farther.

435
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,210
Because you're this close...
-Because I'm this close, what?

436
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,330
I...

437
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,150
can't even think straight.

438
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,210
Then how about this?

439
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,460
Go. Let's never see each other again.

440
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,740
Are you joking?

441
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,250
Then why did you just do that?

442
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,190
--You are mad right?
--What?

443
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,420
That's just  how I feel.

444
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,540
I wasn't doing anything, but you 
shook me up so that I can't even think straight.

445
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,430
Then you say, "I need to go. I can't come back."

446
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,210
Doing that.

447
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,090
Do you know how selfish and mean that is?

448
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,940
You need to know that.

449
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,810
 Song Yi! Mom is coming in.

450
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,640
You can't!

451
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,600
 Why?

452
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,650
I'm not in the mood to talk.

453
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,390
Go!

454
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,190
 Did I ask you to talk?

455
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,820
 I was just going to use your lotion.

456
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,760
I ran out of lotion, too.

457
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,720
Leave me alone so I can rest.

458
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,910
 You stingy girl.

459
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,220
What the..? Why aren't you leaving?

460
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,940
You are good at that. Teleport. Hurry up and leave.

461
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,860
Well... I can't.

462
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,830
What? You came in that way.

463
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,900
Why can't you go?

464
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,990
Mom and Yoon Jae are outside. What are you going to do?

465
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,320
Just a minute.

466
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,820
Why am I like this?

467
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,060
Is it because of a hangover?

468
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,690
What? Isn't the supernatural alien thing all a lie?

469
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,790
Don't make me talk.

470
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,260
Don't tell me that it's because of that
 small kiss that your power isn't working?

471
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,180
That's not it!

472
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,730
What kind of superpowers work on and off?

473
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,170
After kissing, you get sick to death.

474
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,130
You are not much better than an Earthling.

475
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,570
This girl is really...

476
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,440
What superpowers... Oh my god. You scared me.

477
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,860
Who were you talking to?

478
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,710
Talk to whom? What are you saying?

479
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,160
Then you were talking to yourself like that?  Very suspicious.

480
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,950
I got the trophy last year at the acting award ceremony. 
 (getting an award and suspicion are homonyms).

481
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,600
Won't you get out?

482
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,640
Ah, right. Yoon Jae, did you try calling Dad?

483
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,860
I gave you his number a while ago.

484
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,870
I told you.   He's Dad to you, but I don't even remember him.

485
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,600
Why should anything change now, making things awkward?

486
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,540
Hey. Even if it's awkward, he can't stop being your dad.

487
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,080
No matter how comfortable you are with, 
the next door neighbor is your next door neighbor,

488
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,980
and no matter how awkward, our dad is our dad.

489
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,090
You think you were dropped from the sky?

490
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,500
Hey. Are you some sort of an alien?

491
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,150
Hi.

492
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,560
Aren't you going to get in trouble for this later on?

493
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,510
You don't even have the authority to
 prosecute the case nor have you submitted a warrant now...

494
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,390
I'm putting my neck on the line for this one.

495
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,990
And the fact that I was transferred to 
the Criminal Trial Department,

496
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,440
they (Jae Kyeong's side) probably know this by now, 
so they will have relaxed their guard.

497
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,990
This is the perfect timing to get the evidence.

498
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,140
He's unexpectedly aggressive.

499
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,000
Prosecutor.

500
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,990
I have a court order for searching the facility.

501
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,500
Show me the #2 ward, please.

502
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,790
Hurry up.

503
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,790
We've specifically told you already
 that there's no such patient.

504
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,510
How are you going to compensate for this damage?

505
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,800
Min Joon Hyung.

506
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,170
Oh, Yoon Jae. Are you going somewhere?

507
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,010
Yes, to my mom's house.

508
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:04,350
Noona's in her lowest mood, so it's tiring to be with her.

509
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,020
Okay, see you later.

510
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,630
Hyung.

511
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,850
My Noona may look like a strong person,

512
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,560
totally not minding anything.

513
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,990
She's not like that, though.

514
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,670
Actually, she's very soft-hearted.

515
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:22,290
I don't know what happened between you two,

516
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,530
but she hasn't eaten for a few days,

517
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,070
and hasn't slept.

518
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:53,860
 ♫ Finally, I recognized you at first sight. ♫

519
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,340
 Do Min Joon, what are you doing right now?

520
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:05,520
  ♫ Everything was obviously different. 
My world was divided ♫

521
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,870
 Why do I feel... like we're wasting time...

522
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,380
 1 month, no, even 10 days are okay. So let's...

523
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,760
 I... really like yo...

524
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,420

525
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,920
Do Min Joon...

526
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,230
 Do Min Joon, are you listening?

527
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,770
Yes,

528
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,070
I'm listening.

529
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,700
 I don't know if you're listening or not,

530
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,000
 but I have something to say.

531
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,150
I have thought about it deeply. . .

532
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,970
I think I overreacted a lot.

533
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,330
Starting when I was young, I'm usually. . .

534
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,020
I was famous for being spontaneous and for being fickle.

535
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,630
I...

536
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,880
I have never liked a singer till the end.

537
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,760
I liked H.O.T.,

538
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,740
then liked Sechs Kies,

539
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,040
then liked g.o.d. then liked Shinhwa. . .

540
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,170
You see, I. . .

541
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,760
even for the fan clubs, there were 5 times. . .

542
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,040
that I probably switched around?

543
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,500
Anyway,

544
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,460
I am not consistent.

545
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,360
 I thought about it,

546
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,020
 I...

547
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,620
 I think I would be able to forget you right away.

548
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,210
 So, help me to not regret anything.

549
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,040
If I send you away without doing anything,

550
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:12,600
I think I would have some regrets.

551
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,110
So,

552
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,500
as others, 3 months, 1 year,

553
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,160
2 years, what they do in that time. . .

554
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,910
As you said,

555
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,360
let's do everything in one month.

556
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,480
So...

557
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,750
if we do everything that we want to do together,

558
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,440
even before the month is over,

559
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,590
I might get tired of you.

560
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:09,760
I'm usually that kind of kid.

561
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,040
 Do Min Joon.

562
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,950
What is it?

563
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:22,350
 Do Min Joon...

564
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,910
What is it, Cheon Song Yi?

565
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,930
So that I would be able to forget well,

566
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,860
without any regrets. . .

567
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:40,810
So that I can forget you well.

568
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,470
Please help me.

569
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,920
Okay.

570
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,130
But...

571
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,970
How can I. . .

572
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,050
forget you?

573
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,650
Did you hear me?

574
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,990
Are you listening?

575
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,440
Let's go on a trip tomorrow.

576
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:31,620
If we stick together for the whole day,

577
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,560
I might get tired of you.

578
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,030
I could dislike you.

579
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,550
Are you listening to my words?

580
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:00,250
 Let's go, on a trip.

581
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,640
You said to meet when it's bright.

582
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,450
It's still dawn.

583
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,380
Then what about you?

584
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,400
I...well...

585
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,280
Just in case I'd be late.

586
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,040
Me too.

587
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,180
Shall we go?

588
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,240
I guess...

589
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:03,400
Just. . . what's the point of leaving it alone.

590
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,290
Let's at least hold hands.

591
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,980
Well...

592
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,340
Let's do so.

593
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,150
Okay, find another hospital.

594
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,670
But then,

595
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,630
who could be the person who
 told the Prosecutor about that hospital?

596
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,420
A single person,

597
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,900
I have one in mind.

598
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,640
Call me later.

599
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,190
Hyung, do you have some time?

600
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,750
Why?

601
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,870
What is this about?

602
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,030
There is someone that you must. . .

603
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,900
see, that's why.

604
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,990
You open it, Hyung.

605
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,840
I'm out to eat right now, so I'll call you-

606
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,480
--What?
-- Yang Min Joo has disappeared.

607
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:42,010
How did that happen?

608
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,620
Go inside.

609
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,230
Sister-in-law is waiting.

610
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:25,450
She says she has...

611
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,870
a lot to ask you.

612
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,480
 Song Yi, where are you?

613
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,250
 Ah, I'm jogging right now.

614
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,280
 Don't overdo it.

615
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,540
 I'm not, where are you?

616
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,050
 Won't you stop there!

617
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,810
 Are you with Do Min Joon?

618
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,900
 Last time in the hospital,

619
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,350
  if I wasn't hallucinating because I hurt my head,

620
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:06,170
 Do Min Joon, you...

621
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:08,750
 suddenly appeared in front of me.

622
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,440
 That's right.

623
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,860
 12 years ago, that day...

624
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,930
  you disappeared really fast

625
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,400
  and were standing across the street.

626
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,420
 That time, also.

627
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,190
 You're right.

628
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,810
 At first, you were strange. . .

629
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:30,110
 and a dangerous person, that's what I thought.

630
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,910
 You. . .

631
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,580
 when you told me to protect Song Yi from my brother,

632
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:38,170
 I definitely thought you had something planned.

633
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,120
 But,

634
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,250
 now I know.

635
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,050
 Why you told me those words.

636
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:51,560
 The accident that Song Yi had not too long ago,

637
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,020
 it seems like it was my brother's doing.

638
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,970
 I know.

639
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:59,420
 I think his wife is locked up in a hospital.

640
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,310
 So that I can take my sister-in-law out,

641
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,200
 help me.

642
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,430
 If I meet my sister-in-law,

643
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,650
 I will be able to know many more things.

644
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,320
 Investigate the hospital.

645
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,050
 They will probably get my sister-in-law out.

646
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,700
 Because she is someone who's not on the list of patients.

647
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,430
 Yes, I understand.

648
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,990
 Yang Min Joo disappeared.

649
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,760
I also have many things to ask you, Hyung.

650
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,180
All right.

651
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,730
I got it.

652
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,750
 In any case, thanks.

653
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,990
What is it? Who?

654
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:40,140
By chance, was it the young girl who we met at the park?

655
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,060
That girl who tried to talk cute to get your number?

656
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,380
No.

657
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:46,000
Then a different girl?

658
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,070
I told you it isn't.

659
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:55,560
I have to rehearse  my script. Will you help me, Manager Do?

660
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,610
I can't do acting.

661
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:06,650
I'm not asking you to act. Just be my rehearsal partner.

662
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,420
All my managers did that for me before as well.

663
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,470
Scene 71?

664
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:13,070
Yeah.

665
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,890
Don't go on a diet.

666
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:19,990
Didn't I tell you repeatedly?

667
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:24,090
I don't even want 1 gram of you to disappear.

668
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,560
For me, you're perfect just the way you are.

669
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,630
You're the prettiest one of all the women I know.

670
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:34,370
Young kids are just noisy and  bothersome. I don't need-

671
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,820
Why are the lines like this?

672
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,780
It's usually like that. Next line.

673
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,580
He back hugs me.

674
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,280
Why is the script like this? Seriously.

675
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,080
And... you will do all these when you film?

676
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,680
I have to. There's no way around it.

677
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:55,710
Ah then, should we try rehearsing?

678
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:58,050
Try doing what?

679
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,800
Then next dialogue.

680
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,430
You aren't going to do it?

681
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,870
Let's stop.

682
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,710
Why?

683
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:26,000
Where are you going? Let's go together.

684
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,370
I'm staying right beside you all day long...

685
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:37,710
Did you get tired of me?

686
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:43,650
  It is my noona's first time actually dating. 
So she really doesn't know anything.

687
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:48,760
Me being like this is, like I said, for the sake of me 
trying to become tired of you as quickly as possible.

688
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,850
Once we know everything about each other, 
then the fantasies about each other will be gone.

689
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:56,030
In truth, it's not like I've dated only once or twice.

690
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,760
It's obvious what goes on between a man and a woman, no?

691
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,130
 Even when Father left us, I heard that Noona 
was the one who had a harder time compared to Mom.

692
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:04,460
 She has a lot of regrets and a lot of affection.

693
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,100
  That kind of style.

694
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:10,760
 She likes puppies so much, but she doesn't have one. 
Why? Because something might happen to it.

695
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,340
 Because she is afraid of that.

696
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,420
I've done my share of playing in the past.

697
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:20,420
So I won't be saying futile things like 
"love should be like this" and "I regret that."

698
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:25,810
Although I may not look like it,
 I am a very logical and tidy person.

699
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,070
Do Min Joon!

700
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,850
Do Min Joon!

701
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,490
Do Min Joon!

702
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,890
Do Min Joon!

703
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,550
Do Min Joon!

704
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:14,070
Do Min Joon!

705
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,510
Do Min Joon!

706
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,490
Why are you calling me like that?

707
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,940
Where did you go?

708
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,590
I went out for a walk because I felt stifled.

709
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,970
I was scared.

710
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:35,040
I thought you left.

711
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,190
Where will I go?

712
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,830
I feel like you're just going to leave.

713
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:46,270
What I am saying is if you leave, you will leave, but

714
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:49,830
I am worried that you will leave 
without telling me or saying goodbye.

715
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:56,630
I know I'm logical and all that, but...
 if you go without saying goodbye...

716
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,240
I won't go.

717
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:05,420
I won't leave you and go. I will stay here.

718
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,490
What are you saying?

719
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,800
I said I won't go.

720
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,210
Even after one month or two months.

721
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:19,510
So, don't be anxious.

722
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,040
Is it okay for you

723
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,400
not to go?

724
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:34,340
 What is more important is... if I don't return this time,

725
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,900
 the probability that I'll disappear will increase.

726
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,160
 I will probably die.

727
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,060
It is okay.

728
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:49,130
Is it really okay?

729
00:56:49,700 --> 00:57:04,850
 ♫ You are my destiny. You are.
 You are my destiny. You are. ♫

730
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:12,660
 ♫ You are my everything. While I only see you, ♫

731
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:19,690
 ♫ Silently, I call out to you. ♫

732
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:28,330
 ♫ You are my love. You. ♫

733
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,910
  Don't go on a diet.

734
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:37,510
  Didn't I tell you repeatedly?

735
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:43,910
  Young kids are just noisy and bothersome.

736
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,830
  I don't need them.

737
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:55,650
  He kisses me.

738
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:03,670
  He can't. What if he becomes really sick again?

739
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:13,440
  He back-hugs me.

740
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:46,710
  Without going anywhere, 
I will stay by your side for a long, long time.

741
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,660
  You aren't going to do it?

742
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,780
  Let's stop.

743
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,110
  Why?

744
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,350
  Where are you going? Let's go together.

745
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:05,690
