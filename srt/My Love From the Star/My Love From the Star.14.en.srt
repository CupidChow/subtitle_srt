If I die, Cheon Song-yi will die too.

672
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,580
Do you think I didn't have any backups

673
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,320
while playing a game with a guy like you?

674
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:20,390
Even if you kill me, you can't stop me.

675
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,060
If I die, you’ll die too!

676
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,730
Then,

677
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:29,530
no one can protect her.

678
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,440
Are you okay with it?

679
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:38,140
You’d better pray that she will be safe.

680
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,910
If something happens to her,

681
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:43,610
I'll be back to kill you.

682
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,380
You said that you may lose a lot, right?

683
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,950
You will know what it feels like.

684
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:55,620
Eventually you will lose everything.

685
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:00,460
You will know what destruction is.

686
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,130
How dare you…

687
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:07,330
I'll show you

688
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,570
who you irritated.

689
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,290
The surgery was successful,

690
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:29,350
but there was a lot of bleeding.

691
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,890
And pulmonary edema.

692
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:34,130
She’ll need a respirator until she stabilizes.

693
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:37,300
She needs to be hospitalized for a period.

694
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,630
What about her safety?

695
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,600
Is she safe now?

696
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,700
Let's see.

697
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,070
If her breathing returns in two days,

698
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,810
then you have nothing to worry about.

699
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,670
She was very lucky.

700
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,380
Thank you.

701
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:01,850
Thank you.

702
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:06,190
You saved Song-yi's life.

703
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:09,460
I'm leaving.

704
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,660
Call me if anything happens.

705
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:18,040
Stay until Song-yi wakes up.

706
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,340
She wouldn't want to see me.

707
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,780
You are always like this.

708
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,680
Why can’t you understand others’ heart?

709
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,920
Do you know how much Song-yi missed her dad?

710
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,950
How could you not come for once just

711
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:39,590
because she said she doesn't want to see you?

712
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:43,760
You're the one who's colder than I am.

713
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:51,730
Aren't you going to say hi to dad?

714
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,230
You said that I have no dad.

715
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:02,540
You didn't even leave a single picture.

716
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,970
Dad.

717
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,020
When I was scared, I always called dad.

718
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,450
Action.

719
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,060
Dad.

720
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:04,770
But now I call someone else's name.

721
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,740
Do Min-joon.

722
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:21,450
For the first time, I love someone more than dad.

723
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:33,300
I want to share my entire life with him.

724
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:41,170
♫ I sing your name over and over ♫

725
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:49,450
♫ My tears create an ocean of love ♫

726
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:58,620
♫ You're always by my side but I don’t know ♫

727
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:59,020
No matter how much he wants to push me away

728
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:07,100
♫ I hold you waiting for long//telling sad stories ♫

729
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:02,590
I can’t walk away.

730
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:07,970
Even if I try to hate him,

731
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:15,810
♫ How many such tears are left ♫

732
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:11,440
I can’t do it.

733
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:19,480
I keep dreaming a sad dream,

734
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:24,080
♫ Tell me, to love or to leave ♫

735
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,880
where he loves me very much.

736
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:32,390
♫ The rain turns into tears that interrupt my sight ♫

737
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:40,670
♫ Where am I? How many ♫

738
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:47,510
♫ such tears are left? I have no answer ♫

739
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,930
I keep dreaming a sad dream.
