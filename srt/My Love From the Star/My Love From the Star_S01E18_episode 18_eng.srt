1
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,250
Do Min Joon!

2
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,360
Do Min Joon!

3
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,390
♫  If you allow me again  ♫

4
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,020
Do Min Joon!

5
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:06,660
♫    If I may be able to see you again.  ♫

6
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,370
Do Min Joon!

7
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,490
♫     In my memory of the past  ♫

8
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,070
Why are you calling me like that?

9
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,430
♫    Out of the pain, I'm calling you.  ♫

10
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,110
Where have you been?

11
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,800
I went out for a bit because I felt stifled.

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,580
You scared me.
♫   You are my destiny  ♫

13
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,230
I thought you'd left.

14
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,720
Where would I go?

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,010
It feels like you're going to leave.  
♫   You are my destiny ♫

16
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,610
I'm not going.

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,140
I'm not going anywhere with you here.
 ♫    You are   ♫

18
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,280
I'll stay here. 
♫    You are my everything   ♫

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,020
What do you mean?

20
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,330
I said I'm not going. 
♫    While I am looking at you.  ♫

21
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,780
Even after 1 month or 2 months.
 ♫   Silently,   ♫

22
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,760
So don't be anxious.  
♫     I call out to you.   ♫

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,460
Is it okay 
♫    You're the one, my love. ♫

24
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,610
for you not to go?

25
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,130
♫    You are.   ♫

26
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,050
It's okay. 
  ♫    You're     ♫

27
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,950
Is it really...
 ♫    the one , my love. ♫

28
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,600
okay? 
 ♫    You are.   ♫

29
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,760
♫   You're my delight of all ♫

30
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:16,580
♫   You're my love for eternity ♫

31
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,860
What's wrong?

32
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,220
- Let's go. 
- Where to?

33
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,560
A place where it's enclosed by walls. With a roof over it.

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,860
A place where it's dark and no one can see.

35
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,160
A place where only you and I can be.

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,380
What?

37
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,650
You heard everything I said to Yoon Jae?

38
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,360

39
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,710
If you brought guests, you should've told me in advance.

40
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,590
If I told you in advance,

41
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,910
I thought you wouldn't come.

42
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,110
Long time no see.

43
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,280
It's been 7 years.

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,160
Because it has been 7 years since you locked me up.

45
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,450
What did you say?

46
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,500
In the last 7 years, Yang Min Joo

47
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,810
... was  locked up against her will;
 at the mental hospital in Yong San.

48
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,380
I see.

49
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,180
And also,  Lee Jae Kyeong . . .

50
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,470
You are here today as the suspect for illegally 
confining Yang Min Joo against her will.

51
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,450
I am?

52
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,780
Why would I do such  a thing?

53
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,720
Don't you think you've come here in a group
having listened to only one side of the story?

54
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,340
Not to mention,

55
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,220
to the words of a person who doesn't have a sound mind.

56
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm perfectly fine! I'm not crazy!

57
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,600
I...

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,830
thought you were living well studying abroad.

59
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,430
You said you would go, so I sent you there.

60
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,540
You must have been surprised, Hui Kyeong.

61
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,790
But, I think you've misunderstood.

62
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,310
It's something that has nothing to do with me.

63
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,860
Hyung, tell the truth.

64
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,990
What truth?

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,400
Oh, what should I do? I have something else scheduled.

66
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,700
If there's anything else you want to 
investigate, I will try to make time with my lawyer.

67
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,900
- What the heck are you doing?
- Do you really not have anything to say?

68
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,360
- About what?
-About sister-in-law and Han Yoo Ra.

69
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,900
And also,

70
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,490
about the eldest brother.

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,580
Have you...

72
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,820
gone mad?

73
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,600
Why would I have anything to say regarding them?

74
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,730
This was the last.

75
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,760
Before I gave up on you,

76
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,710
the last step.

77
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,020
- What?
-To the Hyung that I liked,

78
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,480
and respected,

79
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,110
I wanted to give you a chance. 
A last chance to at least come up with excuses.

80
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,850
Even if I had to force myself, 
I wanted to understand you.

81
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,580
But, now, I've completely given up . . .

82
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,350
. . .   on you.

83
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,930
And also,

84
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,700
I'm

85
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,170
giving up on calling you

86
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,390
my brother.

87
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,490
Now, you're...

88
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,980
not my Hyung.

89
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,120
But...there's only one room.

90
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,850
Who said that? There's the room next door, too.

91
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,190
You said the boiler doesn't work as well in there. 
I can't sleep if I'm cold.

92
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,010
Then, shall...I sleep there?

93
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,190
Why would you have to? It can't be helped.

94
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,450
This is a situation in which there is no other option.

95
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,850
Just sleep here.

96
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,880
This is not a situation that's quite so dire...

97
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,020
But, I'll warn you.

98
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,350
Kissing is absolutely forbidden.

99
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,770
You really can't.

100
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,430
Even though my dream was to become the 'Angel in white gown (Nightingale),' it gets a little exhausting to care for the sick.

101
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,050
What are you going on about? 
I wasn't going to do that anyway.

102
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,010
You can't guarantee about something 
that may happen in the future.

103
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,420
It's not a guarantee. 
I'm just saying that I will not do it at all.

104
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,030
I had no intention of doing so.

105
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,670
Really?

106
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,540
Then shall I rest easy and lie down in the same bed?

107
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,810
What's with your expression?

108
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,350
My expression?

109
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,810
Why has your face gone red?

110
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,940
Me?

111
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,680
-Why are your ears red?
-What?

112
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,250
-It's because I'm hot.
-You're hot?

113
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,520
It doesn't feel that way to me.

114
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,830
Okay then, let's say that it's because you're hot.

115
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,860
- Then, I'll lie down first.
- Huh?

116
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,970
Aren't you going to sleep?

117
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,180
Of course I should.

118
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,720
That other time, it wasn't a dream, was it?

119
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,250
That time when you let me rest my head
 on your arm, back on the cruise ship.

120
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,780
I don't know.

121
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,120
I'm right, aren't I? You kissed me.

122
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,530
 YOU  kissed  me.

123
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,760
In any case, we  did  have our first kiss that night.

124
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm sleepy.

125
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,530
Turn the light off.

126
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,550
There are advantages since you're an alien.

127
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,930
Move.

128
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,640
What? Can't you turn them off with your powers?

129
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,060
It's because my condition isn't good.

130
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,060
Okay, so come back here.

131
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,470
Some woman you are, so forward and pushy.

132
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,320
Don't you go around doing that elsewhere, too!

133
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,530
Do it again.

134
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,150
What?

135
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,030
What you just did.

136
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,370
What did I just do?
What sort of a woman shamelessly...

137
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,470
That's it. It's so cute.

138
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,650
Try doing it again.

139
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,490
-Oh-ho...
-Oh-ho.

140
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,170
Do it again!

141
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,850
You do it, you. . .

142
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,220
Okay, okay. I won't do it again.

143
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,230
What sort of a woman...

144
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,980
Where did he go that he's not 
even answering his phone?

145
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,540
 Although countless time has come and gone,

146
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,710
  the actual time I have left for myself isn't very much.

147
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,190
 Now I know it all too well

148
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,980
 that the length of time isn't important.

149
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:38,680
 What is important is with whom you spend that time.

150
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,330
 From now on, I will leave the time

151
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,160
 that I will spend only with this person.

152
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,960
 My  Love from the Star
 18th Chronicle

153
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,360
Get up now so we can eat breakfast.

154
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,950
Try levitating me.

155
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,180
What?

156
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,120
I mean,

157
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,270
like you did before, try to levitate me.

158
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,760
So that I will be standing in front of 
the bathroom sink when I open my eyes.

159
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,890
Don't mess around and just get up.

160
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,250
On that occasion, I was so flustered that
 I wondered what on earth was going on.

161
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,400
But thinking back, it was fascinating and fun.

162
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Do that once again for me, huh?

163
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,780
You can't?

164
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,260
Of course, it's not that it's prohibited . . .

165
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,600
Then, do it once.

166
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,960
Are you doing it?

167
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,920
How much do you weigh?

168
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,620
What does that matter? You did it last time.

169
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,460
It's working! It's working!

170
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,310
Is it over?

171
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,190
Can't you do more?

172
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,190
Looking at your face, it seems you can't.

173
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,560
It's because I just woke up.

174
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,610
Okay.

175
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,830
I shouldn't have asked for it.

176
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,560
I can get out on my own feet.

177
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,680
Don't worry about it.

178
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,360
Stay sitting. I'll bring it to you.

179
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,250
Isn't there anything I can help you with?

180
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,740
It's all done.

181
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,960
Not that.

182
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,490
About your abilities not working.

183
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,490
It...did work.

184
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,280
That was too short and it looked like it was difficult for you.

185
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,890
Should we try some medicine?  Do you think the one
 made from deer antlers will sit well with your body?

186
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,360
Wait, would ginseng be better?

187
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,930
I told you. Earlier, I'd just woken up.

188
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,190
And yesterday, I was tired...

189
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,800
But we didn't do anything yesterday. 
What would make you so tired?

190
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,260
You couldn't even turn the light off.

191
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,950
You may have many reasons to use
 your powers in the future.

192
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,180
What can we do?

193
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,540
It's uncomfortable. This sort of conversation.

194
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,810
No, no. Don't let it get you down!

195
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,580
There are times when you can and can't.

196
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,160
It must be because you were anxious. That must be it.

197
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,960
Don't feel down, Do Min Joon. Fighting.

198
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,300
Cheer up.

199
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,210
Don't.

200
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,760
I said, don't.

201
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,050
Don't!

202
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,030
It'll work.

203
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,710
Will it continue to not work or will it ...

204
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,300
Because I'm curious. 
Because it was fun, I want it to continue.

205
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,620
Hey! Cheon Song Yi, you...!

206
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,930
Where did you spend last night that
 you're only coming back now?

207
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,860
Ah, that... a film shoot ...

208
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,070
How dare you lie?

209
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,540
I already checked your whole  movie production schedule. 
 There wasn't any scene scheduled for you.

210
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,000
Manager Do, answer me.

211
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,860
You would know her schedule, right?

212
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,830
No way...you two, last night...

213
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,860
Were you two... Are you guys just coming back
 from a trip or something?

214
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,510
Mother, that's...

215
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,430
Talk to me. Me!

216
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,830
I forced him to come with me.

217
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,880
Do you think "who" instigated the trip is important?

218
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,090
The "going" is important. 
 The fact that you "went" is important!

219
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,290
I don't know if it's because you've been to Harvard 
and  influenced by the American culture.

220
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,600
I didn't raise my daughter like that.

221
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,650
How dare you take my daughter on an overnight trip?

222
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,740
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,170
Sorry? What do you have to be sorry about?

224
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,950
Cheon Song Yi, answer me.

225
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,570
Did my Min Joon grab your hand and 
drag you there by force?

226
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,810
No, I was the one who badgered him to go.

227
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,410
See.

228
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,890
Then, Manager Do, answer me.

229
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,980
Are you going to marry my Song Yi?

230
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,820
-What do you mean...
-What?

231
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,610
Gee, I wonder why he can't answer.

232
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,510
You couldn't have gone on the trip without
having thought about that honorable intention?

233
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,290
In the future, keep your son in line well, please.

234
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,080
Without any plans for the future, I don't think this is proper.

235
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,260
How have I not kept my son in line well?

236
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,490
This guy is someone who never even met
with girls before meeting Cheon Song Yi.

237
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,620
It's Miss Cheon Song Yi over there, who's
 been seducing my innocent boy...

238
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,160
And he's doing things that he has never done before!

239
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,240
What? My Song Yi  seducing  your son?!

240
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,190
Hey, were you the one who seduced him?

241
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,780
Well, yeah, I guess I did seduce him.

242
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,560
No.

243
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,810
"Go Jang Nan Myeong". As the saying goes, wouldn't the 
sound of clapping be made only when the two hands meet?

244
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,400
So, it is no one side's fault. Furthermore,

245
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,830
I completely understand the mother's heart
 which is blaming me, the man in the relationship.

246
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,060
I'm apologetic. 
(In old Korean speech)

247
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,260
How old...did you say your son was?

248
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,000
So, you've set your mind on not going after all?

249
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,520
Yes.

250
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,310
I don't know what's what anymore.

251
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,810
What else can we do?

252
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,850
Even though it might kill you, you want to stay here.

253
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,270
Well, if you think about it, who doesn't die?

254
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,820
It's all the same.

255
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,260
That's how I'll accept it from now on.

256
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,750
But, there isn't anything strange going on 
with your body, right?

257
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,880
About that...

258
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,320
Yes?

259
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,840
Never mind. I'm fine.

260
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,260
Is it...too far?

261
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:21,090

262
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,760
Is it too heavy?

263
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,740
  Do Min Joon.

264
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,040
Do Min Joon.

265
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,050
Can you hear me?

266
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,580
Do you hear what I am saying?

267
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,880
You can probably hear it.

268
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,950
You know...

269
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,330
Why do I want to see you again, even though 
it hasn't been that long since we last met?

270
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,770
Can't you come to my side by using teleportation, huh?

271
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,350
Huh? Huh? Do Min Joon.

272
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,770
Why aren't you answering? You're playing with me, right?

273
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,640
Why aren't you answering?

274
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:07,820
Don't! Don't! Don't do that!

275
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,120
If I think about you listening to what I'm saying now,

276
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,480
do you know how much my heart flutters?

277
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,240
  Huh? Aren't you coming? 
 I'm waiting.

278
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,760
  Okay. I will go now.

279
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,700
  Really? Come quickly.

280
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,730
 What are you doing? Why aren't you coming? I am waiting.

281
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,730
 Just wait!

282
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,310
 Okay.

283
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,060
  Cheon Song Yi.

284
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,710
Hello.

285
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,000
 What is this? You aren't going to come?

286
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,900
Well...

287
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,280
I don't think I can go.

288
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,810
 Why?

289
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,270
By chance, you can't teleport, either?

290
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,020
It's not that I "can't," but

291
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,870
the situation now is a bit (inconvenient).

292
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,130
Honey! Honey! Why are you like this?

293
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,920
Crazy bastard! Hey, crazy bastard!

294
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,190
Do you know what you've done?!

295
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,900
Did you do it knowingly?!

296
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,960
Father.

297
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,720
Hyung locked up sister-in-law,

298
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,400
for seven years.

299
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,700
Sister-in-law?

300
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,300
Who is your sister-in-law?!

301
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,050
She's just a toy that I gave to your hyung!

302
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,860
Since your hyung liked her so much, 
I just allowed her to be in the house.

303
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,580
Probably that 'crazy' thing...

304
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,640
did something to upset your hyung!

305
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,380
That's probably how he was forced 
to do something like that. Just because of that,

306
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,650
you got your hyung to be called into the Prosecutor's office?

307
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,290
Do you know what kind of a person your brother is?!

308
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:44,540
I did it because I needed to know
 what kind of person hyung is.

309
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,500
What kind of person he is, what kind of stuff he did....

310
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,530
No one else, but I...

311
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,490
had to know.

312
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,360
Get out!

313
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,170
I have no other son except Jae Kyeong now.

314
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,480
All the privileges you get for being my son...

315
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,570
...will be no more, starting today. So get out.

316
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,730
Get out! 
 Get out!

317
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,440
GET OUT!

318
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,200
The answers to all your questions

319
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,530
will be given by me, Lee Jae Kyeong's attorney.

320
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,790
A lawyer's participation is only allowed if
 it does not interfere with the  investigation.

321
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,140
However . . .

322
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,110
Mister Lee Jae Kyeong here is a witness.

323
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,650
A witness?

324
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,230
Excuse me!

325
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,460
The victim, who had been illegally detained 
for  the past 7 years,

326
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,060
accused Lee Jae Kyeong as the prime suspect for the crime.

327
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,490
This is Miss Yang Min Joo's medical records
 from the mental hospital.

328
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:46,600
This record shows the mental treatments 
she's received from 2002 to 2004.

329
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,860
It looks like  it was during the time when
Yang Min Joo and Lee Jae Kyeong were married.

330
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:56,330
Believing words from a person in this condition
doesn't seem reasonable.

331
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,230
This is a report from 10 years ago.

332
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:06,590
But, this is a psychiatrist opinion of
 Yang Min Joo from only yesterday.

333
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:13,260
"Though her anxiety level is high due to post traumatic stress, her physical and mental condition hasn't diminished greatly."

334
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,890
"And, she is exhibiting a quite normal physical and mental condition"

335
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,850
"that she can sufficiently provide very  accurate statements."

336
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,710
You see this, right?

337
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,240
Lee Jae Kyeong, you see it, right?

338
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,130
According to Miss Yang Min Joo's testimony...

339
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,890
For the last 7 years,

340
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,960
she has been hospitalized and confined 
against her will by Lee Jae Kyeong's design ...

341
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,600
Do you admit it?

342
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,690
No.

343
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,230
If the hospital held her for that long,

344
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,780
that would be a problem between 
my ex-wife and the hospital.

345
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,730
We have a response ready for that argument as well.

346
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,700
Here are your personal phone records

347
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,560
of Yang Min Joo's calls from the Haneul Hospital.

348
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,140
How are you going to explain this?

349
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,790
I admit that I was receiving odd calls regularly.

350
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,400
I only thought of them as prank calls.

351
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,510
It never crossed my mind that

352
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,070
they were from my ex-wife in the mental hospital.

353
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,180
Did I do something wrong?

354
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,270
Lee Jae Kyeong, you...

355
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,060
conspired with the hospital director to have Yang Min Joo-

356
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,140
But you don't have any concrete evidence 
to prove such an allegation.

357
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,910
Basing it only on the victim's testimony,

358
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,510
which accuses Lee Jae Kyeong as the prime suspect,

359
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,290
is problematic.

360
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:37,790
For now, since Mister Lee Jae Kyeong's and
 Miss Yang Min Joo's stories  are incompatible,

361
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,010
we would like do a cross-examination.

362
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,410
Do you agree?

363
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,120
Yes, I do.

364
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,040
But...

365
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,830
my ex-wife...

366
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,240
Where is she now?

367
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,140
I can't tell you that.

368
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,270
How can he just bring home someone we don't know?

369
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,890
Are we in danger or something like that?

370
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:30,450
Mom, how is she someone we don't know? 
 She is Jae Kyeong Oppa's wife.

371
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,440
You also went to the wedding reception.

372
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,930
Didn't he say she is a woman 
who was in the mental hospital?

373
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,610
She's testifying for Oppa's case.

374
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,200
And didn't you hear how she was unfairly locked up?

375
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,130
If it's anything to do with  Hui Kyeong...

376
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,630
 Hey!

377
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,180
 Why are you this late?

378
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,450
Your hyung has been waiting hours for you!

379
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,510
 It's my Song Yi's graduation tomorrow.

380
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,420
 I have to get her flowers.

381
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,180
 You are also graduating.

382
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,510
 How is that important?
 My girl graduating is more important.

383
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,230
 Seriously!

384
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,610
  Here.

385
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,290
  Graduation gift.

386
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,140
 What is this?

387
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,280
  Ballpoint pen?

388
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,460
  It is not just a ballpoint pen.

389
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,720
 It's a recording pen. Give it here.

390
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,950
  Hui Kyeong, congratulations on your graduation, my brother.

391
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:57,000
  Hui Kyeong, congratulations on your graduation, my brother.

392
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,060
  Wow.

393
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,520
 I use this as my diary, you know?

394
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,400
 If you use it to record things as you think of them,
 it will help you out.

395
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,200
 Aigoo, this rascal...

396
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,280
 He's already graduating. Aigoo...

397
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,550
 You are all grown up.

398
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,870
 You will come to my graduation tomorrow, right?

399
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,290
 Is the Pope Catholic?!

400
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,830
  Hui Kyeong, congratulations on your graduation, my brother.

401
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,240
Where are you?

402
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,490
 Why?

403
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,520
Just. We should eat breakfast together...

404
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,790
  What should I do?

405
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,510
 I'm already outside due to an urgent matter.

406
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,960
You should have told me if you had an urgent matter.

407
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,630
Did you go there alone?

408
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,800
 I came here with a friend.

409
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,910
Friend, who? Lee Hui Kyeong?

410
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,790
 No. There is someone.

411
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,330
  Let's talk later.

412
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,470
Okay.

413
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,820
Then when you get home, call....me.

414
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,040
What is this?

415
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,770
She's the one who wanted me to show her.

416
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,610
What do you think? 
It feels different from when I wore it for a photo shoot.

417
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,460
But, are you doing this after coming to an agreement with him?

418
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,110
From what I see, it doesn't seem like
 he's planning to marry you.

419
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,270
But, you're already planning to live happily ever after.

420
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,270
You can say that we've agreed.

421
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,840
In what way?

422
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,340
Well,  you see, he was originally supposed to go 
somewhere far away.  But he gave it up because of me.

423
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,320
Where?

424
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,870
You don't need to know everything.

425
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,120
But, is it okay for him not to go?

426
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,430
It must be okay for him to say so.

427
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:20,670
I mean, from his perspective, wasn't there a reason 
he had to go; for him to say that he is leaving?

428
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,510
Perhaps because you were boo-hoo'ing and being all clingy,

429
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,950
and whining, "Do you have to go?" and
 "If you're going to go, let's not see each other."

430
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,620
It wasn't anything like that?

431
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,360
 You're not coming back?  
You're saying that you won't be back?

432
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,640
 What will happen if you don't go?
 Why does it have to be now of all times?

433
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,900
 Can't you just... stay here with me?

434
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,800
Well, not much.

435
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,450
So, you did.

436
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,840
Just be sure that if he doesn't go,  there wouldn't 
be any repercussions or anything.

437
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,940
Just so that you can be happy, that man, who has a
 bright future, might have his life become complicated.

438
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:01,430
And if you're going to wear something like this,
 come to an agreement with the guy first.

439
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:06,060
I'm saying you should start all this when he's, at least,
 hinted at the "m" in the word "marriage".

440
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:13,200
I've previously felt this. But it seems like
 you don't have any self-respect.

441
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,130
Hyung, I came because I had something to say to you.

442
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,690
Come in.

443
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,800
I'll just get straight to the point.

444
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,050
Hyung, I really like you.

445
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,750
Oh.  Thanks.

446
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,820
My mom is the problem.  But I'll try to do
 something about her.

447
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,920
Perhaps, I can write a contract saying that I wouldn't 
run away from home starting my third year of high school.

448
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,130
I think something like that could work.

449
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,070
Then, she might approve.

450
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,430
Approve of what?

451
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,860
The two of you getting married.

452
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,000
Huh?

453
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,140
I'm not asking for anything big.

454
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,290
I only look at one thing in a person.

455
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,310
You have that genuine purity of someone who loves the stars.

456
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,050
That aspect captured my heart.

457
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,890
I know what you're trying to say, Yoon Jae, but...

458
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:20,500
However, in return, man to man, make me a promise.

459
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,970
That you will make my sister happy forever.

460
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:29,600
My sister really went through a lot of hardship.

461
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,100
Our father left home and our mother went out of her mind.

462
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:40,270
When my mom lost herself in her addiction to money,
 she made things really difficult for my sister.

463
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,200
I see.

464
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,020
Please, just don't make tears come out of my sister's eyes.

465
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:51,190
Then, in light of that, I will give you a "PASS!"

466
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,700
I had wondered about Cheon Song Yi
 just saying whatever she wanted to say.

467
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,080
It seems the two of you resemble each other a lot.

468
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,830
But, I think you'll have to meet one more person.

469
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,990
Ahjussi!

470
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,760
Yes?  Ah, yes.

471
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,930
Isn't there a valet here?

472
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:31,970
I guess the driver must have gone to
 the restroom for a moment.

473
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,940
Then, you park it.

474
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,130
Ah, well, I can't drive very well.  It looks like
 an expensive car and if it were to be damaged . . .

475
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,910
Just do it and stop blabbing.

476
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,840
You're getting paid, but you're just
 going to sit around and play?

477
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,600
Ahjussi, I can tell the higher-ups and get you fired.

478
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,050
That little...

479
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,730
What is this?

480
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,570
Sudden unintended acceleration... Is it that?

481
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,610
But there's nobody in there.

482
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,760
And who are you?

483
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,420
If you don't have the skills to park without leaving your car in someone else's hands,

484
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,100
how about you reconsider whether or not you should drive?

485
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,460
What?

486
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,820
Gosh, I'm running into all sort of crappy situations today.

487
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,640
Now, a truly unlucky thing has occurred.

488
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,550
What will you do?

489
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,190

490
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,660
That time in the elevator . . .

491
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,360
Right?

492
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,940
Yes.

493
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,910
As you may know, I don't have any right to be a father.

494
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:24,430
But, even so, I do have one thing I would like to ask.

495
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:27,640
Are you healthy?

496
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,880
Yes.

497
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,120
Then, it's set.

498
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,240
After living, I've come to realize one doesn't need money,

499
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,430
fame and all that. Once the glory ends, not much is left.
 So health is most important.

500
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,990
If you're healthy, you can protect your people.

501
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,930
I didn't know that then.

502
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,930
Once I no longer had  money or reputation,

503
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,940
my only thought was that I couldn't 
take care of my loved ones anymore.

504
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,540
I was foolish.

505
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,380
Even so, I should have stayed by my family.

506
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,540
I should have been there with them.

507
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:10,630
Looking back now, I know that there isn't a way 
to be compensated for all the time that I lost.

508
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,560
So, while you are living, no matter what happens,

509
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,270
if you can just be there by Song Yi's side,

510
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,220
I will be truly thankful.

511
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,880
What I wasn't able to do,

512
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,610
if you would do it.

513
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,320
Let's have a glass.

514
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,510
How are we going to walk all the way back like this?

515
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,810
Brother-in-law, you can't catch a cold.

516
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,150
We're here.

517
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,420
Hey, get a hold of your senses.
 We still have to walk another thirty minutes.

518
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,540
Why go inside here, Brother-in-law?

519
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,400
Hyung!  Min Joon Hyung!

520
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,890
How did this...?

521
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,310
What?  When did you get home?

522
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,050
Just now.

523
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,690
What is this, Do Min Joon? 
You haven't been in touch all day.

524
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:53,230
What did you do to Do Min Joon? 
 Did you spit on Do Min Joon?

525
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,340
Then, did he drink?

526
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,800
Ah, seriously!

527
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,300
Ah, I can't live!

528
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,640
Move away! Our Min Joon Hyung is not someone
 that you can treat in that manner.

529
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,650
What?

530
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,050
Don't ask anything more.  I'm not going to tell you.

531
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,920
Min Joon Hyung!

532
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,110
Yoon Jae, that...

533
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,540
I'll keep your secret.  For sure.

534
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,600
Oh, okay.

535
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,260
Thanks.

536
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,840
Can I just ask one favour?

537
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,580
What are you trying to do?

538
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,890
There must be some kind of misunderstanding.

539
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,290
I don't do that kind of thing.

540
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,960

541
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,880
How is it? How is it?

542
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,060
Don't make soup. Ever again.

543
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,830
Do Min Joon, how much are your utilities?

544
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,900
Why?

545
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,890
Is it because it's winter?

546
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,420
My electric and gas bills were really high.

547
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,610
I heard that electric bills are progressively taxed these days.

548
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,750
It was really high.

549
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,030
And this place, I'm paying rent monthly.

550
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:41,260
With utilities and rent, the money flowing out is no joke.

551
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,780
Do you need... money urgently?

552
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,230
No. It isn't that.

553
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:56,060
You are just next door. We eat together 
often like this and sleep, too...

554
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,320
Well, I was just thinking . . .

555
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,470
With utilities and rent, I was just wondering
 if they were a waste or not.

556
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,410
What do you mean? Tell me clearly 
so that I can understand.

557
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,000
I don't know. Never mind.

558
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,930
Should we go there in the evening?

559
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,250
Huh?

560
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,220
Where?

561
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,490
Namsan Tower.

562
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,310
Didn't you say you wanted to go?

563
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,290
Should we?

564
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:34,080
I'll dress really prettily. So, you have to come
 looking your most stylish, too.

565
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,440
Why suddenly ...

566
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,550
She's in my room.  And she ate porridge well this morning.

567
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:00,820
I find myself having to keep apologizing to you.

568
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,380
No.

569
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:06,230
My passionate prosecutor brother is just 
trying to protect his witness, that's all.

570
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,630
It doesn't have anything to do with you.
 Don't think like that.

571
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,520
Even while I was married to Jae Kyeong,

572
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,290
I kept thinking there was something strange.

573
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:26,560
Even though he was a remarkable person in everyone's eyes,

574
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,810
it always felt like he was hiding something.

575
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,250
But...

576
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:37,920
But I accidentally happened to find
 something that I shouldn't have.

577
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,500
I found a pen recorder in his deceased older brother's room.

578
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,130
Was there . . .

579
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,100
something recorded on there?

580
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,880
By chance,

581
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,180
is it related to my oldest brother?

582
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:01,720
Jae Kyeong doesn't know that it exists.

583
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,340
I left it somewhere else in case he were to find out.

584
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:10,770
I should have reported to the police right away at that time.

585
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:15,040
It is all my fault because I was very scared.

586
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,650
Where is it?

587
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,420
The pen recorder?

588
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,670
 February 23, 2002

589
00:44:54,670 --> 00:45:01,530
 This morning, I set the agenda for a team leaders' meeting, went to the department store for Hui Kyeong's graduation gift.

590
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:07,160
 In the evening, Jae Kyeong says he has something 
to tell me, so we're going on a drive.

591
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:15,040
  Hyung, drink some juice.

592
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,640
 Middle brother asked me to bring it to you.

593
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,780
 Oh, thanks.

594
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:24,180
 I'm going out with my friends. Mom and Dad said
 they have a gathering and will be late.

595
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,660
 Really?  I'm going out with Jae Kyeong later, too.

596
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,280
 I guess the house will be empty tonight.

597
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,630
  Hyung, let's go out.

598
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,740
 But, Jae Kyeong . . .

599
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:41,950
  Since earlier, I don't feel so well.

600
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,270
  Why?

601
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,710
  I am not sure.

602
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,600
  I don't know why...

603
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,270
 I feel like I'm drunk.

604
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,000
  You aren't drunk.

605
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,920
 You're probably becoming paralyzed, Hyung.

606
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:05,970
  What?

607
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,320
 Soon you'll lose strength in your hands and feet,

608
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,770
 and it will become difficult for you to walk.

609
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,020
 It'll get harder to breathe.

610
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,450
 Then, your tongue will become paralyzed.

611
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:20,190
 Eventually, you'll fall into a deep sleep.

612
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:26,170
  What are you saying now?

613
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:29,290
 And you'll be discovered in the middle of a highway.

614
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:32,520
 Death due to driving under the influence.

615
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,660
  Jae Kyeong.

616
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,030
 I've been wishing for a long time 
for you to no longer be here.

617
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:43,740
 You kept getting in the way.

618
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,490
  With the reason that I was born later than you,

619
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,680
 Father didn't give me any opportunities.

620
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,680
 Please save me, Jae Kyeong!

621
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:55,200
Why don't you open the trunk?

622
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,480
Huh?

623
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,690
Trunk?

624
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,530
Okay.

625
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:29,600
There's a brush there, isn't there?

626
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,990
Could you bring me the brush?

627
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,260
Do you not have hands or feet?

628
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,030
You could just use those show-off-y powers.
Why make a person do it?

629
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,930
Get in.

630
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,300
 Isn't she Cheon Song Yi? 
 Is he her boyfriend?

631
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,180
  Cheon Song Yi ♥ Do Min Joon

632
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,880
What is this?

633
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:12,260
Come here.

634
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,530
This is a must for new couples.

635
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,890
Seriously.

636
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:19,460
It is something that kids do.

637
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,890
You do this,

638
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,090
and here.  Come here.

639
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,360
Put it in there.

640
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,850
Then how do you undo it later?

641
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,760
You're not supposed to undo it.

642
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:39,360
Our destinies are locked up together here,
 so they can't be forever undone.

643
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:43,290
An everlasting dependency, a complete bond. 
Something like that.

644
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,280
Clickety-clack.

645
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,090
Do Min Joon, you're locked up with me now.

646
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,550
We're totally stuck together now.

647
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,510
It doesn't seem as if you like it.

648
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:04,140
No. I like it.

649
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,930
What is this? I am Cheon Song Yi.

650
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:11,110
Do Min Joon, aren't you being too naive? You're a bit complacent.

651
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:14,420
Please improve on your enthusiasm.

652
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,160
Omo.

653
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,890
Over here...

654
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,160
Oh my!

655
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,670
Honey...

656
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,970
- I'm touched.
- Do you like it?

657
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:44,660
Yes.

658
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,970
- Honey. 
- Try it on.

659
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:00,760
It fits perfectly.

660
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,990
- Is it pretty?
- Yes, it's pretty.

661
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,800
Honey, I love you!

662
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,080
How can I help you?

663
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,880
Do you have ice water?

664
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,840
Yes.

665
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,630
Are you done with your dinner?

666
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:22,130
- Not yet. 
- Finish quickly, then let's leave.

667
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,970
Are you in a bad mood?

668
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:44,080
No. We put up a lock, and ate well. 
What is there to be in a bad mood about?

669
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,810
Cheon Song Yi.

670
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,090
What?

671
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,760
Hello?

672
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,300
Ok. I'll be right there.

673
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,390
Who was that?

674
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,730
I have to take care of something. Go ahead first.

675
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,910
By myself?

676
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:24,240
Wait at home. Not yours,

677
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,160
but our home.

678
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,690
Our home?

679
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,810
Do Min Joon, your house?

680
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,280
Yes.

681
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,980
There is something I have to say.

682
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,970
Ok, I understand.

683
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,190
Cheon Song Yi.

684
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:42,510
Huh?

685
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,210
I'll be back soon. Wait for me.

686
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,350
Ok, I'll wait. Hurry back.

687
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:03,630
 Wow, I'm finally satisfied.

688
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,950
"A new fate is starting."

689
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,310
"The comet that I've been expecting for 400 years."

690
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:56,130
"In 3 months, I can finally return back to where I used to live."

691
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:00,310
"A woman who becomes drunk. 
A woman who has habits when she is drunk."

692
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:04,520
"A woman that is arrogant and ignorant. All of which I hate."

693
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,010
"Next door, a woman just like that, moved in."

694
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,750
"I now have a person by whom I don't want to be forgotten."

695
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,920
"At a time when I have to leave soon"

696
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,530
"to a different world."

697
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:30,340
"Today, to lose Cheon Song Yi,
 I revealed my identity to her."

698
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,780
"Wanting her to run away from me,"

699
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,240
"and to fear me."

700
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,250
"If I lose the chance to return this time, then"

701
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,910
"I will disappear from this place."

702
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:50,140
"Soon, I will probably die."

703
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,630
  Is it okay for you

704
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:56,060
  not to go?

705
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,960
 It's fine.

706
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,400
 Really,

707
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,710
 is it ok?

708
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:13,500
 ♫ Just in case I might be able to see you, ♫

709
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:19,030
 ♫ Just in case I might be able to greet you with a smile, ♫

710
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:26,750
 ♫ Foolishly, in anticipation, I turn around. ♫

711
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:34,010
 ♫ From far away, I can see you. ♫

712
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:40,060
 ♫ Your hair that has been done nicely, ♫

713
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:46,440
 ♫ Your shy smile, ♫

714
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:53,210
 ♫ They're still the same. You still are the same. ♫

715
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:59,970
 ♫ But right now, next to you,
I am not there, but another person ♫

716
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:02,590
  Are you going to meet the family for the first time?

717
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:06,310
 Or are you going to an interview?

718
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,430
 Proposal...

719
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:21,730
 ♫ Just in case you might see me ♫

720
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:24,160
 Cheon Song Yi.

721
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,390
 Miss Song Yi. Song Yi.

722
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:31,660
 Hey, that's for you.

723
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,540
 That's not going to work.

724
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,320
 Can you open the trunk?

725
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:48,410

726
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,450
 Are you finished eating?

727
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,290
 - Not yet. 
- Finish quickly then let's leave.

728
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,990
 Cheon Song Yi.

729
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:15,010
  I don't know until when I can live by your side.

730
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:19,160
  So,  these words now . . .

731
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,040
  I don't know if I should say them.

732
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,430
  But I will do my best

733
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:30,300
  so that I can stay by your side for a long long time.

734
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,300
  That time...

735
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,940
  Even though I don't know how long it will be,

736
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,290
  I will do my best and

737
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:44,550
  I will love you.
