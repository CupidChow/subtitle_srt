1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000

2
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,020
 If you don't want to answer right now,

3
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,300
 you can do it later.

4
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,530
No.

5
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,490
I'll give you my answer now.

6
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,080
 My answer is...

7
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,670
What is wrong?

8
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,430
What is this situation that just happened?

9
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,020
It feels like I've seen it somewhere before.

10
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,320
Huh?

11
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,400
Is it something like deja vu?

12
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,380
No, nothing like that.

13
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,110
Anyway, I feel really strange.

14
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,290
That's how I feel too.

15
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,390
Each second feels like an eternity.

16
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,070
Are you...

17
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,300
not going to answer?

18
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,240
Sorry.

19
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,380
Why?

20
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,430
One second ago, I definitely was
 going to say "yes."

21
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,870
Honestly, I don't even know if love really exists.

22
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,410
And, if it does,

23
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,080
then, my parents

24
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,930
and this world may not be in such a mess.

25
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,350
I was going to think the way you said to.

26
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,830
To think of my liking you and my being comfortable 
with you as love.

27
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,540
And, thereby improve my station in life.

28
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,730
Thanks to you, I would have been
 able to live well indulging myself,

29
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,500
which would also have satisfied
 my mom's wishes.

30
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,330
However,

31
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,280
I am really sorry.

32
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,320
My mind changed after just a mere second,

33
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,590
so I can't do it.

34
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,220
You've come quite far, Cheon Song Yi.

35
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,000
What?

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,150
You said you were going to say yes.

37
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,990
You've at least considered me that much.

38
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,570
In the past, when I said things like this...

39
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,290
"Get lost,"

40
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,910
was your response.

41
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,690
It looks like we've finally made some 
progress in our relationship.

42
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,410
Hey, that's not it...

43
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,030
Hey...

44
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,470
"I was going to say yes."

45
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,210
For me, that's all I heard, ok?

46
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,160
Someday, you will say 'yes.'

47
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,970
 For the first time,

48
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,680
 I wanted to protect someone.

49
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,300
 But I was unable to do anything,

50
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,040
 and ended up losing that someone.

51
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,160
 After arriving on earth, 
that was the very first

52
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,210
 death that I had witnessed.

53
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,730
Do you know why people fear death?

54
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,120
It is because they fear being forgotten.

55
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,400
Even if I disappear

56
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,650
from the world I existed,

57
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,650
the world remains the same,

58
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,180
and I alone would be forgotten.

59
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,980
I wasn't afraid.

60
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,810
Even if I leave this world, 
in which I live and go elsewhere,

61
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,790
and even though there is nobody to remember me,

62
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,930
it didn't matter.

63
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,240
But now,

64
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,050
I think I'm a little scared.

65
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,340
One person has appeared

66
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,100
whom I want not to forget me.

67
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,860
Just at the moment,

68
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,260
when I need to go to another world.

69
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,230
 My Love From the Star 
 Episode 7

70
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,850
Hui Kyeong.

71
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,020
Are you drunk?

72
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,250
Oh, Yoo Se Mi!

73
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,930
My friend that I love!

74
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,750
Yoo Se Mi!

75
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,350
Why are you like this?

76
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,700
Sit.

77
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,740
You don't even take alcohol too well.

78
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,820
Is there something wrong?

79
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,700
Cheon Song Yi,

80
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,650
I must really not be the one for her.

81
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,640
I cowardly tried to
 seduce her with money,

82
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,270
because she's in a difficult situation.

83
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,660
I thought, then, she would come to me.

84
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,610
Then what?

85
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,260
She said no?

86
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,960
So, she said no.

87
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,360
Can't you stop now? 
It's been long enough now.

88
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,390
For you,

89
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,870
does it work that way?

90
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,320
Does your heart

91
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,500
always do

92
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,570
what you want?

93
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,190
I really can't do that.

94
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,700
It's so embarrassing.

95
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,320
What if Cheon Song Yi, that foolish girl,

96
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,590
is really waiting for that guy?

97
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,650
You know . . . That guy who saved 
 her from the accident?

98
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,350
That goblin like guy.

99
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,520
Hui Kyeong,

100
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,380
I think I've seen that guy.

101
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,810
I can't believe it myself,

102
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,720
but I think it's the right guy.

103
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,330
Hui Kyeong,

104
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,930
I can't either.

105
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,840
I can't control my heart, either.

106
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,400
can't control my heart.

107
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,200
Oh, she must not be here yet.

108
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,050
Did it go well with her and Hui Kyeong?

109
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,580
Then, let's leave it at the
 security guard's office and go.

110
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,420
Hey, we haven't once come to your 
sister's house, since she moved.

111
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,040
We should, at least, see how she's living.

112
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,320
How are we to get in? 
She's not answering her phone.

113
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,210
Wait and see.
 Her password is so obvious.

114
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,660
The last digits of her phone number . . .

115
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,290
 The password is incorrect.

116
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,630
It's not that. Then, what is it?

117
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,490
Heol!

118
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,160
How did you know?

119
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,410
This girl can't remember
 complicated passwords.

120
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,650
She forgets.

121
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,020
What the?!

122
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,470
What about you?! You were at home.
 Why didn't you answer the door?

123
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,770
I'm Cheon Song Yi!

124
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,940
Am I supposed to open the door whenever the bell rings?
Do you think the security should be that lax?!

125
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,280
Should the 'security conscious wench'
 set her password to 1111?!

126
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,110
Anyone would be able to come in.

127
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,800
Wow. How did you know?

128
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,050
Go and rinse your mouth! You're so dirty.

129
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,010
Aish...

130
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,320
Yoon Jae, go check.

131
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,380
What is it?

132
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,700
I don't know.

133
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,950
Our Song Yi (fame) hasn't gone down yet.

134
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,050
A fan must have sent it.

135
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,700
What's wrong? What is it?

136
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,490
Don't look! Don't look!

137
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,390
A dead r...rat!

138
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,970
 You die too.

139
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,230
Stop there!

140
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,840
Exactly what jerk is it?

141
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,530
Report it to the police.

142
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,160
So another article can come out?

143
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,390
Right now, just having her name mentioned will buy her bad impressions.

144
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,830
She gets insulted no matter what she does.

145
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,810
If she laughs, she's shameless and 
if she cries, she's spiteful.

146
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:22,310
In other words, she's Korea's most hated right now.

147
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,340
Thank you, Mother. You're ever so encouraging.

148
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,560
Forget it. Go meet CEO Ahn
 with me tomorrow, again.

149
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,330
I will do the unreasonable insisting, 
so you do the negotiation.

150
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,080
After all, how much money 
have you earned them?!

151
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,910
An agency should protect you at a time like this. You're being terrorized right now.

152
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,700
Terrorize? Don't exaggerate.

153
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,060
You see those bears over there, right?

154
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,860
There are fans, who sent me things
 like that, saying to cheer up.

155
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,960
Not everyone hates me.

156
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,140
The reality is, there are a lot more that 
hate you (than love you).

157
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,370
So you're saying you're going to go around, by yourself, without a manager?

158
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,280
I found a new manager combined with a bodyguard.

159
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,060
Who is it?

160
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,590
 Sender: Seoul Yeongdeungpo  Police Station
 (Summons to appear for interview)

161
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,310
Oh yes. Look at me losing my mind.

162
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,910
How did it go with Hui Kyeong?

163
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,770
What about?

164
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,370
Hey, didn't Hui Kyeong say anything to you today?

165
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,320
Something like a proposal?

166
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,450
You told him that? That I like riding
 the Ferris wheel on my birthday?

167
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,890
No.

168
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,920
 You said okay, right?

169
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,730
 Did you or didn't you?

170
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,210
 I didn't.

171
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,430
Why? Why on earth not?

172
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,260
You're lucky that Hui Kyeong has been wooly-eyed for so long.

173
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,280
What will you do if he comes to his senses soon?

174
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,110
Why do you keep playing hard to get?!

175
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,780
I'm not!

176
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,190
Playing hard to get is when you 
say 'no' even though you want to say 'yes.'

177
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,930
 I said 'no' because I meant it. 
I respect the guy enough to do so.

178
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:34,650

179
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,280
You're just arriving now? 
You left before me, though.

180
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,800
My mom and younger brother.

181
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,510
Nice to meet you. I'm Do Min Joon.

182
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,880
Ah, yes. But, who...?

183
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,080
Ah! Like I said earlier, he's my new manager.

184
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,430
-I'm not...
-He lives next door, so it's even nicer
that he's close by.

185
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,570
He graduated from Harvard. I need an English 
speaking manager if I'm to enter Hollywood.

186
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,990
So I recruited him especially.

187
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,170
Excuse-

188
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,580
Now that you've seen I have
 a manager, everything's fine, right?

189
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,220
Hey, you go too.

190
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,790
-Wait!
-Bye!

191
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,600
It's not-

192
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,050
Why don't you let this go?

193
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,880
Ah, sorry.

194
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,040
You said you studied in America. How come 
you are not generous with physical contacts?

195
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,290
In America, don't they do, at least,
 this much among friends?

196
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,930
I didn't have friends in America, 
so I would not know.

197
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,040
So, "In both America and Korea, 
why don't I have any friends?"

198
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,350
You should seriously give that some thought.

199
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,990
About your character flaw and things of that nature.

200
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,670
And,

201
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,210
I never said I'd be your manager.

202
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,290
Don't say that to people.

203
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,550
But, you asked how much it was?

204
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,230
I only asked. Did I say I'd do it?

205
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,180
Huh, he knows how to push and pull.

206
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,530
How much? How much is enough?

207
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,390
What?

208
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,370
I'm going to type my password in.

209
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,210
Type it. Even if I see it, I won't be able to memorize it.

210
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,730
I forget my own password all the time anyway.

211
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,220
Manager Do.

212
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,960
Don't call me that.

213
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,380
Don't-

214
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,870
A funeral portrait of Han Yoo Ra had been delivered earlier.

215
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Then, today, I received a dead rat.

216
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,770
It says I should die.

217
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,490
Come in.

218
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,520
I've lived as a celebrity for 15 years,

219
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,470
and all it took was two weeks to fall.

220
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,220
All that effort I put in during that time . . .

221
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,360
Just because of an unconfirmed rumor, 
everything's turned into nothing.

222
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,900
I'm just. . .

223
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,920
an evil bitch who drove a pretty actress to death.

224
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,930
A shameless bitch who holds her head high 
and lives well even after that.

225
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,000
That's what I've become.

226
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,710
It's not you. That's enough.

227
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,000
I too thought that if it wasn't me, it'd be fine.

228
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,270
That's a naive thought.

229
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,480
Not everyone thinks the way I do.

230
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,500
How do I live from now on-

231
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,190
What?

232
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,380
Did I refuse for no good reason?

233
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,280
What?

234
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,350
You know my friend Hui Kyeong, right?

235
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,380
He proposed to me today.

236
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,220
If I can't re-sign (the management contract),
after paying the CF cancellation fee,

237
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,640
I will be no different from a penniless person.

238
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,410
Because my mom wasted so much money. . .

239
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,360
Even if I'm broke, I can't look like a bum when there are so many eyes on me.

240
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,080
My prospects feel so vague...

241
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,180
But he said this today.

242
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,900
He'd take responsibility for me and my family,

243
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,580
until death.

244
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,630
And, he'd make sure I'd eat and live well.

245
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,940
Then why did you reject him?

246
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,100
That's what I'm saying. 
Why did I?

247
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,250
Shall I just say okay to him now?

248
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,500
Okay, to what?

249
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,670
Discussing wealth during a marriage suit

250
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,190
is considered barbaric.

251
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,940
Who said?

252
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,820
It's in the Myeongshimbogam.
  (Confucian book of moral lessons from the Goryeo period)

253
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,400
Tell me honestly.

254
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,780
You're from Cheonghakdong, not Harvard, right?
  (A village in Korea untouched by modernity)

255
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,100
How can a person be so old-fashioned and boring?

256
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,490
You don't even know the Myeongshimbogam that well.

257
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,930
Do you know how many good proverbs it has?

258
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,030
Does it not also have this?

259
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,110
"Help thy neighbor in hardship first without question."

260
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,740
Starting from tomorrow, stay by my side.

261
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,480
Okay?

262
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,610
Stay by your side?

263
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,580
I'll think about it at least.

264
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,230
 Amazing Journey

265
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,210
♫   Wherever you are

266
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,680
 ♫  Whatever you are doing

267
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,170
 ♫  In my heart

268
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,350
 ♫  I can feel you

269
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,680
  A long time ago, there was a very beautiful princess.

270
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,240
  Like the star that comes out on the dark moonless night,

271
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,880
 It was a princess that twinkled like a star.

272
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,850
 ♫  It can't be anything except love. 
 In my eyes ♫

273
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,980
 For some reason,
 ♫ In my heart ♫

274
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,670
 Edward gained comfort from those words. 
So he murmured it to himself
♫ because you are brilliant like a star♫

275
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,650
  Like a star that twinkles on a dark moonless night.

276
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,100
 ♫ You  come at the start of  each day
 You come at the end of each day ♫

277
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,700
Like the star that twinkles

278
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:43,200
on a dark moonless night.
 ♫That Is my only wish  ♫

279
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,000
 ♫ Today has passed again

280
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,480
 As he repeated it to himself again and again,
♫  I still can't say I love you ♫

281
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,890
 the sun began to rise.
 ♫ From a short distance behind you, ♫

282
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,960
 ♫ I am smiling.

283
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,270
My poor son who has to work so hard at this early hour!

284
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,980
You face is half the size now.

285
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,890
I am okay.

286
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,040
Take care of yourself while doing what you do.

287
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,610
You are taking the tonic I prepared for you, right?

288
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,290
Mom, is he a senior in high school?

289
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,220
You're babying someone over the age of 30 to the extreme.

290
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,080
Hey, wait until he gets married.

291
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,170
I'll end up losing my handsome son to some strange girl.

292
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,430
I have to do this while I still can.

293
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,790
Oh, that's right.

294
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,070
There's a new shirt that I bought for you.

295
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,310
Wear that to work. I'll get it out for you.

296
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,720
Yes.

297
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,950
Oppa!

298
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,700
Yes?

299
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,720
When I went into your room yesterday,

300
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,130
I saw this.

301
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,090
Hey! You can't just take this, okay?

302
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,950
Who is the man in that picture?

303
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,880
I don't know.

304
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,190
Is that also a secret related to the investigation?

305
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,800
I really don't know. 
I've just started trying to find out.

306
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,390
I am sorry for making you come in like this.

307
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,470
Sorry (my ass).

308
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,580
Why did you leave so suddenly on that day?

309
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,910
I had an urgent matter.

310
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,020
Do you realize how much of fine I paid that day?

311
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,430
The illegal parking fine, towing expense,

312
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,630
and penalty for jay-walking... 
 In sum, I paid over $100.

313
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,240
But,

314
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,030
why did you summon me as a reference witness?

315
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,490
After reviewing the CCTV, we noticed 
that you were at the scene of the crime.

316
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,670
Also, on the CCTV of the hair salon, in Cheondamdong, where Han Yoo Ra and Cheon Song Yi were fighting,

317
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,370
we saw you again.

318
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,580
After investigating further, we found out that you 
live in the apartment next to Cheon Song Yi.

319
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,440
You also taught a class Cheon Song Yi 
used to take at the university she attends.

320
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,240
Is that all coincidence?

321
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,230
So you think I am related to that incident?

322
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,730
Yes, being suspicious is our occupation.

323
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,680
I write a daily journal.

324
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,390
After I received the summons, 
I read my diary carefully

325
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,410
to see what I did on the day of the incident.

326
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,450
Since I had an appointment with 
a lawyer that I know well,

327
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,960
I seemed to have gone home around midnight.

328
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,500
What was the time of the incident?

329
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,780
It was sometime between 11:30 p.m and 12:30 a.m.

330
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,360
I know the incident as having happened on 
a cruise boat, in the middle of the Han River.

331
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,680
As someone who was at home in Daechidong during that time,

332
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,980
would it have been possible for me to go 
to and from the incident site in 30 minutes?

333
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,500
Is there anyone who can verify
 that you were home during that time?

334
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,540
There is also a CCTV in the elevator 
of the the building where I live.

335
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,690
He was right.

336
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,800
It's true. On top of that, this image is sharper.

337
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,990
Like he said, going back and forth 
to a cruise ship

338
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,080
in the middle of the Han River is impossible.

339
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,120
Even in the CCTV scenes,

340
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,630
it only shows him going home,

341
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,140
but nothing of him coming out.

342
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,090
He has the perfect alibi.

343
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,020
Hello.

344
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,210
Oh yes, have the results of the handwriting analysis come out?

345
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,970
I understand.

346
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,620
Has the handwriting analysis from 
Han Yoo Ra's suicide note come back?

347
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,010
Yes, it was written by her.

348
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,720
They say that it is 100% her writing.

349
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,800
Han Yoo Ra's suicide note has now 
been confirmed 100% to be her writing.

350
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,110
The criticism about Cheon Song Yi is becoming harsher.

351
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:11,160
Did you cancel your contract with Cheon Song Yi due to this matter?

352
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,330
That is definitely not the case.

353
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,730
The contract was only up to the end of this month.

354
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,120
Since she has no subsequent schedule,

355
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,340
we are simply ending our practical business dealings.

356
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,310
Ms. Cheon Song Yi is understood to be in reclusive state,

357
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,540
do you happen to know what the situation is?

358
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,660
In order for Cheon Song Yi to relieve her stress and fatigue that have been building up,

359
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,260
she is currently resting.

360
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,200
Through reading, music appreciation and meditation.

361
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,520
She is concentrating on mind control as far as I know.

362
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,330
Oh my!

363
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,050
The filming!

364
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,980
Bom!  The sun has risen high up in the sky already.
Where are you, buster?

365
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,850
I'm at the set.

366
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,560
At the set?

367
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,520
I'm at Se Mi noona's filming site.

368
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,320
You can't. Don't leave.

369
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,050
Please!

370
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,460
Cut!

371
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,860
Okay.

372
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,010
That's good, Se Mi.

373
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,300
Good work, everyone.

374
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,370
You guys have worked hard.

375
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,600
How could you get such a difficult scene on one try?

376
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,190
Since we changed the lead actress, the 
atmosphere seemed to have changed too.

377
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,640
 Everybody! We're all eating out tonight!

378
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,740
Noona, is there something wrong?

379
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,480
No, I was just wondering where you were.

380
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,180
It sounds like you have a company dinner. 
Go, hurry.

381
00:27:54,590 --> 00:28:00,450

382
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,750
What am I doing?

383
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,860
 The pager message is a pun. 8 "pal" and  2 "i" sound like "Quickly" so the page says "Quickly, quickly, quickly."

384
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,690
 This is the first message.

385
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,910
 Mr. Do Min Joon, I'm owner Hong Hae Yin.

386
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,530
I mean, how can you borrow a newly released 
volume and have still not returned it?

387
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:45,660
I loaned it to you without an ID because
 you gave a good impression.

388
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,920
But to see what I get in return
 is long overdue (books), I feel bitter.

389
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,060
I ask that you return it as soon as possible.

390
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,550
  This is the second message.

391
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,960
  Hey, it's Cheon Song Yi.

392
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,740
How could a manager leave
 without saying anything?

393
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,260
Where'd you go?

394
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,530
Call me.

395
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,950
Can't you buy a cellphone?

396
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,880
Isn't that a basic equipment for a manager?

397
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,390
A cellphone that gets good reception.

398
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,860
Nowadays, all cellphones have good reception.

399
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,910
The one that works best out of these.

400
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,800
What presentation are you talking about when I'm so busy?

401
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,400
It's an enormous item.

402
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,530
You'll regret it if you let it go.

403
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,510
This is not coming from a son to a father, but

404
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,510
a groundbreaking business proposal from
 an S&amp;C Group employee to the Chairman.

405
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,780
Cut to the chase. What is it?

406
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,570
Our S&amp;C group has department stores, automobiles, movie theaters, apartment buildings,

407
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,280
even electronic appliances. We have an all 
encompassing business.

408
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,220
Unfortunately, we are missing out on one sector.

409
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,920
And, that is . . . Please turn to the next page.

410
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,720
The core of the Korean Wave: celebrity agencies.

411
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,840
Stop it.

412
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,410
It differs greatly from other celebrity agencies. Turn one more page, please.

413
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,780
The difference is that we are an agency
 for only one celebrity.

414
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,800
Someone who currently belongs to no other agency and
who is an unrivaled star of South Korea.

415
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,700
Someone who currently belongs to no other agency and
who is an unrivaled star of South Korea.

416
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:34,010
Asia's star! That one person is

417
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,710
my woman, Cheon Song Yi.

418
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,990
I have a golf appointment.

419
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,790
Of Cheon Song Yi.

420
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,300
Enough, kid. 
- For Cheon Song Yi,

421
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,360
By Cheon Song Yi!

422
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,870
Wait, wait!

423
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,580
Please... establish a one person agency like that, Father.

424
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,250
You like her that much?

425
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,420
Yes, I do.

426
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,960
Well, let's give it a thought first.

427
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,540
It doesn't mean I'm going to approve!

428
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,420
Why would I need your approval?
I need Song Yi's approval.

429
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,880
To get that approval, I've been putting in
 so much effort for over 10 years.

430
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,180
Aiyoo. . .

431
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,380
Please establish the one-person agency, alright?

432
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,950
On that note, you can never go bankrupt, Dad.

433
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,810
- What, this punk! 
-- Ow!

434
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,780
 This winter is very cold, isn't it?

435
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,360
 -But just because it's cold, 
- It's cold, it is.

436
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,600
 you cannot stop making an effort to stay in shape.

437
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,770
Eiyoo. No way. We would be in huge trouble. 
We shouldn't not do it.

438
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,330
 If we loaf around at home,
 there's something that gets bigger indeed.

439
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,220
 My love handles. Ugh, this bulging belly. 
What will you do about it?

440
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,010
 You are very busy these days, aren't you? 
You are very tired, aren't you? 
-- Oh my.

441
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,700
 How do you manage to exercise in the meantime? 
-- Oh my, I think I've put on some weight.

442
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,580
 Don't worry from now on.

443
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,960
 Because you just need to put 
the Waist Aid around your waist  . . .

444
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,450
 Put this on for 30 minutes, then. . .

445
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:08,910
 You will see the result in no time. 
-- All this time, I've exercised my butt off 
when there's something like that?

446
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,110
 You know. . . 
How many sit-ups do you usually do?

447
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,550
 We say that there are specific routines for 
upper abdomen, lower abdomen, and obliques, but. . . 
-- Aish.

448
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,590
 If you wear the Waist Aid, you can 
work out all those areas at once.

449
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,800
Ah, I'm so busy right now!

450
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,820
Hello?!

451
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,960
 It's me, Do Min Joon.

452
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,710
Yeah, say it quickly. I'm busy.

453
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,840
This is my number.

454
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,830
Did you buy a cell phone?

455
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,090
Where are you right now?

456
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,580
Why?

457
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:40,160
We should have a meeting. 
Aren't we going to have a meeting?

458
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,060
When you have a huge star like me?

459
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,560
You wanted to have a meeting. 
What is the agenda?

460
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,720
Umm. . . Even though I let them go lately. . .

461
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,360
Yogurt, rice noodles, coffee, all kinds of instant food, 
and whatnot. . .

462
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,620
I used to do numerous food commercials, you know.

463
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,190
If I renew the contract,
 I will definitely be doing these again.

464
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,480
When that happens, don't you think I should be able to show them an upgraded version of my food eating skills?

465
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,160
Therefore, I believe that it's  very  important
 to experience various foods

466
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,040
during this precious break.

467
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,770
So?

468
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,420
What should we eat for dinner tonight, Manager Do?

469
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:28,790
For reference, I want s-p-o-o-n w-o-r-m-s.

470
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,810
I really want to have some spoon worms 
 before this winter passes.

471
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,180
Where should we go to get spoon worms?

472
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,810
Sashimi place? Department store?

473
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,710
How about Noryangjin fisheries wholesale market?

474
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,760
Don't you think we can get them at a cheaper price?

475
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,180
You wanted to have a meeting for this. . .

476
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,110
For 15 years, I've had either chicken breast 
or cabbage for dinner, you know.

477
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,870
From now on, each and every meal 
will be a very important item on the agenda for me.

478
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:57,280
I would appreciate if you could focus on this matter together with me and come up with some fresh ideas.

479
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,500
I'm not expecting anyone at this late hour...?

480
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,750
Who is it?

481
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,090
 You've got a package.

482
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,660
- I've never ordered anything-
-- Yes, wait a moment!

483
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,180
Open the door for him.

484
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,390
I've never ordered anything.

485
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,410
I ordered it.
 I have some free time these days, you know.

486
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:17,470
So I've been watching some home-shopping shows. 
It's a totally new world. There are so many good things.

487
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,760
Why would you ship it to my house then?!

488
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,600
Because I'm Cheon Song Yi. 
How can Cheon Song Yi personally receive a package?

489
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,520
You will get 2 more delivered tomorrow. 
Please accept them for me.

490
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,800
Otherwise, what's the advantage 
to having a manager?

491
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,120
Who's your manager-

492
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,700
Your name is. . . 'Manager Do'?
 Please sign here.

493
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,620
What's that?

494
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,400
It's ganjang gejang (crab marinated in soy sauce). 
You have rice, right?

495
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,980
Mixing warm rice in the crab shell is the best!

496
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,330
Where do you think you are going?

497
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:06,700
We have to eat together. I'm not the
 kind of person who would selfishly eat this alone.

498
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,610
I told you. I hate eating with other people.

499
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,860
I hate eating alone, though.

500
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,730
Aigoo. . . I should go fishing and 
add more crab or something. . .

501
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,490
Aiyoo. . . Wait a sec.

502
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,600
Ugh. . . There's only soy sauce.

503
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,090
Ah! They said that it would be full of roe!

504
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,390
Ugh. I got swindled! What a rip-off!

505
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:42,040
These bastards who would sit at Beotigogae at night. . .

506
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,860
Endure what? 
("Beoti-" = to endure)

507
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,030
Ah, well, there is a ridge called "Beotigogae", 
between Yaksu-dong and Hannam-dong.

508
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,760
And, then?

509
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,870
A long time ago, a lot of merchants 
passed through that ridge.

510
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,390
It's narrow and rough, 
so a lot of thieves used to hide there.

511
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,310
So when people saw bad people cheating 
and swindling, they would say,

512
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,200
"A bastard who would sit at Beotigogae at night."

513
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
Aiyoo. . . And I thought you weren't using
 the Joseon curses for a while.

514
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,180
First, it was "Byoongjanyeon", 
now, it's "Beotigogae"?

515
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,630
Where do you learn all that? 
Do you enjoy watching educational TV shows?

516
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,800
Ah, right. It's time for the drama.
 Let's eat in the living room.

517
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,430
We should have meals at a table (in the dining room). 
I really hate eating anywhere else.

518
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,530
Ugh. . . What's up with her make-up?

519
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,880
Her make-up is all cakey, right?

520
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,780
She looks pretty.

521
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,400
 Can you do that?

522
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,480
Aiyoo. . . That's not how you do it.

523
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,710
Don't you know that? That "feel"?

524
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:44,840
It's all from her head! Nothing from her heart!

525
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,830
I should give her some advice when I see her.

526
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,860
You should either eat or watch.

527
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,650
That, that. That's not real tears.
 It's eye drops. Fake tears.

528
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,160
If you actually cry, tears don't fall down
 prettily like that in one stream.

529
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,700
It falls from these corners of your eyes. 
Your nose runs like crazy.

530
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,490
Huh? Your nose runs, looking all disgusting. Huh?

531
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,510
You know that, right?
 If you really cry, it looks like that.

532
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,500
I'm not curious. Stop explaining.

533
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,410
There. Pass me the tissues.

534
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,420
Oh! Was it always here?

535
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,750
Yup. Since earlier.

536
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,780
It was over there. . . I just saw it.

537
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,140
You must have seen incorrectly.

538
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,630
This is serious. The viewer ratings will go down now.

539
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,780
Aiyoo. . . I brought it up to 17% with my soulful acting.

540
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,200
They're going to go crazy saying that the viewer ratings
 dropped 50% due to Cheon Song Yi leaving.

541
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,220
Viewers these days are cold-hearted, you know.

542
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,970
I think. . . Tomorrow's rating will be. . .

543
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,270
8%?

544
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,510
How do you know that?

545
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,640
I've been working in this industry for 15 years.

546
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,210
I'm a ghost. 
("I know everything.")

547
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,390
I can tell by a glance.

548
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,030
The highest possible will be... 8%?

549
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,980
 Celebration for exceeding 20% of viewers' rating.

550
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,720
Well, well.

551
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,540
I was worried, but thank you, Ms. Se Mi.

552
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
Even Cheon Song Yi couldn't bring it up to 20%. 
How did you do it?

553
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,140
 Oh, there were a lot of news articles.

554
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,190
"Rediscovery of Yoo Se Mi," 
or "Splendid Rise of a Supporting Actress."

555
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,600
Thank you everyone.

556
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,710
I will treat everyone to lunch today.

557
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,090
Please come to Hanguk Galbi (Korean BBQ).

558
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:44,950
Yoo Se Mi! Yoo Se Mi! Yoo Se Mi! 
Yoo Se Mi! Yoo Se Mi!

559
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,390
Ah, Lawyer Jang. Why do you walk so fast?

560
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,260
What about my walking?

561
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,140
Are you mad at me?

562
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,750
Why would I be mad at you?

563
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,720
I mean, you've been telling me to get a cell phone.

564
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,800
I got one and I'm even giving you my number. 
But why are you mad at me?

565
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,560
It's been over 10 years since I've been telling you
 to get a cell phone.

566
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,180
You've never listened to me.

567
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,390
Why would you buy one now 
when there's only 2 months left?!

568
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,070
Well, I thought I would need it. . .

569
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,100
Let me see your cell phone for a second.

570
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,720
 Cheon Song Yi  
(Speed dial #1)

571
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,860
I thought I would be calling her frequently.

572
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,870
Look. #2 is you, Lawyer Jang.

573
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,510
Who said I care about such things-

574
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,730
#1 or #2.

575
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,500
Who cares about that?

576
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,380
Do you want me to make you #1?

577
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,360
Aigoo. . . Seriously. Who cares about such things-

578
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,230
How childish. Forget it!

579
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,880
Wait for me.

580
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,180
Hello?

581
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,600
Yeah. I'm outside for something.

582
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,760
What kind of a manager goes out so much?

583
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,790
You should've told me if you were going out.

584
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,590
Is there something wrong?

585
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,650
Of course there is.

586
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,090
Aren't we going to discuss about our lunch menu?

587
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,140
I want to eat pot noodles.

588
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,390
What the . . . I'm hanging up.

589
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,390
Aish. . . I'm hungry.

590
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,410
Noona!

591
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,400
What's this? You are not following Yoo Se Mi around? 
Why are you here?

592
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,910
This. You left this in the car last time.

593
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,380
Ah, right.

594
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,240
I will wait for you, Noona.

595
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,240
I guess I'm accustomed to a bad woman.

596
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,080
Se Mi noona is too nice to me.
 It's uncomfortable and a bit awkward.

597
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,320
I miss your insults and violence, Noona.

598
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,500
I miss your insults and violence, Noona.

599
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,070
Yeah, hang in there for a while.

600
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,910
When I come back, I will treat you aggressively.

601
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,480
It bothers me to throw this away.

602
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,480
It bothers me even more to keep it. 
Ah!

603
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,950
What is this?

604
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,810
I wanted to eat rice.

605
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,400
I really wanted to eat these pot noodles.

606
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,700
By the way, what's up with you?

607
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,270
It was so hard to eat a meal with you
 for the last 30 years.

608
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,410
Last time, we even ate together at your house, 
and today. . .

609
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,190
Meals are quite strange.

610
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,620
Since I started to eat with someone else, 
eating alone

611
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,380
feels a bit lonely now.

612
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,520
So we should eat together often from now on.

613
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,720
Yes.

614
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,870
Ah, here. Please make an order of pot noodles to go.

615
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,040
Okay.

616
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,310
N-No.

617
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,490
Make 2 orders.

618
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,490
What are you going to do with 2?

619
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,760
Just. . .

620
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,830
I will save one for later.

621
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,250
 Fifty years's tradition Yoo-

622
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,020
Thank you for the food.

623
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,910
Is something wrong?

624
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,220
It's cold.

625
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,900
Of course it's cold. It's winter.

626
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,640
Are you cold?

627
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,400
You don't feel coldness that well, though.

628
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,600
I guess. . .

629
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,890
it means the time for me to leave is getting nearer.

630
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,500
I think. . . my body is changing little by little.

631
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,710
You sit right there, alright?

632
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,500
Good.

633
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,880

634
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,880
 Please get me out of here.

635
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,560
 I'm not crazy.

636
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,540
 - I feel like I'd lose my mind if I stay here. 
- What's this?

637
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,000
 Tell me.

638
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,600
 Why did you end up here?

639
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,980
 That person put me here.

640
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,630
 Because I found out his secret.

641
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,340
 What's that secret?

642
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,760
What is this?

643
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,630
 - I can't tell you. 
- Is it an independent film?

644
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,690
 Please get me out of here.

645
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,420
Or is it a prank or something?

646
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,170
 You stay away from him, too. 
-- Who is that woman in front of Han Yoo Ra?

647
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,150
 If you don't, he might kill you.

648
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,270
You sounded like you weren't going to buy this for me?

649
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,600
Someone gave it to me, so I brought it here.

650
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,790
There are two. You haven't had lunch yet?

651
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,340
No.

652
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,730
That's good. Let's eat together.

653
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,910
I can eat later by myself. . .

654
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,810
Or I should eat now then.

655
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,460
Things have gotten more complicated.

656
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,430
You may go on.

657
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,060
Go on with what?

658
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,940
What's wrong?

659
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,370
There's a little trouble that I need to take care of.

660
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:24,220
- What's up?
-- I'm going to have dinner with Song Yi tonight. 
Do you want to join?

661
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,270
You said we should all get together for dinner one day.

662
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:29,280
What should I do? I have plans for tonight.

663
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,340
Is that so?

664
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,770
Ah, what about tomorrow night?

665
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,080
That works.

666
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,370
Alright. I will ask Song Yi first and arrange it.

667
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,470
Okay.

668
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,170
Unfortunately, Song Yi probably. . .

669
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,150
won't be able to make it to dinner tomorrow night.

670
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,720
Where did you get this? It's delicious.

671
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,820
They've been in business for 
over 50 years and 3 generations.

672
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,840
I see. No wonder.

673
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,110
It's not as good as the first generation though.

674
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,770
You sound like you've eaten this since then.

675
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,110
Don't people say you sound like an old man?

676
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:11,270
You look fine, but it feels like you
 have an old man inside.

677
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,780
Hello?

678
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,940
That's already out?

679
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,770
Today? Wait a second.
 Let me check my schedule.

680
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,190
Oh, I have a little time. I will be there shortly.

681
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,320
Yeah, I need to go to my next schedule, so. . . 
Alright!

682
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:35,350
Manager Do! We've got a schedule!

683
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,950
- What is it?
-- I sent my clothes out for alteration 
It's all set to be picked up.

684
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,730
It's been a while since I went out of the house. 
What should I wear?

685
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,930
What's that?

686
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,890
Ah, that? One of my fans sent the teddy bear
 to me as a gift.

687
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:49,560
It's cute, isn't it?

688
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,900
What are you doing?

689
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,430
What's that?

690
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:29,230
Who could possibly be keeping 
his/her eyes on me?

691
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,050
Why?

692
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,500
Even putting in money, time, and effort. . .

693
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,130
Does that person hate me so much?

694
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,230
Come out after you've completed your business.

695
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,080
Don't go.

696
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,770
I won't.

697
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,010
Thanks.

698
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:26,100
I was going to call you. . .

699
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,220
Do you have some time?

700
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,800
I watched your drama well.

701
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,760
Oh, yeah.

702
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:53,800
Last time, I think there was some misunderstanding. . .

703
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,420
I didn't misunderstand anything.

704
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,770
You left that night after getting a text 
from the director.

705
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,660
Then you lied to me that your mom got hurt.

706
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,240
I knew that you had already told 
the director you'd do it.

707
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,800
Why did you lie to me that you
 weren't going to do it?

708
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,080
Did you think that I would make a fuss 
to stop you from doing it?

709
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,160
I thought you'd feel bad.

710
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,910
Not anyone else, but because it was me.

711
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:22,660
If I, whom you don't acknowledge 
as your competition, take over your place,

712
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,820
it would've hurt your pride and made you feel bad.

713
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,070
I don't acknowledge you?

714
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,220
If I didn't acknowledge you,

715
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:37,770
would I have begged the directors and writers 
of every production I was in to let you be in it, too?

716
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:40,020
You get jealous easily.

717
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,030
You are way more competitive than
 anyone else. But you . . .

718
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:48,080
You were never on your guard around me. 
You never tried to compete against me. 
You just wanted to keep me next to you.

719
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,980
Did you think I was a fool

720
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,920
who didn't understand the meaning?

721
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,320
Even though I hated more than death to be in that position, 
since there was no other way. . .

722
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,870
I, who had to stand there

723
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,230
and smile at you. . .

724
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,230
Have you ever thought about how I felt?

725
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,360
I wanted. . .

726
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,810
for you. . .

727
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:11,770
at least once,

728
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:14,430
to be jealous of me,

729
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,160
to be on your guard against me,

730
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,610
and compete against me.

731
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:21,880
Yoo Se Mi. That's because. . .

732
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,520
You listen to me now! I always listened to you!

733
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,530
Listen to me from now on.

734
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:32,170
What did you expect?

735
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,470
Did you think I would be sorry for taking your place?

736
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,070
Those things you earned without any effort.

737
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,620
With a desperate effort,

738
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,020
I've only just started to earn little by little.

739
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,360
Sorry?

740
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,300
I'm not sorry at all.

741
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:00,850
You. . .

742
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,410
Have you ever considered me your friend?

743
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:06,870
Ah. . .

744
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,670
For that, I am sorry.

745
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,690
Not even once.

746
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,500
There were many times when I felt like crap 
since I hit rock bottom.

747
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,940
But there's one good thing out of it.

748
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,100
I can filter out people.

749
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,120
Real allies . . . and enemies,
 who pretended to be allies.

750
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:39,380
Sometimes, when trouble comes into one's life,

751
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,850
I wonder whether it may not be a god-given chance

752
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,740
to filter out the real from the fake.

753
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,240
Hospital gown, psha.

754
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,040
Do I have to be hospitalized?

755
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,360
I fainted momentarily from shock. 
 I didn't even bleed.

756
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,200
Even though there is no trauma that is visible,  
you have to be examined.

757
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,980
There's a chance for brain hemorrhage, and one in a million chance for acute subdural hemorrhage.

758
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,890
Therefore, you need to take a CT scan
 and a MRI, so stay still.

759
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:15,190
I've thought about it since
 the last time, Do Manager.

760
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:17,090
Is being a doctor your dream?

761
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,480
Just know that I am better than most doctors.

762
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,730
Hello.

763
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,120
Were you able to catch him?

764
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,840
I will go there right now.

765
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,110
Who? The one that terrorized me?
- Yeah.

766
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,740
You said he wore a helmet, right?

767
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,500
That is him. The one who sent the 
death threat and the teddy bear, too.

768
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,930
He's a guy who even sent a picture 
with blood all over it.

769
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:41,790
Even then, it is a relief because 
he has been caught.

770
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:44,190
Bad jerk.

771
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:46,560
Tell them there will be no out-of-court settlement.

772
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,210
But...

773
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,160
Earlier, when the accident happened,

774
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,970
I clearly saw you in the car, Manager Do.

775
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:01,280
So, how did you save me in 
less than one second?

776
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,980
You saw it wrong.

777
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,490
No, I clearly (saw)....

778
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,700
I will be back. Rest.

779
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,230
I told you it was a prank.

780
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,230
Can't a guy pull a prank?

781
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,840
It's attempted murder, you punk!

782
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,280
A prank?

783
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,250
I just did it, once.

784
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:34,550
Just because the victim is a celebrity, aren't
 you being too harsh in your investigation?

785
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:37,890
I fell on the rooftop earlier,
 so my ankle also hurts.

786
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,040
I am Do Min Joon.

787
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,110
The one who filed the report?

788
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,770
Is the culprit . . .

789
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,310
this person?

790
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,680
Is he going to be late?

791
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:11,380

792
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,630
I will give you a shot.

793
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,320
Okay.

794
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:23,260
Manager Do. Stop by Noryangjin and buy some
 fat innkeeper worm. (AKA "spoon worm, penis fish)

795
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,000
To sum up everything  . . .

796
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,090
Last Thursday, to Cheon Song Yi's house,

797
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:44,010
you sent a bloody portrait.

798
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:48,250
The message was meant for her to repent, 
since she killed our Yoo Ra.

799
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:53,550
Last Sunday, you sent a dead  rat ...

800
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,890
This is also correct, right?

801
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,420
From what I can see, she had no intention to repent.

802
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:04,620
And, today around 4pm - a fish bowl attack...

803
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,560
I think there is one more thing.

804
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,310
A stuffed bear.  One with a video camera in it.

805
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:10,660
Ah yeah.

806
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,440
You also sent a bear with a camera attached, right?

807
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,280
That wasn't me.

808
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,830
I admitted to all the other things.

809
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:41,230
So, why wouldn't I admit to this one, too?

810
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,430
I'm telling you, it wasn't me who sent it!

811
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:47,790
Then besides this bastard,

812
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:50,620
could there be another bastard 
who is after Cheon Song Yi?

813
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,450
  Manager Do.

814
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,130
  The person you dialed is not available....

815
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,800
Please save me.

816
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,500
Please save me.

817
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,380
Manager Do!

818
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,090
Manager Do!

819
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,120
Please save me.

820
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:08,720
Do Min Joon!

821
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:43,600
 ♫ It seemed to be love. 
 It can't be anything but love. ♫

822
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:49,170
 ♫ In my eyes,
 inside of my heart ♫

823
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:53,220
Spank, spank, spank.
 ♫  Because you are brilliant like a star. ♫

824
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:59,400
Food, food, food. I am going to eat it all.
 ♫ You come at the start of each day. ♫

825
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:03,840
 ♫ You come at the end of each day. ♫

826
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,220
 ♫ I only wish that. ♫

827
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:11,750
Teddy bear! Such a cute teddy bear!

828
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,000
 ♫ Today has passed. ♫

829
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,900
Everybody say!
 ♫ I can't still say I love you. ♫

830
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:27,540
Boo!
 ♫  From a little distance behind you,  ♫

831
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,000
 ♫ I smile ♫

832
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,330
You sit right there, alright?

833
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,060
  Please get me out of here, please.

834
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,290
What is this?

835
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:44,590
  I wasn't crazy. I think I will really go crazy being here.

836
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,690
  What are you doing now?

837
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:09,860
 ~ Preview ~
What kind of drug did you give her that 
she has no memory of the past hour?

838
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,010
 What kind of bastard is he? 
I will kill him with my own hands.

839
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:15,800
  That person blocked the car and 
disappeared in one second?

840
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,860
 It's too vivid to call it a dream.

841
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:21,390
 But, it doesn't make sense to call it reality.

842
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,360
 Who was the one that appeared suddenly?

843
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,220
 I am not sure.

844
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,860
 I don't have any clue at all.

845
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,390
 For a while, stay here.

846
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:30,950
 When I am having a hard time, strangely,
 you are next to me.

847
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:35,010
  I saw that man from 10 years ago.

848
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:38,500
  What do you think will happen 
if I tell Song Yi about this?
