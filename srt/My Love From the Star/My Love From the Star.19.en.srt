[Heo Kyun from Gyosan]

3
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,140
Mr. Heo Kyun’s respectable name is heard of

4
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,510
by even a plain hermit like me.

5
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,000
May I ask why you travel so far to look for me?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,160
I have been writing a novel lately.

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,030
It’s a story about Hong Gil-dong.

8
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:08,180
He masters Taoist magic and save people with it.

9
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,420
And then?

10
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,260
I heard that you can perform Taoist magic.

11
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,620
My character is fictional after all.

12
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,020
I want to see a Taoist magician with my eyes,

13
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,870
so that my novel will be more down-to-earth.

14
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,690
I’ve tried different channels to finally find you.

15
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,150
What?

16
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,539
Excuse me…

17
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,740
Don’t scare me, please.

18
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,580
Is this what you’re looking for?

19
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,220
God.

20
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,979
That’s… that’s astounding!

21
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,680
It’s like in a dream. May I touch…

22
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,090
I’m studying arts like invisibility.

23
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,150
You appeared and disappeared like magic.

24
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,110
What kind of Taoist magic is that?

25
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,420
That’s not Taoist magic.

26
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,430
But…

27
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,920
If that’s not Taoist magic…

28
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,310
Then you must be divine!

29
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,240
You are similar to my character.

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,220
That’s not true.

31
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,610
Your character is keen and righteous.

32
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,960
He saves people with his Taoist magic.

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,520
But I’m not like that.

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,380
Could you please tell me why?

35
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,080
Instead of hiding yourself in a remote place,

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,970
you can go out to make people’s life better.

37
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,750
I used to openly help people with my power.

38
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,880
But they treated me like a monster.

39
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,240
So I decided not to be stupid to do that again.

40
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:25,230
What if it’s for who you love?

41
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,230
If she’s in danger

42
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,410
will you still choose to fold your hands?

43
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,760
Pity.

44
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,410
I don’t have a loved one.

45
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,829
That’s for now.

46
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:46,120
The world is enormous and your life’s long.

47
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,910
You’ll meet a lot of people.

48
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,280
The one you love may show up.

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,710
That won’t happen to me.

50
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:01,990
Also, I won’t stay here forever.

51
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,280
When it’s time, I will return to my place.

52
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,390
So even if I see the world

53
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,260
and meet millions of people,

54
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,500
I won’t give my heart to anyone.

55
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,230
I’m not stupid enough to do so.

56
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,240
[My Love from the Star Record 19]

57
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,050
If I miss this chance to come back,

58
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,730
I’ll disappear from this planet.

59
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,680
And soon… I’ll die…

60
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,960
Will it be OK if you stay?

61
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,590
It’s OK.

62
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,780
Seriously?

63
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,210
[And soon… I’ll die…]

64
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,380
Mr. Do.

65
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,320
No.

66
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,820
You know I’m not his father.

67
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,380
He told me

68
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,780
you are like his father.

69
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,580
You said this when he was sick last time.

70
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,820
He’ll be back in 3 months.

71
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,270
Why did he say that?

72
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,960
Where would Do Min-joon go?

73
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,030
You knew it, didn’t you?

74
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,590
But I can’t believe it.

75
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,130
Sometimes he disappears all of a sudden,

76
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,150
and then appears out of nowhere.

77
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,650
I’ve seen this.

78
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,700
But still I can’t believe

79
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,080
he’s from another planet.

80
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,750
He told me

81
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,909
he needed to return to his planet.

82
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:52,390
That’s true.

83
00:06:52,390 --> 00:07:00,640
But then he told me

84
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,030
he would not go.

85
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,550
And it will be OK if he doesn’t go.

86
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,960
But I secretly read his diary.

87
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,650
It reads,

88
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:25,060
he will die if he doesn’t go back.

89
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,080
He’s like a totally different person now.

90
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,950
He used not to feel cold or hot at all.

91
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,990
But now he’s always cold.

92
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,730
Sometimes he can’t even use his superpower.

93
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,560
Will he really die

94
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,030
if he doesn’t go back?

95
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:02,140
And if he knows he will die,

96
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,260
why does he choose

97
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,170
to stay with me?

98
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,560
You now know how much he loves you.

99
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:27,630
He love with you long before you did.

100
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:34,789
His love for you is beyond imagination.

101
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:40,320
He didn’t want you to love him back.

102
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,410
He tried hard to prevent this situation.

103
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,850
I’ve talked to him many times.

104
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,020
But no matter what I said,

105
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:57,600
he’s willing to risk his life to stay with you.

106
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,610
Why do you ask me to be here?

107
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,420
Hi, Mr. Do Min-joon.

108
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,810
It’s true. You can walk in a closed door.

109
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,280
Amazing.

110
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,060
But what on earth are you, Mr. Do Min-joon?

111
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,130
A wizard?

112
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,300
This why you want me here?

113
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,650
What else can you do?

114
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:03,170
You look exactly the same as 12 years ago.

115
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,340
You move very fast.

116
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,960
You walk through the door without touching it.

117
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,860
I’ve loved her for 15 years.

118
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,990
I’ve never won her heart. But you have.

119
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,910
You’ve had it all, Do Min-joon!

120
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,500
I envy you so much.

121
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,650
Well, I envy you.

122
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,970
Me?

123
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,680
I…

124
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,640
One of my families,

125
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,950
wanted to kill the woman I loved,

126
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:06,990
and literally killed my eldest brother.

127
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,400
The day

128
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,210
when my eldest brother died…

129
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,750
Hee-kyung, can you bring this to Han-kyung?

130
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,700
OK.

131
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,820
It was me…

132
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:37,940
I handed the poison to him.

133
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,590
It’s not your fault.

134
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,820
If the truth comes to light,

135
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:59,450
how painful will my parents be?

136
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,850
What will my family become?

137
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,340
I’m sorry, but we can’t cover this.

138
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:14,090
Lee Jae-kyung holds a grudge against you now.

139
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:20,730
He may also hurt Soon-yi.

140
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,780
That’s why I ask you to come.

141
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,320
I don’t know what to do.

142
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,120
I have no one else to turn to but you.

143
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,390
Tell me

144
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,810
what I should do.

145
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,320
I’ve gone home. It’s been a long day today.

146
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,450
See you tomorrow, Do Min-joon.

147
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,970
OK.

148
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,020
See you tomorrow, Cheon Soon-yi.

00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,090
Do Min-joon.

338
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,640
Are you OK?

339
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,870
Why is she here?

340
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,990
That man. Isn’t he her manager?

341
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,570
Is she injured?

342
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,810
What a crowd. It’s noisy.

343
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,760
Let’s go to a quiet place.

344
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,570
OK. Let’s go.

345
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,260
-They disappear again!
-My god!

346
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,890
-What’s happening?
-Where have they gone?

347
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,490
What’s this place, Do Min-joon?

348
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,910
I made it.

349
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,490
I was not even sure about reaching this far.

350
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,150
Where are we now?

351
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,930
Did you ask for somewhere quite?

352
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,690
Oh.

353
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:24,460
No one else will come other than us.

354
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,640
Really?

355
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,990
No one can find us here.

356
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,520
Is this your planet?

357
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,590
Like an alien planet?

358
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,170
Yes.

359
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:51,960
Seriously?

360
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,600
I say yes.

361
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,030
But will I be OK? Will I be floating?

362
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,650
See, I’m doing fine. Breathing, and standing.

363
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,990
I’m totally fine, Do Min-joon.

364
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,330
Silly.

365
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,150
What?

366
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,720
How can this be another planet?
Do you know how far away it is?

367
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,600
We’re not?

368
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,960
Of course not.

369
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,900
And what difference will that make?

370
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,060
What difference? It means I can live there.

371
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,390
I can live on as long as I can breathe.

372
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,320
I’m tough, you know?

373
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,370
I must be no less beautiful than anyone there.

374
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,050
A global star on your planet.

375
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,410
There must be a way out.

376
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,460
But

377
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:10,670
where on earth are we?

378
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,420
No one else will be here?

379
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,800
Only you and I are here!

380
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,450
No police, no reporters, no other people.

381
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,280
No one’s here!

382
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,290
I am Cheon Soon-yi.

383
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,940
Come get me!

384
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,130
He is an alien.

385
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,860
Come get him, too!

386
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,670
We will be here together!

387
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,310
Until we get old.

388
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:07,830
Right here. Only two of us!

389
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,380
We will live our life!

390
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,460
Come try it too.

391
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,850
Try what?

392
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,110
Yelling out, like I did.

393
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,430
We will live our life! The two of us!

394
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,210
Right. There’s nothing you can do with us!

395
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,680
Feels good!

396
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,120
Shall we take a photo?

397
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,400
Why?

398
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,650
Let’s do it.

399
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,090
I’ve even cleaned my face.

400
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,460
Let’s use your phone.

401
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,420
Give it to me.

402
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,290
That tree looks special.

403
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,170
Twinned trunks.

404
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,030
Their roots are intertwined,

405
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,440
so they look like a whole.

406
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,960
This is camellia tree.

407
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,920
That is camphor tree.

408
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,190
They are different varieties,

409
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,160
but still they are intertwined.

410
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,920
How I envy them.

411
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,750
They’ll be together till they die.

412
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,740
Let’s take a photo.

413
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,700
Again?

414
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,780
That’s too much.

415
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,310
Photos are all we’re left with.

416
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,780
There must be chaos out there.

417
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,090
Perhaps.

418
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,800
Hey,

419
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,870
imagine we are in a different space-time here

420
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,760
just like your planet is from the Earth.

421
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,890
I’m not the infamous actress Cheon Soon-yi.

422
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:45,870
And you’re not an undercover alien.

423
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,080
Our identities won’t bother us.

424
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,220
Let’s not worry about the outside world

425
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,520
when we are here.

426
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,130
Do Min-joon.

427
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,910
Yes, Cheon Soon-yi?

428
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,739
I love you.

429
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:22,270
I want to live here if you’re here.

430
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:32,389
If you leave for another planet, I’ll be there.

431
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,830
I love you.

432
00:34:48,920 --> 00:35:00,680
♫ Finally I see you at a glance ♫

433
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:55,989
I’ve been insecure about whether you will leave.

434
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,050
I would rather give my soul away

435
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:07,400
♫ Everything has changed greatly ♫

436
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,790
to freeze the time

437
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,540
♫ You divides my world into two ♫

438
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,190
so that we can be together.

439
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,240
It upsets me so much

440
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,210
♫ When you breathe ♫

441
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,780
that occasionally I think

442
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:23,070
♫ I feel a warm breeze ♫

443
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,220
♫ When you smile ♫

444
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,230
I should not have met you in the first place.

445
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:30,460
♫ I see a shining star ♫

446
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,220
But then I reckon

447
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,440
♫ You are there ♫

448
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,020
I will meet you anyway

449
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,690
♫ one and only ♫

450
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,530
even if time flies back.

451
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:44,960
♫ Sometimes you lean on my shoulder without words ♫

452
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,780
We will still be rambling and quarrelling.

453
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,390
♫ For me ♫

454
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,270
♫ it’s a happy moment ♫

455
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,370
You’ll still fall for me,

456
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,320
♫ With you ♫

457
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,800
♫ time flows or stops ♫

458
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:05,740
♫ I couldn't take eyes off you ♫

459
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,620
and love me.

460
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:12,520
♫ Nothing else I can do ♫

461
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:19,670
♫ If only you have me in all your moments ♫

462
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,290
That’s right.

463
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,540
What’s your problem?

464
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,560
I’ve gone this far

465
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:29,050
♫ This wish arouses waves of emotions about you ♫

466
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,570
and all I hear from you is “that’s right”?

467
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,630
When a girl explicitly speaks out her love,

468
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,270
you should at least respond her with…

469
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:45,610
♫ If only you have me in all your moments ♫

470
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,480
Damn!

471
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,810
We’re there.

472
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:09,540
The top 10 real-time searches are all about
Cheon Soon-yi and Do Min-joon.

473
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,680
I knew that man’s not like us.

474
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,010
I knew it.

475
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,030
Now here comes more heated news.

476
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,750
Director Lee Jae-kyung of S&C

477
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,520
was arrested as a suspect of Han Yoo-ra case.

478
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,260
Soon-yi will be popular again

479
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,600
as long as she comes back.

480
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,240
Is that so?

481
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,880
People pity her for being wronged previously.

482
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,050
Plus the breaking news today.

483
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,270
Everyone will just stick their nose into her.

484
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:37,640
They think she’s still our employee,
so the advertisers are…

485
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,610
Advertisers?

486
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,230
Really?

487
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:44,220
See? Everything about her is sensational.

488
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,230
Dating a man with superpower.

489
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,160
That sounds juicy.

490
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,320
The public must feel the same.

491
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,710
But where’s Soon-yi now?

492
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,980
I heard she didn’t have an assistant at work.

493
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,480
After all the sufferings, I’m worried about her.

494
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,080
Do I need to do something for her?

495
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,410
Gotta call her

496
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,540
when she comes back.

497
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,870
An unbelievable thing happened in Seoul CBD.

498
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,480
Mr. Do, Cheon Soon-yi’s former manager

499
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,120
vanished with this actress together.

500
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:21,110
There are dozens of witnesses of this scene.

501
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,570
Netizens are sharing videos online and SNS.

502
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,580
Wild guesses are going viral.

503
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,670
Some believe Mr. Do to be an alien,

504
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,160
and wizard.

505
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,130
But scientists believe

506
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,160
that the guesses are impossible.

507
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,340
They deny the incident as a fact.

508
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,680
Is that what you want?

509
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,380
Are you happy?

510
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,050
When did you wake up?

511
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,770
Just now.

512
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,700
Sleep a bit longer if you feel tired.

513
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,640
I’m fine.

514
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,480
Your fever is brought down a bit.

515
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,070
But you’re doing much better.

516
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,300
Have you adapted to kissing?

517
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,590
Do we need to take a photo for this?

518
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,280
Again?

519
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,680
Aren’t you hungry?

520
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,620
I am.

521
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,040
But, Do Min-joon,

522
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,850
how many children do you want?

523
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,070
What?

524
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,990
Well, we should start planning, right?

525
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,800
How many children do you want?

526
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,220
Tell me.

527
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,660
7?

528
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,790
7?

529
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,700
That’s too many.

530
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,600
That’s our custom.

531
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,900
Every family has at least 7 or 8 kids.

532
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,130
Many of them even have 12.

533
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,270
Really?

534
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,700
Then 4 girls and 3 boys.

535
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,650
7 girls.

536
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,180
You want all of them to be girls?

537
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,030
I like girls. Boys are too feisty.

538
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,300
OK. I’ll think about it

539
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,520
But that’s not under my control.

540
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,170
What if there’s a boy?

541
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,660
Boy it is.

542
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,150
We gotta raise him if we give birth to him.

543
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,160
If we have 7 kids,

544
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,610
the apartment will not be spacious enough,

545
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,790
right?

546
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,840
It would seem so.

547
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,120
What about suburbs of Seoul, or rural region?

548
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,290
A villa is better that an apartment, right?

549
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,500
A house with yard.

550
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,250
My aunt lives in Pyeongtaek.

551
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,780
She’s got a yard.

552
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,830
But it’s hard to manage.

553
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,270
There must be more trouble.

554
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,340
Can we keep some dogs?

555
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,400
What’s wrong?

556
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,590
Nothing.

557
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,860
I like house with yard.

558
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,250
And dogs.

559
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,220
Of course.

560
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,660
And what about you?

561
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,520
Do you have anything to say to me?

562
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,580
What?

563
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,750
Well, it might sound childish, but

564
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:27,460
you’ve never confessed your feelings to me.

565
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,840
You’ve never said words like

566
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,880
“crush”

567
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,340
or

568
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,220
“love”…

569
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,930
Why don’t you just have your noodles?

570
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:52,550
I often speak out my love. I did just now.

571
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,340
Hey.

572
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,590
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

573
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,490
You look so sexy when eating noodles.

574
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,360
Stop it.

575
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,880
You’ve been busy taking photos all day.

576
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,030
Wasn’t it urgent arrest?

577
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,850
Then don’t let them issue

578
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,640
the warrant for formal arrest.

579
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,190
Hold it up.

580
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:40,490
After all, this is an entrapment operation.

581
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,480
Also,

582
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,360
Silence the press.

583
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,870
If you can’t even cope with the reporters,

584
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,670
you can just quit.

585
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,190
Just do as I say.

586
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,590
Mute this scandal whatever it takes.

587
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:56,470
Jae-kyung is the heir to my business.

588
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:59,050
He can’t be stained. Understand?

589
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,500
You think you can take your brother’s place

590
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,230
if you destroy him?

591
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,510
He’s made marvelous achievements.

592
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,110
He just made a small mistake

593
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,780
and you used it as a weapon against him?

594
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,670
Who do you think you are?

595
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,070
However hard you try

596
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,280
to ruin your brother,

597
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,660
you won’t get a single penny from his share.

598
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,980
Nothing…

599
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,870
I want nothing.

600
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,730
I come here

601
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,410
to beg you

602
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,360
not to help him.

603
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,380
He’s done so many things wrong.

604
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,750
He even

605
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,990
tried to kill Cheon Soon-yi today.

606
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,530
Make up a better lie, will you?

607
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,370
What is he after?

608
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,340
He’s got everything.

609
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,430
Why does he need to do that?

610
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,780
But today,

611
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,390
he poisoned Cheon Soon-yi’s wine.

612
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,500
Lucky that

613
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,580
she didn’t drink much to get herself killed.

614
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,200
I’ll drink it all.

615
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,090
Please believe me

616
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,610
when I finish the wine

617
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,010
that Lee Jae-kyung

618
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:35,480
won’t hesitate to kill someone

619
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,840
if it’s for his own purpose.

620
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,260
He’s a devil.

621
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,870
Even if

622
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,620
he did plan to kill Cheon Soon-yi,

623
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,980
he must have his own reason.

624
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,730
That woman must have made terrible mistakes.

625
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:05,240
My boy will never hurt others. He…

626
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,950
Don’t kill me.

627
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,990
Whose voice is this?

628
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,170
Do you still remember, dad?

629
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,210
What are you trying to play now?

630
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,010
Sorry, dad.

631
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,020
You’re not drunk.

632
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:37,950
You’re feeling numb.

633
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:40,930
What?

634
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,050
You will feel feeble soon.

635
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,320
Unable to walk.

636
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,230
Short of breath

637
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,800
Tongue paralyzed.

638
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,600
Then you’ll fall deep asleep.

639
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,090
What are you talking about?

640
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,770
You’ll be found in the middle of an express way,

641
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,240
dying of DUI.

642
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,560
Jae-kyung…

643
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,650
I always wanted you to disappear.

644
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,050
You are so in my way.

645
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:12,470
I don’t have any chance

646
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,530
because I was born later.

647
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,030
Don’t kill me, Jae-kyung.

648
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,740
Sorry, dad.

649
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,230
Sorry.

650
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,690
Call her again.

651
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,030
The subscriber you dial is power off.

652
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,470
Power off?

653
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:59,650
What is all this about?

654
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,060
Where has he gone with my daughter?

655
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,860
Bloody Do Min-joon…

656
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,840
Don’t worry, mom.

657
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,690
How can I not worry?

658
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:09,030
Min-joon

659
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,950
will never put Soon-yi in danger.

660
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,260
That’s true.

661
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,670
I’ve met him. He’s a nice young man.

662
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:17,110
A nice young man who took my daughter away?

663
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,900
They don’t even give me a call.

664
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,650
Did you watch the TV?

665
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:21,550
Soon-yi was in danger,

666
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,430
and Min-joon was the one who saved her.

667
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,820
Everyone rushed in. He had to disappear.

668
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,130
Who does he think he is?

669
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,340
He’s not even a doctor.

670
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,500
Soon-yi loves him.

671
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,740
They will return safe and sound.

672
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,070
We just wait.

673
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,590
I can’t just wait.

674
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,520
Don’t you have other clothes?

675
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,530
Do Min-joon, where’s your planet?

676
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,650
You can’t see it from here.

677
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,890
I can’t?

678
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,830
Then how can I see it?

679
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,600
Why?

680
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,090
I just wanna know.

681
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,850
Is it in the south or the north?

682
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,800
Is it there?

683
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,730
There? Or there?

684
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,450
Feel cold?

685
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,990
I’m warm.

686
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,740
Do Min-joon.

687
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,870
Yes?

688
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:47,540
Let’s come here every summer.

689
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,020
Good idea.

690
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:57,770
We’ll come with our 7 kids and 5 dogs.

691
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:02,640
Years later we’ll come with grandchildren.

692
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,600
We don’t need to travel abroad.

693
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,990
This place is perfect enough.

694
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,400
OK.

695
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:15,100
Wow, that will be a big family.

696
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,750
We gotta work hard to raise them.

697
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,200
You’ll have to give more lectures

698
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,770
and I’ll have to play whatever roles I have.

699
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,330
That’s right.

700
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:35,730
That’s a promise?

701
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:38,870
Yes, I promise.

702
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,800
Sing a song for me.

703
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,770
You’ve never sung for me.

704
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,020
What song?

705
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:04,200
A song that reminds me of you,

706
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:08,640
and reminds you of me.

707
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:16,590
A song that will stay forever in our memory.

708
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:40,720
The stars shine exceptionally bright

709
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:48,260
But after this moment

710
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,260
You’ll have to leave me

711
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:03,710
I can’t help feeling depressed

712
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,580
Tonight will be over soon

713
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:19,010
The sweet moments we spent together

714
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:26,040
The countless promises of love

715
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:34,510
All these are flashing back

716
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:42,290
I can’t help feeling depressed

717
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:51,590
This is not your fault

718
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:59,180
My eyes are filled with tears somehow

719
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:06,500
How desperately I hope

720
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:14,060
That this is only a dream

721
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,490
Thank you.

722
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:50,400
Cheon Soon-yi, I may not be able to say

723
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,160
all that you want me to say.

724
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,660
But I do want to be part of the future

725
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,420
you just pictured.

726
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,710
Put it on my finger.

727
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:05,700
I’ve always wanted an old-fashioned proposal.

728
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:13,700
Never knew I’d make an old-fashioned proposal.

729
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,760
That’s perfect happiness.

730
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:38,370
Do Min-joon.

731
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,000
What, Cheon Soon-yi?

732
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,420
Do Min-joon, my love.

733
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,210
Yes?

734
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,260
We should wake up from dream now.

735
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,400
Promise me,

736
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:06,620
please live on somewhere.

737
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:09,790
Promise me,

738
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,240
please don’t die.

739
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,960
Live on somewhere.

740
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:25,740
I’m saying

741
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,540
you should go.

742
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,580
Return to your planet.

743
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,550
I’ve had a pleasant conversation with you today.

744
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,890
This will be cherished memory.

745
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:13,300
I also gain inspirations for my novel.

746
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,170
I appreciate that.

747
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,330
Can I say something before I leave?

748
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,110
Please fire away.

749
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,230
I can’t predict the future,

750
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,010
but as far as I’m concerned,

751
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:32,200
you will meet a woman you love

752
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:36,890
with your whole heart before you leave here.

753
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:38,990
For her,

754
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:44,630
you’d rather give up everything.

755
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:46,640
How can you tell?

756
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,880
Because love is treacherous.

757
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,600
To those who don’t believe love,

758
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,000
love is even stronger, more irresistible

759
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,310
and more overwhelming.
