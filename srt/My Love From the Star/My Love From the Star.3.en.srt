[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,270
Who is she?

3
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,140
Why do you take my photo without my permission?

4
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,360
Who is she?

5
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,940
I have to answer you?

6
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,520
What are you doing?

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,730
Are you crazy?

8
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,210
Who

9
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,820
are you?

10
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,879
Who are you? I feel curious

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,460
because you can stand in the air,

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,300
with weird clothes and strange hairstyle.

13
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,060
And the strange object floats down from the sky.

14
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,730
Everything is strange.

15
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,670
What is your real identity?

16
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,430
I won’t be shocked no matter what.

17
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,570
Don’t look down upon me. I like reading

18
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,510
the collections of bizarre stories.

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,289
Mother often said it’s ridiculous,

20
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:36,020
but I don’t think only mankind exist in the world.

21
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,640
There probably be things like ghosts, monsters,

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,140
nine-tailed foxes and emissaries.

23
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,320
Which one do you belong to?

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,310
You don’t have anything to say?

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,640
Then do you have a place to go?

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,200
Where are your families?

27
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,760
No matter who you are,

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,570
you are my savior.

29
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,750
In that case,

30
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,890
mother-in-law may allow you to stay.

31
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,890
So, please go with me.

32
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,690
Follow me!

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,250
I will help you.

34
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:57,020
What an unlucky thing!

35
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,950
Madam Seo hanged and killed herself

36
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,970
last night at the foot of the hill.

37
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,490
In memory of her virtue,

38
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:15,510
we’ll apply to the court for the title of paragon.

39
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,590
The funeral is held tonight.

40
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,240
Find out the kid and kill her.

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:48,190
She is conferred upon and can’t be found alive.

42
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,610
Yes.

43
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,390
This

44
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,170
is my grave.

45
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,840
What am I now?

46
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,990
What will happen if they find me alive?

47
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,030
What should I do now?

48
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,420
I’ll visit the parental home in Kangneung

49
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,590
and tell all this to my father.

50
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,490
He may tell me the way to survive.

51
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,650
Thank you for all your help.

52
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,620
I don’t know where you were from,

53
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,640
but I hope you can return safely.

54
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,250
I don’t know your identity.

55
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,070
But you seem to have superpower.

56
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,620
Anyway, please don’t worry about me.

57
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,560
Leave here

58
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,210
together with me.

59
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,270
Let me

60
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,240
protect you.

61
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,600
Are you asking who I am?

62
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,740
You still don’t know me? I’m Cheon Song-yi.

63
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,550
Yes, you are Cheon Song-yi.

64
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,320
You can’t be her.

65
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,950
Who is she?

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,150
She and I are alike?

67
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:06,230
Right, many people in Cheongdam-dong

68
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,680
want to have my face via surgery.

69
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,950
But fake ones

70
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,290
are never better than the real one.

71
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,300
Hey, what are you looking at?

72
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,610
The shoes

73
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,810
are yours?

74
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,470
Of course.

75
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,790
This is the only pair throughout the country.

76
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,400
I will never use casual brands.

77
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,930
[My Love from the Star Record 3]

78
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,480
Is it rebirth

79
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,250
or doppelganger?

80
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,370
You are not superstitious.

81
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,950
How can you make an illogical speculation?

82
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,870
Please be logical. It’s impossible.

83
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,830
An alien exists, so rebirth is also possible.

84
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,530
As for logics, your existence is illogical.

85
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,679
What’s your plan?

86
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,610
What?

87
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,940
I mean the shoes you mentioned.

88
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,000
Will it be like 12 years ago?

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,370
You are foreseeing the accident later on?

90
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,610
The owner of the shoes may die?

91
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,960
Will you get involved like 12 years ago

92
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,190
or just let it be

93
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,140
as usual?

94
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,600
What did you do with Han Yoo-ra
in the beauty room?

95
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,810
Everyone is talking about it.

96
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,640
I don’t know. She always tries to piss me off.

97
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,890
Who is the man

98
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,390
held your hand and took you out?

99
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,770
The man lives next door.

100
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,380
Your professor?

101
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,170
Yes.

102
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,080
Why did he come for you?

103
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,070
Gave me my wallet back.

104
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,520
He said I’m alike with someone else.

105
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,150
Who?

106
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,410
There is no doubt.

107
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,720
Maybe first love. Maybe deceased mother.

108
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,380
We know the feeling.

109
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,430
He gets close to me on purpose.

110
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,450
What’s wrong?

111
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,180
I had a stomachache since last night.

112
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,300
You didn’t eat anything for the shooting?

113
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,540
-Hello, Ms. Cheon.
-Hello, Ms. Cheon.

114
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,670
I’ve watched the award ceremony for you.

115
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,380
Congratulations.

116
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,990
The evening dress is fabulous.

117
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,570
Where did you buy it?

118
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,780
Miss Yoo, time to the next scene.

119
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,800
Okay.

120
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,450
Hey, do you know Yoo Se-mi?

121
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,260
-Yes.
-Yes.

122
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,500
Then why didn’t you say hello to her?

123
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,600
Where did you learn the bad habit from?

124
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,040
I will watch you.

125
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,400
If you make her awkward again,

126
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,360
I won’t forgive you easily.

127
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,410
You’ve heard about my hot temper, right?

128
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,870
It’s not a rumor but the truth.

129
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,120
Goodness, I forget my lines because of you.

130
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,040
Is she kidding?

131
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,640
She can only realize the problem

132
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,520
while being in the worst situation.

133
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,350
Everyone is looking forward to something bad.

134
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,530
Then Cheon Song-yi is screwed.

135
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,600
If she is really that popular

136
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,880
and great,

137
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,960
how can I trust you and let you take her away?

138
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,320
It seems

139
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,840
I saw the guy somewhere.

140
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,120
Six o’clock.

141
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,450
It’s six o’clock. Let’s call it a day.

142
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,660
I’m leaving now.

143
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,550
Leaving now?

144
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,920
Yes.

145
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,730
Hey, the new guy.

146
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,320
Listen carefully.

147
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,520
I don’t want to…

148
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,060
Please calm down.

149
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,120
I will solve it.

150
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,620
Mr. Lee Hee-kyung.

151
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,950
Are you here to play?

152
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,910
I’ve finished my job, so…

153
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,580
You can never finish your job before seniors.

154
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,240
The new one should be helpful.

155
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,600
How can you use that photo as the background?

156
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,820
She’s my girlfriend.

157
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,220
Shut up!

158
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,460
My wife is Kim Num-ju, will you believe it?

159
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,290
You are decadent.

160
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,990
Workers only put work things on the desk,

161
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,470
or use a family photo as the background

162
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,240
to remind themselves

163
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,640
of working hard.

164
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,430
Do they?

165
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,400
Stop asking questions.

166
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,090
Go change your background

167
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,370
and buy everyone a cup of coffee.

168
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,230
Quickly!

169
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,830
It’s hard to stand in the society.

170
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,700
Yes, sir.

171
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,830
It’s hard to stand in the society.

172
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,390
What’s wrong?

173
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,650
Mr. Yoo.

174
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,500
Did he go for the coffee?

175
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,140
I taught him a lesson.

176
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,630
Why bother? Mr. Yoo.

177
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,420
He used a family photo as the background.

178
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,600
I asked him to do that.

179
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,110
Is this our chairman?

180
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,450
And Director Lee?

181
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,750
What do you think?

182
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,590
Lee Hee-kyung is chairman’s son

183
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,340
and little brother of Director Lee.

184
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,020
Mr. Yoo.

185
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,520
I lost my temper in front of Lee Hee-kyung?

186
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,560
Yes.

187
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,220
Mr. Yoo.

188
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,830
Why did I do that?

189
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,220
Here is your coffee.

190
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,170
I didn’t do it well.

191
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,400
Although I finished my job,

192
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,630
I should wait for you and get off together.

193
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,340
Mr. Yoo already told me all that.

194
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,070
Did I?

195
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:42,960
Yes.

196
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,190
Have you finished your job?

197
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,980
I’ve finished.

198
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,710
Yes, right.

199
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,980
We should finish our job on time.

200
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,480
Then let’s get off together.

201
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,470
Okay.

202
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,440
Thank you for the coffee.

203
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,070
It’s hot.

204
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,090
How is it going? Did you reveal yourself?

205
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,860
Of course not. Nobody knows.

206
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,380
Come in.

207
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,540
Director Hwang.

208
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,210
Hee-kyung, nice to meet you.

209
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,190
How are you?

210
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,830
Fine.

211
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,930
I heard you’re back. Let’s have dinner together.

212
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,970
Sure, but it’s your treat.

213
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,630
I don’t earn much because I just begin to work.

214
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,370
Okay.

215
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,920
And…

216
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,270
Hee-kyung, go back first.

217
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,890
Okay.

218
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,620
Director Hwang, I will visit you.

219
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,930
Okay.

220
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,920
What’s the matter?

221
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,670
I once said it before.

222
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,810
It’s about Im Se-ug.

223
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,300
He joined land procurement of the shopping
center and died of car accident not long ago.

224
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,990
Oh, yes.

225
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,300
It seems we have to conduct an investigation.

226
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,340
During the funeral, the family said

227
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,260
something weird happened before the accident.

228
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,470
It’s said at that time

229
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,980
this is beyond our control.

230
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,470
The police will handle it.

231
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,180
But I feel it’s weird.

232
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,860
It’s said he met someone of our company

233
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,090
on the day before the accident.

234
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,500
We should conduct an investigation in detail.

235
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,980
Fine.

236
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,010
Go ahead.

237
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,720
Okay, I see.

238
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,810
How’s your diabetes?

239
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,960
I measure glucose and take insulin regularly.

240
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,120
It’s stable now.

241
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,840
I like you so much. Please take care.

242
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,440
Okay. Thank you. See you.

243
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,480
My stomach!

244
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,650
What’s wrong with it?

245
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,360
Beom.

246
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,120
Song-yi.

247
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,220
I have a stomachache

248
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,490
in the right side.

249
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,340
I’ve told you it’s because of great pressure.

250
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:27,090
It’s different. Come quickly.

251
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,060
It’s my dad’s death-day. I’m in Chun-cheon.

252
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,710
Call an ambulance!

253
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,420
It will become news in that case.

254
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,550
Call your mom. Or I will call her.

255
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,640
Don’t call her.

256
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,780
I will go by myself.

257
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:58,710
Stomach on the right side. It may be appendix.

258
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,030
It’s none of my business.

259
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,800
My stomach. Remain conscious.

260
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,470
I’m a star.

261
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,950
Star of Asia.

262
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:19,160
National Goddess.

263
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,950
There are so many shoes.

264
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,000
This one.

265
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,990
I should keep fashion even go to hospital.

266
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,980
Excuse me.

267
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,620
Where are you going please?

268
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,210
Me? Seong-min University Hospital.

269
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,140
But it’s two a.m.

270
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,580
I have something to do.

271
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,820
Forget it. That’s great.

272
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,180
I feel extremely terrible,

273
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,330
so would you please take me with you?

274
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,280
Began to feel uncomfortable at nightfall.

275
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,430
Have a fever.

276
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,380
Feel painful on pressing

277
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,240
and worse without pressing.

278
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,240
From all these, I think it’s appendicitis.

279
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,040
[Appendicitis]

280
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,670
What are you doing?

281
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,680
You have one year of experience, right?

282
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,070
Give the records to the doctor
and prepare for surgery.

283
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,690
Okay.

284
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,410
But who are you?

285
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,080
What?

286
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,360
What’s your relationship with the patient?

287
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,130
He’s my manager.

288
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:55,020
Me? God!

289
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:00,640
Why did you ask me to do all that?

290
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,920
There are too many operas recently

291
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,010
related to stories in hospital.

292
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,690
Why am I your manager?

293
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,940
I am a star.

294
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,950
If I came to hospital with a strange man,

295
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,450
there will be rumors.

296
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,570
Pregnant or trying to kill myself.

297
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,590
Very ridiculous.

298
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,550
You still can’t say I’m your manager anyway.

299
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,350
Are you Cheon Song-yi’s manager?

300
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,590
Please apply for admission.

301
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,470
If it’s really appendicitis,

302
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,880
do I have to have the operation?

303
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,930
Of course. You don’t want to?

304
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,610
There will be a scar.

305
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,940
I still want to wear bikini.

306
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,660
Please tell the doctor to pay attention to it.

307
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,260
Why me?

308
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,010
You agreed to be my manager.

309
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,990
When did I agree?

310
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,270
Cheon Song-yi’s manager.

311
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,700
Yes.

312
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,080
Is this the number?

313
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,170
Yes.

314
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,420
There is a person using beeper today.

315
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
Please wait a moment.

316
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,700
Hey, Manager Do.

317
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,760
What’s wrong?

318
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,080
Don’t leave.

319
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,040
You can’t leave. Stay beside me when I wake up.

320
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,350
Don’t go. Wait here.

321
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,990
Time to enter.

322
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,710
Hear me?

323
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,970
Manager Do. Don’t leave.

324
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,510
Guardian?

325
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,160
Yes.

326
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,870
Because of the surgery, the air in the stomach

327
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,870
has to be released.

328
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,480
You can see the green signs in passage.

329
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,680
Help the patient to walk there for several circles

330
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,270
so that she can fart quickly.

331
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,240
I won’t fart.

332
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,460
You can’t leave hospital before farting.

333
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,020
It’s impossible.

334
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,540
-I will inform you after that.
-Okay.

335
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,520
God!

336
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,440
Oh my! The hospital gown is cheesy.

337
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,970
Only slim clothes fit my beauty.

338
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,920
Ask them if they have some in red.

339
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,190
Red ones are better for me.

340
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,120
Are you serious?

341
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,260
Keep walking.

342
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,560
The lady must be extremely beautiful, right?

343
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,380
Who?

344
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,690
The one like me.

345
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,510
You even got confused,

346
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,700
so she must be an epic beauty.

347
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,120
I made a mistake.

348
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,950
You are not alike

349
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,260
in details.

350
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,880
Is she your first love?

351
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,940
No.

352
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,410
I owe her.

353
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,770
In this case, you may owe a lot of people.

354
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,390
Think of it carefully.

355
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,150
You are kind of man easy to be hated.

356
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,190
You should change your manner.

357
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,390
Alright now.

358
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,000
It’s not me.

359
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,840
Nurse.

360
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,800
Hey. It’s not me.

361
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,160
It’s snowing.

362
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,270
The first snow.

363
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,240
It’s the first snow.

364
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,220
You know?

365
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,050
In Joseon,

366
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:19,580
any lies can be forgiven during the first snow.

367
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:26,210
Even lying to the emperor won’t be blamed.

368
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,920
Sir,

369
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,270
I have something to tell you.

370
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,790
Actually, I

371
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,480
love you.

372
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,810
So I want to grow up quickly

373
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:55,590
and then you can see the beautiful grown me.

374
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,570
I’m lying.

375
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,940
Are you scared ?

376
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,660
I’ve said

377
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,520
any lies could be forgiven today,

378
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,820
because it’s the first snow.

379
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,850
How can we have the first snow

380
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:36,530
without chicken and beer?

381
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,290
Beef intestine and liquor sound good.

382
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,930
I want to have seafood pie and dense wine,

383
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,390
noodles with fried sauce, sweet and sour pork.

384
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,400
-Hey you…
-And raw cuttlefish.

385
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,750
It’s really amazing to bite alive little things

386
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,750
with some sesame oil.

387
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,470
Was it an appendix operation or brain surgery?

388
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,790
I can’t remember when I ate things at will.

389
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,370
1,395 calories of noodles with fried sauce,
sweet and sour pork.

390
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,790
900 calories of seafood pie and dense wine.

391
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,970
My favorite chicken and beer

392
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,370
has 1,522 calories.

393
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,650
I can have nothing.

394
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,050
Wait a second.

395
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,140
Since I have my appendix out,

396
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,330
I should have lost some weight.

397
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,570
You’d better stop talking nonsense and go sleep.

398
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,240
Will you leave after I fall asleep?

399
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,540
People now know you are my manager.

400
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,510
They will doubt if you leave.

401
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,480
I mean…

402
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,880
I won’t leave.

403
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,580
What’s your constellation?

404
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,590
Aquarius. Why?

405
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,630
Will you take a boat recently?

406
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,520
Boat?

407
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,910
It’s not suitable for Aquarius to get on a boat.

408
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,650
You’d be careful of water.

409
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,030
Really?

410
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,920
I don’t believe that.

411
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:12,760
Better safe than sorry.

412
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,240
Am I right?

413
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,090
[Patient: Cheon Song-yi
Doctor: Park Jeong-min
Seong-min University Hospital]

414
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,950
No entry for externals.

415
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,600
I’m not an external.

416
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,390
How to explain?

417
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,040
Please keep it a secret.

418
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,210
I am Cheon Song-yi’s boyfriend.

419
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,400
No.

420
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,830
Then I will prove it to you.

421
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,140
The subscriber you dial is power off.

422
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,350
Power off?

423
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,150
I’m really her boyfriend.

424
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,260
There are a dozen people

425
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,320
called themselves a boyfriend this morning.

426
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,240
I’m different from them.

427
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,810
Where is Cheon Song-yi’s manager?

428
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,300
He knows me.

429
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,780
Here he is.

430
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,100
This said he’s Cheon Song-yi’s boyfriend.

431
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,840
Really?

432
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,490
Why are you here?

433
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,390
He isn’t the manager.

434
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,520
Of course he is.

435
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,000
He is the one took Cheon Song-yi to the hospital

436
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,110
and stayed overnight.

437
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,140
What? Overnight?

438
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,110
Overnight?

439
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,640
What should we do?

440
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,840
The patient needs to rest absolutely quietly.

441
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,640
-Nobody is allowed to enter.
-Yes.

442
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,020
Hey. Hey you!

443
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,520
Cheon Song-yi and you are known as friends.

444
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,360
It’s said it started from junior high school.

445
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,070
Yes. We were always together in high school.

446
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,920
We met in everywhere,

447
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,490
so we became friends.

448
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,780
It’s said she had the appendicitis surgery.

449
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,290
Will you go for a visit?

450
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,360
I will see her after this interview.

451
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,140
Next question. When Cheon Song-yi was a student…

452
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,160
-Miss.
-Yes?

453
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,250
-Don’t you have any questions about me?
-I…

454
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,280
Of course we have.

455
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,560
Miss Se-mi, do you have a boyfriend?

456
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:41,640
I’ve carried a torch for him for a dozen years.

457
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:58,310
So many lines. It looks boring.

458
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,950
It’s about Jang Hui-bin’s childhood.

459
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,220
Yours is better.

460
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,960
Not many lines.

461
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,510
Not to fall into the water in such a cold day.

462
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,300
Lee Hee-kyung is coming. Oh my god!

463
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:22,590
He’s really handsome.

464
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,560
Hey, Cheon Song-yi.

465
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,340
You know me, right?

466
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,530
I’m Lee Hee-kyung.

467
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,610
I don’t know you.

468
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,510
You took the chocolate AD,

469
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,360
then became popular and got a play, right?

470
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,410
My dad is the chairman of the company.

471
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,890
So?

472
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,950
I’m not here to show off.

473
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,230
But I’m the one who asked my dad

474
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,690
to invite you to film the AD.

475
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,420
You are here to thank me?

476
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,720
Why should I thank you?

477
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,290
As the model,

478
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,630
I help you sell the chocolate well.

479
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,250
So you are here to show your appreciation?

480
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,220
I’m here…

481
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,220
-I don’t mean that.
-Forget it.

482
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,550
I have no time on you.

483
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,260
-What is she doing?
-Why is she so arrogant?

484
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,260
Hey, Cheon Song-yi.

485
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,130
You can’t be so popular without me.

486
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,550
My dad was unwilling but I persuaded him.

487
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,360
I didn’t ask you to do that.

488
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,690
He’s never really looked at me.

489
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,120
I don’t understand why I was attracted by him.

490
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,700
-No.
-I’ve said many times

491
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,290
that I’m Cheon Song-yi’s boyfriend.

492
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,750
-Yes, I see.
-Yes, right.

493
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,670
Hee-kyung.

494
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,660
Hey.

495
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,860
You could call me since Beom can’t come.

496
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,130
Why did you ask him to come?

497
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,780
He would come to this hospital for something.

498
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,510
But it’s two a.m.

499
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,560
He had something to do.

500
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,750
It must be a trick.

501
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,949
He is a stalker, right?

502
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,800
Think it over.

503
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,449
He lives next door and is your professor.

504
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,340
Seoul is so big.

505
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,659
He must come for you on purpose.

506
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:28,400
Stop making up stories.

507
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,989
It’s me who moved to his next door.

508
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:32,139
It’s me who applied for the class.

509
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,580
How about I move to your next door?

510
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:43,159
Is his house bought or rented?

511
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,090
Se-mi.

512
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,860
Take Hee-kyung home.

513
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,969
Yes, let Song-yi take a rest. Let’s go.

514
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:48,980
Leave yourself.

515
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,469
I will stay and sleep here.

516
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,230
Stop.

517
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,360
It’s dangerous here.

518
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,630
You are the most dangerous one.

519
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,580
Have you called your mom?

520
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,940
Maybe I should wash my hair so as to

521
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,250
keep good in the cameras on the way back.

522
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,300
She may worry you.

523
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,690
Please give me the newspaper.

524
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,540
I will read the horoscope for you.

525
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,450
Horoscope?

526
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,620
Where is it?

527
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,460
I’m Aquarius.

528
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,500
It reads that I should be careful of water

529
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,100
and not to take a boat.

530
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,130
What’s it?

531
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,400
It’s not here.

532
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,060
What did he do?

533
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,520
There is no horoscope here.

534
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,890
I made up story about horoscope

535
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,800
and warned her against water.

536
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,110
Is it useful?

537
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,090
She would never listen to others.

538
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,020
So will you let it be?

539
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,360
I’ve did all that I can.

540
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,760
Getting involved more is improper.

541
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,320
Then why did you call me here?

542
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,290
What?

543
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,890
To be honest,

544
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,120
I also have my life and work.

545
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,600
But you just called me like this.

546
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,130
You said you would never get involved,

547
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,790
then do it.

548
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,050
Why are you mentioning it again?

549
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:14,360
Actually you care very much.

550
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,190
You thought I was hard to deal with.

551
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,600
Now you say I’m calling you at will.

552
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,590
It’s OK since we are friends of 30 years.

553
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,180
Remember,

554
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,610
we look like father and son.

555
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,180
Anyway, I feel at ease in my mind.

556
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,460
What?

557
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,040
You completely forget the respect of seniority.

558
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,810
I’ve seen a lot of changes in this world.

559
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:54,460
Is your beeper ringing?

560
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,540
Should I be the only one
who knows your beeper number?

561
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,530
It’s the first time I meet

562
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,370
your beeper rings.

563
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,760
Call her.

564
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,860
Professor Do Min-joon.

565
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,340
What a surprise!

566
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,220
You really use a beeper?

567
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,480
This is Cheon Song-yi.

568
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,250
How did you get my beeper number?

569
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,970
You left it as the contact of my guardian.

570
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,110
What’s wrong?

571
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,660
Nothing. I’m just asking for the horoscope.

572
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,530
I cannot find it on the newspaper.

573
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,750
It’s there.

574
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,450
You called me for this?

575
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,870
Request?

576
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:42,890
I’ve agreed all your requests I can.

577
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,870
You think I will agree with this request?

578
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,710
What is your plan for tomorrow?

579
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,190
It’s cold.

580
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,510
I want to go for sauna.

581
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,770
-It’s a pity.
-What’s wrong?

582
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,630
I’d invite you to my house

583
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,730
and play table tennis with Tiger.

584
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,850
Jobs came to my house yesterday.

585
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,460
If something wrong with the computer,
let the one who made it repair it.

586
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,550
Jobs is deceased, okay?

587
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,960
No kimchi?

588
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,390
The instant noodles only takes 800,

589
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,200
so I can’t offer you kimchi of 1,000 for free.

590
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,470
You are going too far.

591
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,790
-You are so mean.
-You can just leave.

592
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,990
Thank you.

593
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,930
Welcome.

594
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,420
May I help you?

595
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,510
I’m here to borrow some books.

596
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,810
Okay. Good.

597
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,540
What kind of books?

598
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,830
Deacon for A Single Room.

599
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:14,240
Brilliant Seduction from the Man Next Door.

600
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,790
Staying in the Office with Tactful Superior.

601
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,270
Love Contract with the Potent Man.

602
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,320
Oh my.

603
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,380
Why?

604
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,900
What’s wrong?

605
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,660
Deacon for A Single Room.

606
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,710
Does a single room need a deacon?

607
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,370
Why not to get a two-room with the money?

608
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,240
Of course it’s not a single room.

609
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,930
Please use your imagination.

610
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:57,720
Staying in the office with tactful superior?

611
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,690
Is it worthy of imagining?

612
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,890
Listen.

613
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,120
The books are for my life.

614
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,340
Don’t humiliate them.

615
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,060
You have a higher taste?

616
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,590
Books for my life is

617
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,230
Goo Eun Mong.

618
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,250
What?

619
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,350
Goo Eun Mong.

620
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,290
What?

621
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,300
Isn’t it a book of the Joseon Dynasty?

622
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,520
You are really old-fashioned.

623
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,120
You think old books are old-fashioned?

624
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,330
Goo Eun Mong, a new fantasy book in Joseon.

625
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,880
It’s 400 years earlier than but as good as

626
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,970
Harry Potter.

627
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,260
Kid,

628
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,060
I’ve been curious all the time.

629
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,110
Which year were you born in?

630
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,820
Hey. Naughty boy.

631
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:54,150
Where have you been for all these days?

632
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,650
What’s wrong with her?

633
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,320
The “her” is your elder sister.

634
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,060
All in all, let’s get in quickly.

635
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,210
Wait a moment.

636
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,060
Mr. An.

637
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,760
Here.

638
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,570
Hello.

639
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,770
Madam.

640
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:14,430
Director and workers of Song-yi Special.

641
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,430
Thank you for your hard working.

642
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,350
I’m Song-yi’s mother.

643
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:24,250
This is his younger brother Cheon Yun-jae.

644
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,550
Cheon Song-yi is as beautiful as mother.

645
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,640
Thank you so much.

646
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,940
However,

647
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,990
we don’t use a reflector?

648
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,290
What?

649
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,260
Is this the only thing for lighting?

650
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,050
Oh, yes.

651
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,540
I believe you are clear

652
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,170
about today’s arrangement.

653
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,460
You haven’t met each other for a long time.

654
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,350
You came once hearing of the surgery.

655
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,250
It’s about different concepts of family.

656
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,510
Mr. An.

657
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,320
Good idea.

658
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,890
Let’s begin from the moment I get off the taxi

659
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,210
when I’m crying.

660
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,310
I’m good at acting crying.

661
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,520
Good idea.

662
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,260
Right?

663
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,170
Call a taxi first.

664
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,860
Get me out of the camera before I destroy it.

665
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,370
Okay?

666
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,640
That bast…

667
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,140
You know the senior year syndrome?

668
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,230
I’ve heard of it before.

669
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,630
Even the alien would be afraid of it,

670
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,500
so they give up the invasion of the earth.

671
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,900
Madam,

672
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,620
it’s about concept of family.

673
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,760
Let’s film me at first.

674
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,800
I will try my best to show the uniqueness.

675
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,880
Okay.

676
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,280
To be honest, I’m better than Song-yi in acting.

677
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,130
Cheon Yun-jae.

678
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,080
You are still alive?

679
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,740
So,

680
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,780
why didn’t you pick up my phone.

681
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,880
Mom said you often ran away from home.

682
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,430
Don’t talk.

683
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,020
It’s good to see you are alive.

684
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,540
Hey.

685
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,400
We haven’t met for one year. You just leave?

686
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,960
-Come here. I will give you some money.
-Forget it.

687
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,850
I can support myself by working.

688
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,220
You are not allowed to work.

689
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,190
Why don’t you behave well in studying?

690
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,320
You know?

691
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,920
I ran away from home

692
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,380
because I don’t want to use your money.

693
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,130
Can you

694
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,530
stop talking to me like that?

695
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,070
Can you

696
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,570
stop sending money home?

697
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,070
The family became like this for the money.

698
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,270
If it weren’t for you,

699
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,640
dad wouldn’t become like that.

700
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,040
-Hey, Cheon Yun-jae!
-Song-yi.

701
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,130
My daughter.

702
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,880
What’s wrong with you?

703
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,100
I’m coming.

704
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,820
Oh. My son.

705
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:06,070
He is so sad to heard his sister is  ill.

706
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,390
They love each other so much.

707
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,930
Hey.

708
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,490
Over there.

709
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,090
Song-yi.

710
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:27,250
Please stop!

711
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,380
Get out. Mom!

712
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,410
Everyone, please get out.

713
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:39,960
What a bad girl!

714
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,750
She has such a bad temper.

715
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,780
As beautiful as me, but not the good temper.

716
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,460
You are right.

717
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,440
Mrs. Cheon.

718
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,660
The contract will expire next month.

719
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,910
Will you renew it?

720
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:53,690
You are always the one who signs it.

721
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,470
I’m not sure.

722
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:00,070
Je-guk and Panton called me many times.

723
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,120
Song-yi has worked for you when she was a child.

724
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,800
Maybe she can make some change now.

725
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,510
Why bother?

726
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,770
It’s good to stay.

727
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,960
There is a saying goes

728
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,210
“Friends are old and good.”

729
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,930
Mr. An.

730
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:18,000
For me,

731
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,750
I like the new ones.

732
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,250
Mrs. Cheon,

733
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,160
it’s been a long time. Let’s go shopping.

734
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,180
There are many new things.

735
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,580
It’s said Cheon Song-yi is in this hospital.

736
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,790
Really? What’s wrong?

737
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,880
My daughter.

738
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,810
Dad.

739
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:33,900
Come here.

740
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,440
It’s cold. Why don’t you wait at home?

741
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,760
Did you buy it?

742
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,730
Of course.

743
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,020
Chicken eater.

744
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,500
It’s real.

745
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,510
Snowing day

746
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,740
should have chicken and beer.

747
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,570
You are a little kid.

748
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,870
You can’t drink beer.

749
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:48,990
Only cola.

750
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:50,580
Okay. I see.

751
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:54,590
Drink beer with me when you are grown up.

752
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,530
What’s going on?

753
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:31,460
[Director: Hwang Ui-gyeong]

754
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,830
Hello?

755
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,460
Director.

756
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,620
Can you come to my office?

757
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,940
Yes. I’ll be there soon.

758
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,720
What?

759
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,580
What’s wrong with Director Hwang?

760
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,320
It’s a sudden death of hypoglycemia

761
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,770
because of excessive injection of insulin.

762
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:23,390
What’s wrong?

763
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:25,670
Why did that happened?

764
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,820
He didn’t have diabetes for the first day.

765
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,680
He isn’t the person who will make that mistake.

766
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,030
Call Secretary Zhang for me.

767
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,400
Let’s go to the mourning hall.

768
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,850
Yes.

769
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:46,000
A bit weak and weary-looking

770
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,700
but not looking down.

771
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,800
Yes.

772
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,180
Take a look.

773
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,720
Is it too obvious?

774
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,240
Make it like the feeling of just getting up.

775
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,690
Unruly with sexy beauty.

776
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,830
A bit soft.

777
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,040
I’d re-blow it.

778
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,170
Song-yi, the shoes are missing.

779
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,680
Why?

780
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,320
I wore them to the hospital.

781
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,240
Your stuff were taken away by Professor Do.

782
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,720
Only the shoes are missing.

783
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,210
The shoes

784
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,300
are yours?

785
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,040
I can’t believe he’s that kind of person.

786
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,800
Love is the slave of sexual pleasure.

787
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:47,950
Love is the sweet fantasy getting from sex.

788
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:53,190
You may think if love is forever.

789
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:58,270
I’m sure it’s not.

790
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,430
Expiration date of love is ruled by nature.

791
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:05,050
Human will never go beyond the limit.

792
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,720
Why love is great?

793
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,080
It’s only because

794
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,020
it keeps the species going.

795
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:16,420
So, please don’t exchange

796
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,240
your most precious thing

797
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,140
for the short fantasy.

798
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,380
I’ve told you not to call me frequently.

799
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,060
Let me make it clearer.

800
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,350
Please delete my number.

801
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:47,740
Tell me.

802
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,460
What?

803
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,990
Are you jealous?

804
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,210
Shoes?

805
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,180
I have no idea.

806
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,840
My shoes are missing, but other things are there.

807
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:02,020
Helping you once means nothing.

808
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,400
I really don’t know.

809
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,190
Will you insist?

810
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:10,160
Actually, I appreciate your help.

811
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,410
But how can you steal my shoes?

812
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,930
I thought you were a good person.

813
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,880
But you cheat me.

814
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,930
I don’t understand.

815
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,780
The shoes for women are useless for you

816
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,140
I didn’t take it.

817
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,620
It’s said Hee-kyung is still chasing Song-yi.

818
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:43,270
Can you stop him?

819
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:44,090
Why?

820
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:46,030
What?

821
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:50,320
If I marry you and Song-yi marry him,

822
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,730
we two become sisters-in-law.

823
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,800
But I hate her.

824
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,240
Will I marry you?

825
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,470
Won’t you?

826
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,760
We’ve dated for one year.

827
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,210
People don’t know because we dated secretly.

828
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:12,320
It seems Dispatch doesn’t work hard recently.

829
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,870
They even give up such big news.

830
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:24,350
So you want everyone to know?

831
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:28,100
So you don’t want to get married?

832
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,500
Then break up.

833
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,780
Marry me if you don’t want to break up.

834
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:48,030
Is it for the sake of your ex-wife?

835
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:51,150
I’m different from her.

836
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,830
You know it.

837
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,670
And

838
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:04,920
I will never tell others about what I know.

839
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,220
I received Lo Soo-yeong’s wedding invitation.

840
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,230
Is the second son of L Group your friend?

841
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,520
Yes.

842
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,920
So you received the invitation, too?

843
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,070
Let’s go together.

844
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,320
Okay.

845
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,970
Go together.

846
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,950
You are suffered a lot from the surgery.

847
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:36,150
You are thinner and more beautiful.

848
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:38,120
Really?

849
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,880
I always become more beautiful during a wedding

850
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,340
and was scolded as a contrast.

851
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,540
Really?

852
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,210
Do I need to make you not that beautiful?

Going the wedding like this

854

I will be a contrast to the bride.

855

Why does Lo Soo-yeong

856
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:04,200
hold the wedding on the cruise?

857

859

Some people get in secretly

even in special hotel.

Yes.

There is no way.

867
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:34,000
The proper ones are missing.

868
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,600
Give me the phone.

869
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,770
Okay.

00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:40,890

I bought a new pair of the shoes

875
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,860
at a large sum of money.

876

I owed you last time.

So I will let it go.

I will apologize to you when there is a chance.

879
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:06,870
But I don’t know why you took away the shoes.

880
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,460
Over.

881

You.

882
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,440
I told you not to appear in front of me.

883
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,300
I told you I don’t.

884
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,850
What’s more, we will meet at the wedding.

885
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:27,170
Kindly remind you not to come tonight.

What’s wrong?

887
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:32,720
You dressed up but only my photos in the news?

888
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,490
You’ve made great efforts.

889
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,980
So you should be confident.

890
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:38,560
Hey.

891
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,060
By the way,

892
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:43,750
I received the scripts from Director Ma.

893
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:48,030
It’s said you wanted to get it so much.

894
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:52,910
But I don’t want to miss it,
so I accepted it at a lower price.

895
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:57,280
It seems I have to enter Cannes to avoid you.

I will apologize to you when there is a chance.

Why don’t I trust love?

00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,710
Absolutely trust.

In the past,

many people trusted love above the station.

921

They risked their lives and eloped,

922

but it ended within three years

923
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:50,250
because the man with lower grade played women.

and kneel down.

The woman asks for kneeling down and singing

928
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:04,780
for proposal is childish.
