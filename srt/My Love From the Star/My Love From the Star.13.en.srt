00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,350
When I first got here,

3
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,660
I wanted to help others with my ability.

4
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:54,130
So I had to reveal that I was different.

5
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,140
Anyone out there?

6
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,840
Help me!

7
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,410
Help me! Help me!

8
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,280
My leg!

9
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,930
It's him!

10
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,110
He used magic to lift up a boulder with his eyes.

11
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,039
I bet he's responsible for all the

12
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,110
bad things happening in the village.

13
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:46,750
Get him!

14
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,450
It’s a monster.

15
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,450
Find him.

16
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,789
People were only thankful for a second.

17
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:56,090
Because my abilities

18
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,100
differentiate me and other people.

19
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,170
People fear me.

20
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,700
No matter how close I was with others,

21
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,840
it was the same.

22
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,580
Tell me. We've been friends for ten years now.

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,750
What is that you can't say to me?

24
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,220
Where are you going?

25
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,550
Do you trust me?

26
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,020
Of course, I do, more than I trust myself.

27
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,290
I meant about my appearance,

28
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,930
about how I look today compared with 10 years ago.

29
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,000
I always told you,

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,570
you look exactly the same from the day we met.

31
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,970
Aren't you curious why?

32
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,780
Well, you may be not easy to age.

33
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,220
No. Don't be surprised.

34
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,520
I am...

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,890
Not from this planet.

36
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,420
What?

37
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,730
I am another species from another planet.

38
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,770
Are you teasing me?

39
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,800
No, it's the truth.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,070
Can you prove it to me then?

41
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,570
Prove it and I will trust your words.

42
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,780
If not, I will consider it as a joke and…

43
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,180
Are you hurt?

44
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,020
Spare me!

45
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,120
Please!

46
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,590
I would never hurt you.

47
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:36,160
Spare me, please.

48
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,100
I've learned from my experience.

49
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,300
I have to hide my identity for not to lose.

50
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,280
But today, I told Cheon Song-yi

51
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,880
my identity in order to push her away.

52
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:59,550
I wanted her to leave me and fear me.

53
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,590
Who saved your life 12 years ago?

54
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,230
Didn't you want to know?

55
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,770
The man who saved you back then

56
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,640
is me.

57
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,510
There were no other reasons for saving you.

58
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,950
At that time, you looked like
the girl from 400 years ago,

59
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,450
the owner of the hairpin

60
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,150
a lot.

61
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,560
I was even confused.

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,800
What are you talking about?

63
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,370
The owner of the hairpin from 400 years ago?

64
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,840
How do you know her face?

65
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,310
Did you live 400 years or what?

66
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,010
Yes.

67
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,620
I came here from an outside world 400 years ago.

68
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,960
I could not return to my planet.

69
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,490
I had to live here for 400 years.

70
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,000
Do Min-joon. Let's go home.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,930
You're not well yet.

72
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,150
You said that you didn't care

73
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,020
who I was.

74
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,970
This is who I am.

75
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,810
Do you still think it’s okay?

76
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,010
What happened just now?

77
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
How did you do that?

78
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,780
Do you still not understand?!

79
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,750
If I set my mind to it,

80
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,320
I can hurt you right now.

81
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,420
So…

82
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,790
Leave while you have the chance.

83
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,760
Go.

84
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,820
I'll hold on for just a moment.

85
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,720
My legs are shaking.

86
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,100
Let's just say that you're right.

87
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:06,000
You can hurt me if you want to.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,840
But why would you do it?

89
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,410
Why did you save me so many times?

90
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,820
Why did you do everything I wanted you to do?

91
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,350
Why did you listen to everything I said?

92
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,150
Why did you protect me?

93
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,090
Why?

94
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,900
I told you.

95
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,300
It's because you look like that girl.

96
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,230
I don’t know the connection of you two.

97
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:41,740
But that doesn't seem to be the case.

98
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,110
If you are just Cheon Song-yi,

99

He's the one who needs to go to the hospital.

He should've at least fed me first,

00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,140
if he wants to say these nonsense.

115

Honestly?

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,600

You’re an alien?

If you are, then I’m a vampire.

Who do you think it is?

129
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,400
The person who knows the truth?

130
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,510
Cheon Song-yi!

131
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,340
She's the only one.

132
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,880
It must be Cheon Song-yi.

133

This always happens when I don't
deal with things right away.

But...

The reason Cheon Song-yi

136
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,030
knows is your fault.

137
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,100
You wanted to reveal our
relationship to your rival.

138
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,030
You gave her all the hints.

139
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,540
That's how she found out about us.

140
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,370
You're still blaming me?

141
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,410
There's no point in glaring.

142
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,810
You can't do anything to me.

143

Why do you think I killed you?

144
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,220
You've done too much already.

145
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,490
You think you can cover up everything?

146
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,860
I met an interesting fellow.

147
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,730
I've never seen anyone like him.

148
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,130
He has weird abilities.

149

I don't know who he is.

150

That's why it's even more interesting.

151

Yes.

159

You lost

160

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,330
A photo from 1910.

173
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,470
It's when we opened our university.

174
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,500
Would he be among these people?

175
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,910
Are you talking about the anonymous donor?

176
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,280
He provided us with the enormous funds,

177
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,850
and research funds at every hard time.

178
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,050
If it weren't for him, our museum can’t be built.

179
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,290
Then how about displaying this photo

180
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,120
at our school's 100 year anniversary exhibit?

181
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,230
Let's try to do that.

182
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,000
Why did you go that far?

183
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,170
I guess Cheon Song-yi must be frightened.

184
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,410
Yes..

185
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,670
Did she run away?

186
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,680
No. I did it to make her run away.

187
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,650
But why go that far?

188
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,050
You just have to move

189
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,820
and never call her. Why bother?

190
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,390
Can't you erase her memory?

191
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,660
Huh? Erase what memory?

192
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,260
Like in movies.

193
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,260
Aliens using a device to

194
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,370
erase people's memories.

195
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,600
You can't do that?

196
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,000
It's a movie.

197
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,540
You can stop time. You have telekinesis.

198
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,880
You can do pretty much everything.
Why can't you do that?

199
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,910
You really can't?

200
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,810
I can't.

201
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,680
It’s nice when they erased memories.

202
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,120
I said I can't.

203
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,360
Yeah, we don't even know when
your abilities will disappear.

204
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,130
It comes and goes.

205
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,560
Your superpower is like a roll of the dice now.

206
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,030
I'm concerned.

207
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,180
What can I do from now on?

208
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,150
I have to leave soon.

209
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,590
I can't take her with me or stay here.

210
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,260
The only thing I can do is

211
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,560
to disappear.

212
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,930
There is nothing I can do here.

213
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,600
I can't eat with her, go for a walk...

214
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,840
Celebrate together,

215
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,910
or anything else.

216
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,180
I want her to

217
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,280
eat nice food, go for a walk,

218
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,950
celebrate the good days... and live a good life.

219
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:50,320
even if I’m not here.

220
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,420
I want to do everything I can.

221
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,090
But what can you do?

222
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,730
I will do

223
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,170
what you want.

224
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,010
You want me to take all the blame

225
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,410
and disappear, right?

226
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,710
I will do it.

227
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,410
So…

228
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,720
Will you stop here then?

229
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,220
What is it? Huh?

230
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,800
You love roasted sweet potatoes, right?

231
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,110
Nothing will go down.

232
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,210
It’s even hard for me to drink water.

233
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,310
It is a big problem.

234
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,850
This is the initial stage of love sickness.

235
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,420
What on earth did he say?

236
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,790
He said…

237
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,020
Yeah.

238
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,290
He is…

239
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,590
What?

240
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,160
You can't tell anyone, okay?

241
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,940
Tell me.

242
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,570
He said he is an alien.

243
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,950
You're not shocked or laughing?

244
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,250
It’s a special excuse.

245
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,820
Excuse?

246
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,460
When I first confessed my love to a man...

247
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,990
He said...

248
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,830
I'm joining the army.

249
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,830
He got caught a month later at a night club.

250
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,570
The second man said...

251
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,540
I'm moving out of the country.

252
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,410
I ran into him at the fish market
in Soraepogu a year later.

253
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,650
You know what the funniest answer was?

254
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,050
What?

255
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,430
I'm possessed by a deity!

256
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,930
I need to accept it.

257
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,100
Then he rolled his eyes and foamed at his mouth.

258
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,070
I thought he was becoming a shaman.

259
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,070
Then he got married soon... at a church.

260
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,810
A pastor officiated and

261
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,440
a choir sang for him.

262
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,150
Then it was a lie?

263
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,780
Yeah. Just to get rid of me.

264
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,020
But he went way over the line! Alien?

265
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,890
But there were so many suspicious.

266
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,330
When he was saying that, a glass box exploded.

267
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,290
Is he Uri Geller or something?

268
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:42,860
Huh?

269
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,570
You know the TV magician back in the day.

270
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,270
He said that he came across an UFO
and obtained superpower.

271
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,140
He bent spoons with his eyes.

272
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,870
Bullshit. I don't buy that stuff.

273
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,380
But you're more undignified than I expected.

274
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,680
You must have been pretty desperate
for the guy to lie to you like that.

275
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,150
He's an alien?

276
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,450
He's either lying

277
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,320
or mentally ill.

278
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,130
I can't just sit here.

279
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,190
Why not?

280
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,330
I need to go check.

281
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,620
If I call you here and you come out,

282
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,750
then I'll believe you.

283
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:46,630
Do Min-joon! Help me!

284
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,330
Please help me!

285
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,330
What's wrong with her?

286
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,030
I don't know.

287
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,200
She must be crazy.

288
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,640
Let's go.

289
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,710
Do Min-joon! I'm at Mt. Bukhan.

290
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,580
I'm in danger now!

291
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,080
I am serious!

292
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,380
Please save me!

293
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,550
Save me!

294
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,790
I knew it would be like this.

295
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,830
What? Alien?

296
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,060
Superman, my ass.

297
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,170
Kang Da-jung.

298
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,270
Here.

299
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,940
Kang Yi-jin.

300
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,070
Here.

301
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,740
Go Yong-min.

302
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,940
Here.

303
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,750
Kwon Hyeok-jin.

304
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,590
Here.

305
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,450
Kwon Hyun-joo.

306
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,220
Here.

307
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,020
Kim Min-kyung.

308
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,290
Here.

309
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,330
Class’s over.

310
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,810
What?

311
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,180
Try leaving.

312
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,150
What?

313
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,420
I said try leaving.

314
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,020
If you're an alien,
can't you leave even I'm blocking your path?

315
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,220
Teleport.

316
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,290
Can't you do such a thing?

317
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,520
Get out of the way.

318
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,430
You aren't, right? You aren't an alien, right?

319
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,560
I know you aren't!

320
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,260
[Seventh museum]

321
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
What are you doing?

322
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,630
People are looking at us.

323
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,000
Fly.

324
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,270
What?

325
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,040
I told you to try flying.

326
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,170
You can't fly?

327
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,970
Do you need a costume to fly, like a fairy?

328
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,540
Don't kid around.

329
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,940
I look like I'm kidding around, right?

330
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,550
It looks like I'm joking around you
when I do this, right?

331
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,650
My mood was exactly like that.

332
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,520
You aren't...

333
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,850
You aren't that, right?

334
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,290
You aren't.

335
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,290
I dare you to leave!

336
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,990
If you leave me again and go,

337
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,390
I will scream and say that you

338
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,130
are an alien.

339
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,600
You see people looking at me, right?

340
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,970
If I scream,

341
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,380
it will spread far and wide via SNS in one hour.

342
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,210
A college professor is an alien.

343
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,410
Cheon Song-yi!

344
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,420
What? You believe me?

345
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,620
You told me not to trust anyone.

346
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,790
You were the one who warned me
not to trust anyone.

347
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,550
Why did you trust me?

348
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,090
If you leave me here,

349
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,860
I won't just scream.

350
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,360
I'm going to report to the police,

351
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,900
and write a letter to the Blue House.

352
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,970
And call NASA or whatever.

353
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,570
I'm going to do everything!

354
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,040
Just try me.

355
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,740
You underestimated me.

356
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,980
When I say I can do it, I do it.

357
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,180
What do you want?

358
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,250
Eat with me.

359
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,860
Where are we going?

360
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,200
To eat.

361
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,900
I decide where and what to eat.

362
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,470
Why taking the highway?

363
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,280
Can you part the sea?

364
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,680
Stop it.

365
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,290
You ate corvina and

366
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,050
kimchi pretty well.

367
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,520
Can aliens eat them?

368
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,890
You don't recharge yourself with
electricity or tree sap?

369
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:44,830
Hey!

370
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,330
Do you shed skin?

371
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,000
Aliens have reptiles in them

372
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,370
and have blue blood.

373
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,970
I don't shed. I’m not a reptile,
and I have red blood.

374
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,910
Furthermore, my people are far more beautiful
than your people.

375
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,180
If they come to my star,
they will be far below the average.

376
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,410
But they make movies like
Alien and Planet of the Apes,

377
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,310
setting up prejudices against aliens.

378
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,320
I was furious when watching those movies.

379
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,190
Do you want to have a drink?

380
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,260
You brought your car with you.

381
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,090
We can just wait.

382
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,500
Don't get cute with me.

383
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,340
Let me just ask you one thing.

384
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,450
Before, you asked me who I was.

385
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,450
Are you asking me who I am right now?

386
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,520
Don't you know me? I am Cheon Song-yi.

387
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,990
Yeah. You are Cheon Song-yi.

388
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,030
You can’t be her.

389
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,100
Who is that girl?

390
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,300
Does she look a lot like me?

391
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,610
Is she the owner of the hairpin?

392
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,840
Yeah.

393
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,920
She must have her hair up in a chignon, right?

394
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,150
Did you like a married woman?

395
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,260
I didn't see you as that kind of person.

396
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,260
You're curious about those things?

397
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,660
That's not the point.

398
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,030
Is she pretty?

399
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,830
She should be pretty if she looks like me.

400
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,600
But…

401
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,980
Is that all?

402
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:50,890
The girl you liked looked very much like me.

403
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,860
Is that all?

404
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,730
Yeah.

405
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,230
It started from a misunderstanding.

406
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,000
You look like her so much, so I was attracted

407
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,300
and I wanted to confirm it.

408
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,810
I happened to stay by you.

409
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,440
But at some moment,

410
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,450
I thought you weren't her.

411
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,620
If I like you even just a bit,

412
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,520
when I realized that you weren't her,

413
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,190
I should feel disappointed,

414
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,560
but there was nothing.

415
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,360
There was... nothing?

416
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,670
Yeah.

417
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,540
You never liked me even for a moment?

418
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,410
♫ By chance you come close to me ♫

419
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,350
♫ and hold me in arms ♫

420
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:02,590
♫ We look at each other with no words ♫

422

♫ I long for that in the dream ♫

424
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,880
♫ only to find it comes truth ♫

425

Can't you get a phone?

♫ Love comes ♫

427
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,680

♫ Oh, hard to meet again ♫

432
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,390

♫ Hello Hello ♫

438
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,580
instead of someone like her?

439
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,780
Just purely liked me?

440
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,090
♫ When we meet again, I’ll say ♫

441
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,020

You never pictured your future with me?

♫ I’m waiting ♫

447
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,470

♫ I'm a fool for love ♫

♫ Goodbye Goodbye ♫

452
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,960
Do you have to hear the answer?

453
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,560
Yeah.

454
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,260
Give me a clear answer.

455
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,600
No.

456
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Never.

457
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,740
But

458
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,100
is that more important to you?

459
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,940
Is it more important than that I'm an alien

460
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,370
and that I’ve lived longer than 400 years?

461
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,240
I liked you or not?

462
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,640
You only cared about this?

463
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,750
Yeah.

464
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,380
To me

465
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,920
that's much more... important.

466
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,920
To me it's more important than where you're from,

467
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,290
whether you're an alien, vampire, a monster,

468
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,360
or whatever your past life was like

469
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,930
What the man I like,

470
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,130
I mean,

471
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,060
once liked,

472
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,970
thought about me

473
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,470
is the most important to me.

474
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:29,980
If you like me with your heart even for a second

475
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,040
or if you were

476
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,080
interested in me because

477
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,580
of a girl you couldn't get over

478
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,320
is much more important to me.

479
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,450
Isn't that obvious?

480
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,590
You're the man I liked.

481
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,360
Whether you saved me 12 years ago...

482
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,820
Whether you were that man or not...

483
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,990
Didn't matter to me.

484
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,630
I just liked you, Do Min-joon,
the man who lives next door.

485
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,570
I like you with my heart.

486
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,810
I liked you.

487
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,240
For real.

488
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,280
But

489
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,120
If I were just a replacement for someone,

490
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,160
that’s the worst.

491
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
If I still like you

492
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,290
after knowing all that,

493
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,960
then I'm even worse.

494
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,670
I will give up on you.

495
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,140
Good choice.

496
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,820
I'm sorry for bothering you.

497
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,520
This won’t happen again.

498
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,830
You can relieve now.

499
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,900
Although that won't happen again,

500
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,100
if my heart suddenly happen to race,

501
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,300
and I call you or go find you,

502
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,270
do what you originally did and cut me off.

503
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,910
Also, if we happen to meet each other somewhere,

504
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,610
let's pretend to not know each other.

505
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,480
There's no reason for that now.

506
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,550
According to American psychologist
Kubler-Ross' research,

507
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,650
a person who loses a beloved one,

508
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,090
until he faces up to the reality,

509
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,360
he will go through 5 stages of emotion.

510
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,820
The first one

511
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,230
is rage.

512
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,030
Ah. My chest!

513
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,930
I'm so pissed off!

514
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,400
Here's nothing? Nothing?

515
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,130
Nothing left, huh?!

516
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,640
Never? Never? You've never liked me?!

517
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,940
Not for a moment?

518
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,570
You jerk.

519
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,340
How could you do this to me?

520
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:52,940
The second one

521
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,480
is denial of reality.

522
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,680
Does that make sense?

523
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,850
Alien?

524
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,120
Are you kidding me?

525
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,190
Is that a joke?

526
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,160
Are you making a movie?

527
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,360
Is this a hidden camera show?

528
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,960
Is it you?

529
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,300
Are you behind?

530
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,770
I know everything!

531
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,400
I know!

532
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,370
Third stage.

533
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,570
Compromise.

534
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,179
Okay.

535
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,580
He’s not even my type.

536
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,120
He’s a geek and has no sense of humor.

537
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,449
He’s so old-fashioned.

538
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,350
Yeah.

539
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,590
He might be an alien.

540
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,659
He’s totally a fool.

541
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,389
The worst I've ever seen.

542
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:44,030
Fourth stage is the longest, depression.

543
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,929
Why are you crying?

544
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,000
Am I?

545
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,880
I'm not crying.

546
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,780
It's just shedding tears.

547
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,920
It's not crying.

548
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,060
What's the difference of tearing and crying?

549
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,000
She's lost it.

550
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Last stage, acceptance.

551
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,170
Fine!

552
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,570
I will get even prettier!

553
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,410
Although I'm the most beautiful one now.

554
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,210
But I will do the impossible

555
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,780
I will make you regret this!

556
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,050
Going through the agony of loss,

557
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,720
a human can then recover.

558
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,390
It's called the five stages of grief.

559
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,390
This is where

560
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,760
men and women differ.

561
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,030
Women either try to make themselves

562
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,470
better or try to meet better men.

563
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,740
They focus on self-development.

564
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,140
Men...

565
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,110
Eat.

566
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,780
I can't eat.

567
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:12,120
They show self-destructive reactions.

568
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,020
Or they grieve over loss

569
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,990
more than women.

570
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,630
The condo is going to be sold.

571
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,660
Really?

572
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,630
Good.

573
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,470
I was worried that it wasn't going to get sold

574
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,040
because of the bad rumors about it.

575
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,270
But someone wants to buy it for higher price.

576
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,410
Yeah?

577
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,780
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

578
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,480
I don’t know his career, and why he’s so rich.

579
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,050
He has sent me the money without looking at it.

580
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,220
He says that he's nearby

581
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,620
and he will stop by.

582
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,790
I told him that you will open the door
when he gets there.

583
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:57,330
He must be there already.

584
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,800
Mr. Jang?

585
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,140
I'm not signing this contract.

586
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,540
What?

587
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,610
You can’t.

588
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,580
He’s already given us the money.

589
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,450
I can reimburse by two-fold.

590
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,550
Pay him back.

591
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,420
Why aren't you signing?

592
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,620
I'm paying more than the market price.

593
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,190
I can double it

594
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,860
if you want more.

595
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,590
You said that it's for sale.

596
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,830
I will buy it.

597
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,060
I’m not selling it to you.

598
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,230
Why?

599
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,030
You said you are moving.

600
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,200
Leave while you can.

601
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,600
I don't care who you sell this place to.

602
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,110
I'm going to move here!

603
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,300
Next door is for sale. I'm going to buy it.

604
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,260
Go ahead if you can.

605
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,870
It will be better if you are my neighbor.

606
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,330
I will see you more often.

607
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,440
A saying is “dust in my heart”.

608
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,680
It means dust laying on top of my heart

609
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,550
because I miss you so much.

610
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,350
There's no time for a single dust mote

611
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,460
on my heart, so much for a layer.

612
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,690
Is moving on like moving your room?

613
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,930
Is it like moving your desk?

614
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,160
So fast?

615
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,700
Am I angry?

616
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,100
Not at all.

617
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,040
I'm relieved.

618
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,740
The fact that she sorted through her feelings

619
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,410
so fast and so calmly

620
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,010
makes me relieved.

621
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,280
I said I'm not mad!

622
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,550
By the way,

623
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,880
I was offered a role in a movie yesterday.

624
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,820
-Really?
-Yeah.

625
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,850
It's not a main character,

626
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,820
but an important supporting role.

627
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,620
Apparently, it's a really fascinating character.

628
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,430
What’s it like?

629
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,760
She has a horrible personality.

630
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,290
-Suits you.
-Yeah?

631
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,200
There's no need for me to try acting.

632
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,270
To be honest, aren't all main roles the same?

633
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,670
They're bright, nice and upright.

634
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:21,010
I've always wanted to try out a
supporting role with a strong personality.

635
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,670
It’s good.

636
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,140
Cheon Song-yi, you're great!

637
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,740
Of course!

638
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,780
No matter if it's a supporting role
or a main character,

639
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,180
I'm Cheon Song-yi!

640
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,680
No matter who is the main actor,
I'll finish them off.

641
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,550
Great.

642
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,490
By the way, Hee-kyung,

643
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,660
a police officer came to me.

644
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,330
Why?

645
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,130
He asked me if Han Yoo-ra was seeing anyone.

646
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:53,410
And if Do Min-joon and Han Yoo-ra were dating.

647
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,240
But that's not true.

648
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,380
Actually,

649
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,080
I know.

650
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,880
Know what?

651
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,650
The man who’s dating Yoo-ra

652
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,150
is Jae-kyung.

653
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,920
-Really?
-Yeah.

654
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,830
So, I told the police that.

655
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,660
I thought it was a personal matter,
so, I wasn't going to say it.

656
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,370
But it seemed to be related to the investigation.

657
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:27,340
-And...
-You didn't want Do Min-joon to be suspected?

658
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:34,410
You think Jae-kyung will be upset?

659
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,920
So, this only shows this part?

660
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,820
-Not over there?
-Yes.

661
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,760
[The CCTV is on.]

662
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,890
What's the range for that camera?

663
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,360
From that sign to the intersection.

664
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,860
Is it on for 24 hours?

665
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,400
Yes.

666
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,060
It seems that you need to be faster.

667
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,130
I’ll give you three days.

668
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,970
There’s nothing.

669
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,210
If Cheon Song-yi is right,

670
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,710
Lee Jae-kyung was dating Han Yoo-ra.

671
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,210
One of the cameras must have caught.

672
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,710
We've been watching for days!

673
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,080
Lee Jae-kyung's work place. Han Yoo-ra's place.

674
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,980
Roads nearby.

675
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,990
We even checked the parking lots.

676
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,660
There's no picture of them together.

677
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,590

Hey! I will show them properly this time.

849
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,900
Ha! Ha!

850
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,170
Swish, swish.

851
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,440
Check on the equipment!

852
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,680
Yeah!

853
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,210
This wire,

854
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:18,180
if this isn't placed properly,

855
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,280
it’ll break right away.

856
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,790
So, you should be careful.

857
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:21,890
It's not like it's my first time doing this.

858
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,760
Please check the crane pulley again.

859
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,120
Okay, okay.

860
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,390
Hey, part-timer.

861
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,030
The pulley can't get loosened up, alright?

862
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:32,160
If it gets loosened up, it might look like
it works well the first few times,

863
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,000
but after a couple of times,

864
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,270
the screw will get loose.

865
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:36,070
Okay?

866
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:36,540
Okay.

867
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,840
Hurry up then.

868
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,690
You're here.

869
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,990
Did you find out anything?

870
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,060
No.

871
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,330
There was nothing.

872
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,600
Nothing?

873
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,110
Hello?

874
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:35,230
I'm sorry about it what happened last time.

875
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,530
Are you doing better now?

876
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,660
Yes.

877
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,300
I was curious.

878
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,370
Why did you ask to see me last time?

879
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:53,210
There's something I want to tell you.

880
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,850
Are you sure that Han Seo-jin died 3 years ago?

881
00:53:58,850 --> 00:53:59,720
Yes.

882
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,990
He said that he was leaving for vacation.

883
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,520
Then he went missing.

884
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,290
Later on, he has been reported dead.

885
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:11,400
Do you know Do Min-joon,
maybe Han Seo-jin’s friend?

886
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,000
Have you seen or heard about him?

887
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,840
Seo-jin had no friends.

888
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,770
He hasn't even had a single meal with us.

889
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:23,040
I haven't seen anyone who came to see him.

890
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,840
Then perhaps. . .

891
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,050
Have you ever seen this person?

892
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,720
Are you sure you have it right?

893
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,550
Huh?

894
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:37,160
This person is Han Seo-jin!

895
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,720
This is Han Seo-jin

896
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,360
with a different hairdo.

897
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,660
I'm pretty sure.

898
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:47,730
Please say it.

899
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,670
What you want to say?

900
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:13,330
What the heck?

901
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:16,160
There's no one who even says hello.

902
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,660
What the heck?

903
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,630
We just come directly to the filming site?

904
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:25,300
This is the sorrow of supporting roles.

905
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,770
So let's sign with the S&C…

906
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:30,610
Stop mentioning that.

907
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:33,880
Se-mi, you're here.

908
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,310
-Hi, director.
-Hello.

909
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:35,910
Hello.

910
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,250
Your skin looks good.

911
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,320
What’s it?

912
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,250
Se-mi is the lead?

913
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,350
Although the acting is a bit difficult today,

914
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,460
but it’s not yours.

915
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,760
Cheon Song-yi, you're here.

916
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:50,360
It's been a long time, director.

917
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,830
We're finally working together.

918
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:53,570
Nice to see you.

919
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:57,570
I was hesitating because of your situation now.

920
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:00,470
But Yoon Se-mi highly recommended you.

921
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,310
Did you?

922
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:10,150
Yeah. You always did it for me.

923
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,790
We have a wired-scene to start.

924
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:18,660
You do some actions, right?

925
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,260
I do, a bit.

926
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,660
First, we need to coordinate,
so let's talk with the martial arts director.

927
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,970
Are we done?

928
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:28,230
Yes.

929
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,300
Fighting, Song-yi.

930
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,170
The leading role shines more
with a supporting role by side.

931
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,080
Let’s go.

932
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,150
Did you hear that?

933
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,920
You heard her?

934
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,090
It's what you always said to Se-mi's mom.

935
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:50,060
You just received back as much as you gave.

936
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:56,290
Hey! Whose side are you on?

937
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,300
[Prosecution Service]

938
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,700
Are you out of your mind?

939
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,070
Why? Why do that?

940
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:06,870
If not, I would have to kill Lee Jae-kyung.

941
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,810
I need to kill him or stop him.

942
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:11,940
It's one of the two.

943
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,250
If not, Cheon Song-yi could die.

944
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:20,520
Cheon Song-yi told the detective about
Lee Jae-kyung and Han Yoo-ra.

945
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,290
There's no time.

946
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,490
But…

947
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,760
What are you saying?

948
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,070
Really?

949
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,900
That's kind of him.

950
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:37,940
Keeping his promise well.

951
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,140
What about Cheon Song-yi?

952
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:45,340
Hey! It's not at the center!

953
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,780
Are you sure you can do this without a stuntman?

954
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,750
You said to do it.

955
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,580
I said I would be thankful if you did it.

956
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,920
Because that looks real.

957
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,600
I have to,

958
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,760
if I want to steal the show.

959
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,010
Everything will be recorded from now on.

960
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:17,210
Do you agree to it?

961
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,050
Yes, I agree.

962
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,980
Let's start.

963
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,290
Do Min-joon!

964
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:10,060
I'm at Mt. Bukhan.

965
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,830
I'm in danger now!

966
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:15,400
I am serious!

967
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,670
Please save me!

968
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,670
Save me!

969
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:25,940
I knew it would be like this.

970
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,680
What? Alien?

971
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,510
Superman, my ass.

972
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,390
She must be crazy.

973
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:39,090
How dare she calls me like that.

974
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:40,590
It scared me to death, geez.
