1
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,840
A renowned American psychologist, Harry Harlow, 
conducted a series of experiments.

2
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,420
He separated a red-haired newborn monkey, whose DNA 
is a 95% match to that of humans, from its mother.

3
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,030
It was locked away in a room with two monkey dolls.

4
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,360
One doll

5
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,680
was made of metal wire mesh 
with milk bottles attached to it,

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,730
and the other was wrapped in soft fabric.

7
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,530
No milk bottle was attached to the 2nd doll.

8
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,790
Of the two, which doll would you think 
the baby monkey preferred?

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,510
The one with a milk bottle attached.

10
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,280
The pre-experiment hypothesis  also said

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,620
the baby monkey would prefer the doll with a bottle.

12
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,600
Contrary to the hypothesis,

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,490
the baby monkey showed a strong attachment to the soft fabric doll.

14
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,770
The proven point of this exercise was the importance
of skinship. (Physical affection)

15
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,260
 Just give me 15 seconds.

16
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,120
 What 15 seconds?

17
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,130
 If, after 15 seconds, I'm still a ceramic piece,
 a puppy, or a tree, then

18
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,930
 I'll acknowledge that

19
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,790
 I'm not attractive.

20
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,050
 And~ Start!

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,590
Meeting the eyes could be considered 
an indirect skinship.

22
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,900
When humans meet the eyes of the one they love,

23
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,380
their brains produce dopamine and 
heightens the sense of joy.

24
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,350

25
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,090
When you kiss, the heart rate doubles that of
 being in a resting state,

26
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,510
and the mean breath rate increases 
 also, by 20 fold,

27
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,390
and the blood pressure momentarily 
shoots up as well.

28
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,610
As a result, the heart flutters and 
the breathing becomes labored,

29
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,300
and the person can even experience dizziness, which

30
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,020
makes it easy to be mistaken as him/her being in love.

31
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,420
However, all of these are mere playful games of skinship,

32
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,910
and a hormone's hoax.

33
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,070
You must not be deceived by this.

34
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,160
 One hour after the kiss.

35
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,770
♫  You drew near me by chance  ♫

36
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,580
♫  always hugged me  ♫

37
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,420
♫  gaze upon each other vacantly  ♫

38
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,770
I wasn't the one who initiated it.

39
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,120
Well, then...

40
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,440
that can happen... between two consenting adults.

41
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,510
♫  slid by only in dreams  ♫

42
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:47,940
♫  that you in front of me ♫
3 hours after the kiss

43
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,420
♫  Love came.  You left. ♫
5 hours after the kiss

44
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,710
♫  Been waiting.  Can't see again. ♫

45
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,040
Ah, thirsty.

46
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,670
♫   Always like a fool tears fall.  ♫

47
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:11,670
♫  In my head, it is Hello.  Good Bye.  ♫

48
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,180
♫  Hello, Hello  ♫

49
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,930
Manager Do?

50
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,660
Do Min Joon?

51
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,100
Is he unwell?

52
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,620
Don't. Don't touch me.

53
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,590
What did you say?

54
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,950
I said don't come closer!

55
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,400
Go away! Go!

56
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,960
You must never be deceived.

57
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,520
You must differentiate between

58
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,260
your heart beating and falling in love.

59
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,050
 My Love From The Star
Episode 9

60
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,060
The face captured on the camera is the one.

61
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,750
That day...

62
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,710
The face of the man I saw at the edge of the cliff.

63
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,840
Did you say he's called Do Min Joon?

64
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,270
Yes.

65
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,200
 Do Min Joon!

66
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,820
 I'm from Yeongdeungpo  .

67
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,460
 You're aware of Han Yoo Ra's murder case, right?

68
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,840
 I have a few things to ask regarding that case.

69
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,910
If you're certain that Cheon Song Yi 
doesn't have the USB,

70
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,230
the probability of it having fallen into 
this Do Min Joon's hand is high.

71
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,340
What kind of crappy manners is it to fall ill and take to one's bed

72
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,180
as soon as he does it with me?

73
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,520
It makes me out to be a clump of viruses.

74
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,260
Look here.

75
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,790
Do Min Joon.

76
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,530
Do Min Joon!

77
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,770
Is he dead?

78
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,760
It's beating really  fast.

79
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,740
Can a person live with their heart beating that fast?

80
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,320
Oh my!

81
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,270
Are you okay?

82
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,650
I thought something had happened.

83
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,190
Move.

84
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,390
This won't do. Let's go to the Emergency Room.

85
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,380
I can fry an egg on your forehead.

86
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,000
It's too hot, I'm telling you.  Let's go quickly.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,540
I'm not going.

88
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,740
Why?

89
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,610
Why? Why aren't you going?

90
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,810
Yes, he has a really high fever.

91
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,500
How high?

92
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,080
About 50 degrees?

93
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,470
Fifty degrees? Can a person live at that temperature?

94
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,610
Let's, just please, have a conversation
at a reasonable level.

95
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,540
 Anyway, he's hot, totally hot. What do I do?
 He won't even go to the hospital.

96
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,390
Who is he?

97
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,370
Is that so important?

98
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,580
What am I supposed to do?  You said you know  these kind of things since you've raised 3 nephews and nieces.

99
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,700
 Of course I know. When a person 
has a high fever, you must...

100
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,910
Yes?

101
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,670
Take it off.

102
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,940
Must I do that?

103
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,770
 Have you done it?

104
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,460
Not yet...

105
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,820
 Strip him completely naked and massage his
entire body with a cloth soaked in lukewarm water.

106
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,800
The entire... body

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,220
Massage?

108
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,910
Must I do that?

109
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,800
 That's the fastest way.

110
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,270
 When I did that for my nephews/nieces, 
I even removed their diapers too.

111
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,020
It's not that sort of a situation.

112
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,370
 Really?

113
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,050
 Is the kid older?

114
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,380
 How old is he?

115
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,650
 Wait a moment...

116
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,540
 Hey, just now...

117
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,640
 What was that?

118
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,980
 - That   most definitely 
belonged to an adult male...

119
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,510
I'm hanging up for now!

120
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,380
Well, I need to save him first.

121
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,430
What are you doing right now?

122
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,430
This is supposedly the fastest way to lower your temperature.

123
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,960
Or try taking off your clothes or whatever.

124
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,570
Don't.

125
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,500
Get out.

126
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,140
Consider yourself lucky.  My original ambition
 was to be Helen Keller.

127
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,330
You know her, right?  A white-robed angel.

128
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,830
You mean, Nightingale.
 (Florence Nightingale: Founder of modern nursing)

129
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,840
Don't obsess over details.

130
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,420
What's important right now is that the person 
 whose dream was to become a nurse is nursing you right now.

131
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,540
I am supposed to massage your entire body
 with a cloth soaked in lukewarm water.

132
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,810
If you really don't feel comfortable with me doing it, then

133
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,560
would you like to administer self-massage or something?

134
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,740
I said get out, please.

135
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,920
Perhaps...Is it because you're awkward
 over what happened last night?

136
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,370
It's not your fault. I warned you.

137
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm a lump of pheromones.  A chunk of charm.

138
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,640
I understand.

139
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,610
You're a man too.  You couldn't help it.

140
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,440
Still, that doesn't mean you should have...

141
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,520
k-ki...

142
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,810
Anyway, if you do  that  and fall ill after that,
 then . . .

143
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,570
What does that make me?

144
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,160
By chance. . .

145
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,510
Was it your first time?

146
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,970
The first time?

147
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,680
No way.

148
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,780
Wait, what have you been doing at your age?

149
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:08,170
What's this. I'm the one who got kissed.
If he becomes like this, I'm the one who's sorry.

150
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,660
Anyway, even if it's cold, endure it a little bit
 since we have to lower the temperature.

151
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,250
What's all this out of the blue? 
You were totally fine.

152
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,860
Ah, it's freezing.

153
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,680
 Hey, you frustrating girl. Why are you calling me?
 I said call that guy you like.

154
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,590
 I said call that punk you like.

155
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,670
 Are you asleep?

156
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,470
 If you're not, call me.

157
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,320
What is it?

158
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,610
Oppa, I'm curious about something.

159
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,190
About what?

160
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,710
Last time. . . That man in the CCTV picture.

161
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,940
The person called Do Min Joon. . .

162
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,010
How old is he?

163
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,530
I heard he's an instructor at a university now. 
What did he use to do for living?

164
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:04,460
Is it possible to find out about his siblings and such?

165
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,810
Like he has a twin or an older brother. . .

166
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,270
Why are you curious about that?

167
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,830
What kind of relationship does he 
have with Cheon Song Yi?

168
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,540
Have you found anything?

169
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,080
Aren't you Cheon Song Yi's best friend?

170
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,200
You shouldn't ask  me  about those things. 
You should go ask your friend in person.

171
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,250
I'm not her friend.

172
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,910
If you are not her friend, then, it's even weirder.

173
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,360
If you are not her friend, why are you curious about 
 the relationship between Cheon Song Yi and that man?

174
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,520
Can't you just tell me?

175
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,630
That man. . . He's a bit odd.

176
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,090
What's odd about him?

177
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,040

178
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,370
What are you doing in there?

179
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:45,970
Ah, you're up? Do you feel better?

180
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,270
I mean, I felt like I should stay next to you
 because I was worried.

181
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,660
But it was too cold since the window was open.
Aiyoo, this. . .

182
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,480
This won't unzip. Why won't this open?

183
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,040
I'm fine now, so get out.

184
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,510
E-Excuse me? What did you just say?!

185
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,460
"I'm fine now, so get out?" 
Did I hear it wrong?

186
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,100
Or has Mr. Do Min Joon gone out of his mind 
because he's sick? How can you say that?

187
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,670
I spent the whole night nursing you. 
How can you be so rude?

188
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,280
Seeing that your rudeness is back, 
I guess you feel better now, huh?

189
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,440
Ugh, why won't this open up?

190
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,870
Can't you shut your mouth?

191
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,040
I think the sleeping bag zipper is broken.
 I can't open it. Try to open it from the outside.

192
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,660
Just stay there like that. Don't bother me.

193
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,720
What? Are you kidding?

194
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,270
Open this quickly! Open it!

195
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,280
Mr. Do Min Joon! Do Min Joon! Hey!

196
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,030
I do you a favor and this is the thanks I get, huh?!

197
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,240
I don't think this is right.

198
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,380
A human being shouldn't be like this.

199
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,910
If I helped you when you were sick, shouldn't you
 thank me first? You shouldn't live like that.

200
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:07,820
Consider my sincere advice, huh?

201
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,120
You better open this up in a hurry!  I'm going to count to 3.
I can't be patient beyond that.  I can't be responsible!

202
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,950
One. Two. Two and half.

203
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,730
A quarter! 
 A half of a quarter! Half, half, half!

204
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,000
Bam bara bam bam. Aaaah!

205
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,680
Be quiet. My head hurts.

206
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,730
Please get me out of this.

207
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,930
Hey, what are you doing right now?
 I said get me out of this!!!

208
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,760
Hey! Can't you let go of me? Aaaah! 
Once I get out, you're seriously dead. Aaaah!

209
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,680
HEY! Once I get out, you're totally dead!
 I'm really scary when I get mad!

210
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,220
HEY! HEY!

211
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,900
HEY! Hey! Aish. Ugh.

212
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,370
One moment he eagerly pursues and renders me
 nearly unconscious...  Ugh, he's toying with me.

213
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:16,040
That goblin's slipper-like bastard.

214
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:30,020
- Aiyoo, it's cold, cold. 
-- I feel like I get even hungrier because of the cold.

215
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,390
Huh? Instructor Do is not here yet.

216
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,520
He has class for the intersession.

217
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,160
What is this? He's never late.

218
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,410
I met his Teaching Assistant on my way here. 
She told me that he canceled the class for today.

219
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,190
He's sick or something. . .

220
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,650
I guess he gets sick too. It's a first.

221
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,960
Who's there?

222
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,050
Father?

223
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,170
Ms. Cheon Song Yi?

224
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,820
I see you again. Father!

225
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,630
Happy New Year!

226
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,520
Ah, yes. 
You, too, Ms. Cheon Song Yi.

227
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:39,430
Father, if you have time, 
could you get me out of this?

228
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,760
Then, Mr. Do Min Joon called you in the early morning?

229
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,720
Yes.

230
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,290
But why is he like that suddenly? He's sick to death, 
but he won't go to the hospital.

231
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,490
He doesn't need to go to the hospital.

232
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,300
How come?

233
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,910
Even if it's hard, you should eat some.

234
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,930
I can't swallow anything because my throat hurts.

235
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,450
What exactly happened?

236
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,640
Such a thing happened when you were working 
at the bank 30 years ago. . .

237
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,830
You know, that time when we first met.

238
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,800
One of the employees, who hated you so much, 
spat in your coffee and gave it to you.

239
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,560
After drinking that, you fainted. 
You were very sick for a week.

240
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,900
Min Kyung Wook.

241
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,500
I still remember his face clearly.

242
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,710
You were afraid that such incident would happen again. 
That's why you stopped eating with other people.

243
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,250
Did you eat with Ms. Cheon Song Yi?

244
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,010
Well. . .

245
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,660
No, that can't be.

246
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,190
You ate with me last time, too.

247
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,900
That much was fine, right?

248
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,490
I mean, what exactly happened?

249
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,350
Perhaps. . . is that it?

250
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,600
That.

251
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,090
What are you talking about?

252
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,510
I should rest a bit.

253
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:31,540
You should hold it in. Why risk your life for it?

254
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,380
Then, please rest.

255
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,270
Why, now, just  when you are about to leave?

256
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,310
I am upset.

257
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,880
You know. . . Can't you stay here by chance?

258
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,470
If you leave, after you've come to 
care deeply for someone,

259
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,050
you, who's leaving, will suffer heartache, yes,

260
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,010
but wouldn't the person who's left behind suffer just as much?

261
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,880

262
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,730
What on earth is this?

263
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,950
I feel uncomfortable knowing that the person 
who used to live here became a corpse...

264
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,740
I know, right? You should paper the walls, again.

265
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,720
You ever talked with the guy who used to live here?

266
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,930
I didn't even get to see him very often. . .

267
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,580
Since he used to go out only at dawn.

268
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,390
Please make sure there won't be any rumors 
about this. The value of this place will drop.

269
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,670
Alright.

270
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,650
Helmet, this punk. . . 
He seriously was crazy over Han Yoo Ra.

271
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,990
Detective Park.

272
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,380
Yes?

273
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,150
What is this?

274
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,980
Obstetrics and Gynecology?

275
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,340
It was a month ago.

276
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,120
By chance, was this woman pregnant?

277
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,850
But that wasn't found when we did the autopsy.

278
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,970
The autopsy done by the National Forensic Service
 only includes a record of drugs.

279
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,920
Unless the belly is as big as a mountain, early pregnancy
is hard to ascertain from autopsy.

280
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,360
Also, when they did the autopsy, we were trying hard 
to find whether it was a homicide or a suicide, so

281
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,230
we didn't request a separate examination for 
possible pregnancy.

282
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,760
We should first take a look at the breakdown of insurance payments made for her medical care expenses.

283
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:22,310
This case is so dramatic.

284
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,480
So Han Yoo Ra was seeing someone.

285
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,740
That person must be the one who went to the 
Near Death Experience Center with her, right?

286
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,940
Perhaps. . .

287
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,090
Would it be him?

288
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,840
Do Min Joon.

289
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,340
- Why do you think so?
-- I mean there was this rumor, you know.

290
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,190
Han Yoo Ra and Cheon Song Yi had a cat fight, 
at the hair salon, because of a man.

291
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,430
But we checked the CCTV at the hair salon.

292
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,600
- There was nothing like that. 
-- There wasn't.

293
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,850
But, it is true that the two women fought, and

294
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,150
a man appeared.

295
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,950
Do Min Joon.

296
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,210
So, if you write this as a scenario,

297
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,960
Do Min Joon and Cheon Song Yi began liking
 each other as they lived next door.

298
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,750
But then, Do Min Joon cheated on her with Han Yoo Ra.

299
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,470
This guy is good-looking and rich.

300
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,550
But, he was caught by Cheon Song Yi.

301
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,410
Cheon Song Yi's personality is no joke,
 so she went crazy about this.

302
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,800
So he picked Cheon Song Yi, but . . .

303
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,460
Oh dear! Han Yoo Ra got pregnant.

304
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,760
But Do Min Joon, a man in face, but a brute in mind,

305
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,950
decided to get rid of Han Yoo Ra and

306
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,140
got on the ship.

307
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,120
Do Min Joon has an alibi for that day.

308
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,900
That's strange right now, but...

309
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,560
There's no evidence.

310
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,780
So, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

311
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:48,060
It's not a tangible evidence, but a confident belief.

312
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:52,850
He doesn't know well because he's a rookie. 
No matter how much I tell him. . .

313
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,640
Please take good care of him.

314
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,130
Please remind him to warm up the rest of the porridge.

315
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,720
Yes, I will, Father. Don't worry.

316
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,030
Even if that kid is mean to you, by chance,

317
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,370
you shouldn't spit in the porridge, alright?

318
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,820
Oh, I was going to do that. . .

319
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,870
I was just kidding, Father.

320
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,760
You really shouldn't do that.

321
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,550
It will be really serious.

322
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,880
 Records of the last 3 months on Earth. . .?

323
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,350
 What was that?

324
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,800
 Last 3 months or something?

325
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,000
 Are you going somewhere?
 Or are you ill or something?

326
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,810
 I said don't ask me any questions, didn't I?

327
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,900
Hey, no way. . .

328
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,790
Yoo Ra was in the early stage of pregnancy?

329
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,750
Yes.

330
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,820
Why wasn't that found in the autopsy?

331
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,740
Because it was the very early stage of pregnancy,
the National Forensic Autopsy didn't detect it, I believe.

332
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,550
It was discovered from the record of hospital 
appointments which came from the family center.

333
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:29,590
 I think everyone who knows you and me is here.

334
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,900
 Be full of expectation.

335
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,060
 What I might say to those people.

336
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,020
 When you hear it, you probably will

337
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,730
 be surprised, Oppa.

338
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,820
 My depression is up to you, Oppa.

339
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,850
 I stopped taking the pills since a while ago.

340
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,110
I believe the prosecution will keep the murder
open, as an option,

341
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,600
and focus on finding Han Yoo Ra's man.

342
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,860
And. . . It's very likely that they will call
 Cheon Song Yi in as a reference witness.

343
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,450
If Cheon Song Yi tells the prosecutor about the 
relationship between you and Han Yoo Ra. . .

344
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,690
I have to stop by somewhere.

345
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,570
I will pay you back. Did I ever say I'm not?

346
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,960
I'm Cheon Song Yi's mom. 
You're worrying for nothing.

347
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,370
Oh, yeah. Talk to you later.

348
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,680
Long time no see, Mother.

349
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,430
I know, right, CEO Kang?

350
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,980
Until a couple of months ago, you called me a lot saying you wanted to make a contract with my Song Yi.

351
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,760
I was almost disappointed because 
you stopped calling me these days.

352
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,030
Should we order coffee?

353
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,190
Really?

354
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,210
You're going to give her this much money? Why?

355
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,790
Of course, my Song Yi is valuable enough to warrant
this kind of payment...

356
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,260
However . . .

357
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,390
I have a condition.

358
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,650
What's that?

359
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:05,170
Cheon Song Yi has previously only pursued 
"modest" roles, don't you think?

360
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,340
Now. . . She's old enough.

361
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,190
What do you mean?

362
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,070
I'm saying we should expand her field.

363
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,110
Image transformation.

364
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,550
First, she can enter into the "mobile illustration" arena.
(modeling to sell/represent products with revealing poses)

365
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,180
For the movies, she's of an age to star
 in adult films as well.

366
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,260
Just because I say this,

367
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,290
I don't mean we should film really weird things.

368
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,920
Mother!

369
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,970
Mother, my butt. Who's your mother?

370
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,040
I've never had an old, weasel-like son like you!

371
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,240
If you want to look for a mother, go home,
 grab  hold of your mother, then ask.

372
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,010
"Why am I living like this?"

373
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,250
This woman...!

374
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,740
You're ripping off your daughter. 
Why are you cos-playing as a mom?

375
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,030
What? Am I paying you too little?

376
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,760
Why not just be honest and ask for more money?

377
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,020
You'd do it if I gave more, no?  
What won't you make her do?

378
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:00,500
You are Cheon Song Yi's mom, who's living 
by selling off her daughter's soul.

379
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,680
What?

380
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,360
But there won't be any place 
that will give you more money.

381
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,980
I'm the only one who is willing to, at least, 
give her a chance by taking her clothes off.

382
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,240
Aish, seriously. . .

383
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,220
Your daughter is out of this industry.

384
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,200
Your meal ticket is gone, I'd say.

385
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,160
Wake up.

386
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,890
Ah, what's this? Why am I sleeping here?

387
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,050
Are you feeling a little better?

388
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,630
Is your hand still not alright?  
How badly did you hurt it...

389
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,640
It's fine now.

390
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,940
Your father stayed here for a while.

391
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,610
He was really worried about you.

392
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,650
I guess you're closer to your father than your mother.

393
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,160
That's the same for me.

394
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,360
Where's your father?

395
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,820
I don't know.

396
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,810
It's been over 12 years since I have seen him.

397
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,160
I miss him, but

398
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,050
he hasn't shown up even once.

399
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,260
Maybe it's because I was so rotten to him at the end

400
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,380
that he lost all his love for me.

401
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,540
 Noona, I'm hungry.

402
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,390
 Where's Mom and Dad?

403
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,030
 You can just leave with nothing.

404
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,440
 I told you. I would raise the kids.

405
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,340
 If you really want to, take Yoon Jae. 
I'm going to raise Song Yi.

406
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,080
 You are going to keep Song Yi 
who can make money,

407
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,040
 but give me valueless Yoon Jae?

408
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,410
 That's right. I'm going to raise Song Yi 
who can make money.

409
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:25,700
 She won't amount to anything even if you keep her.

410
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,310
 The one who debuted Song Yi as a child star was me.
The one who took her around to film night and day was me too.

411
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,650
 From now on, I have to take care of her.

412
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,730
 Because I'll make certain that she succeeds.

413
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,390
 I will do it, too.  I also can take her around 
the movie shoots,

414
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:43,360
 and make her succeed.  If you can do it,
why can't I? Am I crazy?

415
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,570
 Why would I hand over such a tremendous money bag to you,
when she has brought in so much money!

416
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,600
  Song Yi.

417
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,560
  I'm not like that.

418
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,530
  It isn't like that.

419
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,650
  Don't touch me.

420
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,760
  Song Yi. 
- Don't call my name.

421
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,100
  Dad, now you aren't my dad anymore.

422
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,850
  Don't appear in front of me again.

423
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,340
  If you call my name one more time,

424
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:20,020
  I will really kill myself.

425
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,540
I guess I've aged.

426
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:32,310
Now I understand what my dad said at that time.

427
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,020
I am sure he didn't mean it.

428
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,060
The reason I am mad now is

429
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,820
because the time I had with my dad was too short.

430
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:48,780
He shouldn't have loved me if he was going
 to be there for only a short time.

431
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,740
After that, I ran away and almost died.

432
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,920
I was almost hit by a truck while running.

433
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,430
But an ahjussi saved me.

434
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,210
Even when I think about that now, it is really strange.

435
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,950
I was about to get hit by a truck, but

436
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:10,520
when I came to my senses, 
I was across the street in his arms.

437
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,710
What could that ahjussi be?

438
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,600
Is he a human being or a ghost?

439
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:22,960
He was wearing dark clothes, 
looking like the grim reaper. . .

440
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,950
If you talk long, you talk nonsense.

441
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,070
Yeah. I understand.

442
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,450
If I were you, I would have also said it was nonsense.

443
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,030
But it was a fact. It wasn't just me who saw it. 
Hui Kyeong also saw it.

444
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,720
Just sleep.

445
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,380
Oh, it is Jae Kyeong oppa.

446
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,290
Why does he call me often these days?

447
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,630
Omo, what happened suddenly?

448
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,770
Song Yi!

449
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,080
  Cheon Song Yi!

450
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,430
Are you in?

451
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,760
She's not here.

452
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,600
 She's a very lucky girl.

453
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,860
Jae Kyeong Oppa's been strange these days.

454
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,830
What is?

455
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,450
I think he has feelings for me.

456
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,710
When he came to my house last time, he told me 
to take care of my health and worried about me.

457
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,910
He asks to eat together and calls me often.

458
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:38,570
What should I do? I really hate that kind of thing.

459
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,580
What if the brothers fight over me?

460
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,330
What if the brotherly love between Hui Kyeong
 and Jae Kyeong is ruined because of me?

461
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,700
Do you think all men in the world like you?

462
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,170
All except you.

463
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,320
But, I guess I shouldn't exclude you either.

464
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,130
Last night, it was a bit confusing.

465
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,350
What is your ideal (girl) type?

466
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,590
I don't have anything like that.

467
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,790
But I do.

468
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:19,280
As for me, someone who will stay by my side
 for a very, very long time.

469
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,930
Unlike my dad who disappeared suddenly,

470
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,620
someone  who will seriously forever
  stay by my side for a very, very long time.

471
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,030
If I think like that, I guess Hui Kyeong fits the picture.

472
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,940
Why?

473
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,540
I need to prepare for tomorrow's lecture.

474
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:53,620

475
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,410
Who are you? 
- That is something I want to ask.

476
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,600
Who are you that you are coming out
 from Cheon Song Yi's house?

477
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,170
As far as I know, there is no one in that house.

478
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:44,060
I thought she was there, so I went in.
But she wasn't there.

479
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:50,100
If you meet Cheon Song Yi, tell her that it is too bad
 that I couldn't meet her.

480
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,920
Please tell her that

481
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,900
she will meet me again soon.

482
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,730
What's up?

483
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,940
Stop it.

484
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,700
What?

485
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,250
The USB . . .

486
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,050
you have it, don't you?

487
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,290
You'd better give it to me.

488
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,080
For you . . . and also for Cheon Song Yi....

489
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,290
There is something you don't know.

490
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,050
I...

491
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,180
I'm not the kind of person that 
a novice like you can deal with.

492
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,030
The reason why you are still alive is

493
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,940
because I am letting you live.

494
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,770
It is the same for Cheon Song Yi as well.

495
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,190
So...

496
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,640
be grateful.

497
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,990
The moment you touch Cheon Song Yi,

498
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,500
your true identity will be revealed to the world.

499
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,360
I . . . will do that.

500
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,760
And there is something you don't know.

501
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,720
You can

502
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:25,800
never kill me.

503
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,870
  As for me, someone who will stay by my side
 for a very, very long time.

504
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:57,110
  Unlike my dad who disappeared suddenly,

505
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,030
  seriously forever,

506
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,650
 someone who will stay by my side 
for a very Very long time

507
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,600
  If you leave after you've come to
 care deeply for someone,

508
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,220
 you will be heart-broken, yes,

509
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,580
  but wouldn't the person who's left behind be as heart-broken as the depth of such feeling??

510
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,350
Professor Do Min Joon?

511
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,190
Hello.

512
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,180
Who are you?

513
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,220
I am an actress called Yoo Se Mi.

514
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,260
I am sorry. I was told that you had a class today,
 so I just came by.

515
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:13,040
I don't know if you know, but I am Song Yi's friend.

516
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,410
I wanted to talk to you about Song Yi. . .

517
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,400
Do you have a moment?

518
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,910
I am sorry (to bother you) when you are busy.

519
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,780
What is it that you want to say to me?

520
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,670
By chance, did you hear anything
 about me from Song Yi?

521
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,170
  What's wrong with her today? 
 Her make up is totally not good, right?

522
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:43,050
 That's all coming from her head.
 There's no feeling from her heart.

523
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,220
  I guess I have to give her some pointers when I meet her.

524
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,180
I'm not sure...

525
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:55,850
I heard a lot about you from Song Yi.

526
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,540
That you've been helping her a lot.

527
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,690
It seemed like Song Yi was relying on you greatly.

528
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,780
Truthfully,

529
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,990
since middle school,

530
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,520
Song Yi and I were the closest friends.

531
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,060
But after the bad incident happened this time . . .

532
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,740
There was a misunderstanding.

533
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,870
Right now, we aren't on good terms.

534
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,120
I want to resolve it in any case, but

535
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,150
I don't know if you know Song  Yi's personality.

536
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,850
Of course, I know her personality.

537
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,760
It isn't easy.

538
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,530
Of course, it isn't.

539
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,200
I clearly know that her situation isn't good.

540
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,930
I want to cheer her up, but

541
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:49,770
if she knows about me doing this

542
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,940
I think she would hate me more.

543
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,020
Can I just ask you for only one favor?

544
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,080
Because I am worried about the state of her condition. 
 I am worried that something bad will happen to her.

545
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:06,920
But, . . . I can't contact her directly.

546
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,490
When I am curious (about her),

547
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,300
can I call you?

548
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,950
Please do that.

549
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,570
But....

550
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:28,300
did you just recently meet Song Yi?  Or. . .

551
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,850
have you known her for a while?

552
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,350
I met her for the first time after she moved in.

553
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,770
I see.

554
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,450
Anyway, that is a relief.

555
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:49,030
Because someone like you is next to Song Yi
 in times like this.

556
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:55,780

557
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,050
Here, Song Yi Unni!

558
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,280
 (What are you crazy?!)

559
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,030
 (Oh, no, what do I do?!)

560
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,800
Thank you, I will eat well.

561
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,790
I'm sorry, Unni. It's a habit.

562
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,970
It's okay.

563
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,780
I guess this can happen since you were
 with Song Yi for such a long time.

564
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:28,600
It must be tough for you guys. 
 After what happened to Song Yi,

565
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,460
you must be going through a lot. Yet, 
 you had to come assist me right away.

566
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,250
-No!
-That's not it!

567
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,490
Even so,

568
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,060
after working with a top star like Song Yi,

569
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,630
you can feel frustrated working with me.

570
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,890
If there is something I don't know,

571
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,770
please let me know.

572
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,270
It's really not like that.

573
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,450
You are like an angel!

574
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,340
Truthfully, compared to working with Song Yi,

575
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,730
I like working with you better.

576
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,730
Really?

577
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,140
Of course!

578
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:13,010
Is that really true?

579
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,380
Of course. I definitely like it better.

580
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,070
"Angel"?

581
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,940
Hey, you shouldn't do that.

582
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,180
What about you?

583
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,000
"Of course, I like you better!"

584
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,970
Ah, really...

585
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,990
This is the problem in making a living.

586
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,190
After the question, 
"Who do you like more, Mom or Dad?"

587
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,750
it was the hardest to answer.

588
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,670
When I was young, I said I liked Dad in front of Dad and

589
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,830
I liked Mom in front of Mom.

590
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,710
But I always liked my grandmother in my heart.

591
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,820
Why?

592
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,490
Grandma raised me.

593
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,330
Today, my heart said Song Yi Noona, but

594
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,870
I lied to Se Mi Noona.

595
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,460
-Me too.
-Hey guys.

596
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,130
-Oh, Hyung. 
 -Hello.

597
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:04,710
Where is Se Mi?

598
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,510
Over there.

599
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,300
I'm sorry.

600
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,840
The angle didn't work.

601
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,470
Okay, okay. Let's do it again.

602
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,000
Ready!

603
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,660
Action!

604
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,040
Oh, sorry. I can't get into the emotion of this scene.

605
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,340
Ah, what's wrong with you?

606
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,500
 -Take a break, then let's do it again. 
-What is that punk doing?

607
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,810
He's always a jerk.

608
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,940
He always makes NG's whenever he shoots kiss scenes.

609
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,790
Yoo Se Mi is better than Cheon Song Yi.

610
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,080
She's easy-going, you know.

611
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,520
What are you?!

612
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,070
Oh, Se Mi!

613
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,740
You're having a hard time?

614
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,550
Are you cold?

615
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:25,630
Why did you meet Yoo Se Mi? Why did she look for you?

616
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:29,060
I told you, didn't I? She is worried about you.

617
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,760
Worry? That's rolling on the floor laughing my a** off!

618
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,060
That wench isn't my friend anymore now!

619
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,130
Seriously, she is a ridiculous wench.

620
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:40,010
What's her agenda? 
What does she want to know?

621
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:43,130
Does she want to know how miserable 
I am right now or something?

622
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,890
I heard you guys were friends for a long time.

623
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,180
How is that related to this?!

624
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,670
She seems like a nice person.

625
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,500
Do Min Joo, whose side are you on?

626
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,930
Are you on my side or Yoo Se Mi's side?

627
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,450
I'm not saying that right now!

628
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,810
What do you mean you're not? Don't you think
 there's a reason if I say I don't like Yoo Se Mi?

629
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,810
Yeah. There is a reason for everything.

630
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:07,230
There must be a reason for people around you 
to leave you, Ms. Cheon Song Yi.

631
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,380
What?

632
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,680
So you are saying that me being like this is my fault?

633
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,830
Before bearing a grudge against people around you,
 for not taking your side,

634
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:18,050
think about why you haven't been able to 
make them stand on your side.

635
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,440
Perhaps, it's you that made yourself lonely.

636
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,270
I am not lonely. Who said I am lonely?

637
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,740
If not,

638
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,710
why are you staying here?

639
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,540
Instead of staying with your friends or family,

640
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,250
why are you at a strange man's house? 
Do you know anything about me?

641
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,240
Why do you depend on me?

642
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,050
You are lonely.

643
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,910
Because you have no one and no place to go to.

644
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:41,980
Get out!

645
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,790
This is my house.

646
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:46,630
Don't say a word and get lost!

647
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,860
Didn't you see my message?

648
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,530
I saw.

649
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,620
Then, why didn't you call?

650
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,660
I was scared.

651
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,220
I thought about it a lot after receiving your call at that time.

652
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,930
All this time, I was clueless.

653
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,520
The person to whom I confessed about liking 
Cheon Song Yi for the first time was you.  And . . .

654
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,220
My letter....

655
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,650
the one who delivered my letter to Song Yi was you, as well.

656
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,830
Whenever I was having a hard time

657
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:30,790
because of Song Yi, it was you whom I relied on and asked for advice.

658
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,640
You . . .

659
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,420
I can't imagine how hard it was for you whenever I did that.

660
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,220
I'm sorry.

661
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,780
But,

662
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,150
I think I will be sorry in the future as well.

663
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,370
Looking at someone who doesn't look back at you,

664
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,780
I know that feeling better than anyone else.

665
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,240
About your heart being hurt,

666
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,080
I know better than anyone else.

667
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,540
If I think about that,

668
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,920
I also feel really upset.

669
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,080
While having someone I love in my heart,

670
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:14,970
what can I possibly do for you?

671
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,520
The only thing I can do for you is

672
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,440
nothing but to reject you.

673
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,790
For that, I'm sorry.

674
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,760
Call me when your feelings are settled.

675
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,500
I...

676
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,740
don't want to lose you, Yoo Se Mi,

677
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:38,380
as a friend.

678
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,480
Hui Kyeong.

679
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:04,290
The man, Do Min Joon, who lives next to Song Yi's house...

680
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,040
Don't you think you have seen him somewhere?

681
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,880
What are you suddenly talking about?

682
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,500
What...

683
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,230
is this?

684
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,650
I told you.  That accident from 12 years ago . . .

685
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,370
The one who saved Song Yi, that man.

686
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,180
I said I knew.

687
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,210
It is the picture I took at that time.

688
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,590
What do you think as you're looking at it?

689
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,280
I think...

690
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,340
it is the same person.

691
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,890
Does this make sense?

692
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,560
It was 12 years ago.

693
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,750
You changed and I changed as well.

694
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,860
I also don't understand how this could have happened.

695
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,450
The important thing is that

696
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,960
the guy, who looks the same as the guy from 12 years ago,

697
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,820
now has shown up again next to Song Yi.

698
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:15,820
Song Yi still doesn't know that

699
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,950
he is the guy from that time.

700
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,970
  Do you remember his face?

701
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,630
  I saw it, but I can't remember.

702
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:38,080
  It is a bit of an exaggeration to call him my first love.

703
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,130
  I am just saying I want to meet him one day.

704
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,730
  I want to thank him for saving me at that time.

705
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,460
  And I want to ask him

706
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,760
  why he saved me.

707
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,250
  That's all.

708
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,500
Did he really leave just because I told him to?

709
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,950
I'm hungry.

710
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:21,520
Please give me an order of chicken and beer to go.

711
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,910
Why are you here?

712
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,760
Why are you in Do Min Joon's house!?

713
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,800
Where is Do Min Joon?

714
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:41,490
Hey, why are you being like this?

715
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,620
Come out.

716
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,260
- I told you to come out. 
- Let go, please!

717
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,940
Because I had no where to go, I came here.

718
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:52,150
The day I came out of the hospital, 
somebody wrecked my home.

719
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,450
I was really scared,

720
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:55,830
but I had no where to go.

721
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:58,680
What do you mean you didn't have a place to stay? 
What about your mom's house, or a hotel!?

722
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,090
I hate going to my mom's house and I am an actress. 
 How could I go to a hotel....

723
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,620
Am I in the situation to do that right now?

724
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:06,680
Even still, this isn't it.
If you have really nowhere to go, stay at my house.

725
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,810
Say something which makes sense.

726
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,140
No, I'll buy you a house! Go there.

727
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,160
In any case, you can't be here. 
Anywhere, but here, is fine!

728
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,910
Lee Hui Kyeong, calm down.

729
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,340
We have a villa in Cheong Pyeong.

730
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,980
There are ahjummas that will cook for you.  
And, there are lots of ahjussis that will guard you.

731
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,020
Go there for now.

732
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,330
Go there, Song Yi.

733
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,190
I am asking you for a favor.

734
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,480
You are having a hard time these days, right?

735
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,850
You can rest too. Let's do that.

736
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,800
Go to the car first. I will come down after packing.

737
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,480
Thank you.

738
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,570
That's right.

739
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,990
For once, try feeling the emptiness when I leave this house while you're gone.

740
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,110
What is it?

741
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,720
 It's Cheon Song Yi. Anyway, thanks for all this time.

742
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,110
 I'm going to Hui Kyeong's villa in Cheong Pyeong...

743
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,910
Why am I even writing where I am going? 
It sounds like I am telling him to come find me.

744
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,520
It sounds pathetic. Just don't write anything.

745
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:43,420
Why are you like this?

746
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,170
 Do Min Joon!

747
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,560
You...

748
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,520
Who are you?

749
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:11,030
What?

750
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,100
Are you, perhaps,

751
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:22,790
from 12 years ago, the one who saved Song Yi...

752
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,480
Are you that person?

753
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:37,760

754
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,500
With the ability I have,

755
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,450
there weren't that many cases
 where I saved someone.

756
00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:00,410
Revealing my powers means revealing my identity.

757
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:04,060
But there weren't that many people who wouldn't 
exploit me after knowing who I am,

758
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:08,420
or people who would accept me as I am.

759
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,770
The limits of my abilities,

760
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,890
I am not sure about it myself.

761
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:16,010
For teleporting through space, 
if I know the exact location,

762
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:18,940
I can teleport within a radius of 300 kilometers.

763
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:23,000
I can also stop time for about 1 minute.

764
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,980
Tthe condition of my body is an important factor.

765
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:30,900
When I first met Lawyer Jang, since the condition
of my body condition was very bad,

766
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,540
I almost killed him.

767
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,660
 1976, Seoul

768
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,770
Drink it.

769
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,360
 Min Kyeong Uk

770
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:02,170
 Please save me. Without that money, my mother

771
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:03,950
 can't receive the surgery.

772
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:06,230
 In order to support me preparing for the bar exam,

773
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:08,300
 she had a hard time.

774
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,080
 Please...

775
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:13,010
 Think of it as saving a life.

776
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,590
 If my mother passes away, I will die too.

777
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:20,220
 - Where do you think this is? 
- Please!
- Why are you pulling on my clothes?

778
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,710
 Manager. Manager!!!

779
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,580
 Hold on!

780
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:27,760
  Who are you?

781
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,450
 Are you a ghost?
