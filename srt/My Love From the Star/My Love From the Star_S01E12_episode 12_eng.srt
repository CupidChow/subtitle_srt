1
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:53,410

2
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,880
Oppa! See, it really is a person!
 What do we do? It seems like a hit and run.

3
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,580
This is 119, right? A person here has collapsed. 
I think it was a car accident.

4
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,850
-Where is the patient?
--He's over here.

5
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,100
Where?

6
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,340
-Where did he go?
--Before, he was clearly . . .

7
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,180
He was really here. The young man was bleeding.

8
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,760
 An hour earlier

9
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,600
With the excuse that you were waiting for that person,

10
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,830
and that you were going to meet him again, you made Hui Kyeong,

11
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,580
that idiotic boy who only looked at you,

12
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,990
into someone who's stuck to you and 
can't even come and go as he pleases. So why?

13
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,160
You don't recognize him?

14
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,520
What . . . don't I recognize?

15
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,030
He's right next to you.

16
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,300
I'm saying, why don't you recognize him?

17
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,540
Right next to me?

18
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,190
Where?

19
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,840
Wh-

20
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,870
What are you talking about?

21
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,040
Are you curious?

22
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,260
No.

23
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,490
Not at all.

24
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,680
At least I got one thing straight.

25
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,100
You like Hui Kyeong, don't you?

26
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,140
Since when?

27
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,300
That's right. I like him.

28
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,130
From when Hui Kyeong started liking you.

29
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,510
But why bring that up now?

30
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,950
That's how it was. You must have hated me so much.

31
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,220
Now I'm starting to understand.

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,910
Is that why you brought that up?
 Saying you knew who that man from 12 years ago was?

33
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,370
I won't ask who he is and how you found out who that man is.

34
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,210
Even if you're dying to say it, don't.

35
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,250
How could I believe your words?

36
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,080
Even though we were friends for over 15 years,

37
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,850
it's you who was never honest with me for one moment.

38
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,970
-Cheon Song Yi.
--Yeah, Yoo Se Mi. That heart of yours that liked Hui Kyeong,

39
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,840
your heart that became desperate to find that man
 from 12 years ago, so I would drop off from you guys.

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,610
I know it so well.

41
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,260
To me, who was your friend at one point, that heart

42
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,790
seems pitiful.

43
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,400
How dare you-

44
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,820
It seems you've misunderstood,
 but that man from 12 years ago

45
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,950
isn't important to me anymore. 
I was curious for a long time.

46
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:14,260
Because he was the person who 
saved my life the night my dad left.

47
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,890
But I'm no longer the little girl who wandered
 the streets, crying because her dad left.

48
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,820
So don't try to scare me with something like that,

49
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,640
and don't think of dragging someone around me to make him into someone strange.

50
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,320
Don't do it.

51
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,850
If there comes a time when
 I need to recognize that man, I will do it.

52
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,580
I don't care if I pass him by without recognizing him.

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,390
So . . .

54
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,990
Don't bring up that man in front of me again.

55
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,170
They say a person's mentality is like that.

56
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,590
When one sees someone 
who's in a better place than oneself,

57
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,220
one doesn't think "I need to be in that place," but rather

58
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,350
one says "you should come down to the trenches I'm stuck in."

59
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,350
I'm sorry, but

60
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,030
I'm not going down there.
 Into those trenches you live in.

61
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,960
That hellish place where you live
 hating and being jealous of someone.

62
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,240
I won't do it.

63
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,320
So, don't wave to me asking me to

64
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,940
come down, come down.

65
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,420
 I have something I must say. Please call.

66
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,710
Hey, why don't you pick up your phone?

67
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,630
I don't need to pick it up.

68
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,440
Who is it?

69
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,350
A girl who follows me around, saying she likes me.

70
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,330
Hey! You got a text. Aren't you going to check it?

71
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,980
Forget it. it's so obvious.

72
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,150
Stuff like "I have something I must tell you," or "I ask that you call me," etc.

73
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,180
Ai, so annoying.

74
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,100
Why did you hit me?

75
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,960
She could really have something to say!
 Is it that hard to pick up one call?

76
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,830
You can't even answer her text? You can't
 think of how the person waiting would feel, right?

77
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,010
Annoying? Did someone tell you to 
save the country or someone's life?

78
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,320
One call, one text message, is it that ha-

79
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,060
What is she saying?

80
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,010
 I have something to say. Please call me.

81
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,560
 He's right next to you.

82
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,010
 I'm saying, why don't you recognize him?

83
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,130
What exactly did she want to say?

84
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,110
No. I'm not curious.

85
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,680
If I get curious, that means I lose.

86
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,310
 The number you have called cannot be reached.

87
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,180
Mr. Do Min Joon!

88
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,280
Mr. Do Min Joon!

89
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,650
Mr. Do Min Joon.

90
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,210
 Do Min Joon!

91
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,780
 Do Min Joon!

92
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,260
 Mr. Do Min Joon!

93
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,990
 Don't go!

94
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,110
Min Joon.

95
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,390
Mr. Do Min Joon! Mr. Do Min Joon!

96
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,640
Mr. Do Min Hoon, what happened to you? What happen-

97
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,210
Are you okay? Are you okay?

98
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,490
Let's go to the hospital.
 Let's go to the hospital, okay?  I can quickly...

99
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,910
Cheon Song Yi . . .

100
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,510
Yeah?

101
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,200
You can't, don't call them.

102
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,460
I can't go to the hospital.

103
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,810
I can't go.

104
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,130
Why?

105
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,690
Why can't you?

106
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,150
Why? No, you'll die like this. You could-

107
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,540
Mr. Do Min Joon! Mr. Do Min Joon! 
Come back to your senses!

108
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,940
Mr. Do Min Joon, what am I supposed to-

109
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,870
  My Love From The Star
Episode 12

110
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,070
Are you saying we can leave him like this?

111
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,250
We only stopped the bleeding.
 We should go to the hospital. . .

112
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,590
Thank you for not calling the ambulance.

113
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,480
It must have been hard not to.

114
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,850
Why should we not do that?

115
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,740
Anyway,

116
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,380
he won't. . . die. . .

117
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,570
He will be okay, right?

118
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,230
Well, I'm not sure.

119
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,250
He should've just left it alone.

120
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,740
If he did that, this wouldn't have happened.

121
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,690
Pardon? Leave what alone?

122
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,090
I will stay here, so,

123
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,800
Ms. Cheon Song Yi, you can go now.

124
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,080
No. I will stay here, too.

125
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,160
I will wait and see him wake up.

126
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,880
No, it's okay, since I'm here.

127
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,140
- But. . .
-- And,

128
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,930
from a while ago,

129
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,510
I've thought whether I should tell you this or not.

130
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,870
My Min Joon is leaving soon.

131
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,780
Excuse me?

132
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,240
To where?

133
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,540
There's less than 2 months left now.

134
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,280
Where is he going?

135
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,480
Far from here?

136
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,400
A foreign country?

137
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,690
Anyway, for both of you, 
there's no good in

138
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,780
getting attached to someone 
who's leaving soon, don't you think?

139
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,560
If you have feelings for him,

140
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,300
please take care of them now.

141
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,200
Please go now.

You can review it and send it back, once you've put your seal on it.

152
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,620
Our seal is already on it.

153
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,800
Yes, I will do that.

Ah, excuse me.

156
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,640
Yes.

157
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,680
I understand.

158
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,180
I guess there's something you should take care of.

159
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,820
Ah. . .

160
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,250
Yes.

161
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,610
I volunteer at an abandoned dogs center sometimes.

162
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,960
A fierce dog, which was supposed to get euthanized,

163
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,140
escaped, I hear.

164
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,410
Oh my, dear.
 Isn't it dangerous?

165
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,150
Yes.

166
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,630
We should catch him soon and 
take care of the matter.

167
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,020
Anyway, don't worry about Ms. Cheon Song Yi from now on.

168
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,210
Our group will do our best to make her come back

169
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,970
and rise to the top again.

170
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,450
This USB has digital rights management (DRM-copy protection)

171
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,100
so the danger of it having been leaked is nonexistent.

172
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,110
But, Do Min Joon.

173
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,950
How's his condition?

174
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,210
Are you sure he couldn't move?

175
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,210
I checked that he fell down 
and lost consciousness, but

176
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,210
I think he suddenly disappeared 
when the ambulance arrived.

177
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,080
Go.

178
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,970
I'm back.

179
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,400
Oh, yeah. You're late.

180
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,380
Are you going somewhere?

181
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,630
After  eating, I couldn't digest.

182
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,160
Your mom and I are going to the park for a walk.

183
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,050
You must be tired. Go in and rest.

184
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,650
Yes.

185
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,690
Let's go.

186
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,880
Are you having a nice dream or something?

187
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,920
 I dreamed a happy dream.

188
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,170
 Wake up.

189
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,420
 Hurry and get up.

190
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,670
 Why are you standing over there? 
I said, If you go sit and wait, I will prepare the meal for you.

191
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,170
 - Can't I do it? 
-- You can't.

192
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,920
 I have a fantasy in aprons, you know.

193
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,960
 Honey, you just need to eat my food deliciously,

194
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,460
 regardless of how it tastes, okay?

195
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,590
 Should I get it?

196
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,170
 Those bastards who would go and sit at the Beotigogae.

197
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,150
 Those things are all useless.

198
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,320
 No. That's a rare combination.

199
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,460
 Not only is it 1+1, but they also give you a frying pan.

200
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,260
 I told you not to get lured by 1+1 or free gifts.

201
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,250
 Just eat this.

202
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,750
 Give it to me!

203
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,150
 Not much time left, come on!

204
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,440
♫  I love you

205
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,280
♫  I need you.

206
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,680
♫  Those words I want to say to you,

207
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,050
♫  Those words that make my heart beat.  ♫

208
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,330
♫   I love you

209
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,550
♫  I need you.

210
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,990
♫  Even if I'm somewhere else,  ♫

211
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,980
♫  I'll forever only look at you.

212
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,530
 When we go home, shall we buy ice cream?

213
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,380
 You'll get fat.

214
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,740
 I've put on weight, right? 
I have, haven't I?

215
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,740
 Tell me honestly. I have, haven't I?

216
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,560
 You have a little one inside your belly. 
Of course, you've gained weight. Why wouldn't you?

217
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,820
 I'm ruined!

218
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,320
 You're not. You're prettier when you gain weight.

219
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,620

220
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,440
 And I realized.

221
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,390
 That a happy dream makes me feel even more miserable

222
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,970
 when I wake up. . .

223
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,740
 In the first place,

224
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,210
 I should have not dreamed a happy dream.

225
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,450
You...

226
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,020
What are you doing here?

227
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,550
I asked what you're doing here?

228
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,860
 But, Do Min Joon. How was his condition?

229
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,610
 Are you certain he couldn't move?

230
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,210
 I checked that he fell down 
and lost consciousness, but

231
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,970
 when the ambulance came, he suddenly disappeared.

232
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,510
Did something happen

233
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,300
to Do Min Joon?

234
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,090
How do you know?

235
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,740
How did you find out?

236
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,740
Anyone could tell if they saw you right now.

237
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,130
Come here.

238
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,470
Why are you here like this?

239
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,080
What happened?

240
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,350
I don't know either.

241
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,380
But, don't tell anyone.

242
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,020
Why not?

243
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,790
Seeing as he won't go to the hospital,

244
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,440
there must have been some sort of reason.

245
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,290
Oh my!

246
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,980
-Hui Kyeong is here, too! 
-Hello.

247
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,940
As a matter of fact, I was planning to call you.

248
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,160
Thank you.

249
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,530
-For what?
- I heard everything from your brother.

250
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,280
That he will set up a one-person agency for our Song Yi.

251
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,480
Sorry?
-Didn't he tell you?

252
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,700
 Protect Cheon Song Yi from your brother.

253
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,360
What are you talking about?

254
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,680
I met Managing Director last night.

255
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,340
- Jae Kyeong Oppa?
-Yes.

256
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,200
Managing Director Lee Jae Kyeong told me that 
he would do his best to make you have a comeback.

257
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,060
He said that he would take care of you personally.

258
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,380
You should be so thankful.

259
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,470
What, you didn't know?

260
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,260
Wasn't it you, my Son-in-law Lee, 
that asked him to do so?

261
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,870
It's something I didn't know of.

262
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,210
Really?

263
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,550
Anyway, he's even prepared the contract.

264
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,830

265
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,700
Yes, just sign there.

266
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,670
Mom.

267
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,720
I'm not doing it.

268
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,350
Hui Kyeong.

269
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,210
There Song Yi goes again. 
You should talk to her, okay?

270
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,740
It was inconsiderate of my brother to do this 
without asking Song Yi first.

271
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,520
If you don't want to, you don't have to.
Don't worry about it.

272
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,260
Yeah, thanks.

273
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,280
I'm from Yeongdeungpo.

274
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,730
Is Mr Do Min Joon inside?

275
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,100
I have few things I must ask him regarding 
Prosecutor Yoo Seok's attack incident of late.

276
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,480
Ah, but Mr. Do Min Joon is not in such 
a condition where he can be investigated.

277
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,240
-I'm just going to ask him a few simple questions.
-Even so...

278
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,420
It was Mr. Do Min Joon 
who planned to meet Prosecutor Yoo that day.

279
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,570
He went there and got attacked.

280
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,860
If you avoid the investigation like this, 
he will buy himself suspicions.

281
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,630
Right now, you want to investigate Mr. Do Min Joon 
as a reference witness, right?

282
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,440
But you sound like you're investigating him 
assuming he's a suspect.

283
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,730
It's not like that.

284
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,390
An investigation on a reference witness
should have inquiry or probing as the first step.

285
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:55,170
Barging in like this without once having called (to notify),
you realize that you're in violation of the rule, don't you?

286
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,800
In addition,

287
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,700
doing this when there is not any kind of evidence that

288
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,560
Mr. Do Min Joon could be a suspect in the case.

289
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,890
It also violates the presumption of innocence. 
(innocent until proven guilty)

290
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,680
If you want to investigate, 
get the warrant and come back.

291
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,480
By the way, who are you?

292
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,080
I'm Mr. Do Min Joon's attorney.

293
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,010
If you have something to say to him, 
please do so through me.

294
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,400
Hello, the call wouldn't connect.

295
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,150
I know it's rude but. . .

296
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:56,160
You must have had a hard time
 because of Han Yoo Ra's case, right?

297
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,820
I've already submitted a written statement about that case.

298
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,210
Ah, I didn't come here today for that.

299
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,680
Well...Mr. Do Min Joon who lives next door...

300
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,420
I know that you two are quite close.
Well, by chance,

301
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,820
did you see Mr. Do Min Joon on the cruise boat
 on the day of the incident?

302
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,870
How could Mr. Do Min Joon have been there
 when you needed an invitation to enter-

303
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,260
Why?

304
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,900
Perhaps, did you see him?

305
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,890
I've already told you.

306
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,990
That there's no way he could have been there.

307
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,700
Right.

308
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:50,230
Is there anything strange 
about Mr. Do Min Joon on daily basis?

309
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,250
No, not at all.

310
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,690
Then, do you know anything about the relationship between 
Mr. Do Min Joon and Ms. Han Yoo Ra, by any chance?

311
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,060
What are you talking about?

312
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:05,200
Ah, well. . . 
It seems like Ms. Han Yoo Ra was seeing someone.

313
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,920
-I was thinking, maybe she was seeing Do Min Joon...
-No, she wasn't!

314
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,310
It's not him?

315
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:16,010
They didn't even know each other. 
What are you talking about, right now?

316
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,820
Then, perhaps, is there another man that you know of?

317
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,230
What are you doing?

318
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,030
I was waiting for you, Hyung.

319
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,500
Is that so? What?

320
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,970
Do you have something to say?

321
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,540
Hyung,

322
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,240
you met Song Yi's mother?

323
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,630
Yes.

324
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,450
I heard you asked of Father

325
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,650
to set up a one-person agency.

326
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,060
- Dad said that it's not possib...
-It's something I can do.

327
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,110
But, Song Yi doesn't want to.

328
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,280
- She doesn't want to?
- No.

329
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,710
She doesn't accept any help without any reasons.

330
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,950
That's why, even though I got Father's permission,
 I was worried about how to tell her.

331
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,220
Anyway, thanks for caring.

332
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,820
Even so, ask her again.
 No, shall I meet her?

333
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,130
No.

334
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,410
She's stubborn. Once she says no, 
she never backs down.

335
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,970
Is that so?

336
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,680
Well, if she feels that way personally, then...

337
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,300
Yes. Rest up.

338
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,930
The man that Han Yoo Ra was secrety dating,

339
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,080
I know him.

340
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,070
I saw them talking.

341
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,560
You saw them?

342
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,030
What did you see?

343
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,260
 The people that I know,

344
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,170
 and the people that you know, came today.

345
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,730
 Look forward to it.

346
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,770
 What it is that I'm going to say to those people,

347
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:57,110
 I'm going to make a surprise announcement later.

348
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,610
 When they hear it, you too,

349
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,800
 will be surprised.

350
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,320
 Yoo Ra.

351
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,810
 Yes?

352
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,350
 How is your depression these days?

353
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,230
 My depression is up to you, Oppa.

354
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,970
 I stopped taking the drugs too, not long ago.

355
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,550
 You know that I like you, right?

356
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:25,210
 Take care of your health.

357
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:30,410
He said "Take care of your health."

358
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,540
It seems they had a good relationship.

359
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,240
Well, it probably was, seeing as they were dating.

360
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,550
Han Yoo Ra was dating

361
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,370
the heir of S&amp;C.

362
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,850
Thank you for the good information.

363
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,380
By the way, what sort of a relationship

364
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,500
do you have with Do Min Joon?

365
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,740
I'm not sure.

366
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,900
I don't know either, what sort of a relationship it is.

367
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,820
Huh?

368
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,150
Can you leave now? I'm rather tired.

369
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,690
 Yes, this is Haneul Mental Hospital.

370
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:28,430
 Jae Kyeong, see me once. Listen to what I have to say.

371
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,990
 I'm not crazy. The people here don't believe me!

372
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,630
 You can get me out!

373
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,820
By any chance, among the patients,

374
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,420
is there a person called Yang Min Joo?

375
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,970
 There's no one by that name.

376
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,390
Are you okay?

377
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,830
What time is it, right now?

378
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,470
It's nearly 12:00am.

379
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,440
Do you have any broken or painful spot?

380
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,320
Fortunately, it seems not.

381
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,280
I was seriously scared.

382
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,710
What on earth happened?

383
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,420
A car attacked me.

384
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,970
Why couldn't you block it?

385
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,500
I'm not too sure either.

386
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,270
It's the first time it's happened.

387
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,750
The condition of my body wasn't optimal, but

388
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,600
there's never been a situation in which

389
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,180
I couldn't do anything. 
However,

390
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,550
I couldn't do anything.

391
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,240
The feeling that my ability couldn't
 be used to control the situation...

392
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,240
Why it was suddenly like that.

393
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,140
By chance...

394
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:51,550
Could this be related to the fact that 
you've been feeling cold lately?

395
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,340
That could be.

396
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,010
As it is getting closer to the day of me leaving,

397
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,140
all the abilities I have may be

398
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,740
disappearing one by one.

399
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,320
This won't do, seriously.

400
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,330
I should step up.

401
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,940
I already told Cheon Song Yi

402
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,460
that you are leaving soon and she should be prepared.

403
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,940
- Lawyer Jang. 
- Yeah.

404
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,190
I've devoted half of my lifetime to protect you.

405
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,840
It's been the most meaningful thing in my life.

406
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,740
When you told me you were leaving soon...

407
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,240
Yeah...

408
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,430
Since I don't have to worry about

409
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,510
who will protect you after I die,

410
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,170
I thought it was rather a relief.

411
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:43,130
But you keep getting yourself involved in weird cases, 
and getting injured like this.

412
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,530
With this and that happening, 
your identity keeps getting revealed.

413
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,740
On top of that, if you're unsure whether or not your superpower, which you always counted on, would work or not,

414
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,540
I can't just sit and watch doing nothing, don't you think?

415
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,640
You told me once.

416
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,940
You have interfered in humans' matters, but

417
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,240
something meant to happen will happen no matter what.

418
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,730
And that something that was meant to become worse,
 did become worse.

419
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,540
About the girl who died 400 years ago. . .

420
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,770
You said that in the end, 
you couldn't protect her and let her die.

421
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,370
How did Cheon Song Yi's situation
 turn out after you intervened?

422
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,550
Did anything get better?

423
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,640
If you stay here and see her everyday,

424
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,520
it will be hard for you to move on.

425
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,640
Why don't you move out of this apartment?

426
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,360
You were going to sell this apartment anyway.

427
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,000
I helped take care of your identity, 
so I will also help take care of your heart.

428
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,440
What are you doing?

429
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,340
Is Do Min Joon okay?

430
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,540
Yes, he is okay.

431
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,110
Where are you going, Father?

432
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,310
If you're busy, should I stay next to 
Mr. Do Min Joon and take care of him?

433
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,290
Since I did it last time, I can do it well.

434
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,440
There is no need for that.

435
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,790
And right now,

436
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm going to put this apartment up for sale.

437
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,710
Excuse me?

438
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,640
Didn't I tell you that he is leaving soon?

439
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,440
So please, my Teach...

440
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,640
No... our Min Joon...

441
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,030
I would like it if you left him alone.

442
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,030
  The password is not right.

443
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,520
 The password is not right.

444
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,140
Do Min Joon.

445
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,040
Are you watching?

446
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,730
Are you watching?

447
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,900
Are you okay?

448
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,040
Are you really okay?

449
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,900
I had many things to ask, but

450
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,940
now I am not curious at all.

451
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,940
You opened your eyes, Do Min Joon.

452
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,650
You woke up now.

453
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,560
So, it's fine.

454
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,950
I miss you.

455
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,520
Wow, what kind of a bastard 
attacks an incumbent prosecutor?

456
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,020
There is nothing you can think of at all?

457
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,830
I got attacked as soon as I got of my car, so. . .

458
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,440
In the meantime, while you're here, 
I've investigated some.

459
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,870
So your incident happened right after these 
two trucks surrounded your car on both sides.

460
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,110
And these bastards clearly knew the CCTV blind spots

461
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:13,030
and did that. 
They also used stolen vehicles.

462
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,970
We found this at the crime scene.

463
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,290
Fountain pen.

464
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,440
Even though this is a limited edition, 
there's not a single suspect yet.

465
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,840
But...

466
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,300
What?

467
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,140
I've found a new fact.

468
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,640
I would like it if he stayed longer, but

469
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,820
I don't know why he doesn't listen to me.

470
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,240
Is it okay to get discharged?

471
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,210
There won't be a big trouble carrying out daily tasks.

472
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,450
But he should be careful of starting his work right away.

473
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,140
Don't you have a headache or some other symptoms?

474
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,360
No, I am okay.

475
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,320
Since you could get a headache or 
you could space out sometimes,

476
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,540
you should be careful of getting shocks 
or external injuries, in particular.

477
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,490
By the way.

478
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,980
What did you tell him that he 
wanted to get discharged suddenly?

479
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,240
Hmm I....

480
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,040
I talked about work.

481
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,300
You know our Prosecutor is very passionate.

482
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,240
I was wondering  who Yoo Se Mi
 takes after that she is so pretty...

483
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,900
She looks just like you.

484
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,270
So? He really got discharged?

485
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,210
His stubbornness, who can stop that?

486
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,770
Hey...

487
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,590
Thank you. I want to talk with my mother.

488
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,380
Yes, Unni.

489
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
I heard a little bit of their conversation, and

490
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,780
Han Yoo Ra...

491
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,620
I heard she didn't commit suicide.

492
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:47,890
There's circumstantial evidence that it's a murder,
 and there seems to be a suspect.

493
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,930
Who is it?

494
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,630
I don't know. I didn't hear that.

495
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,640
But you know, if Han Yoo Ra's death
 is declared as a murder, then...

496
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,100
what will happen to Song Yi?

497
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,540
How will I know that?

498
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,830
But it's true that

499
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:05,270
All of Song Yi's CF's were handed over to you, 
and you are so successful right now.

500
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:09,400
Honestly, I don't want her to make a comeback.

501
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,040
I liked the edited version of the scenario more.

502
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:23,150
Right? That tone would suit you better, Se Mi.

503
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,180
By the way, Director,....

504
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,070
Who would take the role named Bae Soo Ha?

505
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,020
Well that... I've been considering a
 number of actresses and contacting them.

506
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,130
That role, by chance,

507
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,420
can't Cheon Song Yi play that role?

508
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,850
Cheon Song Yi?

509
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,310
I thought she couldn't work yet
because of Han Yoo Ra's case, no?

510
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,140
Just keep it to yourself, Director.

511
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,210
I think that case may be resolved soon.

512
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,280
Oh yeah?

513
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,410
But would returning be easy for her? I mean,
 there's that image that an actress has to uphold.

514
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,140
So I want to help her.

515
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,740
Song Yi helped me a lot before.

516
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,590
Since this is my first time playing the main role in a movie,

517
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:07,870
I think I will be comfortable if Song Yi is next to me.

518
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,040
Wow. . . You are very loyal, Se Mi.

519
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,530
I will consider it.

520
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,910
But the person who always does
 the role of the main actress,

521
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:19,240
will she do the role of the main actress's friend?

522
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,000
Since she is my friend, won't she do it?

523
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,290
Well, I've done that for 15 years.

524
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,400
Ah, this house has a great interior.

525
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,990
At the south side of this house, the sunlight shines like-

526
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,240
Actress. Actress. Cheon Song Yi.

527
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,280
Cheon Song Yi lives right next door.

528
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,360
A lot of celebrities and financial figures
 live in this building, you know.

529
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,860
Anyway, this house was hurriedly put up
for sale which is why it's at this price, so

530
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:02,090
you should get this while it's out on the marketplace.

531
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,770
The father of this house owner 
said there would be someone here.

532
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,980
Perhaps, no one is home.

533
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,070
Excuse me.

534
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,670
Did you come here to look at 2302?

535
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,620
Aigo, yes, hello, Ms. Cheon.

536
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:21,500
This house owner's father put it up for sale.

537
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:29,250
Should I say this to someone who 
came to look around the apartment?

538
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,270
What do you mean?

539
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,940
This building lot is a bit. . .

540
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,740
Excuse me?

541
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,740
I think there's an underground water route.
 I can't fall asleep at night.

542
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,040
When I wake up in the morning, my whole body aches.

543
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,540
Cheon Song Yi,

544
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,310
how could you say like that?

545
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,620
Our family has been in this real estate business 
for 10 generations.

546
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,960
It's been known as a good housing lot 
since the Joseon era.

547
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,020
And, excuse me...

548
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,550
You all know, right? 
I, who used to be on top of the tops, hit rock bottom.

549
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,350
You know I've been all screwed up lately.

550
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,800
That's all because I moved to this building.

551
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,590
I haven't had any work since I moved into this house.

552
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,220
I lost my people, my money, and my health.

553
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,800
Well, the lot isn't that important.

554
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,520
He can't go to the hospital?

555
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,640
And a detective came to ask about him?

556
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,330
His father said that he's leaving soon.

557
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,220
And he wrote down in his diary,
 3 months left or something?

558
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,630
Now, 2 months left.

559
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,030
Who is that man?

560
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,240
That I can't say.

561
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,030
Whomever it is, you should give up.

562
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,100
No matter how we look at it, 
he seems like a criminal.

563
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,390
He isn't that kind of person.

564
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,840
Does a criminal walk around
written "I'm a criminal" over his face?

565
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,400
Why do you think he can't go to the hospital? 
He must be on the wanted list.

566
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,750
Why do you think a detective came?

567
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,200
There must be something fishy.

568
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,230
3 months? It could be the statue of limitations.

569
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,310
Aren't you supposed to report him to the police?

570
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,100
You can't!

571
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,810
If you hide a criminal. . . What is it called?

572
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,900
If you hide a criminal. . . What is it called?

573
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,720
You can get charged for harboring a criminal.

574
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,310
I searched the internet, anyway,

575
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,010
if you are married to each other,
 there won't be any penalty.

576
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,410
So, you want to register your marriage
 so you won't get any penalty?

577
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,570
Would it be really strange?

578
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,830
Is it only strange?

579
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,490
Why are you being like this? You are Cheon Song Yi.

580
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,550
No matter how much you  like
 that person, maintain your pride.

581
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,110
 ♫ Destiny.

582
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:41,660
 ♫ You are my destiny.

583
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,810
Who's that good-looking cutie?

584
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,510
What cutie? He's my little brother.

585
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,270
Really?

586
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,320
You look at that face every morning and night?

587
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,370
You lucky bitch.

588
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,130
Who is that?

589
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,440
I thought you wouldn't eat dinner.

590
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,560
Whoa, who's this golden ratio,
 good-looking man before flowers?

591
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,590
Why are you like that? You know him, Hui Kyeong.

592
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,150
Hui Kyeong?

593
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,220
That Hui Kyeong from the past grew up this well?

594
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,500
Don't you know me? Hong Bok Ja.

595
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,200
No, I don't.

596
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,350
Why, I sat next to you in the second year of middle school.

597
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,830
I guess you don't remember.

598
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:01,110
Because I passed the line, you 
elbowed my philtrum, so I cried a lot.

599
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:01,870
I did?

600
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:07,290
And because your mom tried to block the aftermath, 
she bought all sorts of school materials.

601
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,680
Oh, that happened.

602
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,110
I am sorry.

603
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,000
I see that it's only been a memory of my own.

604
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,100
Why is your face so drawn?

605
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,940
You didn't eat today either, right?

606
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,070
You like sushi from this house, right?

607
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,410
Here.

608
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,380
Blessed bitch.

609
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,330
But, why did you come here?

610
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,260
We are investigating because of Han Yoo Ra's accident.

611
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:40,960
After the investigation, we learned you
 were in a relationship with Han Yoo Ra.

612
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,920
What? Me?

613
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,450
Who said such a thing?

614
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:49,540
That, I can't tell.

615
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:54,200
There was someone who saw Han Yoo Ra
 and Lee Jae Kyeong talking.

616
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,450
What happened that day, can you tell us?

617
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,410
 Why? Did Oppa call for me?

618
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,950
 Yes.

619
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,260
 Where?

620
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,980
 What is this?

621
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,620
 When did you prepare all this?

622
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,560
 I told you.

623
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:34,250
 I like you way more than you think.

624
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:39,690
 So, because of you, I can endure something cumbersome.

625
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:45,980
 You are not doing this because you are afraid 
I am going to say something to other people, right?

626
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,970
 That's right.

627
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,250
 I can't drink right now.

628
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,400
 It's non-alcoholic. I wanted to set the mood,
 for the first time in a while.

629
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,110
 You don't like?

630
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,710
 Fireworks are starting at 12, right?

631
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,030
 They're going to start soon.

632
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,570
 Why are you looking at me that way?

633
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,440
 So that I can see you a lot when I can.

634
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,810
 What?

635
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,860
 To be honest, there are a lot of times 
when I can't understand.

636
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:35,390
 You can be this kind and sweet,

637
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:39,540
 but why did your past wife do that?

638
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,070
 That's why she's getting punished by you.

639
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,890
 She's worthy of all the punishment.

640
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,970
 Don't you worry. I will never...

641
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,400
 betray you at all.

642
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,020
 Okay.

643
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,090
 You won't be able to betray me.

644
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,440
 I...

645
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,200
 know.

646
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,720
 But, Oppa.

647
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,010
 Is this non-alcoholic?

648
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,930
 Why do I feel like I am getting drunk?

649
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,710
 You're not getting drunk, but getting paralyzed.

650
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,260
 What?

651
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:28,410
 You will soon lose strength in your hands and legs,
 so you won't be able to walk.

652
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,940
 Your breaths will get short, 
and your tongue will become numb.

653
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,660
 And you'll eventually fall asleep.

654
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,910
 It's made of the same components
 as the sleeping pills that you take.

655
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:44,280
 Even if it's detected later, 
people will think that you took it.

656
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:50,540
 So, you will be one of the many
 celebrities who killed themselves.

657
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:57,560
 Oppa. You.. Are.. Kidding.... Right?

658
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,090
 I don't kid around.

659
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:15,590
 So, why'd you do it? I wanted to see you for a long time.

660
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,760
I don't know what you have heard from anyone else,

661
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,310
but I wasn't in a relationship with Han Yoo Ra.

662
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:43,280
Because she was the model
 for our shopping center for a long time,

663
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,350
we just knew each other.

664
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:48,950
From this season, we decided to switch our model.

665
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:53,340
And that day, I told her that.

666
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,810
There weren't any arguments, as you say.

667
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:03,560
Oh, what to do? I have plans for dinner.

668
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,110
It was surprising.

669
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,860
I never thought you would contact me first.

670
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,700
It's facinating to see you so well.

671
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,550
What are you, exactly?

672
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:27,010
I have an offer.

673
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:31,960
I will do what you want.

674
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:38,660
I will take every blame, and disappear.

675
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,420
I will do that.

676
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:47,410
Then, are you going to stop now?

677
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,240
Is he home, or not?

678
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:07,180
I feel like I can cross over.

679
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,900
Let's not look down.

680
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,770
Damn it.

681
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,500
Do Min Joon?

682
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,190
 Where are you?

683
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,840
Where?

684
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,130
In order to see you, I am risking my life...

685
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,740
 What?

686
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:55,270
In any case, the situation is life threatening, but talk.

687
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,820
 Do you want to meet for a moment?

688
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,600
Did you say "let's meet up"? 
   Call. (Sure)

689
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,710
Meet..let's meet.

690
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,750
What is this? He didn't open the door for me.

691
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:01,710
If you don't open it for me, I can just open it. 
 It isn't like I don't have a hand.

692
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,860
Are you really okay?

693
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,630
Your rate of recovery is really impressive.

694
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,950
But where are we going?

695
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,720
Didn't you say you have something you want to ask me?

696
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,750
Yeah, I had something.

697
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,650
Didn't I tell you that I am not curious?

698
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,180
Why?

699
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,900
It doesn't matter anymore.

700
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,890
It doesn't matter.

701
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:30,840
Regardless of who you are or

702
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,970
what happened before

703
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,770
or whether you are in a situation
 that you can't talk about,

704
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:40,390
it doesn't matter. Seriously.

705
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,750
Since you opened your eyes,

706
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,960
woke up,

707
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,500
and now you are by my side,

708
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,440
it is okay. Seriously.

709
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,870
But where are we really going?

710
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:01,140
Since you don't tell me, I feel more excited.

711
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,650
This is a date, right?

712
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,220
  Won't you feel more comfortable thinking
 that this wasn't meant to be from the beginning?

713
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:12,960
  I...

714
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,940
  Why do I have to do that?

715
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,840
  The time I have left to see that woman ...

716
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,410
  There's less than 2 months left.

717
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,520
  I like her.

718
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,520
  I am saying I like her.

719
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,510
  I...

720
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,530
 like that woman.

721
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,090
Do Min Joon.

722
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:52,360
After 2 months,

723
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,400
where are you going?

724
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,450
Are you going far?

725
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,410
Europe?

726
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,210
You know...

727
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,970
I don't care if it's a long distance relationship.

728
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:10,420
The foreign atmosphere surprisingly works well with me, so when I travel for photo shoots and whatnot,

729
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,970
I was fine for a few months at a time, 
as long as I had gochujang (red pepper paste) and kimchi.

730
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,720
So, by chance, if you're pushing me away

731
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,620
just because you have to go somewhere. . .

732
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,710
it would be nice if you didn't do that.

733
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,610
That's all I'm saying.

734
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,350
  I would like it even if it is for 2 months,

735
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,820
  or one month.

736
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,720
  I just want to be together with her.

737
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,490
  While doing that, if I can't leave,

738
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,760
 as you said, Lawyer Jang,

739
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,680
 and die in this world,

740
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,380
 as long as I don't have to wake up

741
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,260
 from this happy dream,

742
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,160
 I...

743
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,650
 want to do that.

744
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,390
 Can I really not do that?

745
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:29,350
 Is that not possible?

746
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:36,600
But by chance, you aren't a wanted criminal, right?

747
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:42,770
You know, I might get suspected of harboring a criminal. 
We can't just register our marriage out of the blue.

748
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,340
It's not like the statute of limitations, right?

749
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,780
Omo!

750
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,960
You got something on your coat.

751
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,740
Did the employees here get off 
from work without closing the door?

752
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,330
How did the door open earlier?

753
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,320
We aren't going anywhere to eat dinner?

754
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,910
I am hungry because I didn't eat anything.

755
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,830
Hui Kyeong bought me sushi, but 
I couldn't eat it because I didn't have an appetite.

756
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,430
Cheon Song Yi,

757
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:13,200
I warned you

758
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,470
not to trust me, right?

759
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,690
I asked you to meet in order to 
tell you what kind of secrets

760
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:23,810
the guy, who you foolishly trusted, has.

761
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,270
It is okay not to tell me.

762
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,840
If it is the secret you have to tell with such a scary face,

763
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,820
I don't want to know.

764
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,160
Aren't you curious

765
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:41,110
about who saved you

766
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,330
12 years ago?

767
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,990
At that time, the person who saved you

768
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,830
was me.

769
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:54,780
There were no other reasons to save you.

770
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,210
At that time, you...

771
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,850
looked like the girl from 400 years ago,

772
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,760
the owner of this hair pin, that girl...

773
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,850
Because you looked like her.

774
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,470
To the point I was confused momentarily,

775
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,890
you look very much like her.

776
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:17,780
What are you saying now?

777
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,610
The owner of the hair pin 400 years ago...

778
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:26,560
How did you know the face of the person who lived then?

779
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,370
So you are saying

780
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,090
you've lived all 400 years?

781
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,860
That's right.

782
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,020
400 years ago

783
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,120
I came from an alien planet to here.

784
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,110
I couldn't go back to where I used to live.

785
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,310
I've lived in this world for 400 years.

786
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,810
Do Min Joon, let's go home.

787
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:59,520
My Do Min Joon is still very ill.

788
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,810
Didn't you say it doesn't matter,

789
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,820
regardless of who I am?

790
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,740
I am this kind of person.

791
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,490
Does it still

792
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,740
not matter?

793
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:48,350

794
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,720
 Now, when the day for me to leave is drawing near. . .

795
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:59,990
  How do I feel?

796
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,350
  I am not sure.
