1
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,440
One, two, three!

2
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,790
Yeah, why, is there something?

3
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,820
Seriously?

4
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,720
Did she die?

5
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,310
Holy smokes!

6
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,640
 Breaking News: Actress Cheon Song Yi 
falls during filming, her life in danger

7
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,290
 Has he gone crazy?

8
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,020
 He has gone crazy.

9
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,170
 Breaking News: Actress Cheon Song Yi 
falls during filming, critical condition.

10
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,740
What's the matter? By now...

11
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,510
Shouldn't you be meeting with a prosecutor about now?

12
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,420
If you're complying with our agreement?

13
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,780
What do you think I will do to you?

14
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,160
I am going to kill you.

15
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,220
Me? You will?

16
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,660
You dare?

17
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,560
That's right.

18
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,560
I will kill you. Now.

19
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,760
Just as you did to Cheon Song Yi,

20
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,780
I will kill you with the same method.

21
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,450
Die!

22
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800

23
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,600
 My Love From the Star
 Episode 14

24
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,850
 A week before the incident

25
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,280
I am sorry. Are you alright?

26
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,350
Yes, I am fine.

27
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,860
Thank you.

28
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,420
Perhaps, can't you erase memories?

29
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,740
Excuse me? Erase what memories?

30
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,330
If you watch movies,
 there was something like that, why...

31
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,130
When aliens press something like a button,
 people's memories all

32
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,710
get erased, something like that.
 Can't you do something like that?

33
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,640
That's a movie, isn't it?

34
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,980
 You have the ability to stop time and you have psychokinesis...

35
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,270
 For someone who can do most anything,
 why can't you do that?

36
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,290
 -You really don't have that ability? 
 -No I don't.

37
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,280
 True, now, you don't know when the powers
 you do have might disappear either.

38
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,960
 When they work, they work, and when they don't, they don't.

39
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,090
 Now, well, it's just the luck of the draw, 
even your supernatural powers.

40
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,690
 Since it's unnerving, what do we do?

41
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,650
I'm wondering if the only thing I can do

42
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,740
is to disappear well.

43
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,980
Because there is nothing I can do here anymore.

44
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,560
 Do the things that I am able to do (for her).

45
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,520
 What is that you can do (for her) now?

46
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,540
By chance,

47
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,320
you are not thinking of that, are you?

48
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,290
That, you can't do.

49
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,520
If you use your abilities to kill someone, then...

50
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,180
Was that it?

51
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,230
It was something like that?

52
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,660
There was something like that?

53
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,030
I think I need to meet Do Min Joon.

54
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,070
I have considered the offer you made.

55
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,150
You said you would take the blame
 for everything and disappear for me.

56
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,510
I figured I'd have nothing to lose.

57
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,230
Honestly, I've been gradually becoming annoyed with this as well.

58
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,860
If you'll just keep your promise,

59
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,430
I don't have any reason to go further than this.

60
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,850
I'm someone who has many things to lose.

61
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,940
If

62
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,290
you break the promise...

63
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,420
I know that you are a special person.

64
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,600
You've shown me many times, haven't you?

65
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,700
I've even tried to get rid of you somehow.

66
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,510
But I also know well that that won't happen.

67
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
If I bother you pointlessly,

68
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,830
I know full well that it will cause me unnecessary hardship,

69
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,900
so why would I? I am not that foolish.

70
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,480
If you break your promise

71
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,110
I will get rid of you myself.

72
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,730
That I'm someone who can do that,

73
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,150
as you said, you should know well 
since I showed it to you many times.

74
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,300
Yes, I know it well.

75
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,270
You know, about what Hui Kyeong mentioned before...

76
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,000
You know about Jae Kyeong 's wife...

77
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,080
Have you, by any chance, heard anything about her?

78
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,350
How would I know?

79
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,540
It's because there's something that she told me 
 before their divorce that still bothers me.

80
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,640
She told me

81
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,660
that Jae Kyeong is scary.

82
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,150
She asked me to save her.

83
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,220
You give them an inch and they take a mile.
I took in a girl who was basically an orphan,

84
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,570
and made her my daughter-in-law.

85
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,580
But she shook off all that was offered and ran away.
And now what?!

86
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,340
How dare she say he scares her!

87
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,770
But don't you feel that way as well?

88
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,930
Even though he's someone that I gave birth to,

89
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,700
I find Jae Kyeong  a little difficult.

90
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,240
There's not a single fault in him.

91
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,920
But somehow, unlike with Hui Kyeong, 
 I get very cautious around him.

92
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,770
That's why, he's my successor.

93
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,590
That rascal was born with the inclination to be a top honcho.

94
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,170
He's different from Hui Kyeong.

95
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,700
What happened to him when he was young 
 still bothers me, and--

96
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,520
Why are you bringing up such an ancient story?

97
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,670
Didn't I tell you never to mention it?

98
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,690
- I'm home.
- Ah, you're here.

99
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,740
Yes.

100
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,440
- Please rest.
- Alright.

101
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,150
I was thinking about visiting oldest brother's grave
next weekend, would you have time to accompany me?

102
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,740
Yes, let's go together next weekend.

103
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,140

104
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,120
  3 days prior to the incident.
Haneul Mental Hospital

105
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,300
Are there any patients with the name of Yang Min Joo?

106
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,430
There's no one like that here.

107
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,680
How many patients are there in this hospital?

108
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,540
What? 
 Why do you want to know that?

109
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,730
It's just that this seems like a pretty big hospital.

110
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,200
Despite that, you can say immediately after hearing the name, that there isn't such a person here without looking it up.

111
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,380
You must be very smart.

112
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

113
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,730
Anyway, there's no one like that here, 
 so please go back.

114
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,750
Oh, I see.

115
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,170
Okay.

116
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,500
 2 days before the incident.

117
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,800
You heard the news, right?  That our Se Mi
 and Song Yi will be working on the same movie.

118
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,760
Ah yes, Mother. I heard our Se Mi here 
strongly recommended Song Yi...

119
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,100
Yeah, she's like that. 
 She's so kind that it's killing me, CEO.

120
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,690
Even after being treated like that by Song Yi,

121
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,160
I don't understand how she can be like this.

122
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:36,000
No. Song Yi, in the past, had also persistently
 insisted  that she acted with Se Mi.

123
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,450
When the director said that it won't work out, 
 she said that if Se Mi didn't do it, then she wouldn't either!

124
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,140
She always made such a huge fuss about it
 that it annoyed the hell out of-

125
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,190
It's all in the past.

126
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,810
As it were, pay close attention to it, please, President.

127
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,090
Of course. 
 I'm taking care of her a lot even now.

128
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,530
Also, please send more of Se Mi's staff to the scene.

129
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,360
So that everyone can tell she's the main character.

130
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,730
And so that there would be a huge difference 
 between her and Cheon Song Yi.

131
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,560
Mom.

132
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,210
And, I'll say this as the topic came up.

133
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,020
What?

134
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,370
"The 2nd Cheon Song Yi" or something, 
 don't let there be news like that anymore.

135
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,630
Uttering "insurgence of supporting actor" or whatnot.

136
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,280
Mom, stop it.

137
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,500
He probably understands already.

138
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,740
We have good news.

139
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,050
The billboard ad

140
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,880
that our Se Mi has been longing to do,

141
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,990
we've got it!

142
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,140
Really?

143
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,740
When I checked with his company, the summer vacation
 Managing Director Lee Jae Kyeong took

144
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,190
was from July 24th to July 27th.

145
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,070
The cell phone base station used at that time was 
confirmed as the one in Cheong Pyeong.

146
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,220
However,

147
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,960
on Han Yoo Ra's side,

148
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,580
from July 24th

149
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,850
to the 27th.

150
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,630
Also Cheong Pyeong!

151
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,290
They found out about the vacation home in Cheong Pyeong.

152
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,660
I think you must take precautions.

153
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,130
  One day before the incident.

154
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,290
- We can look around, right? 
- Yes.

155
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,800
This is the private villa of Lee Jae Kyeong. 
 He rarely comes here.

156
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,080
Well... He spent his vacation here last summer.

157
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,120
If you go down 2 kilometers from here, 
 his family villa, owned by the Chairman, is there.

158
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,760
He spent his summer vacation over there.

159
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,460
Then who usually comes here?

160
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,370
Either foreign buyers the Managing Director invites or

161
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,450
his personal guests have stayed at this place.

162
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,590
Did Actress Han Yoo Ra ever come here before?

163
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,310
Yes. She came last summer.

164
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,680
I heard that because she was the department store's model
that the Director let her use it.

165
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,980
She came with some man.

166
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,120
Is this him?

167
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,770
Yes. It is.

168
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,740
Your memory is really great.

169
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,000
You can remember someone you  
 saw last year so quickly.

170
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,640
I think I must have contracted some kind of disease from you.

171
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,930
What?

172
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,520
Everything fits so perfectly, but

173
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,700
why is it so weird?

174
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,270
Why does it seem like Do Min Joon isn't the one?

175
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,750
Actually, Do Min Joon is going to come tomorrow.

176
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,200
Where? Why?

177
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,470
He says he will... turn himself in.

178
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,950
I see...

179
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,040
What?

180
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,190
Really...

181
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,660
He's a  really  strange person.

182
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,930
When the time never ended for me 
no matter how much time passed by,

183
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,290
I never once thought of that time

184
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,510
to be precious.

185
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,120
However,

186
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,720
now, if I could gain even a single day to be with her,

187
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,940
I don't believe I'd care even if I lost everything I have.

188
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,830
But...

189
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,300
Even if I throw away everything I have,

190
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,030
I now know the fact

191
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,440
that I cannot gain that.

192
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,490
What gives?

193
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,540
Could there be nights when so many stars 
can appear in the Seoul sky?

194
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,090
Do Min Joon...

195
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,720
Did you really come from one of the stars

196
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,940
from up there?

197
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,980
 Why didn't you just say you don't like me and be done with it?

198
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,420
 Why did you say things like how you

199
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,230
 came from the stars and such, that

200
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,140
 I would  be forced to think about you

201
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,080
 every time I look at the night sky?

202
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,160
 And I

203
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,990
 know this, too.

204
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,480
 When you start to love someone,

205
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,610
 you also start to have fears.

206
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,650
 Because I might not be able to protect someone I need to protect,

207
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,370
 I'm afraid right now.

208
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,770
 The day of the incident.

209
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,070

210
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,260
Yes, hello?

211
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,640
 This is the movie 'Witness' team.

212
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,700
Ah, yes. I'm almost ready. I was about to leave.

213
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,990
 The director wants you to come without any make-up.

214
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,770
 You know, it's an action scene. . .

215
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,390
Of course I won't. Do you think I would?

216
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,610
I won't.

217
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,610
Hey. Why are you looking like that?

218
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,200
You said you were going to put make-up on yourself. 
It won't do. Let's stop by a (beauty) shop.

219
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,680
It's fine. I'm going to be jumping down
and running in the mud anyway.

220
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,010
What good is putting make-up on? Just go.

221
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,880
What about the car?

222
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,370
I can drive.

223
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,350
It won't look good, though.

224
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,800
I mean, what's up with Manager Do?

225
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,570
Oh, Manager Do. I'm glad to see you.

226
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,700
- You don't work for Song Yi anymore-
-- He doesn't.

227
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,270
He doesn't?

228
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,490
Can I take the elevator first?

229
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,210
I think it will be uncomfortable for both of us 
to take the same elevator.

230
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,130
Hey, why are you like that? Did you two fight?

231
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,240
Should I talk to him later?

232
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,240
This won't do. I'll call him and set it straight.

233
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,570
Mom. . .

234
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,140
What?

235
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,780
If you bother him,

236
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,070
I will just go live with him.

237
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,640
What?

238
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,100
I like him a lot.

239
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,080
So I confessed to him, but was rejected.

240
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,840
Are you crazy?

241
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,620
When there's Hui Kyeong. . .

242
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,090
I know.

243
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,320
It is hard for me to take care of my feelings, so. . .

244
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,280
Hey.

245
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,700
Are you crying?

246
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,930
You are, because of a man, crying?

247
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,750
Yeah.

248
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,880
 I'm crying.

249
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,850
 Because of a man, I'm crying pathetically.

250
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,090
 So, don't bother him.

251
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,400
Just now, I wanted to cling onto him,
 but barely held it in.

252
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,950
 You are crazy.

253
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,280
Yeah.

254
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,310
I'm crazy.

255
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,830
 Prosecution Service

256
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,540
Are you crazy?

257
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,980
Why? Why do you think like that?

258
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,600
Otherwise,

259
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,570
I have to kill Lee Jae Kyeong.

260
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,800
Whether I kill him or stop him,
 it's one or the other.

261
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,810
If I don't, Cheon Song Yi could die.

262
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,600
Cheon Song Yi told the detective

263
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,450
about the relationship between
 Lee Jae Kyeong and Han Yoo Ra.

264
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,640
There's no time.

265
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,600
 Prosecution Service

266
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,920
Then, promise me just one thing.

267
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,300
You won't ever do it.

268
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,950
Because of an inhuman bastard like him. . . 
I can't let it happen.

269
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,560
Promise me.

270
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,170
At least promise me!

271
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:37,190
I told you to ignore the matter and move on, 
but you won't listen to me!

272
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,480
I told you to spend the remaining time here in peace,
but you won't listen!

273
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,250
Then promise me this one thing.

274
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,380
I promise.

275
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,180
You have promised then.

276
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,380
Seriously, if you break this promise...

277
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,710
Then I seriously won't see you again!

278
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,330
From this point on, this conversation is recorded.

279
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,470
Do you agree with this?

280
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,260
Yes, I agree.

281
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,270
Let's start.

282
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,200
On the day of Ms. Han Yoo Ra's death,

283
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,950
The person in the picture from the cruise

284
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,850
is me.

285
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,120
Please continue.

286
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,840
Mr. Beom.
- Yes?

287
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,080
I have to learn my lines. Would you practice with me?

288
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,760
Now?

289
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,490
Mm. Don't want to?

290
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,210
No! Which scene?

291
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,130
Scene 17.

292
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,160
"You should let me go. The detectives will be here soon."

293
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,440
"Shut that mouth of yours."

294
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,620
"I loved you."

295
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,360
"Love? You didn't love me."

296
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,780
"You loved my decent face and wealth."

297
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,690
"But..."

298
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,480
"I will hear such excuses in hell."

299
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,620
"Bye.  Zài jiàn." ("Bye" in Chinese)

300
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,480
POW!

301
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,690
Where is "Bye. Zài jiàn."?

302
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,420
Ah, I'm sorry.

303
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,510
It was an ad lib. Was it weird?

304
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,860
Why do you think she recommended you for this role?

305
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,260
She wants to show you that she's the main actress now.

306
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,370
She wants to brag about it in front of you.

307
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,120
Her mom's like that, but I thought she was nice. But she's worse.

308
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,030
Mom. I have to memorize my lines.

309
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,530
There are not many lines to memorize anyway!

310
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,000
Exactly 3 words.  "Stop right there!"

311
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,440
There are still so many actions!

312
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,700
Looks like Se Mi gets to taste all the romance 
and you'll get to kick to your heart's content.

313
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,130
I mean, these people! 
There's no one bringing a chair for you?

314
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,550
 Today, it's Cheon Song Yi's treat!

315
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:16,720
♬  We will be together for all times.  ♬

316
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,620
Indeed. . .

317
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,560
Please put them in front of Ms. Cheon Song Yi.

318
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:33,390
 Cheon Song Yi 
♬  I've been saving up my moments, 
but I'll spend them with you now.  ♬

319
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:40,650
♬  You are my love forever.  ♬

320
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,380
- You came, Mother.
-- Yeah, welcome.

321
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,580
How is it you came here?

322
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,270
Did you tell him, Mom?

323
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,470
What?

324
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,630
He asked me where you were shooting, so. . .

325
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,000
What's. . .all this?

326
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,820
You might catch a cold.

327
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,830
For sure, people who've spent quite a sum of money
 know how to use money. Anyway, thank you, Hui Kyeong.

328
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,630
My Song Yi can keep her head up now.

329
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,040
Of course she should.

330
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,330
If Cheon Song Yi keeps her head down, 
is that still Cheon Song Yi?

331
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,550
I should go tell them to come eat.

332
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,990
Why go this far?

333
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,730
I have to suck up to the staff to film you well.

334
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,870
Ah, right. Who is the actress you are working with?

335
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,150
Noona. 
- Unni.

336
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,520
So, it is Se Mi. The actress you are working with.

337
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,030
Yes.

338
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,390
Actually, I know it also. That Se Mi likes you a lot.

339
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,550
But why is the mood like that?

340
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:11,890
I should let her clean up her feelings
 as fast as possible, right?

341
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,230
I should've done that too, right?

342
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,270
For you, it's too late.

343
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,880
You are going to do that today?

344
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,030
Yes. If you have time, watch me and then leave.

345
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,960
I am going to make new history in the action movies.

346
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,910
 Can you try raising this?

347
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,970
 Director, you were hungry, weren't you?

348
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,620
 Please come eat.  Enjoy the food!

349
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:44,030
Cheon Song Yi is treating you today!
- Thank you!

350
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,980
 Song Yi Will Treat You Today

351
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,790
 Enjoy the food!

352
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,910
--Eat a lot, Director.
--Thank you!

353
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,250
Why aren't you eating?

354
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,700
Don't bother.

355
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,680
Really? Then, do so.

356
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,420
But wait,

357
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,470
isn't it too much?

358
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,220
What is?

359
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,180
The main actress is staying still,

360
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,080
but the supporting actress is acting out.

361
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,950
What, how childish.

362
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,900
Are you trying to win favors through food?

363
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,470
You might not know this because it's your first time,

364
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:44,740
but do you want to know how to 
 really  make her into a main actress?

365
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,360
What?

366
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,790
Just because she has more lines, 
doesn't mean she's the main.

367
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,680
Loosen up.

368
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,940
If you are that anxious, everyone can tell.

369
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,210
Your daughter is not good enough for the role, 
but you put her there anyway,

370
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,540
and now you are nervous to the core
 because people might realize that.

371
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,840
Omo. Director Jo.

372
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,630
Go and eat up.

373
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,630
I think we need to get a tight shot here.

374
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,860
Aren't you scared?

375
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,880
I am scared.

376
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,390
But in the worst case scenario, I will just die, right?

377
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,600
Hey, how can you say that?

378
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,550
Don't you worry. I won't die.

379
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,590
Let's have dinner later. I will treat you to something good.

380
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,200
Raise her.

381
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,010
Lower.

382
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,990
- How is it? Is it okay?
- Yes.

383
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,920
Once you fall about half way, 
they will start pulling the wire.

384
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,730
And we'll do the landing when we're taking full shots.

385
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:08,110
The important part for this shot is that 
you have to look very cool when you jump off, okay?

386
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,190
Okay.

387
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,310
Hey. Get it controlled.

388
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,100
 There's no danger of that being leaked out, so...

389
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,960
 Hyung!

390
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,400
What?

391
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,640
What are you doing,  pull!

392
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,000
What's happening? Why is this happening?

393
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,120
What's going on?

394
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,600
Hui Kyeong!

395
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,300
 Emergency Center

396
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,350
Oh, why? Did something happen?

397
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,100
Really? Did she die?

398
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,500
Daebak!

399
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,390
 Actress Cheon Song Yi Hurt In Fall While Filming. 
Life in Danger.

400
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,450
Se Mi. What is this?

401
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,500
What happened to our Hui Kyeong?

402
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,930
Mother.

403
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:47,680
Do not act so rashly. A lot of people are watching.

404
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:55,100
 Central Surgery Station

405
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:09,300
Why can't my Song Yi go into surgery?

406
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,400
Because of splenic rupture, there is copious bleeding. 
She also has an external injury, so we need to secure a transfusion.

407
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:19,450
But, her RH antibody screening test result
 came out as positive.

408
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,640
What?

409
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,120
RH E-type blood was confirmed,  a specific kind of blood type.

410
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,690
This is a very unique and rare blood type, 
and our hospital does not have it.

411
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,610
We are going to try to look more.
Because we are such in an emergency state

412
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,740
we'd like all family members to get their blood type tested.

413
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,650
Is there any other family member?

414
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,790
No, what happened?

415
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,510
How did this..?

416
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,550
Wow, even on these articles, people curse her off.

417
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,210
I know right?

418
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,980
I should just..

419
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,090
-Let me go. I am going to sue all those people. 
-You can't. Hold it in.

420
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,030
No.. Why are you doing this? Stop.

421
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,410
Hey. Cheon Song Yi got into an accident.

422
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,710
Serves her right. I didn't like her.

423
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,370
Hey. Are you guys human?

424
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,130
Get out!

425
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,550
You guys are banned from this comic book store. Get out!

426
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,830
Hold it in. Just look at me and hold it in.

427
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,870
Oppa, Cheon Song Yi got into an accident.

428
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,350
A wire was cut when she was filming.

429
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,310
I guess she was seriously hurt since her life is in danger.

430
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,390
Where?

431
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,820
Where is the hospital?

432
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,180
What are we going to do if both you and I don't match hers?

433
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:01,070
Our Song Yi... What is she going to do?

434
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,170
They say they're going to look into other hospitals.

435
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,730
Song Yi's dad..

436
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,980
Song Yi's mom.. Where's our Song Yi?

437
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:39,500
What's this? It's too easy.

438
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,030
He says he did everything without us interrogating.

439
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,690
If this is true, then wouldn't we have to 
arrest him right away, Prosecutor?

440
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:55,200
A lawyer follows in but just sighs.

441
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:59,260
Please say something.

442
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,550
Can we take a break?

443
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,570
Let us.

444
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,370
Would you like some drinks?

445
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,070
It's okay.

446
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,820
Do Min Joon.

447
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,800
Yes.

448
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,890
Do you have a secret that you want to keep?

449
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,900
Or, do you have a person you want to protect?

450
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,920
What is the reason for coming up with
 the perfect lie pointing to yourself?

451
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,160
I don't know for what or for whom you are doing it,

452
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,230
but because of you, someone else's crimes can be covered up.

453
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,260
Prosecutor.

454
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,410
Something happened.

455
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,760
It says Cheon Song Yi had an accident while filming.
 She's in critical condition.

456
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,850
Look at this. The number 1 search keyword 
is "Cheon Song Yi critical."

457
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,190
That's right, you are close with Cheon Song Yi.

458
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,230
How could something like this happen?

459
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:17,090
This man! A person's still talking, yet he runs out.

460
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,460
Mr. Do Min Joon!

461
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,320
Did Do Min Joon already go?

462
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,470
Pardon. Who?

463
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,350
Do Min Joon, the one that was just interrogated.
Didn't he just leave?

464
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,050
No, he didn't.

465
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:32,950
What are you saying? He came bolting out of that door.

466
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,980
No, no one came out before you, Detective.

467
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,640
I have been watching constantly.

468
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,160
What are you saying?
He opened that door and just came out.

469
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,350
No, I'm telling you that no one came out.

470
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,770
Have my eyes turned weird?

471
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,830
Did Do Min Joon come in just right now?

472
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,060
No. He just went out, remember?

473
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:03,590
I know, right. 
He went out, but he's gone.

474
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,690
He was there just a while ago, but gone.

475
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,950
But why does this strange situation seem so familiar?

476
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,790
 Hey! Do Min Joon!

477
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:34,310
Prosecutor, even if I get called a lunatic,

478
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,550
I need to confirm this.

479
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,390
Here. Here.

480
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,820
Here, he came out here.

481
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,310
Here. . . But he doesn't come out there.
Hey, it's not even ...

482
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:58,930
It's like something out of a Hollywood movie. . .
Wow!

483
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,830
Look at my hair standing up here.

484
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:06,790
What is that bastard? 
Is he Harry Potter? Is he Harry Potter?

485
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,270
Is he playing around with us?

486
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,310
Please tell us.

487
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:19,640
What is it? Magic, is that it?

488
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,540
High level of trickery. Is he a friend of Lee Eun Kyul or what? (Lee Eun Kyul is one of the famous Korean magicians)

489
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,400
If not, how are you going to explain this situation?

490
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,510
You must have seen wrongly.

491
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,850
You must be kidding! It was caught by the CCTV.

492
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:38,380
He opened that door to go out,
 but he didn't appear on the other side.

493
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,470
He disappeared. Just like magic!

494
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,730
The CCTV must have been malfunctioning ...

495
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,040
or it's a faulty one.

496
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,700
Are you really going to be like this?

497
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:52,680
Try calling him. Ask him where he went

498
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,380
to see if he went to Hogwarts, the school of magic.

499
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,400
It feels like I'm in a dream right now.

500
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,310
He's gone crazy.

501
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,110
Crazy.

502
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,960
The father's results came out to be a match
 for Cheon Song Yi's RH.

503
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,470
Please prepare for the surgery. 
 - Okay.

504
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,280
Father, please go directly to the Blood Center and prepare 
for the transfusion.

505
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,020
Yes, yes, I will be going.

506
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,510
I will be going. Don't worry.

507
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,850
 Breaking news. Actress Cheon Song Yi
 injured at shooting site. Condition critical

508
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:51,120
What's the matter? By this time...

509
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,740
Shouldn't you be meeting with the prosecutor?

510
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,750
According to our agreement?

511
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,030
What do you think I will do to you?

512
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:07,070
You. . . I will kill you.

513
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,790
Me? You will?

514
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,630
You dare to?

515
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:17,660
That's right. I will. Right now.

516
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,630
You. . .

517
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:37,070
I will kill you the same way you did to Cheon Song Yi.

518
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,950
DIE!

519
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,550
You can't kill me.

520
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:16,560
I. . . know...

521
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:20,750
That if you kill me. . .

522
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,590
you will also die.

523
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:41,080
 You couldn't be thinking about that, right?

524
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,330
 You can't do that.

525
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,550
 If ever you kill someone with your abilities,

526
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:51,850
 you said you will also die.

527
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,910
 That's why you haven't interfered with anything, held back, and lived this far, isn't it?

528
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,090
 No matter how much you hate him,

529
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:02,490
 you should never let that thought become reality.

530
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:06,330
 You can't die just to kill that inhuman bastard.

531
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,480
Could it be that you are risking your life just to kill me?

532
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,080
Did we have such a special relationship?

533
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,480
I know everything about you.

534
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,270
Your secret, who you are. . .

535
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,100
where you came from, and. . .

536
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,650
what your fatal weakness is. . . everything.

537
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:33,900
It's not like you have many lives, 
even if you are an alien.

538
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,150
Perhaps, are you going to use that one life...

539
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,980
on me?

540
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,580
If killing you...

541
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,900
can stop you,

542
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,890
I'm fine if I die.

543
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,310
Cheon Song Yi will die too!

544
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,410
If I die,

545
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:08,250
Cheon Song Yi, who's in the hospital now, will die too.

546
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:11,570
Do you think I didn't set up any safety device

547
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,570
while playing a game with a guy like you?

548
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:17,330
Even if you kill me,

549
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:20,320
you can't stop me.

550
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:23,980
If I die, you die!

551
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,100
Then,

552
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,630
there will be no one to protect her.

553
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,780
Are you...

554
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,950
still okay with it?

555
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:37,450
Pray that Cheon Song Yi will be safe.

556
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,870
If something happens to her,

557
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,450
I'll be back to kill you.

558
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,200
You said you have much to lose.

559
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,070
I'll let you taste the feeling of losing something one by one.

560
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:54,880
Eventually, I'll make you lose everything.

561
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,450
Destruction!

562
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,320
I'll let you know what that is, distinctly.

563
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,990
- You dare to...?
- Whom you dared...!!!

564
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,230
to mess with. I'll let you know that, too.

565
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,350
The surgery was successful,
 but there was copious bleeding.

566
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:34,110
Pulmonary edema developed, so until she 
breathes normally, she needs to use the oxygen respirator.

567
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,260
And we need to observe the progress.

568
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,630
What about her life? Will she survive though?

569
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,700
Let's watch her for a little.

570
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,750
If she breathes normally in 2 days, 
you won't have anything to worry about.

571
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,690
It's still very fortunate.

572
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,770
Thank you. Thank you so much.

573
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,840
I'm thankful.

574
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,470
Our Song Yi,

575
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,580
you saved her.

576
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:09,490
I'll be going now.

577
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:12,730
Call me when something happens.

578
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:18,410
Go after seeing her wake up.

579
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,130
She won't want to see my face.

580
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,750
That's always the problem with you!

581
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,640
You really don't know how people feel?

582
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,370
Our Song Yi...

583
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,890
Do you know how much she missed you?

584
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:36,650
Even if I said not to appear again,

585
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:39,540
how can you really not appear. Not even once!

586
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,260
The one who is worse than me

587
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,080
is you.

588
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,730
Aren't you going to greet your father?

589
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:55,530
You said I didn't have a father.

590
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:02,070
It was you who didn't even leave a single picture, then now...

591
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,140
 Dad.

592
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:45,060
 When I was young, I called you whenever I got scared.

593
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:47,980
 Cue!

594
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:52,920
 Dad...

595
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,790
 But now,

596
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,960
 I call out a different name.

597
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,870
 Do Min Joon.

598
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,770
 For the first time,

599
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,450
 I have a person whom I love more than you, Dad.

600
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,070
 From morning till night...

601
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,740
 I've got a person with whom I want to do everything.

602
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:41,300
 ♫ The person who called out to you like that is me  ♫

603
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:50,310
 ♫ My tears which flow  senselessly are love ♫

604
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:55,710
 ♫ You were always at my side but ♫

605
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,750
 No matter how much that person keeps pushing me to go away,
♫ I didn't know it was you and ♫

606
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,970
 I can't take a step.
  ♫ Why you, who were waiting, knew and ♫

607
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,990
  ♫ and just told a sad story. ♫

608
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:06,860
 Even if I try so hard to hate him,

609
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,450
 ♫  Today how many more of the same tears are left. ♫

610
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:13,550
 I can't hate him.
 ♫  Today how many more of the same tears are left. ♫

611
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,650
 Again and again,
 ♫  Today how many more of the same tears are left. ♫

612
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:24,050
 I keep on dreaming sad dreams that he loves me..
♫ Will you tell me I don't know love and farewell? ♫

613
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:32,500
 ♫ Rain drops keep turning into tears, blocking my vision ♫

614
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:40,600
 ♫ Where are the tears the same as today's going? ♫

615
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:47,490
 ♫ How much more? I don't know ♫

616
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:55,710

617
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,250
  Again and again,

618
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,090
 I'm dreaming a sad dream.
