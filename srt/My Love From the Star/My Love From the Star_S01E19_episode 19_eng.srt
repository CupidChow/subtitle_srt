1
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,080

2
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,000
 Heo Gyun ( Pen name: Gyo San ):
renown Joseon politician, poet, novelist, scholar, 1569–1618

3
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,910
Even I, who am living alone in the mountains, have heard

4
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,430
of your fame, Scholar Gyo San Heo Gyun...

5
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,800
How have you come all this way looking for me?

6
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,340
Of late,

7
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,040
I am in the midst of writing a piece of fiction.

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,930
The protagonist is a person named Hong Gil Dong, and

9
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,020
he is skilled in magic. Using that magic,
 he saves commoners in difficulty.

10
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,430
He's that kind of a character.

11
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,550
So?

12
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,500
I heard that you, Sir, practice magic.

13
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,480
Ultimately,  the figure in the novel is 
not a real figure, just fictional.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,910
Out of the desire to meet a person who actually practices magic,

15
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,160
and to witness that extraordinary sight myself
and incorporate that into the novel,

16
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,240
I came to look for you like this 
after inquiring around with difficulty.

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,690
Whoa!

18
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,670
Heol!

19
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,590
Why are you doing such a frightful thing?

20
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,490
Are you talking about something like this?

21
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,090
My hat!

22
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,930
Indeed...

23
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,790
Indeed... this is wondrous.

24
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,450
Whether this is a dream or real, 
may I touch for just a moment...

25
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,490
I'm in the midst of researching methods like
shape-shifting, shortening distance, and lessening my weight, so

26
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,160
what you just showed me, this...

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,030
flashing in the East, then flashing in the West, 
what kind of magic is this?

28
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,970
I am not someone who practices magic.

29
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,730
No, if this is not magic,

30
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,210
it seems, without a doubt, that you must be a special entity.

31
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,060
You're also a lot like the character in my novel.

32
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,070
That's not the case.

33
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,400
The protagonist of the novel that you, Sir, 
are writing is full of chivalry,

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,830
so that he may save a lot of people 
using the talent he possesses. But,

35
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,130
I do not. That's why.

36
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,240
May I ask the reason?

37
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,960
Rather than hiding a skill like this and 
live like a being that does not exist,

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,840
would you rather not come forth into the world and 
save the commoners in difficulty and give hope...?

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,590
There have been times when I have lent aid, 
revealing my identity.  But,

40
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,360
to them, I

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,220
was only a monster who was different from themselves.

42
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,660
I've decided not to do such foolish things now.

43
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,630
What if...

44
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,490
it were for the person that you love with all your heart?

45
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,150
Even if it were for that person, 
would you not reveal your identity and

46
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,410
save that person?

47
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,630
Regrettably,

48
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,020
I do not have someone I love with all my heart.

49
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,950
Even though you may feel that way now, 
after living a long time in this vast world,

50
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,730
you'll meet countless people.

51
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,100
Couldn't such a person appear?

52
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,550
That will never happen.

53
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,310
And one more thing,

54
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,790
I'm not a being that can remain in this place forever.

55
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,070
When the time comes, I will be returning 
from whence I came.

56
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,220
Therefore, no matter how long this life is 
or how vast the world is,

57
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,160
even if I were to encounter countless people,

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,360
there is no likelihood that I will proffer
 all of my heart to anyone.

59
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,460
I am not that foolish.

60
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,220
 My Love From The Star 
19th Chronicle

61
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,000
 If I miss this chance to return home,

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,540
 I may

63
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,630
 disappear from this world.

64
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,500
 I might even die in the near future.

65
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,830
 Is it okay even if you don't leave?

66
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,400
 It's okay.

67
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,860
 Is it really

68
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,300
 okay?

69
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,220
Father...

70
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,410
I'm not.

71
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,630
Don't you know that I'm not his  father?

72
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,710
Do Min Joon said this . . .

73
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,640
"You are like a real father."

74
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,430
You said this last time when Do Min Joon was sick.

75
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,670
In three months, he will have to go back.

76
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,080
Why did you say that then?

77
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,470
Do Min Joon...

78
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,940
Is he going back somewhere?

79
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,920
Didn't you come already knowing everything, no?

80
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,650
It still doesn't seem like a reality to me.

81
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,030
Do Min Joon can disappear in front of my eyes.

82
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,020
He can also suddenly appear out of nowhere.

83
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,970
Although I saw all of it,

84
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,990
that he is a person from another star...

85
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,480
I still can't believe it.

86
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,720
As if that isn't enough,

87
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,720
that he has to return to his planet...

88
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,520
It's true.

89
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,590
Do Min Joon...

90
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,170
He told me . . .

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,180
That he won't return.

92
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,990
That it is okay for him not to return.

93
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,220
But I ended up

94
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,920
reading his diary.

95
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,920
There it was noted

96
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,910
that if he doesn't return,

97
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,570
he will die.

98
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,880
He has already changed a lot from before.

99
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,810
Back then he wasn't able to feel 
whether it was cold or hot.

100
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,330
Now he keeps on

101
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,890
feeling the cold,

102
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,470
and the supernatural powers he possesses

103
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,550
sporadically disappear, too.

104
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,850
So, if he really doesn't go...

105
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,740
he dies?

106
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,300
Then, that person...

107
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,900
knowing that he may die,

108
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,920
promised me that he will stay by my side?

109
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,970
How can he?

110
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:17,480
It is because he likes you that much.

111
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,160
Even before you, Cheon Song Yi, liked the professor,

112
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,910
he liked you a lot.

113
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,470
 More than you know, much more than that,

114
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,680
 he liked you a great deal.

115
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,130
 Cheon Song Yi.

116
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,190
 Because he didn't want your heart to be hurt...

117
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,650
 he made a great effort for it not to turn out this way.

118
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,950
 I tried many times to stop him, but what could I do?

119
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,840
He's even willing to give up his life

120
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,550
and be by your side.

121
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,360
What is this?  Having called over a person?

122
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,360
Hi! It's Do Min Joon.

123
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,300
Indeed,

124
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,640
you just come right in, even though
 no one opened the door for you.

125
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,620
It's great.

126
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,940
But, Do Min Joon, what is your identity exactly?

127
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,950
Are you a wizard?

128
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,500
Did you call me here to ask things like that?

129
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,770
How extensive are your abilities?

130
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,010
12 years have passed, but your face is still the same.

131
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,180
You can move extremely quickly.

132
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,320
You can even pass through a door 
without even putting your hand to it.

133
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,460
You can even win over Cheon Song Yi's heart

134
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,520
that I couldn't win over in 15 years of continuous love.

135
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,580
You have it all, Do Min Joon.  I'm envious of you.

136
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,920
I...envy you.

137
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,750
You envy me?

138
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,000
I...

139
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,790
Someone of my own blood

140
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,700
tried to kill...

141
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,740
the woman I love.

142
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,880
He killed...

143
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,050
my eldest brother.

144
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,520
That day . . .

145
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,260
The day my eldest brother died . . .

146
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,580
 Hui Kyeong,

147
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,660
 take this to Eldest Brother.

148
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,650
 Okay.

149
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,280
I...

150
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,510
With my own two hands...

151
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,700
took it to him. I did...

152
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,230
It wasn't your fault.

153
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,910
If this is revealed

154
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,090
to everyone,

155
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,430
Father...Mother...

156
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,770
How much will they suffer?

157
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,690
What will happen to our household?

158
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,920
I understand how you feel, but
 we can't cover it up as it stands.

159
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,810
Already, Lee Jae Kyeong will have turned 
malicious towards you.

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,020
If so,

161
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,740
he could mess with Cheon Song Yi again.

162
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,020
That's why I called you.

163
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,190
To ask what I should do.

164
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,410
The fact that YOU are the person 
I have to ask this sort of thing,

165
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,220
I hate it. But,

166
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,070
answer me, please.

167
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,840
What do I do?

168
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,260
 I'm leaving because I'm too tired today.

169
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,310
 Do Min Joon, see you tomorrow.

170
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,930
Right.

171
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,810
See you tomorrow, Cheon Song Yi.

172
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:14,340
♫  Because you are there, because of you ♫

173
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:20,820
♫   Because you quietly lean on my shoulder sometimes, ♫

174
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:28,010
♫  You know it's you. I am truly completely happy. ♫

175
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,190
♫  Because I follow you, time flows and stops. ♫

176
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,070
 Way before you started liking Do Min Joon,

177
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,840
 he liked you a lot.

178
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,160
 Much more than you know,

179
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,230
 he really liked you.

180
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,630
♫  ...couldn't.  Your every moment.  ♫

181
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:57,550
♫  I wish it were me your every second.
As I think about it,  ♫

182
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:04,120
 ♫ my heart is engulfed by you.  ♫

183
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,700
I hear that guy is the successor to S&amp;C.

184
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,520
Lately, there are a lot of women who come
 because of that guy.

185
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,140
Not only that, but I hear his personality 
is unbelievably good too!

186
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,420
Daebak.

187
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,180
Isn't it though?!

188
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,120
It's Lee Jae Kyeong.

189
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,970
 I'm asking you to let me live!

190
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,410
Who are you?

191
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,780
 010-2800 
Headset

192
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,400
Are you...Do Min Joon?

193
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,160
 No, it's me.

194
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,640
 Lee Hui Kyeong, the younger brother
 of Lee Han Kyeong who you killed.

195
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,080
Hui Kyeong, you...

196
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,180
What is it that you have?

197
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,450
I'll explain it all to you.

198
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,410
Right now,

199
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,140
where are you?

200
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,380
Can I come in?

201
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,170
You're drinking alcohol which you don't normally drink.

202
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,880
My little brother.

203
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,630
Did she give it to you?

204
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,250
Yang Min Joo?

205
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,380
Where did that come from?

206
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,290
I had no idea.

207
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,540
Even though I punished her for 7 years like that,

208
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,410
she deceived me blind, that woman.

209
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,840
That's why I can't be nice to anyone.

210
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,790
If you don't immediately take care of things that get in the way,

211
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,670
things always develop kinks unmanageably.

212
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,690
Is that why you did it?

213
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,260
Both eldest brother and Han Yoo Ra.

214
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,140
How many more people were there?

215
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,320
You're here?

216
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,300
At least eat this.

217
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,460
Se Mi.

218
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,880
Yes?

219
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,950
You're close with Hui Kyeong, right?

220
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,140
Yes. Why do you ask?

221
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,000
I feel like I said something I shouldn't have and

222
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,560
Hui Kyeong might be in danger.

223
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,620
What do you mean?

224
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,560
Why would he be?

225
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,890
I don't have any ill feeling towards you.

226
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,520
If you just listen to me well,

227
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,540
I won't

228
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,390
do anything to you.

229
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,410
What's that thing you had me listen to?

230
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,790
Where is it?

231
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,940
I don't know.

232
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,560
Kiddo,

233
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,550
if you don't listen to your brother's words here,

234
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,570
you would become the poor little S&amp;C prince

235
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,070
who committed suicide with 
an anesthetic gun after drinking.

236
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,830
I obtained this in your name.

237
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,940
It will be established that I came 
to the hotel to meet you after the fact,

238
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,850
and though I tried to rush you to the hospital,

239
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,150
I couldn't save you.

240
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,590
Where is it?

241
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,470
The recorded file.

242
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,100
And also,

243
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,510
Yang Min Joo.

244
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,520
Fine.

245
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,400
Finding those trivial objects

246
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,150
is possible even after you're gone.

247
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,770
It seems my little brother called in reinforcement.

248
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,420
Turn yourself in.

249
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,370
If you turn yourself in,

250
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,560
at least, you won't have to meet your end in prison.

251
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,250
And, don't appear

252
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,890
in front of our family again.

253
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,550
Do Min Joon, didn't we agree not to do this?

254
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,260
You're making a big mistake right now.

255
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,510
Whatever you want to say,

256
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,770
say it in front of people.

257
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,980

258
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,800
Mr. Lee Jae Kyeong.

259
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,010
For the crimes of murder and attempted murder,

260
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,660
kidnapping and holding a person against her will, 
I place you under arrest without a warrant.

261
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,990
I think you've made a mistake now.

262
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,620
Call my lawyer. Without any evidence...

263
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,280
There was CCTV in the room you were just in.

264
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,940
Mr. Lee Hui Kyeong had it installed.

265
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,960
Naturally,  the incident just now is probably 
all recorded as well.

266
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,710
Ah, what happened just a little while ago,

267
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,620
that was just scaring a younger brother a little.

268
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,550
A little disturbance between brothers.

269
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:26,050
In conclusion, I have not caused any harm 
to my younger brother.

270
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,700
But murder and attempted murder?

271
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,920
After the wire accident, with Lee Hui Kyeong's information,

272
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,850
we found your henchman, Mr. Lee Jae Kyeong.

273
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,110
Oh boy, we almost lost him.

274
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:54,190

275
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,920
They're coming out!

276
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,170
What happened here?

277
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,990
To what crime are you connected?

278
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,290
What does it mean that this is related
 to the Han Yoo Ra incident?

279
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,090
Please say a few words!

280
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,140
You called the reporters too?

281
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,280
A word, please!

282
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,050
You did well.

283
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,370
Will the broadcasting stations come as well?

284
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,090
-Say a few words, please!
-Please look this way.

285
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,910
Then this is probably being filmed, too.

286
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,620
Hui Kyeong.

287
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,940
From the beginning, I wasn't planning
 to use the anesthesia gun on you.

288
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,720
However, instead I had some other device in place.

289
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,670
A kind of plan that would ensure

290
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,850
you couldn't refuse my offer.

291
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,670
The wine that Cheon Song Yi likes the most.

292
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,240
"Chateau Petrus 1993"

293
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,200
What are you saying?

294
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,990
I made a reservation at a wine restaurant
 that Cheon Song Yi frequents,

295
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,190
Do Min Joon, in your name.

296
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,520
Cheon Song Yi, thinking that you invited her there,

297
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,050
is there now.

298
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,910
Around about now,

299
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,990
the wine will have arrived in front of her.

300
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,780
Since it's her favorite wine,

301
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,920
wouldn't she drink it straight away?

302
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,850
Of course, what happens after she drinks it,

303
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,610
I don't know.

304
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,410
He moved so fast!
 -Take pictures! Take pictures!

305
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,580
Don't take pictures please! Don't take pictures please!

306
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,090
Do Min Joon, please stop.

307
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,840
Do you have the time now to be doing this?

308
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,340
Around about now,

309
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,700
she's probably drinking it.

310
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,520
Cheon Song Yi, answer the phone, really!

311
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,770
There's that thing you're good at.

312
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,330
Try disappearing.

313
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,800
If you're to save Cheong Song Yi,

314
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,830
that seems like the only way.

315
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,060
Ah, then again, you can't, can you?

316
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,350
Seeing as there are

317
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,910
too many watchful eyes.

318
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,980
Man, take the shot!  Take the picture!
Please move back!

319
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,030
Please don't take pictures.

320
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,560
 Whoa!  What is this?

321
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,090
That guy disappeared just now.

322
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,350
-Someone just disappeared, right?
He floated in the air!
- What is this?

323
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,070
What are you going on about? I didn't see. 
You probably saw wrong. Stand back, back!

324
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,250
Stand back, quickly!

325
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,480
Where is he? Where did he go?

326
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,630
Do Min Joon won't be able to save Cheon Song Yi.

327
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,190
Aish.

328
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:22,420
Are you even human? I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you!

329
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,880
What's going on?

330
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,440
Please don't take pictures.

331
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,410
That scared me! 
Where did he appear from?

332
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,050
It seemed like he fell from above.

333
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,440
Don't say such nonsense.

334
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,110
Are you okay?

335
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,370
But, just now, how did you get here?

336
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,250
People are looking.

337
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,720
But...my body feels a little strange...

338
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,460
It's Cheon Song Yi! Cheon Song Yi's fainted!

339
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,680
-She just fainted.
-What?

340
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,270
Awesome, this!. -Is that Cheon Song Yi?
-Yes.

341
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,390
-Wow!
-What the?

342
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,550
She's a drug overdose patient. 
Prepare for  a Gastric lavage of the rugae.

343
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,800
The Doctor isn't here right now, so wait a little...

344
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,700
There's no time for that now!

345
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,630
Excuse me!

346
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,180
You can't do that!

347
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,160
Who on earth are you?

348
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,790
What are you doing? Quickly call the police.

349
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,980
Yes.

350
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,860
  Actress Cheon Song Yi disappears from a restaurant.

351
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,130
Beom. Please go to Hanguk Hospital's emergency room.

352
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,430
What?

353
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,650
Please tell us!

354
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,380
Mr. Lawyer.

355
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,470
Isn't this the person who used to visit our office sporadically?

356
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,670
 Article relating to Cheon Song Yi's hospitalization

357
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,800
Oh my! Hey, is Song Yi ins...

358
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,080
Mom, Cheon Song Yi's is in the Emergency Room.

359
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,520
Again?

360
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,010
How many times this year alone has
 she ended up in the ER exactly?

361
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,590
What happened this time?

362
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,370
 Cheon Song Yi!

363
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,240
 Wow, she's waking up.

364
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,160
 What is it?

365
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,280
Do Min Joon.

366
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,000
Are you okay?

367
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,700
What's wrong with Cheon Song Yi?

368
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,450
 That person next to her. . . 
Isn't that her manager?

369
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,780
Cheon Song Yi must've been injured.

370
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,880
There are too many people.

371
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,500
It's too noisy.

372
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,590
Let's go to a place where there are no people.

373
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,220
Okay.

374
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,010
Let's do that.

375
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,290
They disappeared again!

376
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,430
 Where have they gone?!

377
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,180
Where have they gone?

378
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,820
Do Min Joon.

379
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,970
Where is this place?

380
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,810
I came to the right place.

381
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:12,530
It was my first time going so far. I was worried.

382
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,050
Where are we?

383
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,770
You said you wanted to go to a place 
where there's no one.

384
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,830
This is a place where there's no one.

385
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,360
A place where only you and I exist.

386
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,500
Really?

387
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,820
Nobody will be able to find it.

388
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,480
Is this perhaps...

389
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,480
your planet?

390
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,530
Something like...an alien planet?

391
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,540
Yes.

392
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,710
Really?

393
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,890
Really?

394
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,840
I said so.

395
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,850
But, I'm fine.

396
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,460
My body isn't floating or anything.

397
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,050
I'm really fine.

398
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,610
I can breathe and I'm not floating.

399
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,820
I'm fine, Do Min Joon!

400
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,040
-Are you an idiot?
-Huh?

401
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,880
How is this an alien planet? 
Do you know how far that would be?

402
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,800
-It isn't?
-Of course it isn't.

403
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,770
And what would you do if it was an alien planet?

404
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,990
What do you mean "what"? 
I'll live there of course.

405
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,710
As long as I can breathe, I'm going to live there. 
I adapt quickly.

406
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,260
I won't fall short, with this much beauty, even on your planet.

407
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,900
I'd be popular there too.

408
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,700
Whatever I do, I'm going to survive.

409
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,750
Then...

410
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,020
where is this place?

411
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,540
We're the only ones here?

412
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,730
There's only us two here, he said!

413
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,910
There are no police or reporters!

414
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:36,260
There are no people! There is no one!

415
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:41,580
I'm Cheon Song Yi! Catch me if you can!

416
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,090
He's an alien!

417
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,590
Try catching him, too!

418
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,290
The two of us are here together!

419
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,090
We're going to live here together!

420
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,380
Right here!  Just the two of us!

421
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:11,660
We're going to eat and live well!

422
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,650
Do Min Joon, you do it, too.

423
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,750
What?

424
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,270
Do it, like I did.

425
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,320
We're going to eat and live well, just the two of us!

426
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,350
We are!  What are you going to do about it?!

427
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:52,050
It's nice!

428
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,070
Should we take a picture?

429
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,370
Huh?  What...?

430
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,100
Let's take one.  I even washed my face.

431
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,400
Do Min Joon, you have your cellphone, don't you? Give it here.

432
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,700
The tree is really unique.

433
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,060
Twinned trunks. (The Love Tree)

434
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:39,300
Two trees got tangled together and grew as if it were one.

435
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,480
This is a camellia tree and that is a cinnamon tree.

436
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,130
They aren't even the same genus 
and they're different type of trees.

437
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,590
But I guess it is possible.

438
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,410
I'm envious.

439
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,090
It means they'll be together until they die.

440
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,160
Should we take a picture?

441
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,570
Again?  It's enough.

442
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,270
The only things that will remain are pictures.

443
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,810
I bet it's chaotic now.

444
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,480
Probably so.

445
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,900
You know, how time on your star

446
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,910
and time here flows at different rates.

447
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,160
Let's be like that here.

448
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,230
Here, I'm...

449
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,770
not Cheon Song Yi, who is hated by the whole nation.

450
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:45,570
And you're not an alien who can't be discovered.

451
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,420
It doesn't matter at all.

452
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,080
So while we're here,

453
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,150
let's not worry about anything else in the world.

454
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,430
Do Min Joon.

455
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,290
Yeah, Cheon Song Yi.

456
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,380
I love you.

457
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,990
If you're going to live on this star,

458
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,740
I want to live on this star, too.

459
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,910
And if you're going to go to another star,

460
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,250
then, as much as I want to follow you and live there . . .

461
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,740
That's how much I love you.

462
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:55,980
Even though I'm anxious because it feels like 
you might disappear soon,

463
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,600
the time we're together like this,

464
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,050
if it could only be stopped forever,

465
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,710
I would sell my soul for it.

466
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,380
Because it's so difficult for my heart,

467
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,010
I sometimes think

468
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,600
what if I had not met you.

469
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,980
But still,

470
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,310
even if I were to go back in time,

471
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,750
I'd meet you again,

472
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,360
and I'd fight with you again,

473
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,940
and I'd fall for you,

474
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,400
and I'd love you.

475
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,830
 ♫ then I see ♫

476
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:12,400
 ♫ Because there is nothing else I can do. ♫

477
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,900
Okay.

478
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,090
What is this?

479
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,840
I said all that.

480
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,240
And, "okay" is it?

481
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,580
If a woman accepts the embarrassment
 she will feel and confesses,

482
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,650
you should at least give an answer that...

483
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:45,750
 ♫ I wish it were me your every moment. ♫

484
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,070
Oh, seriously!

485
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,810
No, almost there. Just a little more.

486
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,830
Right now, the trending search

487
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:09,290
from one to ten, they're all related to 
Cheon Song Yi and Do Min Joon.

488
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,500
From the beginning, I was thinking that

489
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,830
he was out of the ordinary.

490
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,900
These articles are burying the news about

491
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,400
S&amp;C Managing Director Lee Jae Kyeong, who was 
arrested as the suspect of Han Yoo Ra's incident.

492
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,470
If Song Yi Noona just returns somehow, 
she'll immediately make a comeback.

493
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,180
Really?

494
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,860
The sympathy she'll garner for being unfairly cursed 
during this entire time,

495
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,890
added to today's incident,

496
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,060
the interest in Song Yi will be nothing to joke about.

497
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,140
Thinking she's still under our management,
there are multiple calls from advertisement firms...

498
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,570
Multiple? Advertisement firms?

499
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,120
Really?!

500
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,200
In any case, whether there's a scandal or whatever,
 my Song Yi Noona is in a class by herself.

501
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,160
A romantic relationship with a superhuman

502
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,060
is so mysterious, you know?

503
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,190
Regular citizens are thinking the same.

504
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,500
Our Song Yi, where is she now?

505
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,960
I was thinking

506
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,370
when she didn't have her own staff at the filming location and suffered like that, "what can be done?"

507
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,620
I thought that maybe, at least, I should step up for her.

508
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,750
When she comes back to Seoul, 
I should immediately try to reach her.

509
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,780
 In the middle of Seoul, an unbelievable event has occurred.

510
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,440
 Mr. Do, who was the manager of actress Cheon Song Yi,

511
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,430
 has vanished with Cheon Song Yi.

512
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:21,020
 There were dozens of people who stated that 
they saw the two people vanish before them like smoke.

513
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,410
 On the social websites and SNS,

514
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,550
 multiple witnessing accounts were uploaded.

515
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,600
 Theories about aliens, magic, and

516
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,030
 rather absurd speculations are being discussed.

517
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,070
 About this situation, scientists comment that

518
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,140
 it is something impossible

519
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,960
 and are refusing to accept the situation.

520
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,770
Are you satisfied now?

521
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,520
Are you happy?

522
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,080

523
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,320
When did you wake up?

524
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,120
A while ago.

525
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,120
If you're tired, sleep some more.

526
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,920
No.

527
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,710
Your fever has gone down.

528
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,020
But I think it's much better than the first time.

529
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,510
Are you becoming more tolerant?

530
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,530
Should we take a picture?

531
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,200
Again?

532
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,230
Aren't you hungry?

533
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,840
I'm hungry.

534
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,560
But Do Min Joon, how many babies should we have?

535
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,320
What?

536
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,860
I mean, we should slowly start planning.

537
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,610
How many do you want?  How many?

538
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,610
Seven?

539
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,810
Seven?

540
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,130
Isn't seven too many?

541
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,510
In the olden days, everyone did that.

542
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,380
Seven or eight were average, 
and there were many families who had twelve.

543
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,750
Really?

544
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,240
Then, four daughters and three sons?

545
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,490
Seven daughters.

546
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,090
Why just seven daughters?

547
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,930
I like daughters.  Boys are just noisy.

548
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,270
Okay, then I'll consider it.

549
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,460
But that isn't something I can control.

550
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,170
What if a son comes out in the middle somewhere?

551
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,550
Then it can't be helped.

552
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,110
If we have one, we'll just have to raise him.

553
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:38,660
But if we're going to raise seven children, 
then where we're living now won't do.

554
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,720
Don't you think?

555
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,720
Probably not.

556
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,170
In the outskirts of Seoul or towards the countryside,

557
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,580
I think a house would be better than an apartment.
 A house with a yard.

558
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,590
My aunt lives in a house with a yard in Pyeongtaek.

559
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,620
But she says it takes a lot of work.

560
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,700
I suppose it would be, compared to an apartment.
Should we raise some puppies, too?

561
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,330
Why?

562
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,740
Nothing.
I also think a house with a yard would be good too.

563
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,080
Dogs are nice too.

564
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,060
Right?

565
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,550
But Do Min Joon, don't you have something 
you'd like to tell me?

566
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,490
Huh?

567
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,680
No, it's really petty, but,

568
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,770
you never specifically said anything 
about how you yourself feel.

569
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,280
Well. . . that you like me. . .

570
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:39,320
or that you love me?

571
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,030
Just eat your ramyun.

572
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,700
I think I said it several times. I said it a while ago, too.

573
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,390
Huh? 
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

574
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:08,160
You look sexy while eating ramyun.

575
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,850
Whatever.

576
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,610
You've been taking pictures the whole day.

577
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,800
I heard that it was an arrest without a warrant.

578
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,400
Then, make sure that they don't file a warrant 
at the warrant evaluation.

579
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,020
I said to block them!

580
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,060
I mean, this is an entrapment investigation!

581
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,260
And also, block the reporters.

582
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,750
If you don't squash down the article right now,

583
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,600
all the ads for our company. . .

584
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,980
Tell them that I will withdraw them all.

585
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,460
Whatever it takes, block them!

586
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,300
Jae Kyeong is my successor 
who will take care of the company.

587
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,640
He can't have a blemish on his career, do you understand?

588
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,950
Just because you do this, 
do you think you can take over your brother's position?

589
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,310
Your brother is someone who will do great things.

590
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,920
Just because he has a tiny flaw,

591
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,720
you're using that to destroy him?

592
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,000
Who are you to do that!?

593
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,940
Even if you set your brother up like this,

594
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,600
none of what your brother has will go to you.

595
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:35,330
Nothing. . . I don't need anything.

596
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:44,170
I am now. . . saying that you should not cover up 
what Hyung has done.

597
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,290
He has committed too many crimes all this time.

598
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,870
Today, he tried to kill Song Yi.

599
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,310
Say something that makes sense!

600
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:56,180
What does your brother lack?
When he has so many things,

601
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,160
why would your brother do that?

602
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:12,740
Today, this is the wine that Hyung wanted Song Yi to drink.

603
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,600
Thankfully, Song Yi did not drink enough.

604
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,830
I. . .

605
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,540
will drink it.

606
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,900
If I drink all of this, then believe me.

607
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:37,600
Lee Jae Kyeong is someone who does not 
regard a person's life if it gets in the way.

608
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,920
He's a monster.

609
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,680
If, by any chance, your brother

610
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:58,210
really did that to Cheon Song Yi,
 there must be a reason for it.

611
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,610
She must have done something that deserved it.

612
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:05,280
My Jae Kyeong is not someone who would do that 
to someone who hadn't done anything.

613
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,830
 Please save me, Jae Kyeong.

614
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,220
Whose voice that is. . .

615
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,530
Do you remember, Father?

616
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,660
What are you trying to do right now?

617
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,210
I'm sorry, Father.

618
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,740
 You're not drunk, you're being paralyzed, Hyung.

619
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,320
 Your hands and feet will lose strength.

620
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,070
 It will be hard to walk properly.
It will be harder to breathe.

621
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:51,990
 Your tongue will be paralyzed. 
Eventually, you will fall into a deep sleep.

622
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,870
 What are you saying right now?

623
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,790
 And you will be discovered in the middle of the highway.

624
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,090
 It will be ruled that you died driving under the influence.

625
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,280
 Jae Kyeong. . .

626
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,590
 I have been thinking how it would be if you weren't here.

627
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,870
 You are too much in the way.

628
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,690
 Just for the reason that I was born after you.

629
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,140
 Father did not give me any opportunities.

630
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:20,510
 Please save me, Jae Kyeong.

631
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:30,430
I'm sorry, Father.

632
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,630
I'm sorry.

633
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,760
Try calling again.

634
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,410
I'm telling you it's turned off.

635
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:59,510
No. . . What's happening?

636
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,360
To where did he take our Song Yi. . .

637
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,550
This doomed Manager Do!

638
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:05,700
Don't worry, Mom.

639
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,450
How can I not worry?

640
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,720
Our Min Joon Hyung is not someone who would harm her.

641
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,510
That's right, Song Yi's mom. I met him and he seemed nice.

642
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,950
Why would someone nice take our Song Yi and disappear?

643
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,850
Why aren't they calling?

644
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:20,560
Didn't you see the news?

645
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,300
Our Min Joon Hyung was the one who saved Noona,
 who almost died, by flushing out her stomach.

646
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,590
They had no choice but to avoid people
since they were gathering all around.

647
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:28,820
What is he?

648
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,070
Is he a doctor?

649
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,500
He's a man that our Song Yi likes very much.

650
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,890
I believe that they will be back safely, 
so let's just wait.

651
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,410
I can't live. Seriously.

652
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,410
Are those the only clothes you have?

653
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,110
Where is the star that you lived on?

654
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:04,180
How can you see it from here?

655
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,780
You can't see it even from here?

656
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,340
Then, from where will it be visible?

657
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,800
Why?

658
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,990
Just. . . I just wanted to know.

659
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,470
If it is on the north or south.

660
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,000
Is it there?

661
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,350
Or there?

662
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,580
Or over there?

663
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,660
Aren't you cold?

664
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,170
It's warm.

665
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:43,720
Do Min Joon.

666
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,650
Let's come here every summer.

667
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,040
Let's do that.

668
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:57,900
With our seven children, five puppies. . .

669
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,050
and much, much later, with our grandchildren.

670
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:06,180
There's no need to go far abroad,

671
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,290
let's just come here.

672
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,270
Let's do that.

673
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,780
We're going to have a huge family.

674
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,910
In order to feed them, we need to work really hard.

675
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:23,450
You need to teach more classes,

676
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:28,310
I need to do it all, be it the lead or second lead.

677
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,970
We should.

678
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,340
Let's do that.

679
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,590
You promise?

680
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:38,740
Yes, I promise.

681
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,150
Sing me a song.

682
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,970
You never sang for me even once.

683
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,490
What song?

684
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:04,080
A song that I will think of whenever 
I think about Do Min Joon,

685
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:08,450
and a song that you will think of 
whenever you think of Cheon Song Yi.

686
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:16,590
A song that we will remember for a long long time. . . 
That kind.

687
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,640
♫ The star ♫

688
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,770
♫ is shining brighter ♫

689
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,040
♫ today. ♫

690
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,300
♫ If this time passes. ♫

691
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,140
♫ The words that tell me ♫

692
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:55,600
♫ that you're leaving ♫

693
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,520
♫ make me. . . ♫

694
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,400
♫ sad ♫

695
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:10,340
♫ until the end of tonight. ♫

696
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:19,150
♫ Those happy times, ♫

697
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,640
♫ the many ♫

698
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,250
♫ promises between us. ♫

699
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:30,690
♫ They keep ♫

700
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:33,950
♫ whispering into my ear, ♫

701
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:41,810
♫ and make me sad. ♫

702
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,030
♫ It's not ♫

703
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,560
♫ your fault. ♫

704
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:54,910
 ♫ For some reason, ♫

705
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,110
 ♫ I have the urge to cry. ♫

706
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:06,580
 ♫ I was dreaming ♫

707
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:13,680
♫ of a dream that was too perfect. ♫

708
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,890
Thank you.

709
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:46,800
Cheon Song Yi,

710
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:50,220
I may not be able to say

711
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,000
all the words that you want to hear.  But,

712
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,760
it's true that

713
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,440
I would like to be in the future that you envision.

714
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:33,640
Put it on for me.

715
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,570
This kind of childish proposal. . .

716
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:05,930
I really wanted to receive one.

717
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,120
I. . .

718
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,690
never knew I would be making a 
childish proposal such as this.

719
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:24,740
I'm perfectly happy.

720
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,460
Do Min Joon.

721
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,140
What is it, Cheon Song Yi?

722
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,470
Do Min Joon, whom I love.

723
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:49,510
What is it?

724
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,500
It's time for us to wake up from our dream.

725
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,940
You, for my sake. . .

726
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,920
Exist somewhere.

727
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:09,580
For my sake,

728
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,350
don't die.

729
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,960
Exist somewhere.

730
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,080
What I'm saying is. . .

731
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,100
Go.

732
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:34,740
To the place where you were.

733
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:47,720

734
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:05,310
 It was good talking to you today.

735
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,950
 It will be an unforgettable experience.

736
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:13,270
 It was a very precious time and one that will give inspiration to the writing of my novel.

737
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:16,470
 If that's the case, then it's a relief.

738
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:23,480
 Before I go, may I say something?

739
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,370
 Please do so.

740
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:28,060
 I don't have the power to predict the future.

741
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,470
 The way I see it.

742
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,280
 Before you leave this place, without fail,

743
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,750
 you will meet a woman whom you will love with all your heart.

744
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,980
 And, for that woman. . .

745
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,380
 it seems like you could throw everything you have.

746
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,480
 For what reason are you saying that?

747
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,580
 Without a doubt, the feeling of love is mischievous.

748
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,740
 It comes in more cruel and vicious way to those who do not believe in it.

749
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,460
 That is why.
