Where?

40

Somewhere with walls and roof.

You heard it when I was arguing with Yun-jae?

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,870
You should’ve told me there will be guests.

46
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,840
You won’t come if I told you.

47
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,220
It’s been a long time.

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,450
Yup, 7 years.

49
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,370
It’s been 7 years since you confined me.

50
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,540
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,730
Ms. Yang Min-ju has been grounded in an asylum

52
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,590
in Yongsan-gu during the past 7 years.

53
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,300
Well, I see.

54
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,270
Mr. Lee Jae-kyung, you are suspected of

55
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,660
illegally confining Ms. Yang Min-ju.

56
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,520
Me?

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,890
What have I done?

58
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,880
You only hear what she says.

59
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,560
And obviously she’s mentally challenged.

60
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,790
I’m not mad. I’m sane.

61
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,970
I thought you were having a good time abroad.

62
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,110
I sent you abroad because you wanted to.

63
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,620
You’ve also been frightened, right, Hee-kyung?

64
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,900
But you must have misunderstood something.

65
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,510
I have nothing to do with this.

66
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,960
Jae-kyung, stop lying.

67
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,200
Lying?

68
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,760
Excuse me.

69

I have other errands to run.

70

Talk to my lawyer

What are you doing?

72
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,100
You really don’t want to say something?

73
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,800
What?

74
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,540
About your wife, and Han Yoo-ra

75
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,440
and Han-kyung.

76
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,950
You’re insane.

77
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,830
I’ve got nothing to say to them.

78
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,110
That was my last attempt

79
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,840
to forgive you for

80
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,940
what you’ve done…

81
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,650
What?

82
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,340
I tried to give my beloved and respected brother

83
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,280
a chance to defend himself.

84
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,380
I tried to understand you though it’s not easy.

85
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,720
But I’ve given up now.

86
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,030
My brother,

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:48,480
by the way, this is my last time

88
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,600
calling you “brother”.

89
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,310
From now on,

90
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,790
you are not my older brother anymore.

91
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,300
They… have only one room left.

92
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,530
That’s not true.

93
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,970
Next door is also available.

94
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,670
But there’s no heating in that room.

95
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,370
I can’t sleep without heating.

96
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,200
Then I’ll sleep there.

97
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,710
Why bother?

98
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,560
We are in a dilemma now.

99
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,930
Let’s just sleep here.

100
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,050
Dilemma is too big a word…

101
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,070
I’m warning you.

102
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,530
No kissing!

103
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,850
Period.

104
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,150
True that I used to dream to be a nurse,

105
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,670
but nursing is really exhausting.

106
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,680
What are you talking about?

107
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,200
I don’t plan to.

108
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,090
You can’t promise me things you’re not sure of.

109
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,550
That’s not “things I’m not sure of”.

110
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,230
I don’t want to do that from the beginning.

111
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,420
You’re sure?

112
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,200
Then try lying on the bed at ease.

113
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,930
What’s that face?

114
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,480
Face?

115
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,870
You’re blushing.

You don’t want to sleep?

Of course I do.

126
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,880
That was not a dream, was it?

127
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,160
You offered your arm to be my pillow.

128
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,310
Don’t know.

129
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,270
And you even kissed me.

130
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,450
You kissed me!

131
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,650
So we did kiss?

132
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,760
That was our first kiss.

Can’t turn off the light with your superpower?

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,670
Lady, you’re being too explicit, aren’t you?

Don’t tell me you’d do this to other men.

What you said just now.

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,740
What I said?

148
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,560
You are a lady. You should behave yourself…

That’s it. Cute, cute

150
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,890

You say it then. Go on.

OK. Fine. I’ll stop.

156

You are a lady…

Where’s he? Not even picking up my phone?

158

Hundreds of years have passed.

159
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:23,390
Not a single moment has ever stayed for me.

160
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:29,380
Now I know what matters is not how long you live

161
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,780
but who you’ve been living with.

162
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:46,160

Get up. Time for breakfast.

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,120
Make me float.

166
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,350
What?

167
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,190
Like you did

168
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,380
when I was in an outdoor filming, remember?

169
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,870
I want to see the sink next time I open my eyes.

170
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,690
Stop rambling. Get up.

171
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,390
I was panicking at that time.

172

But then I just felt amazing.

173
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,920
Just let me float one more time, will you?

174
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,820
Well, I can do that.

175
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,880
Then do it.

176
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,230
Are you trying?

177
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,040
How much do you weigh?

178
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,270
Does it matter?

179
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,760
You made it last time.

180
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,800
I’m floating! I’m floating!

181
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,470
That’s it?

182
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,490
Can I float higher?

183
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,350
You can’t. I can tell from you face.

184
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,710
Because I just woke up.

185
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,900
OK.

186
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,420
My bad. I should not push you that hard.

187
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,160
I should just walk on my own foot.

188
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,360
Don’t care about that.

189
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,540
Sit here.

190
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,830
Anything I can do to help?

191
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,900
All done.

192
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,110
Not the food.

193
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,630
I’m talking about your superpower.

194
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,630
But you did float up.

195
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,510
For a very short time.

196
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,360
And you seemed to be exhausting your strength.

197
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,750
Do you need some invigorator?

198
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,090
Will it work on you?

199
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,470
Maybe ginseng is better?

200
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,100
I’ve told you. It’s all because I just woke up.

201
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,440
And I was tired yesterday.

202
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,960
But you’ve done nothing yesterday.

203
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,330
You couldn’t even turn off the light.

204
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,150
We’re counting on your superpower in the future.

205
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,290
What should we do now?

206
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,710
This conversation upsets me.

207
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,010
No, no, no. Don’t be upset.

208
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,730
We can’t have it all, can we?

209
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,240
You must have been nervous. That’s nothing.

210
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,670
Don’t be upset, Do Min-joon.

211
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,090
You can do it!

212
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,760
Just push it a little bit.

213
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,360
Stop this!

214
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,900
Stop this!

215
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,200
-Please.
-Things will get better.

216
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,910
Will that continue, or…

217
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,860
I’m just curious.

218
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,780
It’s fun, and suddenly it…

219
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,750
Cheon Song-yi, you…

220
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,100
Where have you been? What took you so long?

221
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,960
I was… acting in the film.

222
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,170
Nonsense.

223
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,430
I checked the film’s schedule!

224
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,570
You didn’t have a scene yesterday.

225
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,150
Mr. Do, tell me.

226
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,120
You know her schedule the best.

227
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,920
Don’t tell me you two…

228
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,080
took a trip together last night.

229
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,680
Mrs. Cheon, I…

230
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,560
Blame me if you want.

231
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,020
I proposed it.

232
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,050
It’s not about who proposed it.

233
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,200
You went to a trip anyway, right.

234
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,300
You may be used to American custom,

235
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,750
but my daughter should not be that open.

236
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,810
You took out a girl without permission?

237
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,820
I’m sorry.

238
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,250
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

239
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,960
Ms. Cheon Song-yi, tell us.

240
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,700
Did Do Min-joon forced you to go with him?

241
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,000
No, it’s the other way around.

242
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,510
Hear that?

243
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,990
Then tell me, Mr. Do,

244
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,150
will you marry my daughter?

245
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,160
What are you talking about?

246
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,980
Why?

247
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,690
Silent treatment?

248
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,790
You take a girl you won’t marry to a trip?

249
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,330
Please tell your son to behave himself.

250
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,140
It’s inappropriate for a man

251
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,170
to have no plan for his future.

252
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,340
My son behaves very well.

253
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,660
He didn’t even have a girlfriend

254
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,550
before Ms. Cheon.

255
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,760
My boy is innocent.

256
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,710
Your daughter must have

257
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,240
seduced him to that

258
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,400
My daughter? How dare you?

259
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Hey, did you seduce him?

260
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,350
Well, you can say that.

261
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,640
No.

262
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,410
It takes two to tango.

263
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,900
You can't clap with one hand.

264
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,980
She’s not the only one to be blamed.

265
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,540
And

266
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,700
I can understand why you

267
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,210
blame the man.

268
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,550
I am terribly sorry.

269
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,260
How old is your son?

270
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,170
You’ve decided to stay?

271
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,650
Yes.

272
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,440
I don’t get it.

273
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,880
What can I do?

274
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,960
You stay even though you may die.

275
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,339
But think about it. No one’s immortal.

276
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,950
That’s life.

277
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,310
I’ll come around to it.

278
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,200
Is everything going well with you?

279
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,970
Well…

280
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,470
What?

281
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,420
No. Nothing.

282
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,200
Maybe it’s too far away?

283
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,220
Too heavy?

284
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Do Min-joon,

285
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,670
can you hear me?

286
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,930
You can, right?

287
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,060
You know what?

288
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,380
I just left you and I start to miss you now.

289
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,840
Can you teleport yourself here?

290
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,480
Oh? Oh? Oh?

291
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,370
Do Min-joon.

292
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,900
Why don’t you answer me?

293
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,810
You are making fun of me?

294
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,790
Just answer me!

295
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:07,950
No. Stop it.

296
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,270
You know how happy I am

297
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,720
to know you are listening to me?

298
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,430
Come! Come! Come! Come! Come!

299
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,490
Why? You don’t come?

300
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,300
I’m waiting for you.

301
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,840
OK. I’m coming.

302
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,400
Really? Hurry up.

303
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,410
Why aren’t you here yet? I can’t wait.

304
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,530
Just a sec.

305
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,090
OK.

306
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,850
[Cheon Soon-yi]

307
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,750
Hey, you!

308
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,160
Why aren’t you here yet?

309
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,970
Um…

310
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,380
I can’t make it there.

311
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,120
Why not?

312
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,950
Have you

313
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,320
lost your teleportation?

314
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,490
It’s not that. I’m in a mess now.

315
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,140
What’s wrong with you?

316
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,540
You ungrateful thing!

317
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,020
Have you gone mad?

318
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,340
Look what you’ve done!

319
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,480
Did you do it on purpose?

320
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,120
Dad,

321
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,690
Jae-kyung has confined his wife for 7 years!

322
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,370
His wife? Who are you talking about?

323
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,090
That woman is nothing but a toy.

324
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,010
I allowed her in because your brother liked her.

325
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,680
If he confined that mad woman,

326
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,410
she must have upset him.

327
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,450
And you prosecuted him

328
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,720
because of that?

329
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,460
You know who your brother is?

330
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,710
I did this because I want to see who he is.

331
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,590
I have to know what he is like,

332
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:53,650
and what he’s done before anyone else does.

333
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,490
Get out!

334
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,260
Now Jae-kyung is my only son.

335
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,680
Since now, you won’t enjoy any rights as my son.

336
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,170
Get out!

337
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,650
As Lee Jae-kyung’s lawyer, I’ll answer all questions.

338
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,930
You can join only if you don’t
interfere with the investigation.

339
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,250
But

340
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,240
Lee Jae-kyung is just a witness in this case.

341
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,850
Witness?

342
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,390
Excuse me?

343
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,590
The victim has been confined for 7 years.

344
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,040
She now accuses Lee Jae-kyung to be a suspect.

345
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,120
This is Ms. Yang Min-ju’s psychiatric history.

346
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,680
[Diagnosis]

347
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,820
From 2002 to 2004,

348
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,750
she’s been undertaking psychiatric treatment.

349
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,930
That happened when they were still married.

350
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:56,450
You can’t trust someone with mental issue.

351
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,350
That’s a record from ten years ago.

352
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:06,660
This is Ms. Yang’s diagnosis from yesterday.

353
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,460
She feels highly insecure under the pressure
caused by trauma.

354
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,310
But she’s not mentally challenged.

355
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:20,420
In fact she’s doing well
both physically and mentally.

356
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,820
You see this?

357
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,640
You see this, Mr. Lee Jae-kyung?

358
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,220
According to Ms. Yang Min-ju,

359
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,980
in the past 7 years, she’s been

360
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,200
confined in the asylum under Lee’s request.

361
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,650
Do you admit your crime?

362
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,770
No.

363
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,340
Has she really been confined for that long,

364
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,900
that would be the asylum’s problem.

365
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,840
We’ve checked this.

366
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:59,700
Ms. Yang called Mr. Lee many times from
Sky Mental Hospital and this is the record.

367
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,670
[Call records]

368
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,140
How would you explain this?

369
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,980
Sometimes I receive strange calls.

370
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,540
But I thought they were pranks.

371
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:15,180
I didn’t aware they were my ex-wife’s calls.

372
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,200
Is that illegal?

373
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,100
You colluded with the hospital’s director to…

374
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,240
Without any proof, you deem Mr. Lee to

375
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,710
be a criminal based on the victim’s testimony?

376
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,480
Do you think that will hold water?

377
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,960
Since Mr. Lee’s testimony contradicts
with Ms. Yang’s

378
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,210
we ask that two of you confront each other.

379
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,510
Do you agree?

380
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,200
Yes.

381
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
Tell me,

382
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,950
where is

383
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,380
my ex-wife now?

384
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,170
We can’t tell you.

385
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,440
Anyway, you can’t just bring a stranger home.

386
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,910
We will be in trouble too.

387
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,310
What are you talking about, mom?

388
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,560
You know her. She’s Jae-kyung’s wife.

389
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,600
You even attended their wedding.

390
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,130
Isn’t she mentally challenged?

391
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,720
But she’s Hee-kyung’s witness.

392
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,880
Also,

393
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,340
you know she’s been maligned and confined.

394
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,310
You’ll do everything for Hee-kyung, right?

395
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,380
Where have you been? It’s late.

396
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,540
I’ve been waiting for you.

397
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,530
Gotta prepare flowers for
Song-yi’s commencement tomorrow.

398
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,360
But it’s also your commencement, right?

399
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,830
It doesn’t matter.

400
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,190
My woman matters more.

401
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,750
God.

402
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,480

404
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,310
Ball-point pen?

405
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,670
This is special.

406
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,240
It’s also a recorder.

407
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,260
My dear brother Hee-kyung, happy graduation!

408

My dear brother Hee-kyung, happy graduation!

409
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,620
Wow.

410
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,680
I use it as a diary recorder.

411
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,480
Use it whenever you want to record things.

412
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,180
Hey, my little buddy will graduate soon.

413
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,580
Yo, my buddy, buddy, buddy. A grown-up now!

414
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,840
You will come to my commencement, right?

415
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,220
You bet.

416
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,440
My dear brother Hee-kyung, happy graduation!

00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,360
Where are you?

418
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,480
What’s wrong?

419
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,660
Well, I just want to have breakfast with you.

420
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,550
But I’m dealing with something urgent.

421
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:02,770
Why don’t you ask me for help? You’re alone?

422
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,940
With a friend.

423
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,860
Which friend?

424
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,130
Lee Hee-kyung?

425
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,880
No. Someone you don’t know.

426
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,480
Talk to you later.

427
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,890
OK. Call me when you’re… back.

428
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,630
This woman.

429
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,980
You don’t want to see my superpower?

430
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,670
How’s it? It’s not like taking a poster photo.

431
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,530
Did your man agree with this?

432
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:58,400
He’s not promised to marry you yet and
you’re choosing the wedding dress?

433
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,360
He promised with his action.

434
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,000
How?

435
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,740
He was about to somewhere far away,

436
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,410
but then he decided to stay for me.

437
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,370
Where was he going?

438
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,980
You don’t need to know about that.

439
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,190
But is it OK if he doesn’t go there?

440
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,550
I think so. Otherwise he won’t stay.

441
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:20,820
He must have his reason to go there.

442
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,630
Did you forced him to stay with tears,

443
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:30,740
saying you won’t see him again if he leaves?

444
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,290
You won’t come back?

445
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,420
You’ll just leave for good?

446
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,270
What if you don’t go?

447
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,760
Why must you go now?

448
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,720
You can’t just stay here with me?

449
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,980
Don’t be… silly.

450
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,570
I knew it.

451
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,920
Ask him what will happen if he doesn’t go.

452
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,050
Don’t ruin a nice and talented young man.

453
00:31:55,050 --> 00:32:01,540
And go ask if he will marry you
before you choose your wedding dress.

454
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,190
At least wait until he spells M for marry, OK?

455
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,590
I asked this before. Where’s your self-esteem?

456
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,270
Min-joon, we have to talk.

457
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,780
Come in.

458
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,940
I’ll get down to business then.

459
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,240
If it’s you, I’ll agree from my heart.

460
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,940
Well, thank you.

461
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,910
My mom’s tricky.

462
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,960
But I’ll handle this.

463
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,950
You can sign a contract, making some promises.

464
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,180
This works well. Very convincing.

465
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,340
Then my mom might agree.

466
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,530
With what?

467
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,900
Your marriage with my sister.

468
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,030
What?

469
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,270
I don’t ask for much.

470
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,380
One love for a life will be enough.

471
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,460
And you love stars with pure hearts.

472
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,660
That purity totally captures my heart!

473
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,000
I get you. But, Yun-jae…

474
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,630
But promise me, as a man to another man,

475
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,700
that you’ll make my sister happy forever.

476
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,390
She’s been through a lot.

477
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,940
My dad ran away.

478
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,290
My mom’s got mental problem.

479
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:39,460
She used to be obsessed with money.
My sister suffered a lot because of that.

480
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,360
I see.

481
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,790
So please, never let her cry.

482
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,630
From this perspective,

483
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,150
I’ll say,

484
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,800
you’d get a 60%.

485
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,400
I’ve been wondering why Song-yi

486
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,970
lives in her own world.

487
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,750
That turns out to be a family trait.

488
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,390
Also,

489
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:06,620
there’s someone you need to meet.

490
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,400
Excuse me.

491
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
Yes?

492
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,270
Can I help you?

493
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:28,110
Where’s the parking boy?

494
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,940
He might be in the toilet.

495
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,659
Then you park my car.

496
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,590
I don’t drive well.

497
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,489
Your car looks expensive. If I hit it…

498
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:41,110
Stop babbling. Just park my car.

499
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,980
You are paid to provide service.

500
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,280
Sir,

501
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,020
you don’t want to lose your job, do you?

502
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,860
What’s happening?

503
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,660
Honey.

504
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,190
Is the car rampaging?

505
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,570
But no one’s inside.

506
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,970
Who are you?

507
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,500
If you can’t even park your car without help,

508
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,200
then maybe you should not drive.

509
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,260
What?

510
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,350
I meet a nasty man today.

511
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,330
And a weird thing.

512
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,190
Why is that?

513
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,290
We met in a lift, right?

514
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,450
Yes.

515
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,520
You must have known that I’m not a good father.

516
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,170
But still I have to ask you.

517
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,280
Are you in good health?

518
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,010
I am.

519
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,780
Good.

520
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,210
To an old man like me, money means nothing.

521
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:38,570
Reputation will pass. Only health matters.

522
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,540
If I’m healthy, I can protect my loved ones.

523
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,650
I didn’t realize this when I was young.

524
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,190
I lost my money and reputation,

525
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,100
and so I thought I can’t protect my loved ones.

526
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,140
How stupid I was!

527
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,290
I should’ve been with them despite my failure.

528
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,090
I should’ve been with them.

529
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,420
It’s been years,

530
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,640
and there’s no way I can make up for the past.

531
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:17,790
As for you, no matter what will happen,

532
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,760
I want you to be with my daughter.

533
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,150
That’s all I ask from you.

534
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,370
I’ve failed to do this.

535
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,220
And if you can do this for me…

536
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,880
Well,

537
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,800
cheers.

538
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,210
How far away are we?

539
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,940
Don’t get cold.

540
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,030
Oh, we’re there.

541
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,590
No. You’re drunk.

542
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,720
There’re still 30 minutes’ left.

543
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,530
Why do we come in here?

544
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,340
Min-joon?

545
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,650
Min-joon?

546
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,820
What’s this…

547
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,250
What the heck?

548
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,220
When did you come back?

549
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,560
Um…

550
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,790
Just now.

551
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,550
What’s wrong with you, Do Min-joon?

552
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,940
You haven’t called me the whole day, and now…

553
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,880
What did you do to him?

554
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,060
You spat on him?

555
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,940
You gave him alcohol?

556
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,520
Oh gosh!

557
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,470
Why did you?

558
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,940
Get away.

559
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,870
Don’t treat him like this.

560
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,730
What?

561
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,070
Don’t ask.

562
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,750
I won’t tell you anything.

563
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,520
Min-joon.

564
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,400
Shush.

565
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,700
Yun-jae, that was…

566
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,260
I’ll keep your secret.

567
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,620
I promise.

568
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,260
Well.

569
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,460
OK.

570
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,410
Thank you.

571
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,660
Can I ask you a favor?

572
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,310
What do you want?

573
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,380
You’ve mistaken me.

574
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,110
I don’t do that…

575
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,370
Good.

576
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:01,930
How is it?

577
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,220
How is it?

578
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,900
Don’t make soup anymore.

579
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,700
I’ve got a question.

580
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,700
How much is the management fee here?

581
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,670
Why?

582
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,070
Maybe it’s because it’s winter now,

583
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:28,670
the electricity and gas charges are very high.

584
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,970
I heard that there is a progressive
tax on electricity recently.

585
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,020
The cost is very high.

586
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,130
And I rent this house on a monthly basis.

587
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:41,330
The management fee, the rent… They cost a lot.

588
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,880
You’re… desperate for money?

589
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,480
No, that’s not what I mean.

590
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,740
You live next door to me.

591
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,220
And we often have meals together. At night we…

592
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,550
You know what I mean.

593
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,680
The management fee and rent…

594
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,940
That’s a waste of money.

595
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,590
What? Can you just make it clear?

596
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,160
Forget it.

597
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,480
Never mind.

598
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,140
Let’s go there tonight.

599
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,300
What?

600
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,520
Where?

601
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,060
Namsan Tower

602
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,530
I thought you want to go.

603
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,790
Sure.

604
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,800
I’ll dress up for that.

605
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,870
And you should dress up too.

606
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,630
Why make a fuss?

607
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,360
She’s in my room.

608
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,630
She had some porridge in the morning.

609
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,900
Sorry for always bothering you.

610
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,520
Don’t be.

611
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,420
A keen prosecutor’s protecting his witness.

612
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,720
You’ve done nothing wrong.

613
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,560
Don’t be sorry.

614
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:23,470
I felt weird after marrying Jae-kyung.

615
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,700
He was perfect in front of others.

616
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,570
But to me, he seemed to be hiding something.

617
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,700
Then

618
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,050
one day,

619
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,880
I accidentally found something I should not see.

620
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,120
I found a recorder

621
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,750
in late Han-kyung’s home

622
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:49,360
What’s in the recorder?

623
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:58,470
Anything about Han-kyung?

624
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,900
Jae-kyung knew nothing about it.

625
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:06,110
I didn’t want him to know.
So I kept it elsewhere.

626
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,050
I should’ve called the police at that time.

627
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,770
It’s all my fault.

628
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,670
I was terrified.

629
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,880
Where is

630
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,530
the recorder?

631
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:26,160
[Pawn-broker]

632
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,820
February 23, 2002.

633
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,490
Chaired a leaders’ meeting in the morning.

634
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:01,100
Afternoon, I went to the store
for Hee-kyung’s graduation gift.

635
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:07,170
In the evening, Jae-kyung asked to talk
and we decided to drive out.

636
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,340
Han-kyung, have some juice.

637
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,800
Jae-kyung prepared it for you.

638
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,920
Wow, thank you.

639
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,160
I’m going out to meet my friend.

640
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,270
Dad and mom will also be back late tonight.

641
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:25,130
Is that so?

642
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,820
I will also go out with Jae-kyung later.

643
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,410
Then no one will be home tonight.

644
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,940
Han-kyung,

645
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,190
let’s go.

646
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,390
Jae-kyung,

647
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:42,130
I’m not feeling well for a while.

648
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,360
What’s wrong?

649
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,350
No idea.

650
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,060
Why do I…

651
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,150
feel drunk?

652
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,190
You’re not drunk.

653
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,300
You’re feeling numb.

654
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,150
What?

655
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,580
You will feel feeble soon.

656
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,670
Unable to walk.

657
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,320
Short of breath.

658
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,070
Tongue paralyzed.

659
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,710
Then you’ll fall asleep deeply.

660
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,270
What… are you talking about?

661
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:29,170
You’ll be found in the middle of an express way,

662
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,710
dying of DUI.

663
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,370
Jae-kyung…

664
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,900
I always want you to disappear.

665
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,440
You get in my way.

666
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:52,120
I don’t have any chance because I was younger.

667
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,900
Save me, Jae-kyung.

668
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:55,590
Open the car boot.

669
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,080
What?

670
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,370
The car boot.

671
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,860
OK.

672
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,710
Is there a brush?

673
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,550
Hand it to me.

674
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,500
Are your arms or legs broken?

675
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,900
Why need me when you have the superpower?

676
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,710
Get in the car.

677
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:03,070
That’s Cheon Soon-yi, right?

678
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,660
Is that her boyfriend?

679
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,900
Why are you standing there?

680
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,150
Come here.

681
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,880
This is a must for every new couple.

682
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,260
I don’t get it.

683
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,140
This is childish.

684
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,770
Lock it up.

685
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,190
Here.

686
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,700
Come here.

687
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,970
Throw it inside.

688
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,110
Then how can I unlock it?

689
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,950
No one wants to unlock it.

690
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,630
We need to lock our destiny together.

691
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,480
So that we’ll never be apart.

692
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,560
We’ll be each other’s belonging and chain.

693
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,210
That’s the whole point.

694
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,400
There you go.

695
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,940
Do Min-joon. I’ve locked you up.

696
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,320
We are bound together.

697
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,610
You don’t seem to be happy?

698
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,650
No.

699
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,250
I’m happy.

700
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,240
Hey, I’m Cheon Soon-yi.

701
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,740
You’ve been too calm.

702
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,300
And I’m not satisfied with that.

703
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,550
Be more active, will you?

704
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,370
My god.

705
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,100
Here.

706
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,360
My god. Darling.

707
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,370
I’m so touched.

708
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:43,340
You like it?

709
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,720
Yes.

710
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,110
Ice cream.

711
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,570
Ah.

712
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,100
Darling,

713
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,590
try this on.

714
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,830
Fits me right.

715
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,110
Looks good on me?

716
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,270
Yes.

717
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,900
I love you, darling.

718
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,720
-Fantastic.
-What can I help you?

719
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,050
Do you have ice water?

720
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,380
Yes.

721
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,020
You finish?

722
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:20,800
Not yet.

723
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,650
Finish the rest and we’ll leave.

724
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,870
What bothers you?

725
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,500
Nothing.

726
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,810
We’ve done the lock thing and had dinner.

727
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,980
Nothing bothers me.

728
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,600
Cheon Soon-yi.

729
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,060
What?

730
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,430
Hello?

731
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:02,810
OK

732
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,210
I’ll be there soon.

733
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,210
Who’s that?

734
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,040
Something happened.

735
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,590
You go home first.

736
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,750
Alone?

737
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,650
Go home first.

738
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,070
Not your home.

739
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,970
Our home.

740
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:28,270
Our home?

741
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,710
You mean your home?

742
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:32,320
Right.

743
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,030
There’s something I have to tell you.

744
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,530
I see.

745
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,950
Cheon Soon-yi.

746
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,750
Yes?

747
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,690
I’ll be back soon.

748
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,090
Wait for me.

749
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,270
OK.

750
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,230
I’ll be waiting for you. Come back soon.

751
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,590
A new round of fate has started.

752
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:51,450
I’ve been waiting for that planet for 400 years.

753
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:56,280
3 months later I’ll be back to my last planet.

754
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,540
A woman making a scene after drunk.

755
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,590
An arrogant and ignorant woman.

756
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:04,090
Annoying.

757
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,110
And that’s my neighbor.

758
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,810
There’s someone. I wish she won’t forget me.

759
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,100
Just when I am about to go back.

760
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,290
Why now?

761
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,280
Today, I told Cheon Soon-yi my identity

762
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,660
in order to push her away.

763
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,720
I hope she’ll run away from me,

764
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,210
and she’ll fear me.

765
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,020
If I miss this chance to come back,

766
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:45,050
I’ll disappear from this planet.

767
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,220
And soon… I’ll die…

768
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:55,070
Will it be OK if you stay?

769
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,560
It’s OK.

770
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,870
Seriously?

771
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:12,300
♫ Could I look at you ♫

772
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:15,220
[And soon… I’ll die…]

773
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:19,180
♫ Could I say hello with a smile ♫

774
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:26,900
♫ I turn and stand with stupid expectations ♫

775
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:34,150
♫ I see you from afar ♫

776
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:39,500
♫ Your beautiful long hair ♫

777
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:46,510
♫ and bashful smile ♫

778
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:53,400
♫ are as always, as always ♫

779
00:55:53,400 --> 00:56:03,500
♫ But the one besides you is no longer me ♫

780
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,650
Are you seeing your seniors?

781
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,730
Or are you having a job interview?

782
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,570
I’m making a proposal.

783
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:22,010
♫ I hide from you ♫

784
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,380
Cheon Soon-yi.

785
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:27,860
♫ in the street corner ♫

786
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:25,990
Ms. Soon-yi

787
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,260
Soon-yi.

788
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:35,520
♫ With tears, I turn and stand, like a fool ♫

789
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:31,510
This is… for you.

790
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,440
No way.

791
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:43,880
♫ Far away, you’re calling my name ♫

792
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:40,180
Open the car boot.

793
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,030
You finish?

794
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,840
Not yet.

795
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,480
Finish the rest and we’ll leave.

796
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,270
Cheon Soon-yi.

797
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,780
I don’t know how much time I still have.

798
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:21,390
Maybe I shouldn’t say this,

799
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,530
but I will try my best

800
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:30,190
to be at your side as long as possible.

801
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:34,330
I’m not sure how long will that be,

802
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:44,660
but I will love you with my whole heart.
