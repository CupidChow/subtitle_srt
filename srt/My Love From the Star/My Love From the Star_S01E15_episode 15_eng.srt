1
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,480

2
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,540
Dad?

3
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,590
What have you been doing that you just came now?

4
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,800
Why are you only showing up now?

5
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,800
I am sorry, my daughter.

6
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,000
What were you doing during these 12 years...

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,800
What were you doing while I was growing up by myself...

8
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,000
Why did you only come now?

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,900
Why?

10
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,100
I am sorry, my daughter.

11
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,300
I am sorry, my daughter.

12
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,400
What is this?

13
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,600
How could you do this?

14
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,800
Why did your face get so old?

15
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,600
Huh?

16
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,610
Why are you like this?

17
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,060
Here, cheers!

18
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,130
Why, when you can't even drink?

19
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,680
Just 1 sip.

20
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,150
You can't!

21
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,280
Long time ago, when it snowed, 
you said this while bringing fried chicken.

22
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,800
"When will you grow up and have a drink with me?"

23
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,500
Now it's not just one glass, but I drink it by the barrel.

24
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,590
What is this, you rascal?

25
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,420
I am just saying I have grown to that extent.

26
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,370
Didn't you miss me all this time?

27
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,220
Thankfully, you became famous.

28
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,260
It is very good for me because you are famous.

29
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,700
Because I could see you on TV, in movies and in newspapers.

30
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,840
How tall did she get...?

31
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,830
How much prettier did her face get ...?

32
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,620
I watched everyday.

33
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,020
Then I...

34
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,280
I couldn't see you.

35
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,260
I didn't even know whether my father
 was alive or had passed away.

36
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,790
The manager who was taking care of me...

37
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,520
He said that it was difficult dealing with the fact that
his father was on a respirator in the hospital for several years,

38
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,790
but I envied even that.

39
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,240
Even a father on a respirator

40
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,650
is better to have . . .

41
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,440
Even a father like that, I wished I had one by my side.

42
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,730
I thought like that.

43
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,320
Didn't you hate me?

44
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,310
Do you know so little of your own daughter?

45
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,760
I'm the kind of kid who regrets getting angry
 the moment I turn away.

46
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,760
That night when I ran out like that,
 I almost got into an accident.

47
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,900
As I was returning home, I thought, 
"I must tell Dad about this."

48
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,460
I thought I should tell you that I almost 
got into an accident and some ahjussi saved me.

49
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,340
But when I arrived home, you were already gone.

50
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,800
I am sorry.

51
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,040
It is okay.

52
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,410
When I opened my eyes after the surgery,

53
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,990
thank you for not running away and staying next to me.

54
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,290
For just doing that,

55
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,540
my 12 years of hating you has disappeared completely.

56
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,250
But Dad, did you by chance remarry?

57
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,940
By chance, I don't have some kind of half siblings, right?

58
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,580
Nothing like that.

59
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,940
What?

60
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,640
Did you stay alone without dating anyone all this time?

61
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,840
How about you? You don't have a boyfriend?

62
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,510
I don't have one.

63
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,740
You really don't have one?

64
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,530
I told you I don't have one.

65
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,610
I take after Mom in that respect, too. 
And, my standards for men are really too high.

66
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,800
There aren't any men like you out there.

67
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,940
Hey, what crazy notion is that?

68
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,150
It will be a big problem if you meet a guy like me.

69
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,850
Is that so?

70
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,820
I guess (it is possible).

71
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,810
Though I couldn't quite pinpoint, 
there was a man similar to you, Dad.

72
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,060
Someone who is unnerving, since he
 might disappear at any moment.

73
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,050
Something like that.

74
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,450
Now it is all finished.

75
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,140
I liked him by myself.

76
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,390
Why are you like that?

77
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,880
Even though I don't know what kind of punk he is,

78
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,540
I don't think you liked him by yourself. How special is my daughter?

79
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,840
That punk probably likes you a lot as well.

80
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Dad, you don't even know.

81
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,380
As I've been living,

82
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,490
a person that I love, to love me back,

83
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,240
that wasn't an easy matter.

84
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,770
A miracle isn't something else,

85
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,740
that's a miracle.

86
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,040
  February 6th, 2014

87
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,240
 The record of my last month on Earth.

88
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,840
  My Love From the Star 
Episode 15

89
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,570
Please stop it.

90
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,710
That has to be it!

91
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,050
There must be a secret tunnel somewhere!

92
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,240
Is it not the door?

93
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,740
It isn't the wall either!

94
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,030
Do...Do...

95
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,120
Do Min Joon?

96
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,540
Last..time...

97
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,510
you had something urgent, right?

98
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,120
I am sorry about that time.

99
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,280
I came again to say what I couldn't finish.

100
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,870
Yes, let's do that.

101
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,810
But...

102
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,760
I think it'll be a different story.

103
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,940
This might be something you can't believe, too.

104
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Can we go somewhere we can't be recorded?

105
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,240
Why?

106
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,240
What did we just hear?

107
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,640
 That I went to the cruise on the day of the incident,

108
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,560
 it is the truth.

109
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,800
 Then how about being captured by
 your building CCTV at the same time?

110
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,840
 That...

111
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,840
 That's because I can teleport through space.

112
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,550
 Is this man playing with us public officials now?

113
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,580
 Again.

114
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,340
 Please continue.

115
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,800
 The reason I'm telling you this is because I realized that
I have to reveal my identity and become honest

116
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,550
 in order for you to believe the rest of my story.

117
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,040
 The reason I couldn't reveal the truth was also

118
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,800
 because of my secret that I couldn't tell anyone.

119
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,500
 When I went to the cruise that night, I overheard 
the culprit of Han Yoo Ra's incident speaking.

120
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,740
 I couldn't understand it exactly at the time,

121
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,610
 but when I put it together later

122
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,310
 it turned out to be about that incident.

123
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,640
 Who is that person?

124
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,000
 It's the Managing Director of S &amp; C Group,

125
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,830
 Lee Jae Kyeong.

126
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,110
 Do you have proof?

127
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,610
 On the USB that Han Yoo Ra held,

128
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,010
 there is footage of the two of them together.

129
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,490
 However the original was a copy protected USB,

130
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,100
 and this one is

131
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,900
 the end result of that video shot again.

132
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,940
 Was there a crucial shot taken
 of Han Yoo Ra's death or something?

133
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,640
 That isn't the case.

134
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,620
 However, at a minimum, it shows that the two were lovers,

135
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,570
 and could serve as evidence that Han Yoo Ra was
 forcing Lee Jae Kyeong into a marriage using his weakness.

136
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,130
 I hope you two would investigate using this evidence as the basis.

137
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,780
 If both of you will trust me,

138
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,210
 for the period of one month,

139
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,910
 I will help you in any way possible.

140
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,160
Can you believe.... teleporting?

141
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,690
I'm going to go insane.

142
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,300
This doesn't faze you one bit, Prosecutor?

143
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,320
You just listened calmly, earlier.

144
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,120
I, too, don't know how much to believe,

145
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,340
but the one thing that's for certain,

146
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,150
it's true that Do Min Joon isn't an ordinary person.

147
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,580
The thing that's making me crazy now is,

148
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,260
in my head, I'm saying, "it can't be, it can't be,"

149
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,490
but I do believe him.

150
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,460
In my heart,

151
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,480
somehow,

152
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,040
that person, Do Min Joon.  That punk who I cannot understand!

153
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,000
I didn't bring this for me to eat, why don't you have some?

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,980
I'm fine.  You eat it.

155
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,700
Are you waiting for someone?

156
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,270
No.

157
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,210
From when I came in, your gaze looked as if you were 
expecting something but were totally disappointed.

158
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,040
And aren't you waiting for a call even now?

159
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,560
Do you think that there are people
 who still don't know that I was admitted?

160
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,070
Of course not.  Not in this country, there aren't.

161
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,830
From Japan, China to Malaysia,
 it was the main topic of all Asian news.

162
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,320
Even Badookyi (common puppy's name) in our neighborhood
 knows that you were hurt and hospitalized.

163
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,140
Your (popularity) still isn't dead yet.

164
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,410
But if you aren't on the internet, 
you could still not know, don't you think?

165
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,660
Who?  The alien?

166
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,250
Oh, hey! Hey, shhhhh!  You must be crazy. Really.

167
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:30,140
Look at you!  Surely you don't seriously
 think that man is an alien, do you?

168
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,070
I don't, well...

169
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,780
And you as a person

170
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,810
shouldn't be like that.  You shouldn't do that.

171
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,650
What did I do?

172
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,240
To put it bluntly...

173
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,880
While rescuing you, Hui Kyeong just got surgery 
and hasn't come to his senses yet.

174
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,760
But you thinking about another man, that really isn't right, is it?

175
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,320
Hey, you.  If it weren't for Hui Kyeong,

176
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,160
you would have crossed the Jordan River already!
(She would have been dead)

177
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,410
When Hui Kyeong ended up like that while trying to save you,

178
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,580
that alien or ogre punk hasn't even shown his face
when you almost died!

179
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,570
You said that he disliked you.

180
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,120
Do you think he actually dislikes me?

181
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,860
Don't you think he was just saying that?

182
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,300
Words of women and words of men are different.

183
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,500
A woman disliking someone can mean a lot of different things,

184
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,000
but if a man states decisively that he dislikes you,

185
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,050
it is because he sincerely dislikes you.

186
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,500
He really dislikes you.

187
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,400
With this, just forget about that alien,

188
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,890
and try making things work with this generation's
 man of pure heart, Hui Kyeong, now.

189
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,720
That's the answer.

190
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,190
Don't wait any longer.

191
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,490
Who's waiting?  I'm not waiting.

192
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:51,750

193
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,180
I'll be going home and will return.

194
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,110
Is there still no improvement (in his condition)?

195
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,750
They said the surgery went well, why still hasn't he...

196
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,770
Don't worry too much.  He'll be better soon.

197
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,680
If it weren't for Hui Kyeong, I might have died.

198
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,990
Yeah,

199
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,400
I heard.

200
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,740
Oh yeah, Oppa, perhaps,

201
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,700
did a detective come looking for you?

202
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,930
Actually, one came for me last time and kept asking.

203
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:40,000
He was under the wrong impression that 
another man was Yoo Ra Unni's boyfriend.

204
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,870
So I told him that you were Yoo Ra Unni's boyfriend.

205
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,850
I know.

206
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,260
Did I happen to put you in a difficult position?

207
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,120
I think there was a misunderstanding.

208
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,250
Han Yoo Ra and I

209
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,120
weren't in the sort of relationship that you were thinking.

210
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,320
I don't want to speak ill of the dead,

211
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,170
so I can't say any more.

212
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,550
I see.

213
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,930
I only believed what I saw.

214
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,490
I said something I probably shouldn't have.

215
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,520
But did you tell that

216
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,950
to anyone

217
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,400
besides the detective?

218
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,110
Other than Hui Kyeong...

219
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,570
Uh.

220
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,840
You did?

221
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,670
 Cheon Song Yi's Knight is 2nd Generation Chaebol Lover!

222
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:18,220
Whoa! Did you see it?  When Cheon Song Yi had her accident,
 some man caught her and rescued her.

223
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,280
It says that he is a second generation chaebol.

224
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,710
-Awesome! There's someone with such good body among
our nation's 2nd generation chaebol?!
-Girls who have it made can do anything!

225
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,250
When she fell, the one who caught her and 
rescued her was a flower boy chaebol's son, and...

226
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,720
I mean, I can't reach Managing Director Lee Jae Kyeong at all.

227
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,530
I think I'm going to have to cancel that contract.

228
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,990
My daughter is getting discharged tomorrow,

229
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,430
having signed a contract without 
her consent has been bugging me.

230
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,440
Did you relay my message?

231
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,410
 Yes, I gave him the message, but he said 
that it wouldn't be possible to do that.

232
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,700
He can't?  Why not?  I said I'd return the contract fee.

233
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,710
 Please review the contract details.  If you back out 
of the contract, you have to pay three times the fee.

234
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,120
We aren't strangers, and you want us 
to pay three times the amount?

235
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,070
I said I'm going to have to speak directly to Managing Director Lee Jae Kyeong!  Exactly where is he right...?

236
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,490
I'll call you back later.

237
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,670
I'm sorry, but did you just say 
Managing Director Lee Jae Kyeong?

238
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,030
Yes, Mr. Do Min Joon.  I said 
Managing Director Lee Jae Kyeong, why?

239
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,520
Ah, don't you know? My Song Yi and
 S&amp;C's Managing Director Lee Jae Kyeong

240
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,020
signed a management contract, you see.

241
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,470
They've agreed to provide everything, 
be it the best of cars or managers.

242
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,540
Is this something that Cheon Song Yi agreed to?

243
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,230
Well, my Song Yi hasn't yet...

244
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,410
Well, that's that.  But there was something
 that I wanted to ask you when I saw you.

245
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,030
What makes you so great?

246
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,390
Excuse me?

247
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,760
Do you perhaps have bad vision?

248
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,780
My daughter is Cheon Song Yi!  You dare 
reject my daughter?  Who are you to do that?

249
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,210
Excuse me, but I think you've gone too far.

250
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,450
What do you mean "who do you think you are"?

251
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,330
And who are you?

252
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,020
I'm Do Min Joon's father, why?

253
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,560
Excuse...

254
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,750
My daughter is Cheon Song Yi, the nation's goddess.

255
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,840
All men's "wannabe," the one 
they all want to date, Cheon Song Yi.

256
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,180
Isn't that history?

257
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,490
Well, my Min Joon graduated from Harvard!

258
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,660
And his looks, as you can see, aren't lacking one bit!

259
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,510
Really... Father.

260
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,240
Have you any idea how preciously I've raised this kid?

261
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,070
What good is having graduated from Harvard 100 times over?!
  He has no sense of responsibility.  None!

262
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,740
If he decided to become the manager he should have 
stuck it out until the end.  He quits in the middle?!

263
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,860
Ah... you're referring to that manager thing?
It wasn't Min Joon who said he'd do it,

264
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,230
but your daughter pleaded so desperately that
he handled a few things temporarily!

265
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,160
Just stop it now.

266
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,940
Stop what, you punk! What is the meaning of this?

267
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,840
Did I tell you that it wouldn't work or didn't I?

268
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,210
Have you no work or money?!

269
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,510
Why did you suddenly become Cheon Song Yi's manager?

270
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,710
Oh.  My.  God.  
As I stand here and listen...

271
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,630
People are lined up to become 
Song Yi's manager, I'll have you know.

272
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,780
Then you can simply pick from the people who lined up
and make him/her the manager!

273
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,250
Let's go in.

274
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,480
No big loss here.  My Song Yi signed with S&amp;C,

275
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,990
and will get engaged to Hui Kyeong as well!  Ridicul...

276
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,240
Why are you just standing there, you punk?  Let's go in.

277
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,410
Lawyer Jang.

278
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,890
Oh, I'm sorry.

279
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,010
I got too immersed into the role...

280
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,850

281
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,400
Are you perhaps still upset with what happened earlier?

282
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:58,770
I wasn't planning on doing that, but as that lady provoked
 me so much that I did it without meaning to...

283
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,670
What?

284
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,200
What are you thinking about?

285
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,220
Ah, just...

286
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,590
Because of Cheon Song Yi signing with S&amp;C?

287
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,950
That among many things...

288
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,570
About how (the mom said) Cheon Song Yi would get engaged?

289
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,170
Cheon Song Yi doesn't like that man.

290
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,840
You said she liked him as a friend, though.

291
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,620
That's just as a friend, of course.
  Isn't "friend" clearly different than a "man"?

292
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,590
How can there be friendship between a man and a woman?

293
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,490
That's all an old concept.  People these days aren't that way.

294
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,870
They can be friends between a man and a woman.  Freely.

295
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,180
Well, that's all before Cheon Song Yi's accident.

296
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,970
He saved her from near death this time, so I'm sure
her feelings towards him would change.

297
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,600
Did I not save her?  Didn't I?!

298
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,320
I saved her many times over, really.

299
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,990
Do you suppose...  that is why

300
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,830
she felt for you a bit?

301
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,870
But this time, that guy saved her, so maybe she'd feel towards...

302
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,540
Would you like everyone who saves you?

303
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,010
Then I'm guess the policemen and firemen
 would hog the whole nation's love!

304
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,260
But, why are you getting mad?

305
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,670
I'm not getting mad. It's because you keep talking nonsense.

306
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,440
Ah, really!

307
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,860
Look, you are getting mad but say you aren't.

308
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:26,780
"Actor Cheon Song Yi, is she engaged to
 the 2nd generation chaebol lover who saved her?

309
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,790
Engagement my foot.

310
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,470
Nickname...?

311
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,580
Is that like writing a singer's name that one likes?

312
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,770
 Nickname:  Lee Mi Ja

313
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,040
 Nickname: Bae Ho Jjang

314
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,260
 What do you mean Cheon Song Yi is engaged? Haha.

315
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,010
 It sounds like a groundless rumor.

316
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,110
 If you live long enough, you can see smoke rising out of
a fire-less hearth. (groundless rumor)

317
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,120
 - What's this lame olden tone?
- How the heck do you know whether it's groundless or not?!

318
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,930
 Get lost!

319
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,190
These Byeongja year Jookbang throwing...

320
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,190
Where do these little punks still wet behind their ears,
talking down to...

321
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,840
♫   Where are you?  ♫

322
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:43,040
 How are you recoveri... Jeez! 
 ♫ Still yet you have not seen my heart. ♫

323
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,020
 Are you in your right mind to sign with S&amp;C...

324
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:53,040
♫  I am longing for you again and I want to see you.  ♫

325
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,130
 Perhaps, are you really engaged...
 ♫ I can't forget you.♫

326
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,750
 Have you perhaps heard of Hyoong Joong Saeng Jin...
(Can't forget a person whose been in one's heart for so long)

327
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,380
♫ I love you. I need you. ♫

328
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,940
 I miss you.
 ♫The words I want to say to you.♫

329
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,070
 ♫ The words which make my heart race. ♫

330
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:21,640
 ♫ I love you. I need you. ♫

331
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:30,670
♫  Even if I'm elsewhere, I will forever gaze upon you only.  ♫

332
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,040
 I miss you.

333
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,540
 You have put in 5 incorrect unlock patterns.
Please retry in 30 seconds.
(they draw pattern instead of password)

334
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,880
Umm... are you okay?

335
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,170
Mr. Do Min Joon, what are you doing right now?

336
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,470
Nothing...much...

337
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:07,140
You just appeared suddenly in another person's hospital room.
How did you appear here?

338
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,920
Did you really...

339
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,810
teleport... or some such thing?

340
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,680
Well... at times... uh...

341
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,280
if I'm busy or the traffic is heavy, then I...

342
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,710
This is really unbelievable.

343
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,080
Oh, my phone.

344
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,140
I mean I was just about to check my text,
 but how can you... when...?

345
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,840
What were you doing with my phone?

346
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,540
- It wasn't precisely I was  doing  anything with it...
- This is really unpleasant!

347
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,980
Will you get out?

348
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,510
Aren't you going to check your messages?

349
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,650
What?

350
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,930
You said you were about to check your text.

351
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,850
None of your business.  Will you get out, please?

352
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,570
We aren't that close anymore, no?  Even if we run into each other
 as we pass each other by, I said...

353
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,460
not to acknowledge me, didn't I?  Did that sound like a joke?

354
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,810
What the heck?

355
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:37,250
There's no message.

356
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,270
There isn't.

357
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:46,040
Whether or not there is, it's do as I see fit 
with my messages. So just leave.

358
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,680
I heard you signed with S&amp;C?  Your mother said.

359
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,130
That's right. I did it. Why (do you want to know)?

360
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,680
You will break the contract, right?

361
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,520
--Why would I?
--What?

362
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:09,510
There's no reason not to go forth, when such a large
company says it'll set up an agency just for me.  I should be thankful.

363
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,290
You can't.  Break it!

364
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,250
- What does it matter to you?
- You said yourself that you wouldn't sign that contract!

365
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,910
Well, that was then...

366
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,450
But, Mr. Do Min Joon, how did you know that?

367
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,370
I was talking to Hui Kyeong in my house. So how did you know?

368
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,620
Hui Kyeong wouldn't have told you this himself...

369
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,750
You wouldn't...

370
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,900
You can even eavesdrop on other people's conversations?

371
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,640
Well... it's not like I heard all of it.

372
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,920
 Did I just relive the kiss with that jerk?
Nothing?  What, nothing remains?!

373
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,000
 There wasn't a single moment when he liked me?!
Arrrrgh!  That wretched bastard!  How do I avenge myself?!!!!

374
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,700
 If you bother him, I'm going to move in and live with him.

375
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,280
Just how much of it did he hear...

376
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,240
Perhaps...

377
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,000
were you in my shower...?

378
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,530
In the bathroom...?

379
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,010
Mr. Do Min Joon, are you a pervert?

380
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:20,810
What are you thinking about now?  
It's not like I hear everything that goes on!

381
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,370
Just at times when I'm concerned about something
I can overhear.  Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to live from fatigue!

382
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,980
It isn't like... you steal a look like a peeping Tom?

383
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,860
What kind of person does this woman think I am?

384
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,300
I'm not that kind of person.

385
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,790
How should I know, when you're an alien?
You might be wandering about looking at everything.

386
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,120
I said I didn't.

387
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,740
Why aren't you leaving? Get out! Get out, you pervert alien!

388
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,090
I've never heard such a ridiculous accusations ever in my life.

389
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,440
I told you I am not a pervert!

390
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,420
Didn't you say it was time for him to gain consciousness now?

391
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,100
Why is he like this still?

392
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,320
From the MRI result, I saw traces of damage

393
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,970
where the brain is connected to the spinal cord.

394
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,370
Seeing that his coma is continuing,

395
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,890
I predict that there is some tiny damage
 to the axons due to the head injury.

396
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,660
So just tell me when he will be okay.

397
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,330
Yes, okay.

398
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,100
Because he is young and healthy,

399
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,010
without any aftereffect, I think he will be
 okay in a few days at the earliest.

400
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:24,390
But if he doesn't wake up by then,
 his condition will become more serious.

401
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,630
Well... at this point, we're very positive about his condition.

402
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,860
Please don't worry too much, and

403
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,430
let's watch him a bit more, Chairman.

404
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,590
Then please go home.

405
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,390
You, work hard.

406
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,300
What is it?

407
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,080
I heard that you made a contract with Cheon Song Yi.

408
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,980
Yeah, I did.

409
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,860
Cheon Song Yi's schedule, and her every move,

410
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,930
I'm managing all that now.

411
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,290
But don't be too concerned.

412
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:33,770
At least for you, I won't get rid of her.

413
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,650
Why? Did you come here to prevent that?

414
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,160
If I reveal everything about you to the world,

415
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,780
what do you think would happen?

416
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:50,170
This accident, not only just Cheon Song Yi, 
but you also put your brother in danger.

417
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,140
Go ahead and try exposing it.

418
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:58,620
But you... are someone who can't be accepted by the world.

419
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,350
If my identity is revealed, your identity will also be revealed.

420
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,700
Out of the two, which would be more shocking?

421
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,910
To people, you're scarier than a murderer.

422
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,320
You're a monster.

423
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,710
How many does that make?

424
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,610
Cheon Song Yi, Han Yoo Ra.

425
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,760
Other than them, the people you got rid of or were going to get rid of, how many are there?

426
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,910
Why are you taking such risks?

427
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,880
You already have so much.

428
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,760
Do Min Joon, listen carefully.

429
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,760
There might be many people in this world,
 but there are only few that are necessary.

430
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,350
All the rest are unnecessary, just like insects.

431
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,350
But once in a while, those insects get in the way.

432
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,330
If that happens, it's only right that I get rid of them.

433
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,690
That way I can move forward.

434
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:00,580
It's not evil, but a greater good

435
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,620
for the general population.

436
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,970
But Do Min Joon, you have become very necessary in my life.

437
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,920
If you would change your mind a little,

438
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,890
everyone can be happy.

439
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:19,640
If you lend me your abilities, I'll watch your back.

440
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,550
Then there's nothing we can't do.

441
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:27,560
Of course, the one you want 
to protect at all costs, Cheon Song Yi,

442
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,250
will be safe.

443
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,130
How about it?

444
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,070
I'll think about it.

445
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,770
On the condition that you will not harm anyone anymore.

446
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,850
Okay, you probably don't trust me enough yet.

447
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,990
Think carefully.

448
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:54,360
I will make sure to keep this promise.

449
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,550
 She's going to get engaged to Hui Kyeong. She's going to get engaged to Hui Kyeong. She's going to get engage to Hui...

450
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,690
 Wake up!

451
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,670
 Wake up!

452
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,270
 Let's sleep just a little longer!

453
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,930
 Hey, get up!

454
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,020
 Honey, I bought bell peppers and olive oil.

455
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,890
 Oh, good job!

456
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,130
 What is my honey doing?

457
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,800
 Rolled eggs, but it's all burnt.

458
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,410
 I like my rolled eggs a little burnt.

459
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,320
 Really?

460
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,470
 That's a good thing.

461
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,000
 Oh, don't! Don't, don't!  Don't do that!

462
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,660
 She said that it tickles!

463
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,390
 She said to stop!

464
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,670
 She said not to do that!

465
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,080
 Don't do that!

466
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,930
 It tickles!

467
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,470
 These clementines are sweet.

468
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,030
 Are they yummy?

469
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,010
 Have a good day.

470
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,170
 I'll miss you!

471
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,010
 Ta-da! It's chicken and beer, just the way you like it.

472
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,490
Now, she won't have any problems in her daily life.

473
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,510
But since she did receive surgery,

474
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:24,230
there's a possibility of further bleeding or secondary infections.

475
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,160
Especially because she also had pulmonary edema,

476
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,990
she has to stay away from any cardiac activities 
that will cause her to breathe hard.

477
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,600
If there are any signs of fever or abdominal pain,

478
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,410
you should be admitted right away.

479
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,960
Yes, thank you.

480
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,280
Thank you, Doctor.

481
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,500
See, you can't be moving too much. 
Yet you want to go back to filming?

482
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,720
It's okay.  I just have to be careful.

483
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,280
Your daughter has to start working again,

484
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,320
so that, Dad, you can see me everyday on the TV, 
in the movies, and in the newspapers.

485
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,040
Song Yi, if you're doing this because of the money...

486
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,650
I thought about a lot of things because of what has happened.

487
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,530
If a person lives really long, maybe 100 years?

488
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,350
And there are a lot of people who don't live that long.

489
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:17,070
But in that time, how much of that 
will I be doing the things that I want to do?

490
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,480
The time I spend eating really good food.

491
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,320
And the time I spend talking to the person I like.

492
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,470
And the time I spend having sincere and truthful conversations.

493
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:36,940
The time holding my dad's hand like this.

494
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,640
We've lost too much time compared to other people.

495
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,450
I want to hold it for a long time, my dad's hand.

496
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,800
And I'm going to act, which I like, for a long time, too.

497
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,500
And I suppose I do need to count the calories,

498
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,200
but I'm going to go around looking for good food and try it all.

499
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,270
When I fell from the wire,

500
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,610
I'm going to think that I already died once,

501
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:06,070
and use the rest of my time wisely.

502
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,600
Director called.

503
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,480
He said he'd use a stunt woman for that wire scene instead.

504
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,830
He asks if you'll be able to come back starting tomorrow. 
What do you think? Will you be okay?

505
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,720
But why don't I see Yoon Jae?

506
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,220
Did he greet you?

507
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:36,020
He didn't, did he? This punk keeps avoiding you.

508
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,820
I will just leave.

509
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,100
Let's see (each other) again soon.

510
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,340
I will come.

511
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,810
You have to come right away, okay? Promise?

512
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:04,690
Excuse me...My Song Yi said she hates it very much, so...

513
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,220
Even then, we already prepared from our side, so...

514
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,720
No, even then...

515
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:15,560
My daughter said it is very burdensome...

516
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,600
Hello.

517
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,700
It is like that, but...

518
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,540
what can she do since they are all here?

519
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,530
Hi, I am Cheon Song Yi's mommy.

520
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,250
Please take good care of her.

521
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,520
Yes.

522
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,710
Just entrust her to us and go. 
 We'll take good care of Cheon Song Yi.

523
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,530
I know huh? I think it is better for me not to be here.

524
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,730
Then, please take care of her.

525
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,570
Mom, I told you I didn't want it.

526
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,000
Ah, I don't know. Just tell them to go.

527
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,180
Hello? Mom?!

528
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,620
What is this?

529
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,660
Didn't she say that they were already here?

530
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,500
Get in.

531
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,300
My next door neighbor, Mr. Do Min Joon,

532
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,530
thanks for your intention, but someone is going to pick me up.

533
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,060
That "someone" left.

534
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,270
What? Why?

535
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,360
I sent them away.

536
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:39,960
 Did you check?

537
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,540
 Yes, they said that the fee 
for canceling the contract was deposited, but...

538
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,450
 Now you can go.

539
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,020
 The contract between Cheon Song Yi and S &amp; C Group is dissolved,

540
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,930
 and the details of that have already been sent.

541
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,150
 -Even so....
 -I am Cheon Song Yi's legal representative.

542
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:55,720
 You can't take an actress that 
you aren't contracted with in your car.

543
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,990
 If you continue to argue, then I can file a restraining order.

544
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,560
 Please leave.

545
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,080
How did you send them away?

546
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,030
What good will that do for you?

547
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,680
Oh, I told you I didn't want to.

548
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,480
I will count to 3. You better let go of me.

549
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,130
1, 2, 3, 3.5

550
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,280
Let's at least hear some reasons.
 Why are you doing this to me?

551
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,900
Didn't you say you needed a manager? I will be your manager.

552
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,690
You want me to keep an alien as my manager?

553
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,840
Then what do I need to pay that kind of manager with?

554
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,240
Meteorites, sunlight?

555
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,660
Don't mess with me.

556
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,720
Mess...

557
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,420
Do Min Joon,

558
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:52,150
I am trying to keep a distance from you,
 so I've been using formal speech. Haven't you noticed?

559
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,910
I think we aren't that close, 
to the extent that you can use informal speech.

560
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:57,030
You also, use formal speech to me.

561
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,150
Do you know how many years older I am than you?

562
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,410
What is the reason for you to become my manager suddenly?

563
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:11,540
Are you suddenly curious about celebrities?

564
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,090
Or are you bored now that winter quarter is over?

565
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,520
Or maybe you're still curious about the 
connection between me and that girl from your past.

566
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,930
Think whatever you feel comfortable with.

567
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,250
Don't follow me. It is uncomfortable.

568
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,980
Come after you are done. I will wait for you.

569
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,710
No, Do Min Joon. Don't wait for me.

570
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,430
Leave.

571
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,160
Cheon Song Yi, I...

572
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,970
Do Min Joon, we...

573
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,860
are nothing, right?

574
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,310
You said that

575
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,830
there is nothing left between us.

576
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,890
Didn't you say you don't like me?

577
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,700
Then act like a man who dislikes me.

578
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,480
Unni, let's go.

579
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,710
Wait a moment.

580
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,460
Yes.

581
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,890
You feel okay?

582
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,800
Yeah.

583
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,150
I was told that Hui Kyeong hasn't gained consciousness yet.

584
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,230
He will wake up soon.

585
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,780
The doctor said that.

586
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,400
Why?

587
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,430
I should have gotten hurt to the extent that I wouldn't be able get up,

588
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,300
but I'm here like this. So do you hate me for it?

589
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:12,360
I am tired, so can you please leave me alone?

590
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,930
Not too long ago before the accident occurred,

591
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:20,160
Hui Kyeong said to me;

592
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,730
that we shouldn't see each other even as friends

593
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:28,890
and that he won't meet me anymore.

594
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,200
He said he didn't want to make me feel unhappy.

595
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,440
Because...

596
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,870
he, who likes you,

597
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,210
feels unhappy.

598
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,420
About my heart hating you,

599
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:52,630
can you understand?

600
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,450
How can you understand?

601
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,540
I don't know if Hui Kyeong to you

602
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,140
is a good friend who you feel 
comfortable with if he is next to you.

603
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,290
To me, he is...

604
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,570
the one who I want to have even if
 I have to throw away everything I have.

605
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:17,700
That person only sees you, but

606
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,800
what could I have done?

607
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,480
Because you have everything and
 don't have to be jealous about anything,

608
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:31,980
I must have looked like I was living a pathetic life

609
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,670
hating you and being jealous behind your back.

610
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,410
I...

611
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,670
Cheon Song Yi,

612
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:52,410
when Hui Kyeong caught you when you were falling,

613
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,180
I prayed that I wish I could die instead of him.

614
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,930
I guess Hui Kyeong felt the same as me.

615
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,980
That's why he ran to you.

616
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:17,960
His heart made my heart

617
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,880
bend down and kneel in surrender.

618
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,280
So, Cheon Song Yi,

619
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,590
I will ask you for a favor.

620
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,510
Hui Kyeong...

621
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,240
can't you accept him?

622
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,540
Yoo Se Mi.

623
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:44,730
Hui Kyeong is miserable because he can't have you,

624
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:48,110
but you wouldn't become miserable for having Hui Kyeong.

625
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,190
He will cherish you and love you forever.

626
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,030
Between the two of us,

627
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,350
shouldn't one of us be happy?

628
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,820
Managing Director Lee Jae Kyeong.

629
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,200
Long time no see, Mr. Detective.

630
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,080
Can we talk for a moment?

631
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,590
Because there are many who are watching.

632
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,160
Let's do that.

633
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:14,020
Since you're here as a reference, technically
 we should have prepared a warrant for you.

634
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,660
So thank you for coming in like this.

635
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:18,710
It is nothing.

636
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,680
Let's start.

637
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:30,660
What is it that you are curious about me?

638
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:38,470
What?

639
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,060
Why was Jae Kyeong asked to go there?

640
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,070
Does this involve his ex-wife?

641
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,290
Through the prosecution,

642
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,770
and using all of our channels,

643
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,680
find out the details.

644
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,190
If this gets out to the media, we will be in deep trouble. 
So keep it under tight control.

645
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,870
 I probably would have died if Hui Kyeong hadn't saved me.

646
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:02,990
  Yeah, I heard.

647
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,530
  But about that truth,...

648
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,740
  did you tell

649
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,010
 anyone else other than the detective?

650
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,590
  Other than Hui Kyeong...

651
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,180
  Oh.

652
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,750
  Oh Yeah?

653
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,970

654
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,870
  Weren't you in a coma?

655
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,600
  Then please go home.

656
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,820
  You, work hard.

657
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:03,550
  What do you think will happen if I revealed everything you did?

658
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:08,750
  You put not just Cheon Song Yi, 
but also your younger brother at risk with this incident.

659
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,830
 Reveal it.

660
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,670
  But you...

661
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,880
 are someone who can't be accepted by the world.

662
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,120
  If my identity is revealed,

663
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,600
  your identity will be revealed as well.

664
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,070
  Which one of us is more shocking to them?

665
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:27,200
  To people, you are a monster who is

666
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,130
  scarier than the killer.

667
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,810
  How many people has it been?

668
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,710
  Cheon Song Yi, Han Yoo Ra.

669
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,710
  Other than them, the people you got rid of or were going to get rid of, how many are there?

670
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,850
Okay, we'll start.

671
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,940
Excuse me! Here!
 Excuse me!

672
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:01,110
I am Cheon Song Yi.

673
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,110
When will they shoot me?

674
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:07,580
The scenes ahead took longer, 
so I think you have to wait a lot longer.

675
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,400
Then, you should have told me sooner--!

676
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,790
Excuse me?

677
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,860
It would be nice if you told me sooner,

678
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,250
since everyone is busy.

679
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:21,490
Please wait inside. It will take a few hours.

680
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,250
A few hours?

681
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:30,320
Oh nice. It is cold. Waiting a few hours to shoot one scene...

682
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,370
It is the first time I am experiencing 
this kind of thing. It is refreshing.

683
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:15,390
Cut! Okay! 
 Good. Good.

684
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,010
Director, no. 28 scene is a day scene and
 the sun has set, so I guess we can't take that scene.

685
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:24,360
-It is Cheon Song Yi's scene, right?
 Please tell her that it is postponed til next time. 
- Yes.

686
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,040
You have worked hard, Director.

687
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,870
Ah, Se Mi.

688
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:30,380
Your emotion was very good today.

689
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,070
By chance, you aren't dating, are you?

690
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,900
What do you mean by dating?

691
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,090
The scene we'll be filming tomorrow...

692
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,760
Now, now, we're done filming for today!

693
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,010
You've worked hard. 
 You've worked hard.

694
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,430
--Youngest!
--Yes?

695
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,240
Find Cheon Song Yi and tell her that her scene is canceled.

696
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,840
Yes.

697
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,720
How is our schedule for tomorrow?

698
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,450
Ah, tomorrow? Let's see...

699
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:59,610
You've worked hard. 
 You've worked hard.

700
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,640
What is going on?

701
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,740
It is cold.

702
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,370
Excuse me!

703
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,910
Excuse me?

704
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:40,820
Is no one here?

705
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,230
Hello?

706
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,540
Did everyone except me leave?

707
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,910
Really?

708
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,900
I am Cheon Song Yi.

709
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,770
Unbelievable. Seriously!

710
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:04,200
I told you to leave.

711
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,580
I told you I would wait.

712
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,140
Why?

713
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,420
Why did you wait for me?

714
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,280
I have to

715
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,820
protect you.

716
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,760
What do you mean protect?

717
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,710
You need to tell me specifically
 in order for me to know, because I am stupid.

718
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,040
Tell me why you are doing this to me so that I can understand.

719
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,000
Are you a player, Do Min Joon?

720
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,780
If not, is it fun to make people confused?

721
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,390
After doing this, you're going to say that you're sorry for misunderstanding. There was nothing I could do.

722
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:56,390
You looked like the girl before.

723
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,450
You make me a fool.

724
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,820
You said you didn't have (any feeling for me), not even once!

725
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:14,530
Didn't you say you have never liked me,
 or had your heart flutter because of me,

726
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:19,110
or worried about me sincerely or envisioned the future with me?

727
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,910
Didn't you say I was the substitute of that girl?!

728
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:34,760
I think you don't know about this yet, so I will tell you clearly.

729
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:38,870
I also hate you now, Do Min Joon.

730
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:40,660
I hate it more because you are like this.

731
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:45,710
So please disappear from my sight...no...from my life.

732
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:47,940
Please.

733
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:50,930
And...

734
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
how selfish you are...

735
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,080
I would like it if you knew.

736
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:55,640

737
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,010
Now this....

738
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:03,090
what are you doing?

739
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,840
The most selfish thing

740
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,650
I can do to you.

741
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,590
  ♫ If you breathe,

742
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:18,400
  ♫ a warm wind blows.

743
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:25,780
  ♫ If you laugh, it shines in my eyes.

744
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:33,850
  ♫ Please stay there. Because it is you,

745
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:40,270
  ♫ Because sometimes, you lean on my shoulder

746
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:44,680
 ♫ I am here.

747
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,840
 The elevator must have broken down.

748
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,940
 Are you perhaps ...

749
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:21,240
 are you Cheon Song Yi's dad?

750
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,180
 Who are you?

751
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,020
 Cheon Song Yi has always wanted to see you a lot.

752
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,540
 When she wakes up...

753
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:33,240
 she would be very happy if you were by her side.

754
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:39,340
 Are you ... close to my Song Yi?

755
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,310
 I...

756
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,640
 like Ms. Cheon Song Yi a lot.
