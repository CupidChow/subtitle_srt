1
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,680
I wanted to help people who were in trouble 
 with the powers I had.

2
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,120
In order to do so, I had to reveal to them the truth

3
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,370
that I wasn't human.

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,860
 Is anyone there?! Somebody please help me!

5
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,360
 Please save me, save me!

6
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,850
 My leg!

7
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,920
 It's him!!

8
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,190
 That guy used sorcery,

9
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,180
 and lifted the boulder with a simple stare.

10
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,140
 All the bad luck occurring in the village is definitely
all because of him.

11
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,430
 CAPTURE HIM!

12
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,450
 Where did he go? He's a Dokkebi (a goblin)!

13
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,840
The  gratitude that they felt from my help lasted only momentarily,

14
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,060
and I... because of these powers I possessed,

15
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,090
and because of the fact that I was different from them,

16
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,130
I became an object of fear.

17
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,730
And even in the case of someone 
 I had befriended over a longer period of time...

18
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,120
it was the same.

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,220
 Tell me.

20
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,710
 We've been friends for ten years now, 
 what is there you can't say to me?

21
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,190
 Exactly where are you telling me you're going?

22
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,540
 Do you trust me?

23
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,890
 Of course I do, more than I trust myself.

24
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,310
 I meant about my appearance,

25
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,900
 about how I look today 
 compared to when we first met 10 years ago.

26
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,970
 I always told you,

27
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,990
 you, my man, look exactly the same,

28
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,970
 from the day we first met until today.

29
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,950
 Aren't you curious why?

30
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,730
 That, of course, would be because you were born with traits that prevented you from aging significantly-

31
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,740
 No, that's not the case.

32
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,190
 Don't be surprised.

33
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,880
 I am... not from this planet.

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,400
 What?

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,390
 I am another species from another planet.

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,580
 Are you teasing me?

37
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,840
 No, it's the truth.

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,110
 Can you prove it to me then?

39
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,560
 Prove it to me! Then I will trust your words.

40
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,070
 If not, I will consider it a mockery and-

41
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,050
 Are you hurt?

42
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,130
 S- s- s- spare me, please-

43
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,020
 Why would I ever...

44
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,880
 Help... Somebody help me! AAH!

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,110
Through enough experience I learned

46
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,310
that in order to not lose anyone 
 I would have to conceal my identity thoroughly.

47
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,280
And today, in order to lose Cheon Song Yi,

48
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,910
I told her my identity.

49
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,630
With the hope that she would run away from me,

50
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,450
...and fear me.

51
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,630
Twelve years ago, the person who saved your life.

52
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,260
Didn't you wonder who it was?

53
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,770
The person who saved you then... was me.

54
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,490
There were no other reasons for saving you.

55
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:26,040
Back then, you and the girl from 400 years ago,

56
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,930
...the owner of this hairpin, resembled each other.

57
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,130
You resembled her so much, 
 enough to confuse me for a split second.

58
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,790
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,040
The owner of this hairpin... 400 years ago...

60
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,890
How would you know the face of someone who lived back then?

61
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,460
Then are you implying that

62
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,250
you've lived for 400 years or something?

63
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,890
You're right.

64
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,650
I came from the outerspace to this place 400 years ago,

65
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,570
and was unable to return to my planet, and

66
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,910
I lived here for 400 years.

67
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,950
Let's go home, Do Min Joon,

68
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,890
It seems like our Do Min Joon is still very ill.

69
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,910
You said it didn't matter

70
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,910
who I was.

71
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,650
I am this kind of person.

72
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,290
Does it still

73
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,890
not matter?

74
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,180
What happened just now?

75
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,900
How did you do that?

76
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,790
Do you still not understand?!

77
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:13,320
If I set my mind to it, 
 I can hurt you right at the spot.

78
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,170
So,

79
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,870
run away while I give you the chance.

80
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,750
GO!

81
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,090
I'll hold on for just a moment.

82
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,670
It's because my legs are trembling too much.

83
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,230
Let's just say that you're right.

84
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,240
Let's say that, just like you said,

85
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,350
you can hurt me if you wanted to.

86
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,930
But then why did you do it?

87
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,450
Why did you save me so many times?

88
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,850
Why did you do everything I wanted you to do?

89
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,370
Why did you listen to everything I said?

90
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,970
Why did you protect me? Why?

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
I told you.

92
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,570
It's because you resembled that child.

93
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,220
I thought there might be some sort of connection 
 between the two of you.

94
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,260
But that doesn't seem to be the case.

95
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,300
If you are just Cheon Song Yi,

96
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,320
I don't care what happens to you.

97
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,880
I can't believe it. Is he joking?

98
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,880
An alien...?

99
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,010
He's the one who needs to go to the hospital.

100
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,880
Claiming to be that man...?

101
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,390
...Do Min Joon?

102
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,050
DO MIN JOON! AAH!!!

103
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,890
Please go in safely.

104
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,820
What's wrong with the car?

105
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,930
Why isn't it starting?

106
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,570
I'm famished.

107
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,100
If he was going to say useless stuff, 
 he should've at least fed me first.

108
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,980
I thought this was a date!

109
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,190
Honestly?!

110
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,870
What is this?!

111
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,800
You came from a different STAR?! You're an ALIEN?!

112
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,950
If you are an alien, I am a vampire!!!

113
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,970
 From the time I was 20 years old, I haven't aged. 
This face, this skin ...

114
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,530
They all say it. That I'm like a vampire.

115
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,670
Calling me ANTISEPTIC BEAUTY!!!

116
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,170
What do you know, you grim reaper goblin, sea anemone!

117
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,750
You monster-like bastard!!!

118
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,510
  My Love From The Star 
Episode 13

119
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,590
Who could be the one to tell the prosecutor about me?

120
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,310
Who do you think it is? 
 The person who knew about that truth is....

121
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,350
Cheon Song Yi. There is no one else, 
but Cheon Song Yi.

122
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,900
Obviously, it was probably Cheon Song Yi.

123
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,810
If you don't take care of matters at the right time, there are always these troublesome situations which arise!

124
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,980
But the thing is...

125
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,800
if you calculate how Cheon Song Yi knows that fact,

126
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,110
it's because of you.

127
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:02,020
Because you wanted your rival to know about our 
relationship and kept giving hints here and there.

128
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,480
That is how Cheon Song Yi knew about our relationship.

129
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,700
Are you saying this is all my fault?

130
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,400
There's no use in giving me the evil eye.

131
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,770
You can't do anything to me.

132
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,580
That's why I killed you.

133
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,220
You've already done too many things.

134
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,090
You think you can cover them all?

135
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,940
An interesting bastard appeared.

136
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,750
It is the first time I've seen that kind of bastard.

137
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,160
He has such a strange ability.

138
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,130
I don't know about his identity.

139
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,760
That's why it's more entertaining.

140
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,330
I definitely can't win going head to head with him, but

141
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,400
there's a very absurd weak point

142
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,230
that I know of.

143
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,400
Cheon Song Yi.

144
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,330
That's why I decided to play a game

145
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,810
using that weak point.

146
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,810
I will unconditionally win the game.

147
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:13,380
You're going to play a game with a person loving a person?

148
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,110
Yeah.

149
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,330
You also lost

150
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,150
in that game.

151
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,320
I wanted to look at you guys for a long time.

152
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,970
But why do you guys

153
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,480
provoke me?

154
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,170
The CCTV was malfunctioning.

155
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,190
And the security company claims that they do not 
know how the museum door was opened either.

156
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,100
They're in the middle of repairing it again.

157
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,900
Well whatever the case, since they say that there 
were no cultural heritage pieces damaged or stolen,

158
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,710
it's a real relief.

159
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,610
And...

160
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,470
I found a precious photo. This is it.

161
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,330
It's a photo from 1910.

162
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,540
It's when we opened our university.

163
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,540
Among these people, wouldn't  that  person be present?

164
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,000
Are you talking about the anonymous donor?

165
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,310
When we were founding our school he provided us
with the enormous funds, and

166
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,320
each difficulty we faced, he provided us with scholarships

167
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,840
and research funds, that person.

168
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,050
If it weren't for that person, even our museum would

169
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,070
have had a tough time being built.

170
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:38,130
Then how about displaying this photo at the time of 
our school's 100 year anniversary exhibit?

171
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,160
Let's try to do that.

172
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,010
Why did you go to that extent?

173
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,090
I guess Cheon Song Yi must have been very shocked.

174
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,360
She must have.

175
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,540
Then she didn't run away?

176
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,830
Yes.

177
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,700
Even though I did it to make her run away.

178
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,670
But still, why did you have to say those things?

179
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,930
You could have just cleanly cut off all contact 
and just moved like I said, why...

180
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,420
By chance, can't you erase her memory?

181
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,330
Excuse me?

182
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,630
Erase what memory?

183
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,260
There are things like that in the movies.

184
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,360
The thing where an alien would push on something like
a remote, and it totally erases someone's memories.

185
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,590
Can't you do that?

186
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,020
That's a movie.

187
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,640
You have the ability to stop time and you have psychokinesis.

188
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,880
A person that can do most things, 
why don't you have that one?

189
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,830
You really don't have it?

190
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,860
I don't have it.

191
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,630
Man, it seems so good to just push something "beep"
and memories become erased...

192
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,420
I told you I don't have it!

193
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,310
I guess. Now you don't know when you 
will lose the abilities you have now.

194
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,160
You can when you can, and you can't when you can't.

195
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,480
Well, your superpower is hit-or-miss now.

196
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,040
This is so disquieting.

197
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,620
What can I do in the future?

198
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,880
Now I have to leave soon.

199
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,430
We can't go together.

200
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,520
I can't stay either.

201
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,320
The only thing I can do,

202
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,330
I think, is to disappear well.

203
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,970
There's nothing I can do here now.

204
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,480
Whether we eat a meal together,

205
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,680
whether we take a walk,

206
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,980
whether I congratulate her on a good day,
 because I can't do those things.

207
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:41,130
She, even if I am not here,

208
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,960
eats tasty things, takes walks,

209
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,330
as she has good days. So that she can live well,

210
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,480
I will do the things I can do.

211
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,170
What is it that you can do for her?

212
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,200
  I will do what you want.

213
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,040
 Aren't you hoping that I'd take all the blame

214
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,000
 and disappear?

215
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,800
  If I say that I would do that,

216
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,350
  then

217
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,030
 will you stop here?

218
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,010
What is it?

219
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,190
Huh?

220
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,910
You go crazy for roasted sweet potatoes. Eat some.

221
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,220
Nothing will go down.

222
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,100
Even water, I have to hit my chest to make it go down.

223
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,300
It is a big problem.

224
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,880
This is the initial stage of love sickness, however I look at it.

225
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,510
What on earth did he say?

226
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,890
What he said was...

227
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,260
Yeah?

228
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,310
He is....

229
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,640
What is he?

230
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,640
You can't tell anyone, okay?

231
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,480
Tell me.

232
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,370
He said he is an alien.

233
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,050
You're not shocked and you're not laughing either?

234
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,440
Now even the excuses are evolving.

235
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,770
Excuse?

236
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,440
When I first confessed my love to a man...

237
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,190
He said...

238
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,300
 I'm joining the army.

239
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,690
He got caught a month later while 
trying to hook up with someone at a night club.

240
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,240
The second guy said this.

241
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,620
 I am going abroad.

242
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,440
A year later,

243
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,390
I met him again while eating sashimi in Soraepogu.

244
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,600
But do you know what case bewildered me the most?

245
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,050
What is it?

246
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,420
 I received a divine calling.

247
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,830
 I am going to accept it.

248
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,130
And he rolled his eyes and foamed at the mouth.

249
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,950
I really thought that that man was going to
 become a shaman priest.

250
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,190
But, then, he got married at the church not long after.

251
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,570
A clergyman even conducted the ceremony and
 the church choir sang for them...

252
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,170
So they were all lies?

253
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,700
That's right, to get rid of me.

254
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,010
But this case is too much. He, being an alien.

255
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,880
But there wasn't just one or two strange things.

256
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,420
The glass case broke in front of me when he told me that.

257
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,810
Is he like Uri Geller or something?
(self-proclaimed psychic)

258
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,610
You know, the psychic who was on TV a while back.

259
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,330
Claiming he got his superpowers 
after seeing an UFO and whatnot...

260
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,310
Bending spoons with his gaze...

261
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,880
I don't know, I don't believe those kind of things,
 Do they even make any sense?...

262
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,350
But you have less pride than I thought.

263
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,720
How much must you have clung to him 
that the man made up such a ridiculous lie?

264
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,210
That he's an alien.

265
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,640
That's a 100% lie 
 or that person is mentally ill!

266
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,170
I can't stay like this.

267
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,200
Why?

268
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,130
I need to check.

269
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,600
I am calling you from here.

270
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,850
I will acknowledge if you come.

271
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,460
Do Min Joon!

272
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,610
Please save me!

273
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,990
Please rescue me!

274
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,290
Why is she like that?

275
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,040
That's what I want to say.

276
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,220
I guess she is a crazy girl.

277
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,400
Let's go.

278
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,950
Do Min Joon!

279
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,720
I'm here on Bukhan Mountain!

280
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,520
I'm in danger now!

281
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,160
I am serious!

282
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,850
PLEASE SAVE ME!
PLEASE SAVE ME!

283
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,830
I knew it would be like this. What alien?

284
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,360
Superman, my ass.

285
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,290
-Kang Da Jung 
 -Present.

286
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,000
-Kang Yi Jin. 
 -Here.

287
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,240
-Go Yong Min 
 -Yes.

288
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,070

289
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,520
-Kwon Hyeok Jin. 
 -Yes.

290
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,150
-Kwon Hyun Joo. 
 -Yes.

291
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,320
-Kim Min Kyung 
 -Yes.

292
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,690
We will end it here for today.

293
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,140
Why?

294
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,100
Try leaving.

295
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,100
What?

296
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,930
Bypass me. If you're an alien, 
 can't you leave because I'm blocking your path?

297
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,260
Try getting out. Teleport. Can't you do such a thing?

298
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,540
Get out of the way.

299
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,810
You aren't, right? You aren't an alien, right? 
 I know you aren't!

300
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,700
What are you doing? People are looking at us.

301
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,920
Fly.

302
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,360
What?

303
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,050
I told you to try flying.

304
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,900
You can't fly? Do you need a costume to fly, like Superman?

305
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,550
Don't kid around.

306
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:46,460
I look like I'm kidding around, right?  When I do this, it's really annoying ans it looks like I'm joking around, right?

307
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,970
My mood was exactly like that.

308
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,710
You aren't...

309
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,970
You aren't that, right? You aren't.

310
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,990
I dare you to leave! If you leave me again and go,

311
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,810
I will scream and say that you...

312
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,470
are an alien.

313
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,060
You see people looking at me, right? If I scream,

314
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,260
it will spread far and wide via SNS in one hour.

315
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,380
A rumor of some college professor being an alien.

316
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,440
Cheon Song Yi, seriously, you are...

317
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,390
Why? You believed me?

318
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,790
You said for me not to trust you. You were the one
 who so kindly told me not to trust anyone.

319
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,370
But then why do you believe me?

320
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,850
If you leave me behind and go alone,
I won't end with screaming.

321
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,930
I will report to the police that there is an alien out here, 
and I will write to the Blue House.

322
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,980
What is it? In America... NASA or something.
Anyway, I will tell them, too.

323
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,810
Anyway, I'm going to do it all, so be prepared.

324
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,990
You took me as an easy girl. 
I am a girl who will do it if I say I'll do it.

325
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,470
What is it that you want?

326
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,590
Eat with me.

327
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,840
Where are we going?

328
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,970
You said you would eat. 
I'll decide where and what we will eat.

329
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,870
Why are you getting on the highway?

330
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,200
Can you split the sea in two or something?

331
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,600
Stop it.

332
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,050
I saw that you can eat seafood and 
Chongak kimchi (halved radish kimchi) well last time.

333
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,480
Aliens also eat that kind of thing?

334
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,070
You don't get energy by charging with electricity?

335
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,840
Hey!

336
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,440
Your skin doesn't peel off?

337
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,330
You know, they usually have reptile-like 
things inside their bodies and have blue blood.

338
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,970
My skin doesn't peel off. I don't have reptiles 
inside my body. Also, my blood is red.

339
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,960
Furthermore, our star's people are far more beautiful 
than you people.

340
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,560
If they come to my star, they will be far below the average. 
But they make movies like "Alien" and "Planet of the Apes,"

341
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,270
setting up prejudices against aliens,

342
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,410
It wasn't only once or twice that I was
 exasperated watching those types of movies.

343
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,220
Do you want to have a drink?

344
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,020
- You brought your car with you. 
- Pssh, we can just wait for the 
alcohol to wear off before we go!

345
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,300
Don't get cute with me.

346
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,350
Let me just ask you one thing.

347
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,610
Before, you asked me

348
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,590
who I was.

349
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,460
 Are you asking me who I am right now?

350
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,600
  Don't you still know me? I am Cheon Song Yi.

351
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,130
  Yeah.

352
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,900
 You are Cheon Song Yi.

353
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,070
 There's no way you could be that girl.

354
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,500
  Who is that girl?

355
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,630
 Does she look a lot like me?

356
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,520
Was it her at that time?

357
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,650
The owner of the hairpin?

358
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,170
Yeah.

359
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,450
If she is the owner of the hairpin,

360
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,010
it means that she had her hair up in a chignon, right?

361
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,840
Did you, Mr. Do Min Joon, like a married woman?

362
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,330
I didn't see you as that kind of person.

363
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,240
You're curious about those things?

364
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,870
That's not the point.

365
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,110
Was she pretty?

366
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:28,320
Well, if she resembled me we can say that it was to the point your mouth hurt (from reiterating the same thing.)

367
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,020
But...

368
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,790
Was that really all it was?

369
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,250
Because the girl you liked

370
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,540
looked very much like me.

371
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,990
Is that all?

372
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,700
Yeah.

373
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,280
It started from a misunderstanding.

374
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,070
You resembled her so much, so I was attracted, curious, so

375
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,450
I wanted to confirm it.

376
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,850
That's why I stayed by your side.

377
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,550
But at some moment,

378
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,570
I thought you weren't her.

379
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,770
If I liked you even just a bit,

380
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,620
when I realized that you weren't her,

381
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,240
something should have been left, but

382
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,470
there was nothing left.

383
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,320
There was...

384
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,450
nothing left?

385
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,890
Yeah.

386
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,080
Not even for a moment,

387
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,460
you didn't like me?

388
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:50,700
 ♫Coincidentally  you approached me ♫

389
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,210
 ♫ And sheltered me in an embrace. ♫

390
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,720
 ♫ You blankly stared,  ♫

391
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:06,730
Not even once,
 ♫  "The word goodbye was handed over." ♫

392
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:13,450
getting thrilled because of me, or...
♫ You, who brushed by only in my dreams,   ♫

393
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:20,160
 ♫  Now are in front of me. ♫

394
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,710
 Can't you buy a cellphone?

395
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,530
 Isn't that a basic necessity for a manager?
 ♫  Love came. ♫

396
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:28,150
♫   You are leaving.  I was waiting.  ♫f

397
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:33,150
You have never been sincerely concerned about me? 
♫   You said I can't see you any more.  ♫

398
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,110
♫   Always like a fool  ♫

399
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,930
♫ The flowing tears say   ♫

400
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:44,550
 ♫ Now it's farewell. Goodbye. ♫

401
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,680
 ♫  Hello. Hello. Hello. ♫

402
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,090
 ♫  Hello. Hello. ♫

403
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,440
Without associating me with her,

404
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,350
was there really not even a moment when

405
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,620
♫   When we meet again    ♫

406
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,350
you liked me for who I am?
♫  I will say first  ♫

407
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,550
♫   I'm fine. Hello.   ♫

408
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,580
♫   Love came.  ♫

409
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,160
♫  You are leaving.   ♫

410
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,950
Imagining a future with me...
♫  I was waiting. ♫

411
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,850
You've never done this, even for a moment?
♫ You say I can't see you any more. ♫

412
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,470
♫ Always like a fool ♫

413
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,340
♫ The flowing tears say ♫

414
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,370
♫  Now it's farewell.  Goodbye~  ♫

415
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,050
-Must you hear my answer? 
 -Yes.

416
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,510
Answer me with certainty.

417
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,570
There wasn't. Not even for once.

418
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,730
But is it important to you,

419
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,810
more than me being an alien,

420
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,280
or me living here for 400 years?

421
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,220
Things like whether I liked you or not,

422
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,650
those trivial things are important?

423
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,750
Yes.

424
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,860
That is definitely more important 100 or 1000 times.

425
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:12,570
To me, what star you flew in from, whether you're an alien, vampire, monster, no matter your past, more than that...

426
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,060
The guy I like... No...

427
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,530
How the guy I liked

428
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,220
would have thought of me.

429
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,270
That is the most important.

430
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,910
Whether you truly liked me even for a moment,

431
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,010
or that you liked me as a substitute for
 the woman you couldn't forget,

432
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,510
which is why you were interested in me.

433
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,850
That is definitely more important.

434
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,390
Isn't that obvious?

435
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,560
You're a guy I used to like.

436
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,710
Regardless of whether it is true or not 
that you are the man that saved me 12 years ago,

437
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,400
I liked you just as the man, Do Min Joon,

438
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,240
who lived next door.

439
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,190
I liked you. Sincerely.

440
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:16,110
But... if you were a guy who saw me 
 in the place of another woman,

441
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,130
that is the worst.

442
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,290
If I continue liking you 
 despite knowing what kind of guy you are,

443
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,610
then I am even worse.

444
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,980
I will put an end to my feelings then.

445
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,560
You thought it over well.

446
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,260
I'm sorry for bothering you during all this time.

447
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,320
It won't happen again, so lay your worries down.

448
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,820
Although that won't happen again,

449
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,120
if my heart suddenly happen to race,

450
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,310
and I call you or go find you,

451
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:06,270
do what you originally did and cut me off.

452
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:11,590
Also, if we happen to meet each other somewhere,
 let's pretend to not know each other.

453
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,050
There's no reason for that now.

454
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:04,900

455
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,530
According to American psychologist Kubler-Ross' research,

456
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:27,120
a person who's deprived of affection, 
until he/she faces up to the reality,

457
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,390
he/she goes through 5 stages of emotion.

458
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,430
The first one is rage.

459
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,660
 Ah! I'm so pissed off!

460
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,920
 There's nothing left? Nothing? Nothing left, huh?!

461
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,840
 Never? Never? You've never liked me?!

462
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,140
 Not even once?!

463
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,110
 Ah, this bad jerk! How should I get revenge?!

464
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,890
The second one is denial of reality.

465
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,810
 Does that make sense? Alien?

466
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,120
 Are you kidding me? Who are you trying to kid?

467
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,100
 Are you making a movie?

468
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,550
 Is there not a hidden camera?

469
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,140
 Hey. Hey.

470
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,310
 It's you, right? 
Where is it?

471
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,330
 I know it. I knew about it all along.

472
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,910
The third stage is bargaining.

473
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,540
 That's true. He wasn't my type to start with.

474
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,440
 He's cold and rude. He even uses old Joseon swear words, too.

475
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,610
 That's right. He could actually be an alien.

476
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,420
 He's completely crazy.
 He's the craziest crazy guy in my life.

477
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,390
The fourth stage is a long period of depression.

478
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,690
 Why are you crying?

479
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,920
 Me?

480
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,720
 This is not crying. These are tears coming out from my eyes.

481
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,010
 It's not crying.

482
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:14,090
 What's different between tears coming out and crying?

483
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,640
 She's gone crazy recently.

484
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,070
Finally, the stage of acceptance comes.

485
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,450
 That's right. I'll get prettier, 
even though I'm so very pretty right now.

486
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,240
 I'll get impossibly pretty

487
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,020
 and make you regret so much!

488
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,020
As she goes through this sadness and suffering
triggered by loss,

489
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,720
in order to cure her pain,

490
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,430
she goes through the stage of lamentation.

491
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,780
However, men and women are very different in this stage.

492
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,040
Women try to make a better self,

493
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,450
or try to meet a better man.

494
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:00,740
So they focus on improving oneself. 
On the other hand, for men...

495
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,360
 Please eat something.

496
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,390
 I can't swallow.

497
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,990
They show signs of self-destruction, or 
due to the unbearable feelings of loss,

498
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,810
they are much more distressed than women.

499
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,610
 I think the house will be sold soon.

500
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,130
Is that so?

501
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,600
That's good.

502
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,000
 Yes. Someone spread a rumor that the house lot
 was unlucky, so I thought it might not sell,

503
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,280
 but someone gave a price better than the market price.

504
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,210
Is that so?

505
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,740
Really?

506
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,050
 The young person must have a lot of money 
 to already have paid the deposit in full

507
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,070
 without even looking at the unit.

508
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,180
 The person said he's nearby,

509
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,620
 so he said he'll drop by.

510
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,760
 I called to ask you to open the door for him if he comes.

511
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,630
 Looks like he's here already.

512
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:08,440
However, Lawyer Jang, I will not sign that contract.

513
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,640
 What? You can't do that!

514
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,570
 He already paid the contract fee.

515
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,430
Give back twice as much to him.

516
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,220
Please compensate him.

517
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,620
Why are you not signing the contract? 
I'm giving more than the market price.

518
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,840
If you're not satisfied with the price, I can double it.

519
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,750
You said you're selling the house. I'll buy it!

520
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,120
I'm not selling it to you.

521
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,200
Why won't you sell it to me?

522
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,850
You said you're going to move! 
Hurry if you're going to leave!

523
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:42,220
No matter who you sell this house to,
 I will move into this house for sure!

524
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,340
 The house next door is for sale. I'm going to buy it.

525
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,200
 Do so if you can.

526
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,400
 I'll be happy if you're living next door.
 Then I can see you more often.

527
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,430
There is this saying, "Hyoong Joong Saeng Jin".

528
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:24,550
It means I miss you so much that
 there's dust piling up in my heart.

529
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,320
Well, for her. . . Far from dust,

530
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,340
there isn't even a space for a tiny particle, it seems.

531
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,700
Is sorting through your feelings 
the same as tidying your room?

532
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:38,100
Is it the same as tidying your desk? 
How can you do it so fast?

533
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,700
You asked me if I'm mad right now?

534
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,060
Of course not. I'm saying I'm relieved.

535
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,360
The fact that she sorted through her feelings
 so fast and so calmly...

536
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,290
I think that's really fortunate.

537
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,040
I said I'm not mad!

538
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,900
By the way, I was offered a role in a movie yesterday.

539
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,780
Really?
- Yeah.

540
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,650
It's not a main character, but an important supporting role. Apparently it's a really fascinating character.

541
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,390
What is the character like?

542
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,820
She has a horrible personality.

543
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,340
- That's perfect for you.
- I know, right?

544
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,210
There's no need for me to have to act.

545
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,200
To be honest, aren't all main characters 
 more or less the same?

546
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,720
They're bright, nice and filled with a sense of justice.

547
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,240
I've always wanted to try out a 
supporting role with a strong personality.

548
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,140
It turned out well then. Cheon Song Yi, you're great!

549
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:28,150
Of course! No matter if it's a supporting
 character or a main character, I'm Cheon Song Yi!

550
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,070
No matter who is the main actor, I'll finish them off.

551
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,990
That's right.

552
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:40,590
 By the way, Hui Kyeong, 
a police officer came to look for me.

553
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,240
Why would a police officer come?

554
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,170
He asked me if Han Yoo Ra was seeing anyone.

555
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:53,270
After saying that, he asked me if
 Do Min Joon and Han Yoo Ra were dating.

556
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:56,220
But that's not true.

557
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:01,040
In fact... I know.

558
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,820
Know what?

559
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,830
The man that was dating Yoo Ra is Jae Kyeong Oppa.

560
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,110
- Really?
- Yes.

561
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,770
So I told the police that.

562
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,610
I thought it was a personal matter, so I wasn't going to say it.

563
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:24,120
But it seemed to be related to the investigation. Also...

564
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,140
You didn't want Do Min Joon to be suspected?

565
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,800
 If Jae Kyeong Oppa finds out, he'll be sad, right?

566
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,930
So you are saying, this is just for... right over here?

567
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,300
- Not that side? 
-- Yes. Yes.

568
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,830
From where to where does that camera cover?

569
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,470
From that signboard to the crossing.

570
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:52,200
- It's on for 24/7, correct? 
-- Yes, it's on for 24 hours.

571
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,910
 I want you to carry out what you've promised a bit sooner.
 I will give you 3 days.

572
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,290
There is nothing, nothing.

573
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,760
If Managing Director and Han Yoo Ra dated for real, 
 like Cheon Song Yi said,

574
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,890
they should have been caught at least somewhere. . . 
How many days have we been looking?

575
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:45,970
At Lee Jae Kyeong's office, in front of 
Han Yoo Ra's house, and all the nearby roads,

576
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,010
and even bus stops. We searched everywhere, but

577
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,210
there wasn't even a single shot of them together.

578
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:54,160
Huh? There is no single phone call history between them.

579
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,980
Don't you think Cheon Song Yi just said that?

580
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,650
Because it will be beneficial for her if Han Yoo Ra's case 
were to be found as homicide, rather than suicide.

581
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:05,360
Well, for now, "there was a man."

582
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,210
Like this. . . ?

583
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,860
What are you looking at so seriously?

584
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,390
These are the data I got from base transceiver stations. Here.

585
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,750
I confirmed with his office, and the days
 that Lee Jae Kyeong took off in the summer

586
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,120
were from July 24 to July 27.

587
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,120
The cellphone log shows that 
a signal was pinged in Cheongpyeong.

588
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,340
But then,

589
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:36,700
from Han Yoo Ra's side, from July 24th

590
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,420
to 27th... it's Cheongpyeong.

591
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,790
Could it be a coincidence?

592
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,560
I will change my last name (if I'm wrong).

593
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,330
Last year from July 24th to 27th,

594
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,740
get all the footage from the CCTVs
 at the tollgates to Cheongpyeong.

595
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,550
I will find this out even if my eyeballs pop out.

596
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:02,790

597
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,960
- I appreciate your hard work, Ahjussi. 
-- Yes.

598
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,140
Did my brother go in?

599
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,670
Yes, just now.

600
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,380
Ah, right. I left something in my brother's car last time.

601
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,640
I will go look for it for just a sec.

602
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,060
Sure, go ahead.

603
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,980
Give me the key. . .

604
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,630
Ah, yes. Here you go.

605
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,420
 Warning!  
You should not let this interfere with safe driving.

606
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,990
 Recent destinations

607
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,210
 Haneul Mental Hospital

608
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,690
 There were no other reasons for saving you.

609
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,610
 At that time, you looked like. . . 
the girl from 400 years ago.

610
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:11,520
 Because you looked like that girl, 
the owner of the hair pin. . .

611
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,630
 To the point I was confused momentarily,
 you looked very much like her.

612
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,540
 Myeongin University Museum

613
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,650
Excuse me. 
Where did the hair pin go? It used to be right here.

614
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,870
There was an incident a while ago.

615
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:38,300
We moved it to somewhere else and 
we are keeping it there.

616
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,990
Ah, I see. . . 
By the way, by chance,

617
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:46,140
would it be possible for me to find out 
who the owner of the hair pin was?

618
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,700
Pardon? 
We don't know about that either.

619
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,930
Maybe her portrait, or how old she was.

620
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,210
Or personal information like if she were married or not? 
Something like that?

621
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,000
Sorry?

622
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,010
Do you think she was pretty? 
Any records of her look?

623
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:01,480
Well, I'm not sure about that. . .

624
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,750
Thank you for you time.

625
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,130
 What are you saying?
The owner of the hair pin 400 years ago. . .

626
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:45,120
 How did you know the face of the person 
who lived back then?

627
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,750
 So you're saying you've lived all 400 years?

628
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,950
 That's right.

629
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,080
Hey, they are all good-looking 
even though they lived 100 years ago.

630
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,200
Seriously. This guy is so handsome.

631
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,960
He's better than any of the guys right now.

632
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,860
Isn't she Cheon Song Yi?

633
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,140
What the heck?

634
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,620
Let's go.

635
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,440
Excuse me!

636
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,790
Yes.

637
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,060
What is this picture?

638
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:20,960
Ah. . . It's a picture of people who helped us a lot 
when we opened our university.

639
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,470
Are you selling it?

640
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,620
I'm asking if you are selling this picture. I will buy it. 
How much is it? Is there a discount?

641
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:29,530
It's not a picture that can be bought with money.

642
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,510
Do you want my autograph?

643
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:37,890
No, it's okay.

644
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,220
It's okay. . .?

645
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,570
Take care.

646
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,980
Long time no see.
- Yeah.

647
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,540
You've been well, right?

648
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,450
Of course, I've been well.

649
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,930
Ah, right.

650
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,950
My Song Yi is starting a movie soon. 
They are begging her to do it so much. . .

651
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:11,040
Oh, really? She's finally starting her work again.

652
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,640
But it must be hard since she doesn't have an agency.

653
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,880
Speaking of which, the S&amp;C group offered an one-person
 agency for Song Yi, so we've been thinking about that.

654
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,620
We just need to seal the contract, but

655
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,870
my Song Yi says she wants to think about it.

656
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:27,470
Ah, is that so? It's a relief. I worried about her.

657
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,440
Thanks for your concern.

658
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,620
But, worry about yourself.

659
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,470
Worry about what?

660
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:37,730
I mean. . . When my Song Yi makes her comeback,

661
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,780
she will need to bring her CF's back, you know.

662
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,630
I will see you again.

663
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,230
Oh, you haven't paid.

664
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,380
Pay?

665
00:47:56,310 --> 00:48:01,590
Manager Yoon. It's me, Cheon Song Yi's mommy!

666
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,370
The director told me that we can't support you 
(give you service for free) anymore. . .

667
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:08,110
She told me to ask you to pay. I'm sorry.

668
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,420
Work hard, Manager Yoon.

669
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,140
Yes. We need to send our staff to 
Se Mi Unni's filming studio, correct?

670
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,830
Right.

671
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:20,120
Unni? I'll get going first.

672
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:32,420
 Should I tell him or should I not?

673
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,020
 I don't need to tell him, right?

674
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:40,640
Forget it. 
This spoon worm, sea anemone-like bastard.

675
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,700
 Should I tell him? 
No, no, no.

676
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,040
 Go to Myeongin University Museum.

677
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,070
 The 100th anniversary or something. . . 
Pay attention to that picture.

678
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:17,210
 Don't EVER try to find out who wrote this note.

679
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,890
 Shinhan Daily, February 3, 1914

680
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,320
  Myeongin University's intellectual community

681
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,730
Prosecutor Yoo. They got caught.

682
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,580
Did you find it?

683
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,320
There is nothing of Lee Jae Kyeong and Han Yoo Ra 
going together, but

684
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:06,330
I found that they separately went through
 the Cheongpyeong IC within an 1 hour interval.

685
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:10,160
Managing Director Lee Jae Kyeong's villa is
near Mt. Homyeong.

686
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,810
If we look into that area thoroughly, 
wouldn't we find something?

687
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,050
By the way, where are you going?

688
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,030
The owner of the fountain pen.

689
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:21,820
The person, Han Seo Jin, who was, first,
declared as missing, then dead.

690
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,340
it's possible that he gave the pen to his friend as a gift.

691
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:30,270
That's true. That someone hit our prosecutor
 on the back of the head. We must find out who did it.

692
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,800
- Take care. 
-- Alright.

693
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,130
Well... Since I've always been the one 
 to deal with the contracts anyway...

694
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:42,870
You've thought very well.

695
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:46,200
Song Yi probably won't regret it either.

696
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,240
I heard she's gotten into a movie.

697
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,950
--Then, a manager and a car...
-- No.

698
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,870
That girl will throw a fit if she finds out
 that I signed the contract without her--

699
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,960
We can do it anytime later.

700
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,090
First, she should go into filming 
the movie and when she gets too busy to argue, then.

701
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:08,340
When she feels the need of an agency. . .

702
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,030
At that time, she should agree to the contract.

703
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,550
Then, let's do that.
But I still need to know her schedule.

704
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,480
Please do tell me.

705
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,360
Of course.

706
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,320
I heard you're going into a movie.

707
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,770
Yeah.

708
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,890
I think a film would be much better 
than going out on TV in terms of public opinion.

709
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,580
But it's action. 
I would have wanted some passionate melodrama.

710
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:42,420
Why? Because you're in a one-sided love?

711
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,370
You little--!

712
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,120
Hey! Hey! Hey!

713
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,540
Where could you find an actress in 
South Korea that's as good as me?

714
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:53,540
Martial arts, then martial arts. 
 Fights, then fights.

715
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,170
Hey! I will show them properly this time.

716
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,640
Properly.

717
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:13,720
Check on the equipment!

718
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,000
Hyungnim.

719
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,580
This wire, if this isn't placed properly it would 
give way right away. So you should be careful.

720
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,910
It's not like it's my first time doing this.

721
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:24,670
Please inspect the crane pulley again.

722
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:26,150
Okay, okay.

723
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:28,930
Hey, part-timer.
The pulley can't get loosened up, alright?

724
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:32,060
If it gets loosened up, it might seem like 
it's working well the first few times, but

725
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:36,050
if you pull and release the wire a couple of times, 
the screw will get loose. Okay?

726
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,270
- Yes.
-- Hurry and move.

727
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,060
You're coming in now?

728
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,510
Did you find out anything?

729
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:04,200
No. There wasn't anything.

730
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,170
Man, there isn't much now.

731
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,560
Hello?

732
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,870
For what happened last time, I'm sorry about it.

733
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:38,610
- Are you all better now?
- Yes.

734
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,220
I was curious.

735
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,750
Why did you ask to see me last time?

736
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,600
There was. . .

737
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,500
something that I wanted to say to you.

738
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:58,760
 So are you sure that Han Seo Jin died 3 years ago?

739
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:03,470
 Yes. After he said he was going on a trip, 
he stopped communicating. . .

740
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,270
 Later on, I simply heard that he had been reported dead.

741
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:11,310
 Could it be that someone named 
Do Min Joon was around Han Seo Jin?

742
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:14,980
 He might have mentioned him,
 or came to look for him?

743
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,730
 Seo Jin didn't have any friends.

744
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,800
 He didn't even have a single meal with us.

745
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,780
 I didn't see anyone coming to visit him either.

746
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,780
 Then perhaps. . .

747
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,500
 Have you ever seen this person?

748
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:34,530
 Are you sure you're not misunderstanding something?
- What?

749
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:37,080
 This person is Han Seo Jin!

750
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,750
 It is Han Seo Jin, just the hairstyle changed.
I'm sure.

751
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,910
Please say it, what you want to say.

752
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:16,390
What's this? There's no one who even says "You're here."

753
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:22,550
What is this?
Not even a preliminary meeting with the director
 first, but directly to the filming site?

754
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:26,150
This is what is called the sorrow of supporting roles.

755
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:31,090
-- That's why, let's do as I say regarding S&amp;C--
-- Stop it with that topic.

756
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,770
Miss Se Mi, you're here.

757
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:38,170
Hello.

758
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:41,260
The lead was Yoo Se Mi?

759
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,520
Miss Cheon Song Yi, you're here.

760
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,240
It's been a long time, Director.

761
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,210
After thinking multiple times about working together,
 we've finally met. Nice to see you.

762
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:57,530
This time, your situation is a bit... so
I was a bit apprehensive.

763
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:01,110
But our Yoon Se Mi strongly recommended you, so you were cast.

764
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,230
You did?

765
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,540
Yeah.

766
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,880
Like you have always done for me.

767
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:18,640
The first filming is a wire stunt scene.
You do some action, right?

768
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,130
I do, a bit.

769
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:24,410
First, we need to coordinate, so let's 
talk it out with the martial arts director.

770
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:26,970
Are you done inspecting?

771
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:28,140
Yes!

772
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,720
We'll be relying on you, Song Yi.

773
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,380
You need to support the lead well, so that the lead will shine.

774
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:45,930
Did you hear that? You heard her talk
 about me in front of me, right?

775
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,000
It's what you always said to Se Mi's mom.

776
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,050
Madam, you've received back as much as you gave.

777
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:57,080
Hey! Whose side are you on?

778
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,700
Are you crazy?

779
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,050
Why? Why are you thinking those thoughts?

780
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,790
If not,

781
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:07,740
I would have to kill Lee Jae Kyeong.

782
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,890
Whether I kill him or make him stop, it's one or the other.

783
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:14,880
If not, Cheon Song Yi may die.

784
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:20,520
Cheon Song Yi told the detective about the 
relationship between Lee Jae Kyeong and Han Yoo Ra.

785
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,210
There's no time.

786
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,650
What are you saying?

787
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:36,160
Really? That's kind of him.

788
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,430
Keeping promises well, too.

789
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,560
What about Cheon Song Yi's side?

790
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,060
Hey! It's not in the center!

791
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,750
Will you be really okay 
doing it yourself without any stuntman?

792
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,590
- You said to do it.
-- I said I would be thankful if you did it.

793
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:54,740
Since it will look more realistic that way,

794
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,840
I should do it . . .
 If I want to go and swallow up the lead.

795
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:15,920
From this moment on, 
all the things you say will be recorded on video.

796
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,700
Do you agree to it?

797
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:22,310
Yes, I agree.

798
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,790
Let's start.

799
00:58:53,290 --> 00:59:00,090

800
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:10,070
 Do Min Joon! I am on Mount Bookhan!

801
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:12,840
 I am in danger!

802
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,410
 It's really true!

803
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:19,840
 Aaahhh! Please save me!
Please save me!

804
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:30,200
 I knew it would turn out like this.
What alien? Superman?

805
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:34,180
 She must've gone crazy, right?

806
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:39,050
 How dare she calls someone out 
at anytime, anywhere.

807
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:40,300
 Scared me, geez.
