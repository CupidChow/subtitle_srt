1
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,850

2
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,200
Let me ask you this then.

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,960
Where were you on the day of
 Han Yoo Ra's accident?

4
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,020
How were you able to 
board the cruise boat,

5
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,780
without an invitation?

6
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,410
He is the culprit, alright. Hey!

7
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,480
Mr. Do Min Joon!

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,800
Hey! Do Min Joon!

9
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,180
Hey, Do Min Joon!
Hey, Do Min Joon!!!

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,530
Hey, Do Min Joon! Hey!

11
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,760
 Don't follow me.

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,100
 The soldiers are chasing after me.

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,120
 Go!

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,540
 Go back to where you are from, my Lord!

15
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,910
 I. . .

16
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,190
 Didn't I say I would protect you?

17
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,690
 You. . .

18
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,910
 I don't want you to get hurt.

19
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,140
 So,

20
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,000
 let's go together.

21
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,220
Hey! Do Min Joon!

22
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,190
 My Love From the Star
Episode 6

23
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,670
With reporters swarming in recklessly, telling us to control them, is that even possible?

24
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,880
Who's there?

25
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,640
Ah, well. . .

26
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,210
I'm a resident here. #2302.

27
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,930
You, two, must not have been here long.

28
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,390
I know the faces of the usual employees.

29
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,290
Ah, then, work hard.

30
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,550
Did you see him coming in?

31
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,920
I didn't.

32
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,000
Didn't it seem as if he fell from the sky?

33
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,130
Wait a moment!

34
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,200
Stop there!

35
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,290
What would you like to drink?

36
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,520
I have some really good 
coffee beans in the house.

37
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,560
It's imported from Costa Rica-

38
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,100
And I've run out completely.....

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,770
Is instant coffee all right?

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,100
On a rainy day such as this, there's
nothing sweeter than instant coffee~

41
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,460
What are you doing there?

42
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,150
I was just curious how an 
actress' dressing room would look.

43
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,490
Am I being rude?

44
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,400
Come and drink some coffee.

45
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,430
Are... you okay?

46
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,130
Pardon?

47
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,630
Since that happened to Han Yoo Ra....
There's been a lot of talk.

48
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,370
Are you okay, Oppa?

49
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,940
Me?

50
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,090
Why?

51
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,770
Well, actually ...
 I know you had a relationship with Yoo Ra.

52
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,820
Weren't you two planning
to announce your wedding?

53
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,150
What makes you think that?

54
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,720
I.... heard it.

55
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,220
Heard what?

56
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,410
The two of you talking . . .

57
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,960
What did you hear...

58
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,920
And, how much (did you hear) . . .

59
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,700
That night... The two of you fought
in front of the restroom, remember?

60
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,820
Regarding the announcement of the marriage...

61
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,770
Just listening to you guys, it didn't seem like you guys
 had been seeing each other for just a short time.

62
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,300
What you're telling me now....
Have you ever told anyone else?

63
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,610
Of course not.

64
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,110
To whom would I say those things...

65
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,830
I just...

66
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,070
You and Yoo Ra were in such a relationship...
But she ended up passing away like that....

67
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,870
If the fight was your last moments together,
 I thought you may be suffering some heartache.

68
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,150
So I wanted to console you.

69
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,610
I guess you...

70
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,900
heard it all.

71
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,440
Things just got a little more complicated.

72
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,230
Sorry?

73
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,090
Didn't you say you suffer from insomnia?

74
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,150
Has it been getting better these days?

75
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,700
Well, just.... It gets a bit worse
when I become emotionally sensitive, and...

76
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,870
Then, I just take some sleeping pills and such.

77
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,820
Take good care of yourself.

78
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,980
I dropped by because I was concerned
 about you after what happened to Yoo Ra.

79
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,980
Thank you, Oppa.

80
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,650
Hey.. What brings you here?

81
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,180
Hey! What's with you, not being available for contact and all.....

82
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,880
Whose are those?

83
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,020
Which bastard is he?

84
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,360
What?

85
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,250
Is it perhaps that bastard neighbor of yours?!

86
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,810
I asked you if it's that bastard!

87
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,080
It's your BROTHER, you little punk!

88
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,770
What?

89
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,110
Hyung!

90
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,960
Why are you....?

91
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,450
I came by to meet someone, then dropped in 
because she came to mind.

92
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,290
Even if you are my brother, you are still a man.

93
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,970
The fact that you're here alone with my Song Yi...

94
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,030
is, you know...  not sitting all that well with me.
- Hey!

95
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,490
I've seen her and confirmed
she's doing well.  So, that's that.

96
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,990
I'll be off now.

97
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,380
Yes, Oppa. On your way out ... 
Please take him with you.

98
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,620
Yo, I JUST arrived, man.

99
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,440
Hyung, you go on ahead first.

100
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,740
Tell Mom that I may not make it ho...

101
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,180
We apologize for mistaking you.  
This is just following procedures.

102
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,070
You know . . . With all the ruckus going
on about that actress Cheon Song Yi ...

103
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,200
So, because of that the entire non-resident 
entry policy has become a lot stricter...

104
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,180
Due to residents' complaints pouring in...

105
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,980
I'm free to leave now, right?

106
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,370
Ah, yes.  Of course.

107
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,530
What is that?

108
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,070
How can the sensors lights in all the 
staircases turn on at the same time?

109
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,240
Did something pass by and make it that way?

110
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,890
Nah.  How can anything go by that fast?

111
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,570
Unless it's a ghost.

112
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,420
I think it's malfunctioning.

113
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,690
Crap.  I'm spooked for some reason.

114
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,410
Thanks SO much for what happened
at the hospital the other day by the way.

115
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,590
Thanks to you, I almost got hit by one of the bodyguards.

116
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,740
Where is Cheon Song Yi?

117
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,000
What?

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,180
"Where is Cheon Song..."

119
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,400
Is Song Yi your friend?

120
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,470
Your lover?

121
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,130
The one ringing the doorbell...  was you?

122
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,890
Song Yi!

123
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,140
 Yo Song Yi, open the door!

124
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,540
What's going on....

125
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,170
Why are so many male guests
showing up at my house today?

126
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,830
Are you alright?

127
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,430
What about?

128
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,040
 Yo, Mr. Neighbor!

129
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,250
 Hey, open the door!

130
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,530
What's he doing outside and all?

131
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,340
What is it?

132
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,100
Aside from the guy outside the door, 
did anyone else drop by here?

133
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,040
Who? Jae Kyung oppa?

134
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,990
Who is he?

135
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,870
The brother of the one who is busy
knocking on my door out there.

136
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,290
Unlike the one out there, 
his character is outstanding.

137
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,530
He is also the heir to SNC Group.

138
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,920
But... why do you ask?

139
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,340
 Cheon Song Yi!!

140
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,440
Hey, open the door! Yo.... CHEON SONG YI!!

141
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,490
Hey you! Mr. Neighbor! ARE YOU
NOT GONNA OPEN THE DOOR?!

142
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,990
Let me go, I'm have to open the door.

143
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,090
What kind of girl...!

144
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,250
....opens the door for just anyone?!

145
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,570
What do you mean, for just anyone?

146
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,450
Why would you thoughtlessly let in someone 
without knowing what kind of person he may be?

147
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,710
You sure are fearless for a girl.

148
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,520
You're right, come to think of it.

149
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,890
Why did I let in the person in front of me,
 not knowing what kind of man he is?!

150
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,230
And without a single drop of fear!

151
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,330
You know I'm not talking about me.  I'm talking 
about men other than me-

152
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,880
Why take  your name  off the list? 
Please leave. Now!

153
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,050
Hold it! Hey! I absolutely LOATHE
someone touching my body!

154
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,790
Loathe, my butt....

155
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,540
Hey, Song Yi, you okay?

156
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,880
Did this bastard play any weird tricks on you?

157
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,850
Hey, look here. I am NOT the type of
person to pull those type of tricks, you hear?

158
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,640
I told you, didn't I?

159
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,810
Just one look at you and I don't see 
much of a good impression.

160
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,350
One can experience all kinds of situation 
when one lives long enough...

161
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,910
That's the first time I've heard 
myself described that way.

162
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,150
Oh, no?  I think you must have heard it a lot.

163
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,040
Look... I'm very tired today, alright?

164
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,880
Can you just leave now?

165
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,660
Yeah...

166
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,920
Go on now, get out of here.

167
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,190
YOU too!

168
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,400
Hey, it's been several days since I last saw you...

169
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,310
Can't I just have a cup of coffee before I...

170
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,150
Hey, next door. Can I see you for a second? 
I need to talk to you about something.

171
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,250
The house that you live in now, next door
 (to Song Yi). . . Do you own it?

172
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,170
Lease? Monthly rent?

173
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,470
Why are you curious about that?

174
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,590
If you own it, I will buy it. 
Double the market price. How about it?

175
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,830
If you are going to talk nonsense, 
I'm heading back.

176
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,580
I don't know what you are thinking 
about my Song Yi right now.

177
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,320
But, all thoughts you have right now. . .
Give them up.

178
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,340
- Why? 
-- Because Cheon Song Yi, that girl. . .

179
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,000
She's my woman.

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,970
'My woman'. . . 
Is it by mutual agreement?

181
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,120
Mutual agreement, well. . .

182
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,360
That. . . A little bit. . . Uh. . .

183
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,600
It's not quite settled as of yet...

184
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,970
She's going to agree soon!
 I wasn't going to bring this up, but

185
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,650
Cheon Song Yi and I have a really special 
relationship. I've known her since middle school.

186
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,000
We attended intensive subject study at the study
 center together. I even brought her a bouquet at her graduation.  (typically given by a boy friend)

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,250
She also drank for the first time with me.

188
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,260
So, that's how it is for me, you see?

189
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,310
So from now on, whatever it is,
 I'm going to do it together with her.

190
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,950
I'm going to be responsible for her life 
in its entirety. Until we die.

191
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,890
 Jealousy is the lowest form of human emotion.

192
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,490
 It is both crude and immature.

193
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,500
It's an emotion resulting from the fear 
that the affection from our partner

194
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,030
may, instead, be bestowed upon someone
 other than one's own self.

195
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:32,160
This emotion, which is similar to anger, 
manifests beginning from toddler age.

196
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,270
Seeing his/her mother holding and being
 affectionate with another child,

197
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,180
he/she may throw a tantrum, spit out food that he/she ingested

198
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,280
or sucking his/her thumb, etc.

199
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,930
Typically, it's referred to as "regression."

200
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,050
Even for a full grown adult,

201
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:51,860
a person with low self-esteem, can experience the process of regression when he/she falls in love with someone.

202
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:59,770
They may express their jealousy by speaking or 
acting crudely, in fear of losing that someone to another.

203
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,430
You don't get jealous, even when you like someone?

204
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,280
You understand what I'm getting at, right?

205
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,450
Starting from now, I'm saying that you shouldn't 
hang around my Song Yi's home for no reason-

206
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,970
I went there today because I had a reason.

207
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,950
What reason?

208
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,550
Ms. Cheon Song Yi left her purple 
elastic hair band at my home.

209
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,510
I was going to tell her to come and take it away.

210
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,090
What?

211
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,070
Why did she leave that... there? 
Did she get drunk and go into your house again?

212
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,870
Ah. . . It's not that, so don't get it wrong.

213
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,810
She slept overnight at my home, 
even though she was sober.

214
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,820
Ah . . . I really need to return her hair elastic quickly..

215
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,550
Because you seem so chic, 
I don't think you would get jealous.

216
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,610
As I explained earlier, jealousy is the 
lowest and most childish emotion.

217
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,430
It's the kind of emotion associated with a person 
having low self-esteem and an inferiority complex.

218
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,380
Therefore, I've never felt such an emotion.

219
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,460
Wow. . .

220
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,070
As I forewarned, next week is the final exam for 
this semester. All must attend without fail.

221
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,600
 Get lost, Cheon Song Yi!

222
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,430
 You killed Yoo Ra Unni.
Do you even have a conscience?

223
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,910
 What place do you think this is that 
you can come crawling here?

224
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,270
Noona, I don't think this will do. Right now, there are too 
many reporters and too many of Han Yoo Ra's fans here.

225
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,680
The family of the deceased also told us not to come. . .

226
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,160
For now... Let's go back.

227
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,240
I was going to... return Yoo Ra Unni's possession.

228
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,710
What's going on?

229
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,610
Did something happen?

230
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,830
Can't you see that my child is being shredded?

231
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,570
Just what the heck are you doing 
as the CEO of her agency?!

232
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,260
If you have a mouth, say something!

233
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,810
Mother, because of this incident, 
we've got some serious damage-

234
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,950
All that damage, wasn't that what my Song Yi brought in
in the first place?

235
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:21,830
When she was making money for you, you said, "Let's go 
together forever," "We're a family," "We're a community."

236
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,930
But, now that you've encountered some damage. You 
want to cut off your tail and run away by yourself?!

237
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,250
Mother, Mother, if we were to speak of it unemotionally,

238
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,770
our contract with actress Cheon Song Yi is
 valid up to the end of this month.

239
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,740
Oh my, and so?!

240
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,470
Oh, my Song Yi is here. 
Continue speaking in front of her, Representative Ahn.

241
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,660
Her contract with this company is up to 
the end of this month. Then, what?

242
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,430
So, I mean. . . We should postpone the renewal-

243
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,840
Let's postpone the renewal.

244
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,530
- What? 
-- Hey!

245
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,390
In consideration of the friendship we've built over the years,
 I was going to re-up, if possible.

246
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:05,080
However, the way you've been handling this incident . . .
It sucked.

247
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,790
In this vein, do you think you are capable of managing me?

248
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,680
I think I should take some time 
to consider the renewal for now.

249
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,900
Really?

250
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,710
Due to this incident, the CF penalty fees,
 I will take responsibility for them.

251
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,900
Re-a-lly... would really you do that?

252
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,340
Cheon Song Yi, are you crazy? 
Why would you do that?!

253
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,680
Do it according to the contract, the contract!

254
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,260
I'm going to take a break for a while,
 so don't contact me.

255
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,690
Yeah, I won't. 
Yeah, you take some rest.

256
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,840
Don't follow me. You are not my manager anymore.

257
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,120
Ah, it turned out well, right?

258
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,850
What?

259
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,850
She said she'd do it! She said it herself!

260
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,050
Hey, girl. Are you crazy?!

261
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,010
How much is that? What money do you have?

262
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:05,070
It was a loss incurred because of me!  
How can I put it all on CEO Ahn?

263
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,940
You seem like a stranger.  Since when were you this decent?

264
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,480
Try being nice to your mother, you girl!  As of now, you've been 
kicked out of the drama and fired from all the CF's.

265
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,890
Where will you get the money to pay back?!

266
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:27,080
Ah. . . Long time no see, Se Mi. You came to the office?

267
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,270
Yeah. To see Representative Ahn.

268
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,520
Her role in the drama has been altered at the last minute. 
We have so much to prepare, you know.

269
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,960
Her role. . . How has it been altered?

270
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,430
You haven't heard, Unni?

271
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:45,080
Since the drama is already half over,
 it would be difficult to cast a new actress.

272
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,020
So, they've changed the story giving the male lead a love line 
with my Se Mi, after Song Yi leaves to study abroad.

273
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,910
What?

274
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,360
Mom. . . How could you say like that?

275
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,520
Song Yi, don't misunderstand.

276
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:04,630
It's true that the director wanted to make this change, 
but I told him I decline.

277
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,770
What? Really?

278
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,680
Yeah, Mom.

279
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,250
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier. I was going to 
discuss it with Representative Ahn.

280
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,470
Are you in your right mind?

281
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,970
Don't you know what kind of an opportunity this is?

282
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,160
But, how can I do that, though?

283
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,380
Even if it's an opportunity I've longed for, 
I don't want to do it this way.

284
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,330
It's all a result of Song Yi being falsely accused.

285
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,120
If I accept it, it'd be like getting the role
 by shoving one's best friend aside.

286
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,730
I believe that I will have another opportunity, if I wait.

287
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:47,040
And, if I don't get another opportunity, 
there's nothing I can't do about it.

288
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Se Mi is better than her mom, indeed.

289
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,580
Song Yi, don't mind about it. 
That's what I'm going in to say.

290
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,730
Do it.

291
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,350
Even if it's not you, some other person will just take this part.

292
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,600
It's not that I'm not doing it because of you. 
I'm in a situation where I'm not able to do it.

293
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,810
- So, don't worry and do it.
-- Huh?

294
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,230
Right. Song Yi is better than her mom.

295
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,430
It's really alright. Do it.

296
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,750
- Song Yi. . . 
-- Representative Ahn must be waiting for you. Go now.

297
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,380
Is it okay for you to wear heels when your ankle is fractured?

298
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,630
 What? What message is it?

299
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,290
 Oh. My mom fell on a patch of ice.

300
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,920
 She fractured her ankle.

301
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,250
What? Ankle? What fracture?

302
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,570
Are you serious?

303
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,750
Did you really say that to the director?

304
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,940
Let's go. Go tell the director again.

305
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,460
There's no need to do that. 
I already told the director I would do it.

306
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,400
What? Then, why just now. . .

307
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,910
Yes.  I lied.

308
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,820
I felt kind of guilty towards Song Yi.

309
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,870
I wanted Song Yi to say that it was okay first.
That's why I did it.

310
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,550
But, Mom,

311
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,150
you saw Song Yi's expression, right?

312
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,950
It wasn't a congratulatory expression at all.

313
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,480
I've always congratulated her

314
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,810
for all this time.

315
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,270
It's all because

316
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,960
she thought of you as her bridesmaid, not her friend.

317
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,230
You need to show her this time.

318
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,700
What happens when a supporting cast gets the spotlight.

319
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,840

320
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,730
 Unnie, it's your birthday tomorrow, right? 
Happy early birthday. Have some strength!! 
-A fan-

321
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,590
Mr. Do Min Joon!

322
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,280
Mr. Do Min Joon, are you not in there?!

323
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,700
It is said that even dung can't be found when you try to use it as medicine.

324
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,820
Where did he go?

325
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,030
Ah, I don't know where he went. He just disappeared.

326
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,110
In the meantime, my car got towed.

327
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,220
I even got fined for jaywalking, you know.

328
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,610
Me, who's been living with a law-abiding spirit!

329
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,930
He's just a reference witness. 
We can't force him to come in.

330
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,400
Let's first start by sending him the summons officially.

331
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,740
However,

332
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,520
no matter how many times I think about it, it's weird.

333
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,760
He was definitely in front of my eyes,

334
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,020
but he just vanished into mist.

335
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,930
Maybe he went into a building or something.

336
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,400
The time was too short for him to do so.

337
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,670
Could it be...

338
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,920
I mean...

339
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,750
Even on the CCTV, he disappeared in 1 second.

340
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,920
Perhaps . . .

341
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,580
Superpower?

342
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,040
Ah, Detective Park.

343
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,130
No way, right?

344
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,140
I was in the rain too much yesterday.

345
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,830
What exactly is his identity?

346
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,380
I found out a bit,

347
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,170
and he is no ordinary person.

348
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,300
Really?

349
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,990
He has

350
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,730
an unbelievable amount of wealth.

351
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,400
It's nearly equivalent to a chaebol's asset level.

352
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,700
Ah, this is nice.

353
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,990
Aigoo.

354
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,830
I just streamlined most of the real-estate portion.

355
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,260
While I was doing it, I got surprised again.

356
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,970
How did you manage your property?

357
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,310
Since I've been living for about 400 years,

358
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,830
the wealth accumulated on its own, that's all.

359
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,600
Did you have the foresight?

360
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,700
How do you get so much land in Gangnam?

361
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,460
The first time I started in business was 1753.

362
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,110
At that time, there was a man named Yoon Sung Dong,

363
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,750
who was a really popular real estate broker in Hanyang.
 Jib Ju Reum: modern day real estate broker.

364
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,890
Over there!

365
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,250
Over there.

366
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,180
It may appear to be just a field of rocks, 
but if you plant mulberry bush or trees,

367
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,140
this spot will become unbelievably successful.

368
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:04,200
 I bought that land with 200 bags of rice, 
thinking about making a mulberry field.

369
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,230
 On that spot the Jamshil amusement park was established.

370
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,140
Over there. Over there.

371
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,330
The owner of this land was a royal secretary.

372
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,330
But because he said the wrong thing in front of the king,

373
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,700
he has been demoted and had to let go
 of the land, with tears in his eyes.

374
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,270
For quick-quick-quick sale!

375
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,120
The vast land I bought at a cheap price, with good scenery
 and where I planned to build a pavilion,

376
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,290
has now become the Apgujeong Dong apartment complex.

377
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,830
At that time, Gangnam was not even a part of Hanyang.

378
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,630
Naturally, the land price compared to Gangbuk,

379
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,020
which was part of Hanyang, was much lower.

380
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,590
Samsung-dong only. . .

381
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,820
At the time, was divided into three towns:

382
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,700
'Mudongdori', 'Jeojadori', 'Buridori'.

383
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,120
But even if you combined all the people 
who lived there together,

384
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,320
I doubt it would have been more than 200.

385
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,280
Literally, it was an empty wild plain.

386
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,170
A wasteland among the wastelands.

387
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:04,390
If people, who lived then, saw the present Samsung-dong, 
they would probably faint.

388
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,710
It would be like the world had undergone a cataclysmic change. 
( "A whole new world has begun.")

389
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,890
What were my ancestors doing?

390
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,500
They should've bought some land then.

391
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,970
Please start to dispose of them slowly.

392
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,170
In case of the antiques and art works,

393
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,590
dispose of them slowly, after I leave.

394
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,190
If too many expensive objects come out at once,

395
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,530
people will find it suspicious.

396
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,150
Yes, I'll do that.

397
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,200
But,

398
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,260
since you're starting to make arrangement  ,

399
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,680
I'm finally realizing it.

400
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,060
That you are really leaving.

401
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,220
To me, this moment,

402
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,410
is the moment that I've been waiting for 400 years.

403
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,820
When the time comes to leave,

404
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,000
I thought I'd be able to leave without any regrets.

405
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,870
But, then?

406
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,210
The end is near,

407
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,120
but, behind me, a person remains.

408
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,230
Unresolved curiosity,

409
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,820
lingering attachment, sorrow. 
Also, things like that.

410
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,330
This odd situation, which seems different, yet similar

411
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,600
to the situation 400 years ago makes me afraid.

412
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,440
I believed death

413
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,510
was the end and disappearance.

414
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,260
Is it possible that it isn't?

415
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,600
 If you can, buy a cell phone . . .

416
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,140
 Otherwise, I can't call in an emergency.

417
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,760
 Did that person whom I thought was gone forever

418
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,670
 turn the long time around and turn back 
to appear in front of me?

419
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,190
You're here?

420
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,660
You're the only one who comes and 
volunteers time and time again.

421
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,420
One day a week. . . 
I like this time I'm volunteering here the most.

422
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,810
Why would I miss out?

423
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:08,570
A chaebeol heir volunteering at an abandoned dog center?

424
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,060
If reporters find out, they would go crazy. 
But you won't let me tell the press.

425
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,000
What's wrong with this guy?

426
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,480
Someone abandoned him on the highway. It's distemper. 
( An infectious viral disease )

427
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,680
He also has a hard pad and definite skin rashes. 
( A condition in which the skin of the nose and foot pads get hard. )

428
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,220
- What about the lab work?
- It's positive.

429
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,440
According to the blood test, lymphocytes 
and neutrophils are increased.

430
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,210
According to the x-rays, there is 
bronchial pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis.

431
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,090
The central nervous system is out of hand now.

432
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,740
Euthanasia is... the only way?

433
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,530
Right. I think we should do it tonight.

434
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,930
Magnesium sulfate?

435
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,870
Anesthesia first.

436
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,870
Oh, right.

437
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,910
These days propofol is used for anesthesia.

438
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,450
You know there's controversy about celebrities using it.

439
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,680
That's right.

440
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,870
Give him to me.

441
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,760
Here.

442
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,640
Would you like some Chinese quince tea?

443
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,510
Just wait a bit,

444
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,590
your pain will

445
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,930
soon end.

446
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,440
Oh my.

447
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,080
It's not even my birthday. You didn't need to do this.

448
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,400
It's the day you went through the most.

449
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,710
Well.

450
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,560
I've suffered even when that girl was still in my womb
because of her terrible temper.

451
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,590
What are you and Song Yi planning to do today?

452
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,700
Currently, she has no appointments scheduled,
 so she has a lot of time.

453
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,300
I'm planning to eat dinner with her.

454
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,150
Hmmm . . . The same dinner you eat 365 days.

455
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,480
Instead of that, do something special.

456
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,410
Something special . . .

457
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,450
Shall I give you a tip?

458
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,820
I have something truly important 
to take care of in the afternoon.

459
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,750
I would like to request a monthly paid vacation day.

460
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,310
A monthly paid vacation day?

461
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,200
Okay, okay use it.

462
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,890
I'm sorry.

463
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,770
Later, at three o'clock I was supposed to go 
to the consortium contract signing, but ...

464
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,200
It's okay, it's okay. We'll do it ourselves.

465
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,870
It would have been my first time at contract signing,

466
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,830
so I really wanted to see it.

467
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,960
You wanted to see it?

468
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,600
Should we postpone signing the contract?

469
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,010
But, they are from England. 
And, they said they could only sign today.

470
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,260
Then, they can come from England, again.
 It's only a 12-hour long flight, nonstop.

471
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,720
I'll delay it, so come and watch next time.

472
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,610
Can I do that?

473
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,970
Thank you.

474
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:14,850
 Final exam at 4PM. You must attend.
 If you don't attend, then an F.

475
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,480
Look at his writing.

476
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,230
Aiyoo. . . So old-fashioned. This guy.

477
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,280
 Cheon Song Yi, Happy Birthday.

478
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,050
 Keep your evening absolutely free.

479
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,880
You, you little rascal.

480
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,470
It's your sister's birthday. 
Yet, you're not even going to congratulate me?

481
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,680
Are you alright?

482
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,780
 Of course I'm fine!

483
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,200
Everyone has cancelled on you, according to Mom.

484
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,490
Not even! Even today, there is someone 
who is earnestly wanting me.

485
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,210
And, I'm going there.

486
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,110
I'm so busy. But they are earnestly 
requesting of my attendance.

487
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,510
 I heard you broke off from your agency.

488
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,560
 You're going to wander around by yourself?

489
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,760
Of course. I have my own car and my own license.

490
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,500
I can go anywhere.

491
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,180
My boom boomie. It's been a while. 
Shall we go for a ride?

492
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,550
Cheon Song Yi is rapping. Song, song, song.

493
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,900
My name is

494
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,920
Are you listening? Are you watching?

495
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,440
Yes, hello. It's me, Cheon Song Yi.

496
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,660
They're greeting me so passionately since it's
 been a while that I've been outside.

497
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,690
Ah.

498
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,090
What a terrible driver.

499
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,960
Those who can't drive shouldn't be out in cars.

500
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,180
Right, boom boomie?

501
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,080
Should we give our boom bommie some yum-yum?

502
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,730
May I have some gas?

503
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,360
Unleaded or diesel?

504
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,590
Please give me some g-aaaa-ssss. Fill her up.

505
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,410
Oh no!

506
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,000
Oh no, my bag!

507
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,150
Where did I put my bag!?

508
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,180
I'm sure I put it in here.

509
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,460
Where is it?

510
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,720
Your bag.

511
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,490
Oops. Thanks.

512
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,200
Your signature, please.

513
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,840
 Be successful.

514
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,330
Is valet possible?

515
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,340
Pardon?

516
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,090
Valet?

517
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,110
Alright...

518
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,040
Seriously, why isn't there a valet?

519
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,390
Oh my, what kind of punk?

520
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,090
Oh my.

521
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,600
What should we do?

522
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,700
 We are in front of the apartment of actress Cheon Song Yi.

523
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:28,190
Excuse me, but I hit the back of your car. Please come out.

524
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,930
It's alright. Please just go.

525
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:33,860
How can I leave after hitting such a nice car?

526
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,120
Please step out for a second.

527
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,200
It's alright. It's not an expensive car. Please go.

528
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,340
The price isn't what's important. We've had an accident.

529
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,400
Please come out and examine it.

530
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,180
 Cheon Song Yi.

531
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,550
 Cheon Song Yi.

532
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,700
 Please come out. Give us an interview.

533
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,650
 Cheon Song Yi, please show us your face.

534
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:00,710
 Please come out. Cheon Song Yi.

535
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,020
 Please open the door.

536
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,960
 Look over here.

537
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,010
 Please open the door.

538
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,670
 Please come out.

539
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,540
 Cheon Song Yi, please step outside.

540
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,690
 Don't be like this and come out.

541
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,740
It's been an hour already.

542
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,970
What kind of nuisance is this?

543
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,770
In the case of a car accident,

544
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,380
you have a duty to come out and check.

545
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,590
If you continue to act like this, 
I'll have to open the door by force.

546
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,840
This wasn't a car accident, but an intentional accident.

547
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,050
You were aware that someone was inside.

548
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,760
You were also aware that the person could've been injured,

549
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,000
yet you purposely caused the accident.

550
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,670
Thus, this falls under property damage offense
 due to intentional negligence.

551
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,970
Who are you?

552
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,820
I am Cheon Song Yi's legal advisor

553
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,520
and a witness to the intentional accident.

554
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,300
In the event that the woman inside is injured even a little bit, then

555
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,310
you could be additionally charged with 
infliction of injury and assault.

556
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,700
For a maximum fine of 7 years of imprisonment and 
a 10 year maximum suspension of your driver's license,

557
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,780
plus a maximum of $10,000 in fines.

558
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,720
No, I just...

559
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,540
I only wanted to talk about this in person.

560
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,210
Continuing to tell her to get out of the car 
when she did not want to, raising your voice,

561
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,800
or taking forceful actions all falls under Article 283 
of the Criminal Code, as duress.

562
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,600
Threatening behavior can subject you to

563
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,530
a 3 years maximum imprisonment and $5000 in fines.

564
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,430
In this case,

565
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,960
you can be penalized because you were caught
 'in flagrante delicto.' (in the act of the crime)

566
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,190
Shall I call the police?

567
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,480
You may photograph if you'd like. However,

568
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,710
if you circulate the photographs without consent,

569
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,050
we can demand compensation for damages in a civil suit.

570
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,310
Come out. It's alright.

571
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:59,900

572
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,750
Hide only when you're at fault.

573
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,990
Don't hide otherwise.

574
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,930
Manager Do, where have you been?

575
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,690
- Let's go. 
  - He's her manager?

576
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,970
Manager Do.

577
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:29,220
Hey, film them.

578
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,900
Why won't it work?

579
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,920
Is it broken?

580
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,230
 Did the battery go out? What's wrong with this?
 Why won't it work?

581
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,750
This isn't the way to the lecture hall.

582
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,390
I'm not going to take the test?

583
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,240
It's been over for a long time.

584
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,110
Where are we going then?

585
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,760
Where is this place?

586
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,360
The University Museum.

587
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,700
The most vacant place on campus.

588
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,670
Regardless, I'm grateful again.

589
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,660
But, did you minor in law?

590
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,590
How do you know it so well?

591
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,840
What happens since I couldn't take the test today?

592
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,630
As you saw for yourself, I was in a situation that
 I couldn't avoid. Can't you look lightly on me?

593
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,130
You would've gotten an F even if you had taken the test. 
You have too many absences.

594
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,280
Then why did you tell me to come, creating this situation?!

595
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,010
We're in a museum.

596
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,680
Seriously.

597
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,900
The things I dislike most in the world are places
 like art galleries and museums.

598
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,120
I start feeling sleepy in 30 seconds. 
Why do you bring a person to this . . .

599
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,120
Oppa.

600
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,250
He must be tired after being up all night.

601
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,110
  Song Yi, Merry Christmas.

602
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,230
  Why did you come here again?

603
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,990
  It is bothersome. 
 Move!

604
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,860
  Song Yi!

605
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,310
Yeah, Hui Kyeong.

606
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:32,920
You are coming, right?

607
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,690
  But why are you at the amusement park at this time?

608
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:40,360
  By chance, you aren't making something 
like an event there, right?

609
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,410
  I hate amusement park events the most in this world. 
"I love Cheong Song Yi."

610
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,220
  Of course, there is nothing like that.

611
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,090
 A long time ago at an amusement park,
 some guy brought me 1,000 roses

612
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,570
 because my name is Cheon Song Yi.  
( "Cheon" = Thousand )

613
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,740
 Did you know that you are supposed to 
throw roses away in specific garbage bags?

614
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,200
 Because of the thorns, the bag gets all ripped up.

615
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,410
  I was really annoyed.

616
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,420
I am not doing that kind of thing.

617
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,730
Yeah, I'll hang up.

618
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,190
See you in a bit.

619
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,830
Please remove all of this. Hurry.

620
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:16,400
Everything?

621
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,600
Please remove them quickly.

622
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,590
Move them. . . 
Oh, right. That placard (banner)!

623
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,010
Hurry and take it down.

624
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,890
Heart, balloons,

625
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,470
and these candles.

626
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,150
Thank you for driving me there.

627
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:35,040
How long does it take to get my car back 
since it's been towed?

628
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,320
I should ask Beom.

629
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:41,310
Ah, Beom isn't my manager anymore.

630
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,090
Now that the semester is over, 
what will you be doing?

631
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,180
By chance, do you want to work 2 jobs?

632
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,640
What?

633
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,410
Such as a part-time job during your school break.

634
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,630
How about being my manager?

635
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,080
Stop saying nonsense.

636
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,500
Why not? You don't like the title "manager"?

637
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,190
Then how about my legal representative? 
That sounded cool.

638
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,320
If you don't like that either, then be my bodyguard.

639
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:12,670
There is not much I can do alone.

640
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,920
Since I was 12 until now,

641
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,290
I laugh and cry in front of the camera if I am told to do so.

642
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,600
I've done this only.

643
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,870
There isn't much I did myself.

644
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,100
I like coffee, but

645
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,360
I can't buy that either because I don't have a manager.

646
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,720
Because I don't know how to order.

647
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,510
How much?

648
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,270
Coffee?

649
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,090
No. Part time job salary.

650
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,020
Didn't you tell me to do a part time job?

651
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,410
That punk...

652
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,100
Where does he think this place is...

653
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,110
Why did you two come together?

654
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,970
Ah, it just happened like that.

655
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,630
Since you came all the way here, have dinner, then, go.

656
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,800
What do you mean by dinner?

657
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,770
It is okay now, so why don't you leave?

658
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,070
Hey, you....

659
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,240
Don't stay too late.

660
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,000
When you are done, send her home early.

661
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,760
I got it.

662
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,170
Wait, why are you telling me-

663
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,990
I will take care of it.

664
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:37,440
But why don't I see anyone here?

665
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,210
Did you do that?

666
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,070
Renting out the whole amusement park?

667
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,540
N...N...No.

668
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,550
Hey, even if I'm a rich family's son, that's a bit dramatic.

669
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,220
I guess it's because of the cold weather today.

670
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,390
That's why there is no one here really.

671
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:53,320
But why did you ask me to meet up?

672
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,780
Ah, that.

673
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:09,660
I heard when you were young you always rode
 that thing on your birthday regardless?

674
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:17,070
  It is moving.

675
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,000
  Do you like it that much?

676
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,190
 Yeah.

677
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,270
 When I ride this, I feel like I've become a star.

678
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,970
 You can see everything down from here.

679
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:30,560
 You must be tired and lack sleep from 
both filming and school. Are you okay?

680
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,490
  If you don't like it, it is okay for you not to do it. 
I will talk to your mom.

681
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,010
 No. I like it.

682
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,260
  Since I go on air and make money,

683
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,870
  Mom doesn't get mad at you like before, right?

684
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,260
 Why are you worried about money?

685
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,100
  I will take care of the money.

686
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,170
  So if it is hard, quit immediately.

687
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:51,590
 No. It is fun.

688
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:55,410
  I see famous celebrities if I go to the broadcasting company.

689
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,560
 Last time I saw Won Bin, Won Bin.

690
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,050
  You know Won Bin who starred in Autumn in My Heart, right?

691
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,210
  He is very handsome.

692
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,550
  Who is more handsome, between me and Won Bin?

693
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:10,180
 Oh, Dad, even though we're related,

694
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,490
  I guess I can't lie.

695
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,790
 You, rascal!

696
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,820
 Answer me. Who is it?

697
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,780
  Who is more handsome?

698
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,120
  Dad. I said, Dad.

699
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,270
That's right.

700
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,680
I came here to ride that, on my birthday, with my dad.

701
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,030
But how did you know?

702
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:42,460
There isn't anything I don't already know about you.

703
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,730
Let's go.

704
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:15,040
♬  If I’m allowed once again.  ♬

705
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:23,010
♬  If I could see you once again.  ♬

706
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,810
 Oh.

707
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,080
  Why am I feeling like this?

708
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,810
 Why is it that when I'm looking at this,

709
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:37,650
  I keep feeling sad?

710
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:42,540
♬   You are my destiny.   ♬

711
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:50,090
♬  You are. 
You are my destiny.   ♬

712
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:52,800
♬  You are.  ♬

713
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,990
♬  You are my everything.  ♬

714
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:59,350
 It was like a sad dream.

715
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:03,680
 Or, like a distant star,

716
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,880
 or a fairytale-like story.

717
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,580
 My lord, you've gotten paler.

718
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,290
 Catch them!

719
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:47,930
  My deceased grandmother said this,

720
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:53,420
 "A farewell should be done early,

721
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,170
 in case the end really comes

722
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,890
 and you can't say

723
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:05,140
 a farewell."

724
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:13,210
 Last time, when the first snow came down,

725
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:19,240
 the thing I told you, do you remember?

726
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,700
 I am going to quickly

727
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:28,600
 become a pretty young lady that

728
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,690
  I want to show you, my Lord.

729
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,100
 Before I met you,

730
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,180
 I didn't have any hope

731
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:52,820
 in my future.

732
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:58,240
 I only had resignation and resentment.

733
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:05,120
 After I met you,

734
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:10,480
 for the first time, my future seemed brighter.

735
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,700
 For the first time, I desperately wanted to live.

736
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:35,450
 Thank you... and thank you again.

737
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:45,030
 Be sure to safely return to where you are from.

738
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:52,120
 I won't forget you. 
I won't be able to forget you.

739
00:51:53,220 --> 00:52:02,560
 After death, even in any world, 
I will not forget you, my Lord.

740
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:08,200
 Everyone! There she is! Capture her!

741
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,830
 Capture her alive!

742
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,230
 That wicked one

743
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,750
 is playing tricks on us.

744
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,400
 Shoot the arrows! Kill him!

745
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,610
 There is a moment that I want to stop forever.

746
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:14,680
 The moment of the death of a loved one.

747
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,070
 I don't want to see it.

748
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:32,560
 I don't want to believe it.

749
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,720
 I can't do anything, and

750
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:40,730
 I find myself helpless. . . 
That moment.

751
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:29,930
Lately, living is so annoying.

752
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:35,160
Thank you. It's nice coming here.

753
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,580
Then, I'll prepare myself to be hit by you 
and say a few words.

754
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:49,050
Lately, I like things being difficult for you.

755
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:54,690
I'm actually happy that

756
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,680
you are in trouble.

757
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,640
What?

758
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,390
Because, then, there are things I can do for you.

759
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,140
Because, then, there's a gap I can squeeze myself into.

760
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,080
I'm terrible, right?

761
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,700
Yeah. Totally.

762
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:20,420
But. . . Can't you consider this as love?

763
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:25,040
For 15 years, I've jokingly confessed to you.

764
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,520
If I had been serious and you were to reject me,

765
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,020
then it would have been hard for me to continue
seeing you. So, that's why I behaved that way.

766
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:39,810
Can't you consider even this cowardly heart as love?

767
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:46,770
You said that crying in front of me didn't hurt your pride.

768
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:52,690
You said that I was the most comfortable because
 I've seen everything since we were children together.

769
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:01,250
That too. . . Let's consider it as love.

770
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,390
Let's say it's love, and

771
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:14,500
just come to me. You. Your family.
 I will take the responsibility until I die.

772
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:21,650
Just live while doing whatever you want.

773
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,570
I will make that possible.

774
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:38,140
 If you don't want to answer right now,

775
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:41,510
 you can do it later.

776
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:43,560
No.

777
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,850
I will answer now.

778
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,000
 My answer is. . .

779
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,480
 There are moments that one would like to stop forever.

780
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,360
 But, having to do such a thing to prevent it . . . 
Yet, I just don't want to hear those words.

781
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:06,610

782
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,750
What's this?

783
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:31,490
Noona. Please stay healthy-

784
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:36,650
♬  I believe,
even though you are not next to me,  ♬

785
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:44,490
What's he saying?
♬  Like this, it can't be a goodbye, right?  ♬

786
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:49,060
 To the next manager:  
You can't let my Noona drink more than 3 glasses of alcohol, ever.

787
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:53,320
 She becomes a dog. She really does bite you.

788
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,370
 Make sure she doesn't do SNS.

789
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:01,950
 She's the type of person who ruins her image
 whenever she opens her mouth.

790
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:06,790
 Last, but not least, there are some dramas
 my Noona shouldn't do.

791
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:10,760
 She can't do medical dramas. 
She can't memorize medical terms.

792
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,100
 She can't do legal dramas. 
She can't memorize long lines.

793
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:19,210
 Historical dramas? She can't.
She doesn't like the Joseon era.

794
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:23,600
 This punk. He knows me well.

795
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,600
 Ah, by the way, why do I dislike the Joseon era?

796
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,900
 It's strange, but I don't like it.

797
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,500
 That's weird.
