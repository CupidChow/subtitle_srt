Help!

6
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,830
Do Min-joon!

7
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,480
Manager Do!

8
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,690
Do Min-joon.

9
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,260
Where are you?

10
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,090
Come out! I’m scared.

11
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,460
Please.

12
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,940
Hee-kyung.

13
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,710
I failed to contact you...

14
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,180
What happened?

15
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,980
Where are you?

16
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,690
I don’t know. I don’t know.

17
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,020
There are trees here.

18
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,720
And a cliff.

19
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,860
But I don’t know this place.

20
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,270
Hee-kyung, I almost died.

21
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,200
Song-yi, stay calm.

22
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,740
Turn on your GPS on the phone.

23
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,670
Do you hear me?

24
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,690
Song-yi.

25
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,290
Song-yi, are you okay?

26
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,460
Hey, neighbor, can you at least keep her company
after you took her to the hospital?

27
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,730
Do you know what happened?

28
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,560
Where were you?

29
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,830
I said I need to go to the police station.

30
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,770
So you came here from the police station?

31
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,810
Instead of that cliff?

32
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,840
What are you talking about?

33
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,310
Tell me if you’ve been to that cliff.

34
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,750
I saw you, Do Min-joon.

35
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,120
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

36
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,620
I’m done with the police station.

37
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,290
I can go now that your friend is here.

38
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,800
Of course.

39
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,430
Go now.

40
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,200
And, I’m not a friend but a boyfriend.

41
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,610
I haven’t finished yet.

42
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,880
Darn it.

43
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,810
What did you mean?

44
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,850
What did you see on the cliff?

45
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,550
I may see it wrong.

46
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,960
You might be over frightened.

47
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,659
Yeah.

48
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:50,000
If you have illusion,

49
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,800
see it as me but not him.

50
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,440
Hee-kyung.

51
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,670
Thank you.

52
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,910
I thought I’d die.

53
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,350
If it hadn’t been you, I would’ve died.

54
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,980
Likewise. I can’t live without you.

55
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,720
Go in now.

56
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,120
[My Love from the Star Record 8]

57
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,760
What’s wrong?

58
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,159
You barely make mistakes.

59
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,830
Because...

60
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,020
Who is he?

61
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,820
What happened?

62
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,930
The brake master cylinder is dismantled.

63
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,630
That’s impossible.

64
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,870
Get rid of her.

65
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,240
Yes.

66
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,140
Who is it?

67
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,180
We found ourselves lying on an expressway afar

68
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,850
when we were conscious.

69
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,350
And Cheon Song-yi was not there anymore.

70
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,990
Who is that guy that popped up?

71
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,460
I don’t know.

72
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,460
I have no idea.

73
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,600
I’m asking what you gave her.

74
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,240
Why is her memory for an entire hour gone?

75
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
She was kidnapped from Seoul.

76
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,810
But now she remembers nothing about that.

77
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,580
Some medicine must have been given to her.

78
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,610
Ms. Cheon Song-yi suffered
from inattentive vagus.

79
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,380
We only gave her normal saline.

80
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,780
No medicine was given.

81
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,490
I haven’t ever prescribed yet.

82
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,020
She said there was a guy
who put injection for her.

83
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,290
Who was it?

84
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,690
I have no idea.

85
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,659
I can only saw him in a white robe.

86
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,500
Didn’t see his face.

87
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,000
Let’s have your blood tested first.

88
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,370
Where can I have a look at the CCTV?

89
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,940
Can we go to another hospital?

90
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,940
I hate crowded place.

91
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,140
I’d rather stay at home.

92
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,510
The CCTV in the hospital was destroyed.

93
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,410
It’s must be a lunatic who planned all this.

94
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,020
Don’t worry. I’ll have them brought to justice.

95
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,720
I said don’t call the police.

96
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,390
I don’t want to be gossiped anymore.

97
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,860
I’m so annoyed and exhausted.

98
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,230
What?

99
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,700
When can we end all this?

100
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,510
I feel so unsettled and heartbroken

101
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,010
when seeing you going inside alone.

102
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,380
I don’t want to do this anymore.

103
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,550
I’ll go in now.

104
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,520
Okay, call me if you need anything.

105
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,780
Open the door! It’s me!

106
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,130
What happened?

107
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,830
Someone must have broken into my apartment.

108
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,530
It’s in a mess.

109
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,370
What?

110
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,340
What if that guy is hiding inside?

111
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,410
Do you have other places to stay at?

112
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,190
You can stay here for now.

113
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,560
It’s strange that you’re always there

114
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,930
whenever I get myself into trouble.

115
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,940
But... I think you were there, right?

116
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,170
Where?

117
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,140
Nothing.

118
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,580
I’m getting more and more paranoid.

119
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,120
What happened?

120
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,760
Are you hurt?

121
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,190
I ran into a trivial accident
when I left the police station.

122
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,260
What accident?

123
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,630
Not a big deal.

124
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,530
Stop bothering me. Get some sleep.

125
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,110
What are you doing here?

126
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,280
Hey, you should wrap yourself up more.

127
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,020
Get in the car.

128
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,830
I just drove Song-yi home.

129
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,030
I was reluctant to leave her.

130
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,640
I want to send some body guards for her.

131
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,010
But you know, she’ll turn it down.

132
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,610
Se-mi, can you sleep over at Song-yi’s place?

133
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,020
I can drive you there.

134
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,950
She doesn’t even allow me to call the police.

135
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,250
This is not a trivial matter.

136
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,620
That jerk kidnapped my Song-yi.
And I don’t even know who it is.

137
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,090
I’ll definitely skin him if I catch him.

138
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,300
You’re here to say these to me?

139
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,730
Aren’t you shocked?

140
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,500
Song-yi got into such huge trouble.

141
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,740
There’s no need for me to be startled at all.

142
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,970
A lot of people will give their hands to her.

143
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,110
You’re the first to help her
if anything bad happens to her.

144
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,080
Did you have fight with her?

145
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,020
She’s in trouble now.

146
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,720
Did she lose her temper on you?

147
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,360
You’re a kind girl. Please forgive her.

148
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,530
Hee-kyung. Must I be a kind person?

149
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,900
Actually, I’m not a kind one.

150
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,070
I’m an evil one. My kindness is just my disguise.

151
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,070
Only you would think...

152
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,510
Why are you an evil person?

153
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,620
Se-mi, you’re the best girl in this world.

154
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,250
I can tell you what I can’t tell Song-yi.

155
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,060
Yoo Se-mi, I’ll only tell you this.

156
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,060
What is it?

157
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,430
I...

158
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,740
Like...

159
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,840
Cheon Song-yi so much.

160
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,810
I don’t know why.

161
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,710
That girl is rude and arrogant,

162
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,490
always making me embarrassed in public.

163
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,190
But what now?

164
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,390
I like her so much.

165
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,330
Please hook us up as friends.

166
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,860
She doesn’t even lay her eyes on me.

167
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,000
Please do me this favor.

168
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,070
Please.

169
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,840
You’re a kind girl.

170
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,050
That man 12 years ago.

171
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,790
That man who saved Song-yi in the accident.

172
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,060
I saw him.

173
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,630
What?

174
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,400
Where did you see him?

175
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,170
How can you recognize him?

176
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,840
I witnessed that accident.

177
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,340
So I saw him accidentally.

178
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,980
Okay, if you say so.

179
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,250
Who is him?

180
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,750
Did he tell you

181
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,590
that he saved Cheon Song-yi?

182
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,360
I’m sure it was him.

183
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:56,130
What if I tell Song-yi this? What would she do?

184
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,440
Song-yi has been waiting for him for so long.

185
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,630
Who is that man?

186
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,800
Who is he

187
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,330
I’m sorry.

188
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,000
What?

189
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,770
I’ve starred in many films so I know it.

190
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,240
I know what it means that I’m wearing your shirts

191
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,470
in your place with an excuse
of having nothing else to wear.

192
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,310
So what does it mean?

193
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,050
You may have s crush on me as a man.
But don’t misunderstand me.

194
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,319
I only borrowed your shirts
because I was too frightened to fetch mine.

195
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,319
There’s nothing more.

196
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,790
It’s none of my business.

197
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,890
Yeah, although you say so,

198
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,830
you must feel the opposite in your mind.

199
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,900
People are all the same.

200
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:40,170
They’ll have a crush on pretty things.

201
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,150
Is this vase pretty?

202
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,520
What do you mean?

203
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,590
People will not have a crush on a vase
however beautiful it is.

204
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,030
So it is for other things.

205
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,130
People will not have a crush on a lovely puppy

206
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,730
or on an almighty pine tree.

207
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,530
What does that mean?

208
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,970
You, Cheon Song-yi,

209
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:17,010
make no difference
with a porcelain, a puppy or a pine tree.

210
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:23,950
Don’t worry that I’ll have a crush on you.

211
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,120
Get more rest if you have time.

212
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,520
I got it.

213
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,960
I’ll go to sleep right now, who is the same
with a porcelain, a puppy and a pine tree.

214
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,190
Please bring me a blanket.

215
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,930
Sleep inside.

216
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,530
You want me to sleep on your bed?

217
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,300
Just this once.

218
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,770
Well...

219
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,380
I’m tired today, so I need a good sleep.

220
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,620
And you know I have insomnia.

221
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,090
Please get me a book so that I can fall asleep.

222
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,090
You read for getting asleep?

223
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,290
It works so fast.

224
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,970
Touch nothing.

225
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,640
Okay.

226
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,440
Wow, have you read all these books?

227
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,850
I mean, are these are read or to be read?

228
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,680
I’ve read them all.

229
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,850
Then why are you keeping them?

230
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,050
For showing off?

231
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:40,390
You’re showing off yourself
with such large quantity of books?

232
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,130
Or are they the proof of you being a professor?

233
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,930
I don’t get it.

234
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:49,200
You can give them away or sell them.
Why would you keep them?

235
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,670
Cut it out.

236
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,570
Pick one.

237
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,080
What are these? Some alien language?

238
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,320
It’s not alien language but Chinese.

239
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,490
It’s the book I mentioned to you last time.

240
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,290
Seriously?

241
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,860
I need to get some sleep with it.

242
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,960
How am I supposed to read it?

243
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,860
[The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane]

244
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,830
What is this one?

245
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,610
Oh, it has pictures.

246
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,270
I like books with picture

247
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,940
Not bad.

248
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,220
Edward falls on the ground with large noise.

249
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,690
Then he rolls over the long and dusty slope.

250
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:51,660
Finally, he stops. Then he stares at the sky,

251
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,630
speaking the names of constellations.

252
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,400
He stops,

253
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,370
thinking...

254
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:07,980
How many departures without farewell
do I have to go through?

255
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,550
Somewhere in his body starts to pain.

256
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,450
He just wants to cry out loud.

257
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:23,960
Open your heart, there will be someone
coming to pick you up.

258
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,070
But you have to open your heart first.

259
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,800
No. No.

260
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,640
Never believe. Never believe.

261
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,360
But it’s too late.

262
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,460
The heart of a porcelain

263
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,840
has been opened.

264
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,020
[Unicinctus. Trepangs.]

265
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,390
Would you like some unicinctus?

266
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,590
They’re so fresh in this season.

267
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,300
Where is he?

268
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,980
[Cheon Song-yi]

269
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,720
What?

270
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,490
Leaving me alone in fear again?

271
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,630
Where is the umbrella?

272
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,490
Why would you take a pair of woman’s shoes back?

273
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,450
I said I didn’t take it!

274
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,890
You’re outrageous, Do Min-joon.

275
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,340
Where have you been in this early morning?

276
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,240
I just... did some shopping.

277
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,290
What’s wrong?

278
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,690
About this.

279
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,660
I need your explanation.

280
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,060
You said you didn’t take it.

281
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,930
Do not act like a snob.

282
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,440
I misunderstood you.

283
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,070
What would you do with woman’s shoes?

284
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,610
You said so, right?

285
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,380
Did I?

286
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,340
Sure.

287
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,650
You did say so.

288
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,220
I bought some unicinctus.

289
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,490
Darn it.

290
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,530
“A man in a good disguise...”

291
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,160
What was it?

292
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,660
“Makes trouble under the table.”

293
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,330
Right. Under the table.

294
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,470
This saying is so right about you.

295
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,800
Just admit it that you’re tempted by the shoes.

296
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,840
Will the truth kill you?

297
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,410
I have countless of them.

298
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,380
You can keep a few pairs of mine.

299
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,150
I didn’t take it for...

300
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,880
Hey, it’s okay.

301
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,750
All people have hobbies. I won’t mock at you.

302
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,820
Don’t be shy.

303
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,020
Tell me if you have any
colors or styles in your mind.

304
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,090
You can keep them as gifts.

305
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,790
What’s wrong with you, sir?

306
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,620
Why did you turn around suddenly?

307
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,120
I’m fine. Leave now.

308
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,530
Are you okay, sir?

309
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,300
Can you stand up?

310
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,710
Are you hurt? Should I call 119?

311
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,380
I’m okay. Young man.

312
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,350
You should have yourself checked at the hospital.

313
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,390
I’ll do it. Thank... thank you.

314
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,490
You...

315
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,870
Dad, don’t go!

316
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,410
Don’t leave me! Don’t go!

317
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:59,930
It’s lean. Clean and delicious.

318
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,300
That’s fine. Leave it.

319
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,210
I’ll wash them.

320
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,570
Your hand is hurt. You can’t wash them.

321
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,980
I can do this for you since I live at your place.

322
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,980
Right?

323
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:30,030
I found that bowl in person in 1693, Ly Dynasty
at the white porcelain at South Jeolla.

324
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,860
It was made by the most famous
porcelain maker then.

325
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:37,940
It’s extremely invaluable.

326
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,770
Oh, it’s okay.

327
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,510
I was thinking this bowl is old enough.

328
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,880
Why are you still using them?

329
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,320
A lot of tableware in your kitchen
should be abandoned.

330
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,720
What about I get rid of them all for you?

331
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,990
You can’t do that!

332
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,160
I’ll wash them. Step away.

333
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,560
I said I can do it.

334
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,960
Don’t be sorry. It’s okay.

335
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,730
I can do it.

336
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,740
I’m good at chores!

337
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,870
See?

338
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,880
That one is a white porcelain of Ly Dynasty

339
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,420
with the inscription by Mr. Heo Gyun.

340
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,420
Oops!

341
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,130
Sorry.

342
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,900
I got it.

343
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,900
I’ll buy you an identical one.

344
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,740
No. I’ll buy you a more expensive one.

345
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,840
It’s sold everywhere. Especially in Incheon.

346
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,280
Wait until I finish it.

347
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,750
Don’t move. Don’t do anything.

348
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,350
Or I’ll ask you to leave.

349
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,920
I got it.

350
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,190
Can you let go of me?

351
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,310
You’ve committed intimidation and mayhem.

352
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,510
But you’ve pleaded guilty.

353
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,820
And we’ll not detain you.

354
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,050
Let him go after the testimony is given.

355
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,020
Turns out this guy is only a creepy stalker
of Han Yoo-ra.

356
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,930
He was prohibited from getting close to her
when she was alive.

357
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,630
It’s unfortunate for Cheon Song-yi
to be targeted by this guy.

358
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,440
But what does it mean?

359
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,170
Ah?

360
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,710
Death Experience Pavilion?

361
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,480
Han Yoo-ra’s been there?

362
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,980
Well,

363
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,810
the stalker saw

364
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,580
that she’s been there with a man a month ago.

365
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,450
Death Experience Pavilion?

366
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:10,390
It’s it lying in a coffin and writing a death note?

367
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,820
Why would she go there?

368
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,030
Is it the time when she wrote the suicide note?

369
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,800
Then that one is forged.

370
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,970
Can we believe that crazy guy’s words?

371
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,240
But there are still blind spots.

372
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,580
I called that pavilion.

373
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,950
They said they’ve never seen Han Yoo-ra.

374
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,550
Can you get surveillance tape on that day?

375
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,890
I’ve ask them to mail it.

376
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:48,860
But they said something was wrong
with the facilities. They can’t offer the tapes.

377
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,000
Are you thinking

378
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,370
that Han Yoo-ra didn’t commit suicide?

379
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,970
If it’s not a suicide,

380
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,610
the murderer should be

381
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,080
someone who benefits from her death.

382
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,550
Someone who asked her to the pavilion

383
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,050
and took her suicide note away.

384
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,550
Was Han Yoo-ra dating someone secretly?

385
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,920
That stalker said he knows that man’s face.

386
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,660
It’s our priority to confirm his face.

387
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,700
Who will it be?

388
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,700
What’s this?

389
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,770
That one?

390
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,100
The teddy bear given by a fan.

391
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,270
Isn’t it cute?

392
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,350
What are you doing?

393
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,680
I didn’t find that USB.

394
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,090
I didn’t find it at Cheon Song-yi’s place.

395
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,290
I’m sorry.

396
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,970
What are you doing?

397
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,510
What’s this?

398
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,610
The same person did it.

399
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,010
I’ll check other places in this apartment.

400
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,520
Pack your stuff and get ready to leave.

401
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,690
This is unsettling.

402
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,120
Do we have to wait

403
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,980
till so late?

404
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,290
One, two, three.

405
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,550
Can you ask them to come in advance?

406
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,620
I’ll ask them.

407
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,760
Oh, Hee-kyung.

408
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,560
Hey, pleasure to meet you.

409
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,760
Se-mi. Do you have a second?

410
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,700
Are you here due to your curiosity?

411
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,200
Do you want to know who that man is?

412
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,940
I’m indeed curious.

413
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,570
But I came not because of that.

414
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,570
I’m here to ask you for a favor.

415
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,580
What is it?

416
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:25,120
Don’t tell anyone who that man is,

417
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,220
including me and Song-yi.

418
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,460
Please.

419
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,700
Hey.

420
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,730
You must know what I mean.

421
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:45,270
I tried not to say this
in case you feel unsettled.

422
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:49,040
I’ve watched your interview.

423
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,340
You said you’ve been loving
a man in secret for a long time.

424
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,980
I can’t believe it.

425
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,220
Why didn’t you tell me?

426
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,750
Who is it?

427
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,760
Who is this man that hurts you for so long?

428
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,260
Should I talk to him?

429
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,060
Never mind.

430
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,630
No. You should just confess your love to him.

431
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,860
Look at me.

432
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,570
Cheon Song-yi, who was too tough to be conquered

433
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,770
seems to be moved

434
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,270
by my constant efforts.

435
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:22,409
Just confess your love to him without hesitation.

436
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,880
What should I do?

437
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,550
It’s a piece of cake.

438
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,350
If you find it hard to have
a face-to-face conversation,

439
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,280
just call him.

440
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,850
As soon as you get through,
you say, “I like you.”

441
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,150
It’s done.

442
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,659
Actually, a man

443
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,489
is easy to be moved

444
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,230
by a woman’s love confession.

445
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,570
Go for it.

446
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,699
And don’t forget what I’ve asked of you.

447
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,239
I sneaked out at lunch time.
Now I have to come back.

448
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,570
I’m leaving.

449
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,880
[Se-mi]

450
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,790
Hey, what’s wrong?

451
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,560
Why do you call me?

452
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,330
I said you should call that man you like.

453
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:24,600
Just call him.

454
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,140
Please.

455
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,880
Thank you.

456
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,950
It was rude of me

457
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,380
not greeting you last time.

458
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,260
Your place is quite different from Song-yi’s.

459
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,690
Did you rent it

460
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,620
for a short period?

461
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,830
Or did you get it from your parents?

462
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,960
Do you have anything to talk to me?

463
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,330
Now that you’re Song-yi’s manager,

464
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,000
we have to keep close contact.

465
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,940
That means you’ll have to satisfy me

466
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,110
so that you’ll be a good manager.

467
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,980
I heard you went to Harvard.

468
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,250
How old are you?

469
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,350
You look young, do you have a girlfriend?

470
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,320
What does your father do as a job?

471
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,690
Do I have to answer all these?

472
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,730
You passed.

473
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,800
You can keep your secrets,
which satisfies my demands.

474
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,500
The top priority for a manager
is to keep secrets.

475
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,170
Do not give your answers randomly to reporters.

476
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,410
Well... Mrs. Cheon.

477
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,250
This is my number.

478
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,980
Text yours to this number.

479
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,590
I’ll call you whenever you’re needed.

480
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:24,390
Keep your phone on for 24 hours.

481
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,260
Right.

482
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,030
Report to me

483
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,100
if anything happens to her.

484
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,730
Promise.

485
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,980
Excuse me.

486
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
I would like a portion of sticky candy.

487
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,880
Make it cooked.

488
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,680
Octopus tentacles taste better
than the sticky candy, right?

489
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,880
It’s chewier.

490
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,850
Okay.

491
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,090
Make it two portions of octopus tentacles.

492
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,590
Two rare portions.

493
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,260
That’s right.

494
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,260
Aye. Not again.

495
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,100
Does she keep doing this?

496
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,130
Amanda Seyfried is still chasing you?

497
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,100
I’m so annoyed!

498
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,570
Gosh.

499
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,630
What about you?

500
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,040
Is Hyun-a still the same?

501
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,870
She needs me 24-7.

502
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,340
She says there will be no tomorrow.

503
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,460
Cheon Song-yi.

504
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,690
Are you okay?

505
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,260
Yes.

506
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,270
I’m here to return these.

507
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,340
But it was Do Min-joon who borrowed all these.

508
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,570
Why is it you who return these?

509
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,470
What Do Min-joon?

510
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,110
I asked him to borrow them.

511
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:55,810
Hey, why would you ask such a
handsome and cute man to borrow comic books?

512
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:00,020
I have no idea about it.
I even complain about him being overdue.

513
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,790
Cut it out.

514
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,520
I need to ask you something.

515
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,330
You mean, a man was in the car.

516
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,900
Then he popped up in front of you
in less than a second?

517
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,970
Your car was about to fall from a cliff.

518
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,440
And that man stopped the car with his body?

519
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,300
Exactly.

520
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,700
Then he disappeared in less than a second.

521
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,570
That’s right.

522
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,980
What?

523
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,510
Make sure you go to see a doctor.

524
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,580
Please do so.

525
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,390
Doctor.

526
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,060
Please don’t tell anyone that I’ve been here.

527
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,030
Please keep it as a secret.

528
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,830
Ah, rest assured.

529
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,700
Please tell me what you’ve been through.

530
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,240
The first thing that makes me paranoid was...

531
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,810
It’s too detailed for a dream.

532
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:05,550
But it’s super abnormal for reality.

533
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,450
And...

534
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,760
I saw that clearly.

535
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,660
He was in the car a second before.

536
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:23,170
And he saved my life a second later.

537
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,300
Do you think I’m a lunatic?

538
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,210
Of course not.

539
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,510
Keep going.

540
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,250
And there was a decisive matter...

541
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,650
Do Min-joon!

542
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,550
Ah!

543
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,320
He just popped up?

544
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,350
Like a thunder?

545
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,720
Yes!

546
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,820
He is not the Flash.

547
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,530
What’s more surprisingly.

548
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,630
He vanished

549
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:54,370
when I got off the car.

550
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,870
Are you diagnosing that I’m a lunatic?

551
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,010
I am not.

552
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,740
You had illusion.

553
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,740
Caused by sudden stress in a short period.

554
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,550
Acute reaction stress.

555
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,380
One of the acute stress responses.

556
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,050
You just have kind of disease.

557
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,350
What is it?

558
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,190
Acute sufferings and stress

559
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,520
may cause you mental disorder.

560
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,260
It’s possible for you to have illusions.

561
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,160
You may have fear.

562
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,530
Your symptom is caused by such fear,

563
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,170
which is growing bigger and bigger.

564
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,740
Early symptoms include phonism.

565
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,170
Illusion will exist when the symptom id accelerating.

566
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:35,870
You mean I had illusions?

567
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,980
But I only see one specific person all the time.

568
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,550
It’s maybe someone you see a lot lately.

569
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,550
Or it can be that

570
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,750
you have anaclisis to someone gradually.

571
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,820
That’s why you often see this specific person.

572
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,030
Someone I want to rely on?

573
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,860
Yes.

574
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,100
However, under such a difficult circumstance,

575
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,370
over reliance on someone

576
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:11,410
will bring you and that person tiredness.

577
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,720
Try to get rid of such reliance.

578
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,390
Like releasing the air in a balloon.

579
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,530
Try to release your inner conflicts

580
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,290
through some conversations

581
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:32,230
or your interests or hobbies.

582
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,270
That may be a good choice.

583
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,170
What are you looking at?

584
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,270
What?

585
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:38,940
Why are you here?

586
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,340
I can do it myself.

587
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,010
You asked me to come.

588
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,210
Me?

589
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,610
Did I?

590
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:49,450
I am not that kind of person
who would rely too much on others.

591
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,620
I mean

592
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,450
I will not be that kind of woman

593
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,420
relying on you

594
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,750
who tires you out.

595
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,990
Just in case, don’t have any stress.

596
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,290
I don’t know what you are talking about.

597
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,100
I can do it on my own.

598
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,030
The brake master cylinder is dismantled.

599
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,270
That’s why the brake failed.

600
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,300
Who on earth is it...

601
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,470
It was lucky for you.

602
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,640
Did the car hit on a rock or something?

603
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,740
No.

604
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,550
Then why is there a crack?

605
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,710
Does it exist before?

606
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,350
No. It never existed before the accident.

607
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,050
The car must have hit something.

608
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,050
The brake failed. It can’t stop itself.

609
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,790
-Mr. Shin.
-Yes?

610
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,860
Ah!

611
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,670
Aye. It’s not possible.

612
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,870
What?

613
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,600
Nothing.

614
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,570
I have an appointment with Hee-kyung. I gotta go.

615
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,980
Are you late?

616
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,080
None of your business.

617
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,010
Mind your own business.

618
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,350
I said so, right?

619
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,720
I am not that kind of woman

620
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,690
who would bring you trouble or tiredness.

621
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:00,890
Did anyone say anything to you?

622
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:03,160
You keep repeating it.

623
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,420
No. It’s just random talks.

624
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,500
Mr. Yoo.

625
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,440
I don’t believe that this really happened.

626
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,940
What’s wrong?

627
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,480
That crazy stalker with a helmet on. Remember?

628
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,580
He’s dead. He died!

629
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,250
What?

630
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,320
The rain made the road slippery.

631
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,950
Why would he ride on a motor on the road?

632
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,820
That’s supposed to be used by cars only. Right?

633
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,460
Yes.

634
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,460
He’s the only one that can prove
the fake suicide.

635
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,000
The only one!

636
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,260
Gosh.

637
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,810
Song-yi.

638
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,720
I’m startled.

639
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,650
Jae-kyung.

640
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,420
Why are you so easy to be frightened?

641
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,050
Right.

642
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,090
I ran into too many abnormal things lately.

643
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,630
I was nearly scared to death.

644
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,730
Where’s Hee-kyung?

645
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:17,230
He should be here first.

646
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,180
I heard from Hee-kyung

647
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,050
that you had an accident.

648
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,050
Yeah.

649
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,250
Be alert.

650
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,980
Okay.

651
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:42,690
There are too many lunatics.

652
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,260
The one who kidnapped me,

653
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,290
may be the same person with the one

654
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,960
who installed an interceptor on my teddy bear.

655
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,430
If it hadn’t been him,

656
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,370
I would have been dead.

657
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,340
Who is he?

658
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,470
What?

659
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,640
The man who found the interceptor

660
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,080
on the teddy bear.

661
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,580
How did you know that?

662
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,250
Oh?

663
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:16,150
I never told you that he found the interceptor.

664
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,530
Isn’t it obvious?

665
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,230
Let’s go.

666
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:48,820
Song-yi.

667
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,920
Did Se-mi tell you anything?

668
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,890
What is she supposed to tell me?

669
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:56,060
Nothing.

670
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,630
Jae-kyung.

671
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:05,840
Yes?

672
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,970
Why do I feel that

673
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:12,910
Yoo-ra didn’t commit suicide?

674
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:17,020
What are you talking about?

675
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,820
I saw something.

676
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:24,360
It’s a video of Yoo-ra’s meeting with a woman.

677
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,330
It’s doubtful.

678
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:31,000
That woman told Yoo-ra

679
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,600
that she must leave somebody

680
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,770
or she’ll die.

681
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,000
What?

682
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,010
Who is that “somebody”?

683
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,880
I have no idea.

684
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,210
Where is that video?

685
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,880
Go to the police station with the video.

686
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,380
If Han Yoo-ra was murdered,

687
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,450
your name will be cleared.

688
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,920
Don’t act rashly.

689
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,590
The rumors just ceased down.

690
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:02,660
This will stir it up again.

691
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,900
So.

692
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,300
Where is that video?

693
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,400
Do you need me to check it out?

694
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,770
It went missing.

695
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:16,640
Went missing?

696
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,710
Yes.

697
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,880
It went missing.

698
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,330
I win again.

699
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:35,860
Yeah.

700
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,800
You should go home.

701
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,730
What? So quick?

702
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,400
It’s not quick.

703
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,270
It’s snowing. There must be a traffic jam.

704
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:49,310
Let’s have another run.

705
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:52,680
No one’s waiting for me anyway.

706
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,080
Since when does anyone wait for you?

707
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,820
That’s true. Never.

708
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,260
Cheon Song-yi moved in, didn’t she?

709
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,490
Did she go back to her apartment?

710
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:05,860
No.

711
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,830
She said she had a date tonight.

712
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,230
It’s freezing cold and snowing.

713
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:15,030
And she had an accident yesterday.

714
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,570
She can make her decisions.

715
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:21,640
I can’t interfere.

716
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,510
It’s nothing to do with me.

717
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:28,310
Did Cheon Song-yi have a date
with the man who likes her?

718
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,850
Why would you...

719
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,790
You look like you’re jealous.

720
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,160
Excuse me?

721
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,030
Wrong assumption.

722
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:44,730
Two months left.

723
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,530
Your asset is almost sorted out.

724
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:53,170
But I can’t sort your heart for you.

725
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,710
You’re back.

726
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,510
You said you would go back late.

727
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:34,280
I’m tired so...

728
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,380
Come and have a seat.

729
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,450
What are these?

730
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,620
Didn’t you see?

731
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,090
Chicken and beer.

732
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,620
You said you went for dinner.

733
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,820
You haven’t had dinner?

734
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,390
I don’t know.

735
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:48,490
I just don’t have appetite. I ate nothing.

736
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,530
I was so starving when I got home.

737
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,060
And I ordered these.

738
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,300
Enjoy yourself.

739
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,430
Hey, don’t go.

740
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,000
Eating alone is weird.

741
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,340
Let’s have it together.

742
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,370
I don’t drink alcohol.

743
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:03,180
Nonsense. You just haven’t got used to it.

744
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,610
You’ll get used to it.

745
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,550
I said so because I did it before.

746
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,920
[1634. The brothel of Hanyang.]

747
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:15,090
Everyone,

748
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:17,790
have you heard about mixed wine?

749
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:19,760
[Mixed wine:
A mix of rice wine and Soju, aka the
deep bomb cocktail in the Joseon Dynasty.]

750
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,690
In the reign of Emperor Yeonsan, a poet

751
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,300
once said about mixed wine,

752
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:29,670
that a cup of it empowers you to talk to gods,

753
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:34,870
another cup makes you one of the nature.

754
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,710
Come on, fill your cups.

755
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,350
Cheers!

756
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,190
Hey, you.

757
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,660
Why wouldn’t you drink?

758
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,730
Because I rode a horse here.

759
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,070
Recently, a lot of drunk riding accidents occur

760
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:06,370
With people dying and being hurt.

761
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:10,580
I heard that master prohibits drunk riding.

762
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,450
You overreact about dangers that even don’t exist.

763
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:19,480
You can leave your horse here.
A chauffeur can carry your sedan.

764
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,520
Good idea.

765
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,290
Come on, one more drink.

766
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:29,530
Cheers.

767
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,630
We’ve empty our cups.

768
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,430
Yeah.

769
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,650
That’s a good one.

770
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,230
Hey, what are you doing?

771
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,210
Mischief!

772
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,750
Mischief! That’s mischief!

773
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:26,680
Won’t you drink?

774
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:29,310
I said no. I won’t drink.

775
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:33,690
What now?
You’re reluctant to drink with a porcelain,

776
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,620
a puppy,

777
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:42,360
or even a tree?

778
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,130
Are you drunk already?

779
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:48,670
No.

780
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,240
Definitely no.

781
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,610
Listen to me carefully.

782
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:59,640
There’s chemi… between a male and a female.

783
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,380
Chemi... It’s an abbreviation or something.

784
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:07,250
Whatever. It means a crush between two people.

785
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,390
But I... I’m filled up with chemi.

786
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,330
No man would escape from my charm.

787
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,160
They’d be really turned on.

788
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,460
Does it mean that there’s no crush
between me and other women?

789
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,000
No, that’s not true.

790
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,400
Every female would be turned on, too.
Their switch of jealousy will be turned on.

791
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,900
In a word.

792
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,170
I’m the charming girl.

793
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:27,770
Women are jealous of me.

794
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,510
I’m Cleopatra.

795
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:31,310
You should have yourself tested

796
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:32,980
if you’re sober and say these words now.

797
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,380
I have.

798
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,150
I have myself diagnosed by a doctor.

799
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:41,790
This made me speechless and furious.

800
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:45,190
I went to a doctor because of you.

801
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:49,130
And I was diagnosed
as being over obsessed to you.

802
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:55,470
And you, you said I am no difference
with a porcelain, a puppy and a tree!

803
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:58,070
It’s never occurred to me so far in my life.

804
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:01,110
How can you feel nothing between us
if you are a common people.

805
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,580
I won’t let it go easily.

806
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,980
I’m gonna regain my fame.

807
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:10,620
How can I face my fans like that?

808
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,490
I need to stand on the summit again.

809
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:14,950
No way.

810
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,530
Give me 15 seconds.

811
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:23,800
What 15 seconds?

812
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,670
I’m also known as “an elf of 15 seconds”.

813
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:31,340
I’m capable of drawing all attention
within 15 seconds of my ads.

814
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:36,680
So, please give me 15 seconds.

815
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,680
If you still think I’m no difference
with a porcelain, a puppy and a tree,

816
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,250
I’ll admit that there’s nothing between us.

817
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,490
Go.

I can’t help looking back at her.

829
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:41,330
Also, I can’t help regretting.

830
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:42,700
Regret for what?

831
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:50,810
For failing to live every simple day
like normal people.

832
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:55,350
For failing to share every common morning
and night with someone.

833
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:00,520
For failing to have a home where there’s
someone who would be waiting for me.

834
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,390
For failing to confess my love to her.

835
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:05,760
I’m so regretful

836
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,960
for the trivial things that

837
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,030
those common people have done

838
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,440
but were once mocked by me,

839
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:26,910
those sweet and warm moments.

840
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:30,150
Now, I suddenly want to enjoy them too.

841
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,450
What should I do?
