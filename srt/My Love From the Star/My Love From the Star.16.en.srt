[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,220
I don’t think you understand it.

3
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,290
So I’ll make it clear now.

4
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,900
I hate you, Do Min-joon.

5
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,730
I even hate you now.

6
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,770
Please keep your distance.

7
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,200
No. Please disappear from my life.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,940
Please.

9
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,980
And, I hope you can be aware

10
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,580
how selfish you are.

11
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,470
What are you doing?

12
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,740
I am being selfish to you.

13
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,100
Do Min-joon, you...

14
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,170
You’re absurd.

15
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,600
Ridiculous.

16
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,410
What? Do you like me?

17
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,650
Do you?

18
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,370
You’re a poor liar.

19
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,140
Normally people would say yes in such atmosphere.

20
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,850
Is that common on your planet?

21
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,750
Kiss the girl you don’t like.

22
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,920
On my planet,

23
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,050
we don’t do that.

24
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,620
We only kiss the one we like.

25
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:39,360
It’s not right. What do you think?

26
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,850
Damn it!

27
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,220
Do Min-joon?

28
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,490
Wake up.

29
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,820
What’s wrong with you again?

30
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,839
You’re a man. Where’s your superpower?

31
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,310
You fainted every time you kissed me.

32
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,610
The key, where’s the key?

33
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,910
-In my pocket.
-Your pocket?

34
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:53,540
Hey, which planet are you from exactly?

35
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,060
[My Love from the Star Record 16]

36
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,100
You! Out of my way!

37
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,700
We’re in a hurry.

38
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,140
Out of my way.

39
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,870
He’s dying.

40
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,880
Get off. You slow grandpa!

41
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,380
We’re in a hurry.

42
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,320
Slow down.

43
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,820
I can’t breathe.

44
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,260
I’m risking my life to save you.

45
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,260
You okay? Do Min-joon?

46
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,800
Are you alright?

47
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,530
The road.

48
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,000
What? What did you say?

49
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,600
Say something, Do Min-joon.

50
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,640
The road. Watch out!

51
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,320
That was close.

52
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,490
You okay?

53
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,600
Tell me, this is not an accident, right?

54
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,640
Huh?

55
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,570
That kiss. You fainted after that.

56
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,110
The same with this time.

57
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,880
What is wrong with you?

58
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,980
I know you heard me. Tell me.

59
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,150
What’s wrong? What’s your secret?

60
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,990
Is it more terrifying than an alien?

61
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,790
We can’t make body contact?

62
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,659
But you’re fine holding my hands.

63
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,800
You can’t kiss me?

64
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,270
Right?

65
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,400
You’re noisy.

66
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,000
If you’re an alien like you said,

67
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,340
I’m different species to you.

68
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,110
You’re Mr. Alien. I’m Ms. Earth.

69
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,280
Isn’t that funny?

70
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,520
You need to tell me dos and don’ts.

71
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,090
How far can we go or can’t we go.

72
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,290
That means...

73
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,160
Anything beyond a kiss is forbidden?

74
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,630
We can’t go that far?

75
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,670
Stop that.

76
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,970
I know you’re an alien. What can’t I know now?

77
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,170
Dos and don’ts.

78
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,550
I can do this.

79
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,380
I know.

80
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,850
You can let me go.

81
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,830
Let me go.

82
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,730
You’re so bossy.

83
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,230
Fine, then.

84
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,380
Let’s sort things out.

85
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,480
I asked what kind of woman you think I am.

86
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,490
You ignored me.

87
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,290
I was so upset.

88
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,020
And you even mention the hairpin owner,

89
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,760
saying I looked like her. So you care about me.

90
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,730
Then you were indifferent to me

91
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,200
knowing that I’m not her. You said so, right?

92
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,470
I dropped the idea for that.

93
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,200
But you just popped up today.

94
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,840
You kissed me without my permission.

95
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,940
You can tell I’m so confused if you’re in my shoes.

96
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,620
Whom did you give that kiss to?

97
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,950
Was it me? Or that woman who looks like me?

98
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,830
You know what? The most complex relationship

99
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,900
is that with the woman in your memories.

100
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,300
If she exists, I’ll know what kind of person she is.

101
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,970
So I can compete with her.

102
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,040
But she only exists in your memories.

103
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,410
I can’t even compete with her.

104
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,210
I still want to know

105
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,580
whom you gave that kiss to.

106
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,820
To me or to that woman?

107
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,000
To Cheon Song-yi.

108
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,980
Who?

109
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,880
Cheon Song-yi.

110
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,420
I can’t hear you.

111
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,760
Cheon Song-yi.

112
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,630
Me?

113
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,730
Right. You.

114
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,630
What happened?

115
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,440
Hello?

116
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,240
Do you know what time it is now?

117
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,850
Worked overnight. I’m at the parking lot now.

118
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,820
I’m coming back.

119
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,500
I know what you’re thinking.

120
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,530
But it’s not true.

121
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,930
Worked overnight?

122
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,400
Yeah, you must have misunderstood it.

123
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,540
It’s not what you’re thinking.

124
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,700
Come in now!

125
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,420
You spent the night in his place?

126
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,390
You crazy?

127
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,900
I said, it’s not what you’re thinking.

128
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,170
His condition didn’t allow him to do so.

129
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,040
That is not important.

130
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,370
All men are the same. You fool!

131
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,940
Well.

132
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,240
The sun sets, the wall stands and the roof.

133
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,540
That’s it.

134
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,580
What is it?

135
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,680
The conditions all the men want.

136
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,820
The night falls and a room is set.

137
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,790
There will be only one filthy idea in his mind.

138
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,690
He’s not that kind of man.

139
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,830
He’s sick.

140
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,830
He’s still a man.

141
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,530
He needs to lie on a bed if he’s sick.

142
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,800
But if you lie on the same bed, you’re over.

143
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,040
Alas. I’m so pissed.

144
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,580
Dude.

145
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,580
We did nothing. Nothing.

146
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,520
It’s true that the night fell and a bed was set.

147
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,190
But we did nothing!

148
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,960
Absolutely nothing.

149
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,500
I didn’t expect that your brother would come.

150
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,740
I’m afraid he saw me there.

151
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,880
Jae-kyung, isn’t it nice to see you?

152
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,250
Oh.

153
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,690
When did he wake up?

154
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,420
This morning.

155
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,690
We had him tested.

156
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,690
Is he okay now?

157
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,190
No sign of paralysis.

158
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,300
Nervus motorius is back normal.

159
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,170
He can fully recover in a few days.

160
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,370
Like I said.

161
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,740
He will be fine.

162
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,810
See how strong he is.

163
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,810
You okay?

164
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,580
I feel dizzy.

165
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,450
Right. Doctor.

166
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,980
My head haven’t been shaved for that skull...

167
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,550
Cranial perforation.

168
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,650
Right.

169
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,960
Thank you for keeping my hair
while performing the operation.

170
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,600
But he lost his memories on that day.

171
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,100
Oh.

172
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,440
I only remember I booked a dining car
to be delivered to Song-yi’s shooting site.

173
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,970
But...

174
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,740
I can’t recall anything on that day.

175
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,510
You can’t?

176
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,880
The hemorrhage may cause cerebral concussion.

177
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,580
It’s possible that you lose some memories
with cerebral concussion.

178
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,550
It’s not a big deal if you can’t recall.

179
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,550
Not a big deal.

180
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,220
Hey, Jae-kyung.

181
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,390
Song-yi left the hospital when she recovered?

182
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,330
Look at you.

183
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,100
You’re still worried about that gal?

184
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,960
You should focus on your health.

185
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,100
Mom.

186
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,430
Don’t call her that.

187
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,700
You’re so back to life.

188
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,910
And you’re now annoying me.

189
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,540
No.

190
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,910
Where’s my phone?

191
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,050
I need to call her.

192
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,550
See how calm he is.

193
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,690
We can’t see him through.

194
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,960
Han Yoo-ra and I were dating.

195
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,700
It’s a bit of ambiguous. So I told you so.

196
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,070
But what’s wrong with it?

197
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,800
Please make it clear.

198
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,670
Did you date Miss Han Yoo-ra?

199
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,210
I don’t think so.

200
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,610
But Miss Han Yoo-ra may do.

201
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,680
I’ve met her for several times due to work.

202
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,480
She wanted to have dinner with me.

203
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,450
I assume you’ve dug into all my relationships with ladies.

204
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,420
Since I got a divorce,

205
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,360
I’ve never dated anyone for long.

206
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,660
Did you have contact with your ex-wife?

207
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,030
We’re separated.

208
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,730
Do you know where she is now?

209
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,930
I heard that she’s in Britain.

210
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,770
What does it have to do with this matter?

211
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,410
According to our investigation,

212
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,480
Miss Han Yoo-ra met with your ex-wife.

213
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,880
Oh, is that so?

214
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,180
You mean my ex-wife is in this country?

215
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,020
Or did Han Yoo-ra go to Britain?

216
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,790
Look at his expression.

217
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,730
That’s totally curiosity.

218
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:27,070
He looks much more sensible than that guy
who claimed that he can do teleportation.

219
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,870
Let’s go find his ex-wife.

220
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,610
She may know something.

221
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,510
That place in the video seems like a bedlam.

222
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,780
We haven’t confirmed its location.

223
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,650
And we investigated the paycheck.

224
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,220
No records of any hospitalization.

225
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,420
What about the location?

226
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,290
Here.

227
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,590
There is an apartment under her name in Gangnam.

228
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,990
But she isn’t there.

229
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,760
[Owner: Yang Min-soo 801007-200
No.63-2, Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam, Seoul]

230
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,930
Detective.

231
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,670
Detective Kim needs you.

232
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,900
[Undersecretary Detective: Kim Kuen-soo]

233
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,170
Why did you issue a public trail?

234
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,109
I know you’re enthusiastic about your work.

235
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:15,950
You want to make achievements. I just let it be.

236
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,680
But you’re doing useless things.

237
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,589
Han Yoo-ra may be murdered.
It may not be a suicide.

238
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,520
By whom?

239
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,660
The heir of S&C?

240
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,590
Use your brain.

241
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,660
He’s got everything he wants.

242
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,430
Why would he do that?

243
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,970
That’s why we need to investigate.

244
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,700
She committed suicide.

245
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,770
It’s obvious.

246
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,470
Hurry and close file.

247
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:56,050
Were you dating that dead actress?

248
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,290
Why would the procuratorate interrogate you?

249
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,760
I was telling them the truth.

250
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,600
I was not dating her.

251
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,700
Good.

252
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,600
You won’t make any mistakes.

253
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,110
Remember.

254
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,040
Ever since your big brother passed away,

255
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,880
I have all my hope on you.

256
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,350
You’re perfect

257
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,150
and flawless.

258
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,460
You’re my heir.

259
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,960
Yes.

260
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,870
What’s up?

261
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,900
My sister slept in your place yesterday, right?

262
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,870
It was not sleeping.

263
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,610
Excuse me.

264
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,180
Why do these two

265
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,480
treat my apartment like theirs?

266
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,960
Make yourself at home. Have a seat.

267
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,660
This is my home.

268
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,030
Since that kimchi container,

269
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,100
I have been suspecting you two.

270
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,370
Now it ended up like this.

271
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,880
I’m asking you as a man.

272
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,250
Do you like my sister?

273
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,280
What’s your name again?

274
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,220
Cheon Yun-jae.

275
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,920
It’s not important.

276
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,250
Do you like my sister?

277
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,160
Is it funny?

278
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,630
You asked me to sit down and you keep laughing?

279
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,830
I didn’t ask you to sit down.

280
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,470
You helped yourself with it.

281
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,700
Of course.

282
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,610
I’m here for a man-to-man,
a male-to-male conversation.

283
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,280
Do you like my sister?

284
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,950
Would you like some chocolate milk?

285
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,680
Do you have it?

286
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,890
Countless boys wooed my sister since high school.

287
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,130
I shooed them for her like a busy bee.

288
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,960
But it’s the first time that she likes a man.

289
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,800
I don’t know what she sees in you.

290
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,850
It’s a refractor, right?

291
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,120
It is.

292
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,390
Awesome.

293
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,120
How far can I see with it?

294
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,660
The Jupiter and Saturn.

295
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,360
Awesome.

296
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,140
Is this...

297
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,810
Limiting magnitude, 13.28.
Light grasp, 816.32 times.

298
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,710
A reflector that can observe nebulae
and star clusters in the Andromeda galaxy.

299
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,420
Are all these yours?

300
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,720
Yes.

301
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,690
Can I ask for something?

302
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,490
Go ahead.

303
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,630
Can I take a selfie with it?

304
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,530
Sure.

305
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,780
If you’re interested in stars, take these.

306
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,980
These...

307
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,980
Yes. Atacama Desert.

308
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,090
Atacama Desert in Chile.

309
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,820
My biggest dream is to go there.

310
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,030
I like this place the most on Earth.

311
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,100
It has strong sunlight, dry air and clear sky.

312
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,700
I feel that I am among the stars on the sky.

313
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,570
Trust me.

314
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:14,150
Don’t buy the idea that 2003QQ47 asteroid
would hit Earth in March 2014.

315
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,650
Don’t use it as an excuse to skip your study.

316
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,750
It was released by NASA, so I thought it’s real.

317
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,420
It’s not true?

318
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,130
The chance of hitting was 1 of 250,000.

319
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,800
But later the possibility to hit was eliminated.

320
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,700
Oh. I see.

321
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,670
I believe you.

322
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,670
I’ll not skip my study because of that.

323
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,340
We’re friends now!

324
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,570
So glad that we share the same hobby.

325
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,550
My sister has many weaknesses.

326
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,820
For you, it may be hard, but...

327
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,950
Please take good care of her.

328
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,420
I have one more favor.

329
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,690
Say it.

330
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,760
Can I have fun with you again?

331
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,030
[Cheon Song-yi’s boyfriend is a rich guy.]

332
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,730
Come on in.

333
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,510
Song-yi, here you are.

334
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,720
Come here.

335
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,700
What is this for?

336
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,340
My heart can’t take it. You want me to faint?

337
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,410
You fool.

338
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,750
What if you die?

339
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,780
Why would you be so impulsive?

340
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,120
I will never die. I like you so much.

341
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,600
If anything happens to you, I will be so painful.

342
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,270
How can I live in the future?

343
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,670
Why would you do this for me?

344
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,910
I did nothing for you.

345
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,340
Hey, Cheon Song-yi.

346
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,780
You make me fall in love with you.

347
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,880
Let me see.

348
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,480
Have you been hurt?

349
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,320
Hee-kyung.

350
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,190
I’m sorry.

351
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,430
Don’t cry.

352
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:50,540
I can’t like you back even if you like me.

353
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,070
I’ve troubled you.

354
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,940
I...

355
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,050
I like Do Min-joon.

356
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,020
I can’t control my feelings.

357
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,320
I see.

358
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,990
I can’t, either.

359
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,030
Hey, don’t be like this.

360
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,100
It makes me even sadder.

361
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,970
I don’t know if I can live a normal life
once I lose you, my friend.

362
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,910
At least I know we can’t be like this.

363
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,670
We…

364
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,280
Chance!

365
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,720
Let’s go.

366
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,920
Hee-Kyung, are you okay?

367
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,120
Chance.

368
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,860
You’re bleeding. What chance?

369
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,190
I want it. You’re grateful, aren’t you?

370
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,430
I will use it.

371
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,170
Why would you interfere?

372
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,330
They bully me, so what?

373
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,200
Now you’re hurt because you interfered.

374
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,700
I’ll not leave you alone.

375
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,970
I’ll seek for revenge from them.

376
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,840
Same in the future.

377
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,210
Hilarious.

378
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,280
Are you alright?

379
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,990
If you feel sorry, give me one chance.

380
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,930
What chance?

381
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,900
You have to say yes for a future wish.

382
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,240
Okay.

383
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,470
Really?

384
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,780
Sign it.

385
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,080
Sealed.

386
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,790
Remember?

387
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,560
It’s already sealed.

388
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,000
I do remember.

389
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,400
I wanted to use it long time ago.

390
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,370
I tried so hard to hold it back till now.

391
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,070
What’s your wish?

392
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,150
Hold what you’re gonna say.

393
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,980
Of course.

394
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,950
I love you, but you can’t love me back.

395
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,720
I feel sad about it.

396
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,690
If you can’t stay with me,

397
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,860
I’ll be so sorry.

398
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,300
So don’t say it now.

399
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,540
Never say it.

400
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,390
I heard from the nurse

401
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,660
that Song-yi came.

402
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,030
Yes.

403
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,560
I was interrogated by him.

404
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,570
So I told him

405
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,740
that you are Yoo-ra’s boyfriend.

406
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,140
Do you tell anyone

407
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,870
except for that police?

408
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,810
I told Hee-kyung about it.

409
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,910
Well.

410
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,220
Did Song-yi mention Yoo-ra to you?

411
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,350
She did.

412
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,520
What did she say?

413
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,790
They never got along.

414
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,990
She was so annoyed by her.

415
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,290
And Han Yoo-ra kept gossiping behind her back.

416
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:39,330
What else?

417
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,200
And...

418
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,170
What?

419
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,840
Did she say anything else about Han Yoo-ra?

420
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,640
What else?

421
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,510
Like what?

422
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,950
She said Han Yoo-ra’s suicide
has nothing to do with her.

423
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,420
As for anything else...

424
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,600
I might have hit my head.

425
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,800
I can’t pull the pieces together.

426
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,270
I would faint if I try hard.

427
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:25,880
Do you? Then Don’t push yourself.

428
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,950
Have some rest.

429
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,150
Okay.

430
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,970
It’s a nice guy. Mr. Do of the next door.

431
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,740
What?

432
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,940
The one who likes stars won’t be a bad guy.

433
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,480
He has a telescope in his place.
He can see stars any time.

434
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,210
How nice!

435
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,580
He doesn’t watch stars.

436
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,020
He came from a star.

437
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,260
What?

438
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,890
It’s true.

439
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,630
Do you think there are aliens?

440
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,600
Of course. They exist for sure.

441
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,430
I’m not exaggerating
but there may be one living next door.

442
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,140
I believe this idea.

443
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,570
What a genius.

444
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,280
Do Min-joon.

445
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,130
What’s up?

446
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,930
Awesome.

447
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,030
What do you need me for?

448
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,500
I was just trying if you can hear me.

449
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,740
You’re kidding me?

450
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,910
Do Min-joon?

451
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,070
Mr. Do Min-joon?

452
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,080
You can’t just leave like that.

453
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,250
I didn’t call your name to test you.

454
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,950
I miss you.

455
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,550
I miss you so I called your name.

456
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,550
Hey!

457
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,390
I said I miss you.

458
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,360
What a mean eccentric.

459
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,890
Jees!

460
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,570
How did you...

461
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,600
I’m still not used to it.

462
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,910
A mean eccentric?

463
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,110
I don’t mean it.

464
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,880
Let me go.

465
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,750
Stop it.

466
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,550
Let me go.

467
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,680
Stop it. Stop pinching me.

468
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,280
Hey, you!

469
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,900
Is this for me?

470
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,500
You don’t need coffee, young man.

471
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
Why do you make two cups?

472
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,570
Because I need two cups of coffee.

473
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,140
I have to recite my lines though I’m sleepy.

474
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,370
What?

475
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,750
Does your father

476
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,060
also come from the outer space?

477
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,460
My father?

478
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,890
Well.

479
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,900
He’s not my real father.

480
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,170
But he’s like one to me.

481
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,670
Not your real father?

482
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,040
He is not.

483
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,640
You don’t have any families on this planet?

484
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,780
How can I have families?

485
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,010
I see.

486
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,720
So you spent so many years all alone?

487
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,460
I’ve got good news.

488
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,490
I found my dad.

489
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,100
Although I suffered from the accident,

490
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,470
he came back for me.

491
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,040
We can’t live together for now,

492
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,610
but I’m so happy about our future meetings

493
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,810
on a mere phone call.

494
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,780
It’s strange that it makes me feel relieved.

495
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,750
All my pressure is gone.

496
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,880
Lucky me.

497
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,230
Do Min-joon.

498
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,800
You have me now.

499
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,530
I’ll always be with you.

500
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,170
I will not escape.

501
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,750
What?

502
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,620
What’s wrong?

503
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,580
Do Min-joon,

504
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,220
you’ll always look like this, right?

505
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,420
Pardon me?

506
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,430
You surely will.

507
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,230
You look exactly the same
in that 100-year anniversary photo.

508
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,960
Your hairstyle changed but not your look.

509
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,870
What is going on?

510
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,909
The time on our planet

511
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,239
is totally different from

512
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,679
the time here.

513
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,909
So is our aging.

514
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,150
What should I do then?

515
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,350
I’ll have cutis laxa,

516
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,380
wrinkles on my face,

517
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,520
gray hairs,

518
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,150
and stooping waist.

519
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,290
I’ll grow so old one day.

520
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,989
Calm down. You’re pretty even if you’re old.

521
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,060
Forget it.

522
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,389
Do you know the vampires in the movie,

523
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,830
who turn a girl into vampire by biting her neck?

524
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,830
Those men remain young forever.

525
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,100
But if the girl ages, this is not a happy ending.

526
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,199
Cheon Song-yi.

527
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,100
I don’t want to hear anything now.

528
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,370
I’m leaving.

529
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,940
Cold winds hurt my skin.

530
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,160
Will this work?

531
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:17,660
Gosh, I’ll be damned.

532
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,870
No way.

533
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,870
No way.

534
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,510
I’m almost 30.

535
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,570
What should I do?

536
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,980
We’ve invited Miss Kim Min-hee as our special

537
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,550
guest to share her skills of staying young.

538
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,350
I see you bring a pair of plastic gloves.

539
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,090
What is this for?

540
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,490
Blowing it like this

541
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,730
helps increase lung capacity

542
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,530
and removes reactive oxygen species.

543
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,100
It’ll be of help with staying young.

544
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,170
Wow, so this is your secret to keep fit?

545
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,110
Cheon Song-yi may think of it that way.

546
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,980
But this is not the point.

547
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,450
I’m going to...

548
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,390
Hush.

549
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,470
There is a tapping device on your bag.

550
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,510
Keep talking.

551
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,010
Oh, right.

552
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,580
I’ve met Mr. Lee Jae-kyung.

553
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,820
Ah...

554
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,450
I see.

555
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,890
He needs my assistance and offers me backup.

556
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,460
So.

557
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,330
What did you say about it?

558
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,700
I said I would think about it.

559
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,900
His offer is quite generous.

560
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,070
No matter what, I need to protect Cheon Song-yi.

561
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,240
Right.

562
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,610
But,

563
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,710
I asked him not to hurt anyone

564
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,080
and keep his head down.

565
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,520
As long as he keeps his promise,

566
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,480
I may help him.

567
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,490
Really?

568
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,230
If so,

569
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,760
if you think so,

570
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,100
that will be good.

571
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,040
I was shocked when I heard it.

572
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,810
Do Min-joon is going to breach the contract.

573
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,440
He paid 3 times of liquidated damages.

574
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,110
My good buddy, Min-joon?

575
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,210
Good buddy?

576
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,910
He’s cool.

577
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,920
If you date him,

578
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,250
I’ll absolutely agree to it.

579
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,690
I don’t agree.

580
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,520
Hee-kyung is alive.

581
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,920
And Do Min-joon’s father

582
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,690
is awful.

583
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,160
Hee-kyung will leave the hospital tomorrow.

584
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,940
I’ll take Jae-kyung’s ride.

585
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,010
Okay.

586
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,640
I’ll go to Song-yi’s place.

587
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,250
What about dinner?

588
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,550
I’ll have it with Song-yi.

589
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,250
Can you drive me there?

590
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:25,780
Sure.

591
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,350
Look how insensible you are.

592
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,890
You always do that.

593
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,320
Come on.

594
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,710
Nice to see you again.

595
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,740
I’ve seen you when I hanged out.

596
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,980
What?

597
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,380
I’m new here.

598
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,020
Is that so?

599
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,990
Wish you good luck.

600
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,620
Why can’t I remember faces?

601
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,360
I keep making mistakes.

602
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,650
You haven’t fully recovered.

603
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,080
Be careful.

604
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,910
Okay.

605
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,950
Say hi to Song-yi for me.

606
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,020
I will.

607
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,790
Go now.

608
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,650
Okay.

609
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,800
You mean

610
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,570
the crane was appointed by a delegated company?

611
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,610
The pulley was prepared by the VFX team, right?

612
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,310
Right.

613
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,410
Then what about the joint
that links the pulley and crane?

614
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,410
We’re responsible for that.

615
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,380
Are you okay?

616
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,450
I’m so worried.

617
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,690
I’m fine now.

618
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,520
Such kind of accidents seldom occurs.

619
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,660
This is what we used at that time.

620
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,130
The bolt was gone.

621
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,930
We should have checked it.

622
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,870
It’s our negligence.

623
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,340
We’re so sorry.

624
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,100
Don’t be.

625
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,870
I’m not here to blame

626
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,840
but out of curiosity.

627
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,380
You’ve been working with your teammates?

628
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,480
No.

629
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,310
We are short of hands sometimes.

630
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,850
Other teams would help us out.

631
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,990
There are temporary helpers, too.

632
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,890
What about that day?

633
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,790
That day?

634
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,290
Yeah, I think we had helpers that day.

635
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,130
Do you have a name list?

636
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,300
Wait a sec.

637
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,640
Ah. Here you are, bro.

638
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,770
Is your sister ready?

639
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,240
Hey, Cheon Song-yi.

640
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,540
Hurry up.

641
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,380
Min-joon is waiting.

642
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,650
Damn it.

643
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,610
But...

644
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,480
Yes?

645
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,150
I think you’re too rude to your sister.

646
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,390
Am I?

647
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,660
I’ll do better.

648
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,970
What?

649
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,440
What the hell?

650
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,310
Are you a high school student?

651
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,510
Is it weird?

652
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,610
Oh.

653
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,250
Damn.

654
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,850
My sister

655
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,050
has so many weaknesses.

656
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,360
Do you know what makes me upset the most?

657
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,160
I’ve been waiting a whole day.
But my part was deleted.

658
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,600
Why did they ask me to wait then?

659
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,130
What scenes will you shoot today?

660
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,830
Action scenes and...

661
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,200
Kiss scenes.

662
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
What?

663
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,910
Action scenes and kiss scenes?

664
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:07,740
Use a stand-in.

665
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,340
The action scenes?

666
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,370
No, the kissing.

667
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,210
Seriously?

668
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,040
Who would use a stand-in for kiss scenes?

669
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,050
You can initiate the trend.

670
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,720
Why would you obey whatever they say?

671
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,350
You should be a unique and creative actress.

672
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,550
Is it creative to use a stand-in for kiss scenes?

673
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:25,420
You’re so conservative.

674
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,360
It’s not that I’m conservative.

675
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,760
It’s true.

676
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,400
I lied.

677
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,070
All action scenes today.

678
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:36,270
I have to run back and forth or hang on wires.

679
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,240
Use a stand-in.

680
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,000
Why?

681
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,740
The doctor said so.

682
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,770
Your spleen was hurt, and you had pneumonedema.

683
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,040
If you keep doing that,

684
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,850
you’ll have it broken or superinfection.

685
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,510
What about I shoot the kiss scenes only?

686
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,620
Hey.

687
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,990
Do Min-joon.

688
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,490
Be there for me.

689
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,990
I’m neglected when I am not the leading actress.

690
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,000
I know. And many people treat me like a joke.

691
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,830
However,

692
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,770
I feel even happier than being a leading role.

693
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:12,100
Because I have you now.

694
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,310
Please don’t leave me.

695
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,150
It may take a long time.

696
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,910
But I will regain what belonged to me.

697
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,170
-Did you take them all?
-Yes.

698
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:41,870
Oh.

699
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,970
Haven’t seen you for a while, professor.

700
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,740
Yes.

701
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,280
Long time no see.

702
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,640
What brings you here?

703
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,380
No need to ask.

704
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,850
I brought him here.

705
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,420
Why did you bring him here?

706
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,480
I’m Cheon Song-yi’s manager now.

707
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,190
Oh.

708
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,260
Song-yi.

709
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,490
Good for you.

710
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,300
I was thinking that it’s hard
for you without a manager.

711
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,400
I heard from my mom

712
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,770
that you’re going to sign with S&C.

713
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,130
That’s not true, right?

714
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,470
It’s not.

715
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,970
[Midnight TV Show]

716
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,970
Right. The show Midnight came to interview us.

717
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,310
Can you take it before the shooting?

718
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,780
It’s about us, besties.

719
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,110
What?

720
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,310
What bestie?

721
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,720
Hello, Miss Yoo Se-mi and Cheon Song-yi.

722
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,620
You’ll jointly shoot a movie.

723
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,090
And you’re the famous besties in the showbiz.

724
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:44,000
Not long before Miss Cheon Song-yi
had some gossips with a rich guy.

725
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,830
Can you tell us something about that?

726
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,670
We’re just friends.

727
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:52,070
He’s an important friend.

728
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,680
As we all know, Cheon Song-yi has many gossips.

729
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,740
Yoo Se-mi has quite few.

730
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,880
Do you have a boyfriend?

731
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,250
I want to have one, too.

732
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,790
There were many boys falling in love with her.

733
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,590
It’s quite normal for her to have affairs.

734
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,060
Hey. I never do that.

735
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,400
Relax. I’m just kidding.

736
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,600
Miss Cheon Song-yi,

737
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,200
can you share some of your secrets

738
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,970
of staying popular?

739
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,270
As long as you have a pretty face.

740
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,080
Well, if you say so.

741
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,180
Miss Yoo Se-mi,

742
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,550
you are the leading role for the film,
how do you feel?

743
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,780
Honestly, I am pretty stressed.

744
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,420
With Song-yi here, I feel safe.

745
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,620
Oh, why? Miss Cheon Song-yi?

746
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,420
Tell me about it.

747
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,060
Song-yi always takes care of me

748
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,200
when she’s the leading role.

749
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,170
It’s my turn to look after her, isn’t it?

750
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:59,140
Miss Yoo Se-mi is indeed a real angel

751
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,940
I envy you so much for having such a bestie.

752
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,080
Say something to each other.

753
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,650
You go first, Miss Yoo.

754
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:17,090
Song-yi, our friendship will last forever, right?

755
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,660
Whatever.

756
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,770
Do you want to make a comeback?

757
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:35,140
Can you just at least play innocence?
Don’t say your real thoughts.

758
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,710
Can you do that?

759
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,510
You always spoke for Se-mi.

760
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,250
I didn’t.

761
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,810
Oh, here you are, Song-yi.

762
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,280
Director, what was going on
with the last shooting?

763
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,820
You kept me waiting
and then you left without trace.

764
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,990
Can you at least tell me in advance?

765
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,060
What happened last time?

766
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,460
Hey, I told you to inform Song-yi.

767
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,900
Yeong-chol, you didn’t notify her?

768
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,070
Oh, I forgot to make a phone call.

769
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,340
You brat.

770
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,500
Don’t do this again.

771
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,070
Please forgive him. Song-yi.

772
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:12,210
Where is the lighting team?

773
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:14,650
They’re so late.

774
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:19,050
Ridiculous.

775
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:22,720
They never even lay their eyes on me.

776
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,560
Sir.

777
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,400
Ah.

778
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,130
I’m sorry.

779
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:32,360
I failed to notify her.

780
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,330
It’s okay.

781
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,730
Well done.

782
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:35,570
What?

783
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:36,370
Why?

784
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:39,270
Do you know how many times
has she rejected my films?

785
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:43,710
She used to be so proud.
Now she deserves it.

786
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:44,510
So, director.

787
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,850
What about splitting her parts.

788
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:51,120
Leave her the first and last scenes.

789
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,520
Then she’ll have to wait for the whole day.

790
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,620
What’s wrong? Manager Do?

791
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,600
Cut.

792
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,470
NG.

793
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:10,800
Song-yi, your expression is not enough.

794
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,710
I need you to look more anxious.

795
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,940
I already am, director.

796
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,040
No, that’s far from enough.

797
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,410
One more time.

798
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,160
More leaves.

799
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,260
Or it’ll be dangerous.

800
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,790
Use a stand-in.

801
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,400
No, my face is featured.

802
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,430
Remember what the doctor said?

803
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,200
Your spleen was hurt, and you had pneumonedema..

804
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,270
If you keep doing that,
you’ll have it broken or superinfection.

805
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,270
It’ll be done soon.

806
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:47,370
I have done it for numerous times.

807
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:50,880
I think it’s quite good.

808
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,440
Take it.

809
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,750
Cut. NG.

810
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:07,490
Cut. NG.

811
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,160
I don’t like it. I don’t like it.

812
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,370
NG.

813
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,100
Her hairs.

814
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,140
NG.

815
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,110
One more time.

816
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,340
One more time. Do it again.

817
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,690
Cut.

818
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,090
Is it enough?

819
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:41,730
The first shooting is the best.

820
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,530
We’ll use that one.

821
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,660
Move.

822
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,660
Okay.

823
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,700
Move.

824
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,900
Move, everybody.

825
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,140
Lighting, move.

826
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,970
Yes.

827
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,210
Well done, everyone.

828
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,080
Ouch! It hurts.

829
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,280
Ouch! It’s killing me.

830
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,620
What is going on?

831
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,290
Are you okay? Director?

832
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,720
Ouch. Give me hand.

833
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,420
Be careful.

834
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:16,360
Who pushed me?

835
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,430
Who did it?

836
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,870
Who did it?

837
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:20,600
Are you okay?

838
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,830
Ouch, my waist.

839
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,010
You did it, right?

840
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,950
What?

841
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,750
You made the director and his assistant fall.

842
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,320
You did it, right?

843
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,120
What did I do?

844
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,120
It’s must be you.

845
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,730
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

846
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,260
What?

847
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,830
So what? No one sees that.

848
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:55,000
But having an alien manager is not a bad thing.

849
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,540
You can do everything for me.

850
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,000
What can you do?

851
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,840
Do you feel cold?

852
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:00,670
I am.

853
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:02,510
It’s freezing cold.

854
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,010
Can you do that?

855
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,820
Setting fire on your palm.

856
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:14,190
You know? Set fire on your palm with a snap.

857
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:15,790
It’ll cause fires.

858
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:18,290
Right.

859
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:21,490
But can you do that?

860
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:22,860
I’m not Batman.

861
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,700
So you can’t.

862
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,400
It’s freezing cold.

863
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,270
Can you keep me warm?

864
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,470
Any superpower that can keep me warm?

865
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,980
I feel so warm.

866
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,720
Shuffle.

867
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,960
The last shooting delays for one more hour.

868
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,360
It’s so late.

869
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:05,600
One more hour means
we have to wait for at least 3 hours.

870
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,970
What can we do to kill time?

871
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:10,880
Let’s play cards.

872
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,110
See?

873
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,980
Double!

874
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,690
I’m killing it.

875
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:23,160
What perfect cards I have.

876
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,190
I’m gonna throw this.

877
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:32,630
If it’s straight flush, I’ll be so invincible.

878
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:35,930
See? See?

879
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,140
I’m killing it!

880
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:44,840
Straight flush. Straight flush.

881
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,310
I got it. I got it.

882
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,050
I win too much today.

883
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:49,450
I’ll sell all I have and quit.

884
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,520
Sell them all.

885
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,150
Show your card.

886
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,190
No way!

887
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,790
No way!

888
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,720
The most expensive one.

889
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,430
What?

890
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,000
Are you cheating? Cheon Song-yi.

891
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,030
Call my Miss Overkill.

892
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,290
Hey! What’s this?

893
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:30,660
Goodness. Goodness.

894
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,820
Goodness. Goodness. I’m on fire!

895
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,390
Double! Double.

896
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:37,660
Double! Double.

897
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,700
You win. You win.

898
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,370
Now give me the money.

899
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:47,110
Thank you. Thank you.

900
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:49,140
Thanks.

901
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:58,120
It’s the first time that I’ve enjoyed
the stand-by hours so much.

902
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,720
Even a whole night is okay.

903
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,170
What should we do
on our 100th day anniversary?

904
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:23,040
What should we do?

905
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,650
100th day anniversary?

906
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:27,880
Yeah.

907
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:32,120
I don’t care about that usually.

908
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,050
But now I’m dating you, I care about it now.

909
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,830
It seems childish but I want to do it.

910
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:46,330
100th day, the first year and 1,000th day.
I want to spend them with you.

911
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:50,800
Which day do we start?

912
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,370
It’s a bit ambiguous before today.

913
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,980
What about starting counting from today?

914
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,850
What do you want to do on anniversaries?

915
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:02,950
Whatever people would do.

916
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,090
Shop for couple rings and T-shirts in day.

917
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,560
Dine at that spinning restaurant on Seoul Tower.

918
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,690
We can have dinner and watch the view.

919
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:18,000
They have a place where we can hang a love lock.

920
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,730
I’ve been there once for shooting a film,

921
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:26,470
thinking that next time I’ll be there
with a boyfriend.

922
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:30,780
When it’s our first-year anniversary,
we gotta have ice creams.

923
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,410
Ice cream?

924
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:34,810
You know what?

925
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:37,450
A lot of people bury a ring in an ice cream.

926
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,150
And a tour for the first-year anniversary.

927
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,920
What should we do on the 1,000th day?

928
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,790
It will be almost 3 years.

929
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,460
What about a backpack tour in the Europe

930
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,660
for, like, a month and a half?

931
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,200
What do you think?

932
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,610
What?

933
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,780
Cheon Song-yi.

934
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,220
What now?

935
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,280
What again?

936
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:17,090
Aren’t we dating?

937
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,690
I think it too much again?

938
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,430
That’s why you said so?

939
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:26,000
Being selfish to me?

940
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,130
Cheon Song-yi, as for what you want to do...

941
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,510
