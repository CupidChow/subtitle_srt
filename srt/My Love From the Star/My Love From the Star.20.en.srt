You don’t know how much I love you.

24
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,730
Living apart is much better

25

than your death.

26

that no one lives for death.

Relax, Do Min-joon.

171
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,250
I’m relaxed.

172
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,250
Don’t be intimidated. Don’t give in.

173
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,450
You only hide up when you’ve done wrong.

174
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,490
Hold your head up. You’ve done nothing wrong.

175
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,820
I know.

176
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,360
You should be braver.

177
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,990
Why?

178
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,030
I’ll get off first.

179
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,000
Together.

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,700
I’ve been through this many times.

181
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,300
I’ll handle this. Don’t worry.

182
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,910
What are you gonna do?

183
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,210
When I get off, the reporters will flock here

184
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,510
and surround me.

185
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,710
You take that opportunity to run inside.

186
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,520
Don’t try to

187
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,990
use your superpower.

188
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,620
You’re not in good health.

189
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,790
Don’t make it worse.

190
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,560
Stop shaking. OK? OK?

191
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, thanks.

192
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,240
OK. Ready.

193
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,140
Action.

194
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,520
Hey. It’s Cheon Song-yi!

195
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,320
It’s Cheon Song-yi!

196
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,920
Ms. Cheon Song-yi, where did you come from?

197
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,160
What happened? Were you kidnapped?

198
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,830
Let me answer you. I’m not kidnapped.

199
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,200
Then what happened?

200
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,400
Where is Mr. Do Min-joon?

201
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,960
Please tell us more details.

202
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,970
-Over there.
-It’s Do Min-joon.

203
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,270
Mr. Do Min-joon, did you kidnap Ms. Cheon?

204
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,440
-Hey. Excuse me?
-You disappeared with Ms. Cheon.

205
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,940
-Hey. Guys?
-Do you have superpower?

206
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,580
You’re just interviewing me.

207
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,710
-I am Cheon Song-yi.
-Please tell us.

208
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,080
What happened?

209
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,350
Hey. Wait.

210
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,690
Wait. No photo. No photo.

211
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,720
-Excuse me. No photo.
-How did you disappear?

212
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,460
No photo. Stop taking pictures.

213
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,390
Take my photos if you want.

214
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,560
Please put your cameras way.

215
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,000
-How did you disappear?
-Do you have hidden agenda?

216
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,470
What?

217
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,800
Mr. Do Min-joon,

218
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,310
please come with us.

219
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,010
I’ll explain it to you.

220
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,880
He didn’t kidnap me.

221
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,450
You can explain it in the police office.

222
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,080
Let’s go.

223
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,690
Could you please let go of him first?

224
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,390
[Missing Cheon Song-yi Showed up with Mr. Do]

225
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,290
Ms. Cheon Song-yi showed up with Mr. Do.

226
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,730
Cheon claimed to be Do’s fiancée.
She said that she was not kidnapped.

227
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,500
They kept how they disappeared as a secret.

228
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,470
What? Fiancée?

229
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,100
Is she insane? Did we allow it?

230
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,040
What’s wrong with her finger?

231
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,610
What an ungrateful girl.

232
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,280
[Not kidnapped. Do is Her Fiancé]

233
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,380
She didn’t even call us.

234
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,010
Is Min-joon under arrest?

235
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,450
That’s not good.

236
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,350
He’s the one you care about?

237
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,520
Your sister is also there. And she’s an actress.

238
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,790
Which police office are they going to?

239
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,990
Are you leaving?

240
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,530
You daughter’s in the police office now.

241
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,860
She’s safe now. That’s all I want to know.

242
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,470
Tell her to call me when she’s back.

243
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,700
But,

244
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,740
we will have dinner together when she’s back,

245
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,440
right?

246
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,410
You’re asking me?

247
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,320
Let’s have dinner together.

248
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,870
Mr. Do’s interrogation will be longer.
Go inside, please.

249
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,040
Ms. Cheon, please make your statement here.

250
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,300
Why can’t I go with him?

251
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,170
What will you do?

252
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,609
What else can I do?

253
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,440
Then let’s make things straight right here.

254
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,079
I’ve told you on the way to the office.

255
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,780
I’m his fiancée. That was not kidnap.

256
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,849
If you keep on badgering him, I won’t…

257
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,180
Cheon Song-yi.

258
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,819
What?

259
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,349
It’ll be fine.

260
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,660
OK. But…

261
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,030
If they try to hurt you,

262
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,060
go out immediately. Or just yell.

263
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
I’ll be here for you,

264
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,360
understand?

265
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,430
Hey, you think I’m from the gang or something?

266
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,170
Let’s go.

267
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,170
What age are you in?

268
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,480
Call me if it’s too much for you. Call…

269
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,310
Wait, I don’t have a phone.

270
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,180
If they extort a confession from you, call 119.

271
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,220
Wait, here’s the police office.

272
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,420
First, let’s talk about kidnapping Ms. Cheon.

273
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,660
But how on earth did you do that?

274
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,870
You disappeared when everyone was watching.

275
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,630
That’s superpower…

276
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,140
Impossible.

277
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,440
It doesn’t matter how I disappeared.
Is that illegal?

278
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,410
Is there any clause in laws that stipulates this?

279
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,750
Well,

280
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,280
this is the first time we encountered this…

281
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,680
If I haven’t broken any laws,

282
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,490
please talk about my illegal deeds.

283
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,520
I’m not sitting here to feed your curiosity.

284
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,470
You want some meat sauce noodles?

285
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,570
Will you provide Do Min-joon with food?

286
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,170
He doesn’t want to eat.

287
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,440
Then I won’t eat either.

288
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,880
Ms. Cheon Song-yi?

289
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,890
You came up to me previously, right?

290
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,790
I did. You have a good memory.

291
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,860
Um, is Do Min-joon inside?

292
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,830
Sir.

293
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,070
Hey,

294
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,310
I said I’d cooperated with you on Do’s case.

295
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,140
Why didn’t you answer me?

296
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,580
You didn’t get that message?

297
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,510
Korea Hospital is under our jurisdiction.

298
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,210
Nonsense.

299
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,280
The restaurant where he first disappeared
was under my jurisdiction.

300
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,850
And your case derived from mine.

301
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,160
That’s true.

302
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,460
And I have much of his info
from previous investigations.

303
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,100
I’m researching his background.

304
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,940
Hey, you,

305
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,570
don’t eavesdrop.

306
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,380
I’ll get to the bottom of this.

307
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,480
So just let me handle this.

308
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,190
I’ll go check if there are reporters.

309
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,690
You follow me.

310
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,070
Excuse me, can I get your autograph please?

311
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,940
I’m kinda busy now. Your name is…?

312
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,880
Did you use your superpower?

313
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,380
People say you are a wizard.

314
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,720
He doesn’t give autograph.

315
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,420
No autograph? Then what about a photo?

316
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,790
Or a handshake?

317
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,630
Why do you want handshake?

318
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,330
No.

319
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,660
My kid likes you so much because of the video.

320
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,400
He thinks you’re a superman.

321
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,500
Your kid? So you’re married.

322
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,770
Give her an autograph.

323
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,940
Her kid likes you.

324
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,380
No reporters here.

325
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,050
Please go first, Ms. Cheon.

326
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,950
No, I want to stay with him.

327
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,320
This is not for fun. It’s an investigation.

328
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,690
We’re not going to a park.

329
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,230
We’ll first drive you home…

330
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,730
-No.
-Cheon Song-yi.

331
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,930
I won’t listen. I’m gonna be with you anyway.

332
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,800
I’ll be waiting outside the interrogation room.
You can’t stop me from that.

333
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,610
You treated a patient at will in the hospital.

334
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,920
That’s a breach of the Medical Law

335
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,350
That was an emergency. Cheon Song-yi would

336
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,560
be in danger if not treated in time.

337
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,860
And now she’s recovered after treatment.

338
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,570
It was an emergency, not for personal profits.

339
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,840
That makes sense, right?

340
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,300
I think so.

341
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,810
Here comes the second problem.

342
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,380
You broke things in the restaurant.

343
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,510
How should we do with this?

344
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,250
12 expensive plates were broken.

345
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,450
And their turnover was compromised.

346
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,690
Fortunately, no one was injured.

347
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,920
So that can be deemed as a small case, right?

348
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,260
Is that so?

349
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,590
You’ve been really lucky.

350
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,000
If the keeper agrees, compensation will suffice.

351
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,570
What else?

352
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,070
Assaulting Lee Jae-kyung.

353
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,210
He deserved it.

354
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,880
What are you doing?

355
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,120
Can’t you tell? We’re covering up for you.

356
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,460
Why did you do that, Do Min-joon?

357
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,460
What do you mean?

358
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,930
[Exhibit 1]

359
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,070
You’ve been living as Ha Yun, Han So-jin
and Do Min-joon.

360
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,910
There must be secrets you want to keep.

361
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,810
But why did you ruin that in an instant?

362
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,050
I want to know the reason.

363
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,220
There must be someone you cherish, right?

364
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,100
Well, I met someone.

365
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,900
The idea of losing her drives me crazy.

366
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,570
Then I won’t be able to think.

367
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,840
I just did what I could do at that moment.

368
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,480
Think about it.

369
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,920
You all try so hard to protect your loved ones

370
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,390
that we’d rather fight, get hurt, or suffer.

371
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,160
You’re living life to the fullest.

372
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,460
I’m just doing the same thing,

373
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,440
All done?

374
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,950
Let’s go home.

375
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,220
They’re not home yet. The investigation
isn’t over.

376
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,590
The reporters now gather at the gate
and parking lot.

377
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,660
They can’t get home without passing the places.

378
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,470
Teleportation?

379
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,270
Are you joking?

380
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,270
There’s no such thing in the world.

381
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,350
Well, they’re not back.

382
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,750
-I’m not sure if they’ll be back tonight.
-What’s this about?

383
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,490
-They may have gone elsewhere.
-Well.

384
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,790
-Talk to you later.
-Wrong location.

385
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,460
Cheon Song-yi!

386
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,870
-Do Min-joon.
-Min-joon.

387
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,540
Who is he?

388
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,540
What exactly is Do Min-joon?

389
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,510
What?

390
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,380
I didn’t believe a single word from the rumors.

391
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,910
But just now… how did you get in?

392
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,750
I almost fainted away.

393
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,990
I’ll tell you later.

394
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,950
What if he’s vicious?

395
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,390
Yun-jae seems to know something.

396
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,960
I’ll ask him if you don’t tell me.

397
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,290
Mom,

398
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,430
he’s the only man I love in this world.

399
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,770
I’ve never loved someone, and will never do.

400
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,710
True that he is not a normal human,

401
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,950
but to me he’s just someone I love deeply.

402
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:18,560
So could you please prepare dinner for him?

403
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,460
What do we have for dinner?

404
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,400
It’s dried yellow croaker!

405
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,430
Terrific! That’s Do Min-joon’s favorite…

406
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,870
Hey, one for each of us.

407
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,810
I don’t do this because I like you,
but it’s time for dinner now.

408
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,450
Thank you for the food.

409
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,180
Thank you for the food.

410
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,990
OK.

411
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,320
Do Min-joon,

412
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,530
last time our family had dinner together was
12 years ago.

413
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,730
Why are you being so overcautious.
Use the spoon to fill your mouth.

414
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,730
That’s my business.

415
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,870
Yun-jae, you should eat more.

416
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,540
Yes, sir.

417
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,810
Mom, the soup tastes weird.

418
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,650
Is it? I think it tastes good.

419
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,020
How dare you judge my cooking.
You can’t even cook.

420
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,390
What do you think, Mr. Do?

421
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,660
What?

422
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,120
How’s the soup?

423
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,700
It does taste weird.

424
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,400
Hear that?

425
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,710
Don’t drink it. It’ll ruin your appetite.

426
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,270
I never drink her soup.

427
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,450
Don’t drink it then. Like I have to beg you.

428
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:07,470
This is my first time to dinner with “family”.

429
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,030
How do I feel?

430
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:18,510
I’ll be reassured if they are with Song-yi.

431
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,650
And I

432
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:27,420
want to live with them, too.

433
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,490
That’s how I feel.

434
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,800
Oh my. It’s very late now.

435
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,670
Go home when it’s easy to get a taxi.

436
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,140
OK.

437
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,940

00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,750
You want me to leave, too?

440

441
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,520
She doesn’t want you to bother Min-joon.

What? I just speak out my mind.

449
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,330
He doesn’t belong to you.

450
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,370
And you think he belongs to you?

451
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,940
Go home. Don’t be annoying here.

452
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,710
Why is she so easy to be captured?

453
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,640
You’re the queen of seduction.

454
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,580
Women need to be reserved to be attractive.

455
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,950
If so, I’ll be the exception.

456
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,820
Right, Do Min-joon?

457
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,590
Put it in the middle.

How do we make her popular again?

465
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,150
I’ve been sleeping on this.

466
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,960
Then I made up my mind.

There’re loads of people waiting to see me.

476
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,840
Wait a minute, Mrs. Cheon.

477
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,550

I can’t reach him.

You want Do Min-joon to work for you?

490

He’s not an artist.

That’s not the point.

492

Well, my daughter is also an item for you.

You buy it when its price’s rising, and abandon
it when it seems to depreciate, right?

Since when is she a righteous woman?

500
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,250
I didn’t say merchandise.

501
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,720
My mistake.

502
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,360
Why don’t you want me to drive you there?

503
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,630
There will be chaos if you show up.

504
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,330
I’ll be back soon.

505
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,940
Is it because there will be scenes of
kisses and hugs?

506
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,300
Of course not.

507
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,970
If so, ask for stand-in, understand?

508
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,210
Song-yi.

509
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,810
Hi, Hee-kyung.

510
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,550
Look at my girl.

511
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,160
You’ve suffered a lot

512
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,090
It’s because of Do Min-joon, right?

513
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:29,730
Why are you here?

514
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:33,970
I’m here to drive her to work.

515
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:38,400
I don’t think you should be in the public.

516
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,840
People are desperate to see you.

517
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,940
Right, did you lose your phone?

518
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,010
This is for you.

519
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,320
I was going to buy a new one.

520
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,690
The number’s changed.
We now share the same last figures.

521
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,160
That’s good. I always forget my number.

522
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,120
But your number’s like engraved in my brain.

523
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,360
Darn, I forget my purse. Wait a minute.

524
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
OK.

525
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,870
Angry?

526
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,340
No.

527
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,580
Not at all.

528
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,210
I don’t stop to make a move because I like you.

529
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,580
She’s so into you now.

530
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,150
So I just let you be.

531
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,050
But

532
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,590
I haven’t given up yet.

533
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,920
If you

534
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,590
are not around her anymore

535
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,900
or leave her behind,

536
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,730
I’ll take your place. You gotta remember this.

537
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,200
Then

538
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,040
I will never let her go.

539
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,620
Song-yi,

540
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,050
about Jae-kyung…

541
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,790
I know.

542
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,390
I’ve heard of it.

543
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,159
Sorry for putting you into trouble

544
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,860
for many times.

545
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,070
Hee-kyung,

546
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,639
I know you must feel bad

547
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,409
though there’s a smile on your face.

548
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,710
I’ve been there.

549
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:30,420
I eat and work like nothing ever happened.

550
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,389
But I’m dying inside.

551
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,190
What’s wrong?

552
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:42,159
Everyone else in the world seems to be happy.

553
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,239
It’s been a long time.

554
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,540
Thanks to you, this place has become noisy.

555
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,880
Too many reporters here.

556
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,750
You know I’m popular.

557
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,880
They’re not here for you, but your manager.

558
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,650
Isn’t Do Min-joon here?

559
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,660
That’s not your business. He’s not your man.

560
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,560
Thanks to you, director’s having a hard time.

561
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,060
That event was said to be hype for the film.

562
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,800
Thanks to me, your debut film will go viral.

563
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,900
They’ve changed the script.

564
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,200
Your scenes are increased.

565
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,470
I’m always that irresistible, right?

566
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:32,580
My acting skills speak for me.

567
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,450
Excuse me?

568
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,780
You can’t improve your lame acting overnight.

569
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,880
That’s not the case.

570
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,320
Han Yoo-ra’s case was solved.
People start to pity you.

571
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,650
Plus there’s a Do Min-joon,

572
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,120
who makes you somehow mysterious…

573
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,660
You’ve read all news about me, right?

574
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,260
And you’re reciting those reports.

575
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,730
Did you attack me online, too?

576
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,840
I’ll report all the slander against me some day.

577
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,810
You’d better stop now

578
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,410
if you don’t want to end up in prison.

579
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,340
What have I done to…

580
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,050
You have time now?

581
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,750
No.

582
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,430
I want to have a personal talk with you

583
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,500
when Song-yi’s not around. i will take your place

584
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,430
OK.

585
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:31,200
I heard something from Yun-jae,

586
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,210
but that was ridiculous.

587
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,340
Alien?

588
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,910
Seriously?

589
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,880
Yes.

590
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,980
That’s impossible.

591
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,220
Manager Do.

592
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,620
Do you have psychiatric history?

593
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,820
No.

594
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,760
You may find it hard to believe,

595
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,460
but that’s true.

596
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,140
It’s real skin.

597
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,580
Where are your parents?

598
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,180
That man isn’t your biological father?

599
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,220
Then where are your biological parents?

600
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,520
On your planet?

601
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:26,790
Do your family plan to move to Earth together?

602
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,900
We have different custom.

603
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,700
We don’t have concepts like family,

604
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,530
friends, or couples,

605
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,200
OK.

606
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,340
I see.

607
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,140
Go have a rest.

608
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,160
Do Min-joon.

609
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
Where has he gone?

610
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,900
He can’t walk around now.

611
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,840
Will he die

612
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,180
if he stays here?

613
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:00,120
I don’t know about that.

614
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,520
But I know he’s keeping some plants at home.

615
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,030
They start to rot from the roots

616
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,560
not long ago.

617
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,500
Do they have anything to do with him?

618
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,140
That’s just my guess.

619
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,690
Do Min-joon?

620
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,830
What’s wrong?

621
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,860
Are you asleep?

622
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,310
You don’t feel nervous anymore

623
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,550
when in the same room with me?

624
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,920
Is that so?

625
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,610
Do Min-joon?

626
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,410
Stop it.

627
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,150
You’ve scared me.

628
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,530
Don’t.

629
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:56,170
Don’t.

630
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,970
Don’t.

631
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,890
You wake up?

632
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,270
How can I not wake up

633
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,810
when you’re that noisy?

634
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:39,610
I thought you were dead!

635
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,150
I thought you were dead!

636
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,470
Tell me,

637
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:13,280
how many days are left before your departure?

638
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,880
About a week.

639
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,360
That’s too short.

640
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,660
I don’t want to waste the rest of our time

641
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,770
arguing whether you should go or not.

642
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,670
You saw me just now?

643
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:44,040
If you die before me,

644
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,240
I’ll cry like that

645
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,550
for days, months,

646
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,580
or even for years.

647
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,520
I’ll be guilty till I die.

648
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:07,130
I’ll be in pain because you die for me.

649
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,470
You don’t want me to be like that, right?

650
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,040
What about me?

651
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,910
I won’t be able to see you when I miss you

652
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,810
for the rest of my life.

653
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,180
What if I just can’t forget you

654
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,280
however time passes by?

655
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,390
What should I do then?

656
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,990
We have many photos.

657
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:39,030
You can take them with you.

658
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,700
Every time I miss you,

659
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,310
I’ll look at your photos,

660
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,980
and listen to the song you sang for me.

661
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,250
I’ll miss you.

662
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,290
You can do that too.

663
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,100
And we are left with enough time.

664
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,100
Let’s make 7 years, or ever 7 decades

665
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,110
out of 7 days.

666
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,550
Let’s just live every moment to the fullest.

667
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,620
If so,

668
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,460
do you still love me?

669
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:53,440
Go clean your face. You look terrible.

670
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,580
So

671
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,190
did I have an extraordinary week?

672
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,220
That was the most

673
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,990
boring and ordinary week ever.

674
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,300
Hey, what are they doing?

675
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,830
They’re have home advent!

676
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,800
You mean home advantage?

677
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,840
That’s what I said.

678
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,670
Well, can you help them?

679
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,940
What should I do?

680
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,080
You can’t help?

681
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,850
That’s annoying.

682
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,850
I can’t just sit here and do nothing.

683
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:36,880
I gotta order chicken and beer.

684
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,880
I’ve told you not to drink.

685
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,220
Just one beer.

686
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,050
No way.

687
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,520
You have one, and then two, then three.

688
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,190
Do you want to get drunk and trespass again
when I’m not around?

689
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,260
Cut out alcohol.

690
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,200
Hey.

691
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,540
Life is about choice.

692
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:05,480
I have to choose between you and her.

693
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,980
What kind of lines are these?

694
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:09,850
Do Min-joon, if Lawyer Jang and I both

695
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:14,090
fall into the water, who will you save first?

696
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,750
Where does that come from?

697
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,390
Tell me, who will you save first?

698
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,790
Make the choice.

699
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,560
You.

700
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,860
Really?

701
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,400
Lawyer Jang used to be a navy soldier.

702
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,800
He can save himself.

703
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,170
That’s the reason?

704
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:31,700
You don’t have specific reasons to save me?

705
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,910
What specific reasons?

706
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:36,340
You know it.

707
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,450
Never mind. I asked for it.

708
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,480
Leave me alone.

709
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,920
You want ice cream?

710
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,190
Go buy it.

711
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,630
That’s weird.

712
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:59,900
Why is that?

713
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,700
No, it’s not.

714
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,770
Three points.

715
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:08,240
And five points here.

716
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,670
Stop.

717
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,140
That’s not right.

718
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,010
Are you using your superpower?

719
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,880
I’m a top gambler. How can I lose?

720
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,880
You’re not in good health,

721
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,920
and you are wasting your energy on game?

722
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,520
I’m just good at this game.

723
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,090
I win. Let’s stop here.

724
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,960
Are you really going to punish me?

725
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,330
How could you hit me that hard?

726
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:33,000
Wait and see.

727
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,830
I’ll give you a French kiss

728
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,900
and make you faint away.

731
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,330
Do Min-joon.

732
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,700
Yes?

733
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,670
Come here.

734
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:26,450
What?

735
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,720
That’s the teleportation man

736
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,990
we saw on TV, right?

737
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,390
Really?

738
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,110
Where have you gone, Do Min-joon?

739
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,850
Damn, I didn’t bring socks.

740
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,580
Your feet must be cold.

741
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,930
Why do you suddenly lose control of it?

742
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,160
You must be shocked.

743
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,500
Lawyer Jang,

744
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,070
Yes?

745
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:54,170
It was in this park too.

746
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,310
Right.

747
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:58,380
I was about to die

748
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,410
when you saved me

749
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,850
You offered me rice with soup,

750
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,250
and brought me here.

751
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:12,060
Buckwheat jelly.

752
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,260
Glutinous rice cake.

753
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,090
Thank you.

754
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,460
Thank you for catching me.

755
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,070
I don’t know who you are,

756
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:26,440
but you’ve saved me and my mother.

757
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,050
Pay your debt with this.

758
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:35,810
If you want to die simply because you’re poor,

759
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,620
you must be dumb.

760
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,990
How will you pass the judicial examination?

761
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,760
Anyway,

762
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,860
pay me back when you pass the exam.

763
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,090
You just give this to me?

764
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,130
You trust me?

765
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,870
I don’t give you money because I trust you.

766
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:55,400
I trust nobody.

767
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,970
Then why?

768
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,740
I don’t like to interact with people.

769
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:09,780
Let’s just say it’s fate that makes us meet.

770
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,050
Thank you.

771
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:23,960
Thank you so much.

772
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:36,380
Can I shake your hand?

773
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:54,960
I don’t want to see you off.

774
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:00,530
It may sound strange

775
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:08,670
but I do feel like saying farewell to my son.

776
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,080
Lawyer Jang.

777
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,420
Yes?

778
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:25,590
A long time ago, a wise man said

779
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,600
farewells should be said in advance.

780
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,230
Because when the time comes,

781
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:44,140
people won’t be able to say them properly.

782
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,810
I’m really grateful to you.

783
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,820
I won’t forget you.

784
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,460
Are you OK?

785
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,700

Don’t you divorce me.

797
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,250
If you cheat on me, you’ll be a dead man.

798
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,320
I can feel it with my sixth sense, you know.

799
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,660
It is more awesome than your power.

800
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:46,300
You gave me a ring when you proposed to me.

801
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:50,070
I don’t have much money left since I have
to pay for all those life expenses.

802
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,980
This is my gift to you.

803
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,250
Don’t watch it now. I’ll feel embarrassed.

804
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:07,290
Wait until you’re alone.

805
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,890
Watch it when you miss me.

806

Again and again.

807
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:23,040
You’re not gonna say “I love you”, are you?

808
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,010
So I’ll say it in your place.

809
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,480
I love you, Do Min-joon.

810
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,750
You’ll live much longer than me.

811
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,620
So you’ll forget me eventually.

812
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:44,120
But don’t forget that

813
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:50,130

Of course.

I feel that if I say this when time is passing,

everything will flow away with time.

834

♫ You’re smiling even without me ♫

835
00:56:56,330 --> 00:57:02,600
So I choose to say it when time’s frozen.
