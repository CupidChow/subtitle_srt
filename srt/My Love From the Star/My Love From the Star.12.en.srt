He just protects you and can’t get you.

That's how it was. You must hate me so much.

Now I'm starting to understand.

37

but that man isn't important to me anymore.

I was curious for a long time.

54
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,260
Because he was the man who saved

me on the night my dad left.

56

But I'm no longer that little girl
who was crying because of my dad.

So if you’re going to threaten me

I don't care if I don't recognize him.

62

So don't mention him again.

171

A fierce dog, which was supposed to

179
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,120
get euthanized, escaped.

180
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,160
Oh my dear.

181
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,490
Isn't it dangerous?

Yes.

Are you sure he can't move?

190

Can I cook?

208

No. I always had fantasies about aprons.

Those bastards who sit at the Beotigogae

215

For what?

268
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,490
I heard everything from your brother.

You’re setting up a talent agency for Song-yi.

281
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,990
Didn’t you ask your brother?

282
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,900
I didn't know about it.

283
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,000

Ah, well...

337
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,480
It seems like Ms. Han Yoo-ra was seeing someone.

338
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,190
Maybe, she was seeing Do Min-joon...

339
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,720
Not him!

340
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,490
It's not him?

341
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,260
They didn't even know each other.

342
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,130
Then,

343
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,700
do you know anyone else?

344
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,020
What are you doing?

345
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,890
I was waiting for you.

346
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,200
Is that so? What?

347
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,500
You met Song-yi's mother?

348
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,200
Yes.

349
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,740
I heard you asked dad

350
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,910
to set up a one-person agency.

351
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,880
Dad said that it's not poss...

352
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,910
It's something I can do.

353
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,350
But, Song-yi doesn't want to.

354
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,050
She doesn't want to?

355
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:44,950
Yes.

356
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,960
She doesn't accept any help without any reasons.

357
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,760
Actually…

358
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,660
I didn't know how to bring it up

359
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,200
to her even if dad allowed it.

360
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,400
Anyway, thanks for caring.

361
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,100
Try to talk to her about it again.

362
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,030
Do you want me to talk to her?

363
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,840
No.

364
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,540
She's stubborn. Once she says no, then it's a no.

365
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,740
Yeah?

366
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,880
If she doesn't want to...

367
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,950
Yeah, good night.

368
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,360
I know the man Han Yoo-ra was dating secretly.

369
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,140
I saw them talking.

370
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,570
You saw?

371
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,710
What?

372
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,440
All of my friends

373
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,350
and your friends are here.

374
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,950
Just look forward to

375
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,990
what I'm going to say.

376
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,290
I'm going to make a surprise announcement.

377
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:02,490
You will be surprised too.

378
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,500
Yoo-ra.

379
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,430
Yeah?

380
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,930
How is your depression?

381
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,510
My depression all depends on you.

382
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,640
I even quit the meds a while ago.

383
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,750
You know that I like you, right?

384
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,680
Take care of yourself.

385
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,720
Take care of herself?

386
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,690
So they were in a good relationship.

387
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,530
Yeah, they were going out.

388
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:45,140
Han Yoo-ra was dating the heir to S&C.

389
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,240
Thank you for the information.

390
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:57,320
But what’s your relationship with Do Min-joon?

391
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,680
Well…

392
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,990
I don't know either.

393
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,090
Ah.

394
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,260
Can you leave? I'm tired.

395
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,540
Here’s Sky Mental Hospital.

396
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,880
Jae-kyung! Come see me!

397
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,680
Hear me out!

398
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,250
I'm not crazy! You know it.

399
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,150
No one here believes me.

400
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,190
You can get me out!

401
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:42,160
Is Yang Min-ju one of your patients?

402
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,660
No such person.

403
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,010
Are you alright?

404
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,980
What time is it?

405
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,150
It's past 12:00pm.

406
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,220
Are you in pain anywhere?

407
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,620
Fortunately, it seems not.

408
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,520
I was seriously scared.

409
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,030
What on earth happened?

410
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,730
I was hit by a car.

411
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,160
Why couldn't you block it?

412
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,800
I'm not too sure either.

413
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,600
It's the first time it happened.

414
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,940
Though I wasn't in a good state,

415
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,610
I always can use it.

416
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:35,380
However, I couldn't do anything.

417
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:41,350
My ability didn't work as I wanted it to.

418
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,290
Why it was suddenly like that?

419
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:52,100
Could this be related to the cold you feel?

420
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,470
It could be.

421
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,140
As the day gets near,

422
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,270
all the abilities I have are

423
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,910
disappearing one by one.

424
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,440
This won't do, seriously.

425
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,550
I should step up.

426
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,010
I already told Cheon Song-yi

427
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,780
that you are leaving and she should be prepared.

428
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,590
Lawyer Jang.

429
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,820
Yeah.

430
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,430
I've devoted a lot time to protecting you.

431
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,460
It's been the most meaningful thing in my life.

432
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,970
When you told me you were leaving soon...

433
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,610
Since I don't have to worry about

434
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,740
who will protect you after I die,

435
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,340
I thought it was rather a relief.

436
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,810
But you keep getting yourself involved in

437
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,350
weird cases and injured like this.

438
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,680
Your identity keeps getting revealed.

439
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,820
On top of that, now you can’t even use
your superpower as you wish.

440
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,860
I can't just sit and watch doing nothing.

441
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,600
You told me once.

442
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,130
You have interfered in humans' matters,

443
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,440
but things will happen no matter what.

444
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,940
And bad things become worse.

445
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,680
About the girl who died 400 years ago,

446
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,950
you couldn't save her, right?

447
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,780
Look what happened to you after getting

448
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,580
involved in Cheon Song-yi's affairs.

449
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,580
Nothing got better.

450
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,550
It will be hard for you to move on

451
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:27,060
if you see her every day here.

452
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,990
Why don't you move?

453
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,500
Moreover, you were going to sell it anyway.

454
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,970
I’ve taken care of your legal affairs.

455
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,470
I will also help you with your emotions.

456
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,580
What are you doing?

457
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,420
Is Do Min-joon okay?

458
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,780
Yeah, he's better.

459
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,250
Where are you going?

460
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,420
If you have to go, I can stay with Do Min-joon.

461
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,460
I can do it well, because I've done it last time.

462
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,560
You don't have to.

463
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,500
Also, I'm going to put the condo up for sale.

464
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,400
What?

465
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,360
I told you

466
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,800
that he’s leaving.

467
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,030
So please leave Do...

468
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,800
So please leave my son alone.

469
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,770
Please don’t see him anymore.

470
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,960
Incorrect password.

471
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,490
Incorrect password.

472
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,040
Do Min-joon.

473
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,770
Are you watching?

474
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,210
Are you watching?

475
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,050
Are you okay?

476
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,850
Are you really okay?

477
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,520
I had a lot to ask, but I don't

478
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,890
want to know anymore.

479
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,300
You woke up and...

480
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,800
That’s okay.

481
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,840
So that's good enough for me.

482
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,510
I miss you.

483
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,000
Who would dare attack a detective?

484
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:53,270
Do you remember anything?

485
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,909
It happened as soon as I got out of the car.

486
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,740
It’s…

487
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,710
I investigated while you were down.

488
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,910
On that day,

489
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,050
two trucks covered your car.

490
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,320
They knew exactly where the CCTV blind spot was.

491
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,590
So they did this.

492
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:13,460
All the cars used were stolen cars.

493
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,230
We found

494
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,130
this at the scene.

495
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,600
A pen.

496
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,600
[Evidence No.1]

497
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,300
It's limited edition but we don't

498
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,670
have someone in particular yet.

499
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,070
But...

500
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,470
What?

501
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:29,670
I found out something new.

502
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,880
I wish he can stay a few days longer,

503
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,980
but he won’t listen.

504
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,350
Is he okay to leave?

505
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,350
He can go back to his daily life,

506
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,290
but he needs to be

507
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,490
careful of working again.

508
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,260
Do you have a headache?

509
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,530
No, I'm fine.

510
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,460
You could have headaches sometimes.

511
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,070
Be careful of any shocks to your head.

512
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,710
What did you

513
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,670
tell him to make him

514
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,210
want to leave the hospital?

515
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,380
Ah, I…

516
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,250
I only talked about work.

517
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,450
You know how passionate he is.

518
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,520
For real…

519
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,420
No wonder Yoo Se-mi is so beautiful.

520
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,160
She looks just like you.

521
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,830
So?

522
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,460
He left hospital?

523
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,360
He is so stubborn.

524
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,570
Hey…

525
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:30,770
Thank you.

526
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,870
Can I talk to my mom?

527
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,300
Okay.

528
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,340
You know what I overheard?

529
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,010
Han Yoo-ra

530
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,880
may not commit suicide.

531
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,550
It's likely that it was a murder.

532
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,150
There is a suspect.

533
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,150
Who is it?

534
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,850
I don't know.

535
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,860
I didn't get that.

536
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,260
But if

537
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,860
Han Yoo-ra didn't commit suicide, Song-yi...

538
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,230
What's going to happen to her?

539
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,660
How would I know?

540
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,970
It’s obvious.

541
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,300
You've taken over all of her commercials,

542
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,470
and you are so successful right now.

543
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,970
Honestly,

544
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,910
I don't want her to make a comeback.

545
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,120
I liked the edited version of the scenario more.

546
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,950
Right?

547
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,250
That tone would suit you better, Se-mi.

548
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,320
By the way, director, ...

549
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,230
Who would take the role named Bae Soo-ha?

550
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,800
Well that... Lots of candidates there.

551
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,230
But we’re still thinking.

552
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,270
That role,

553
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,570
can Cheon Song-yi play?

554
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,140
Cheon Song-yi?

555
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,610
I thought she hasn’t worked yet

556
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,480
because of Han Yoo-ra's case, no?

557
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,280
Just keep it to yourself, director.

558
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,520
I think that case will be solved soon.

559
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,420
Oh yeah?

560
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,550
Comeback is not easy. Image is so important.

561
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,360
So I want to help her.

562
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,930
She helped me a lot.

563
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,660
Since this is my first time playing
the main role in a movie,

564
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,700
I think I will be comfortable

565
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,070
if Song-yi is next to me.

566
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,340
You are very loyal, Se-mi.

567
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,700
I will consider it.

568
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,140
But

569
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,070
the person who always does the main role

570
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,410
will she act as the main role's friend?

571
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,980
Since she is my friend,

572
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,150
she may agree.

573
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,250
Well,

574
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,290
I've done that for 15 years.

575
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,560
Ah, this house has a great interior.

576
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,470
It sits in south. The sunlight shines like…

577
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,070
Shh…

578
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,100
Actress. Actress.

579
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,440
Cheon Song-yi.

580
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:51,410
Cheon Song-yi lives right next door.

581
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:55,480
A lot of celebrities live in this building.

582
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,080
Anyways, this house was hurriedly put on sale
which is why it's at this price, so

583
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,320
you should get this quickly.

584
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,120
His father said there is someone inside.

585
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,260
Perhaps, no one is home.

586
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,290
Excuse me.

587
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,900
Did you come here to look at 2302?

588
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
Hello, Ms. Cheon.

589
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,870
Hello.

590
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:20,240
This house owner's father put it up for sale.

591
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,870
Ah.

592
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,150
Should I say this to the potential buyer?

593
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,510
-Em.
-What do you mean?

594
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,480
What?

595
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,020
This building is a bit...

596
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,850
Excuse me?

597
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,390
I think the house is doomed.

598
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,860
I can't fall asleep at night.

599
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,560
When I wake up in the morning, my body aches.

600
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,960
No.

601
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,660
Ms. Cheon Song-yi,

602
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,560
how could you say like that?

603
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,800
Our family has been in this real estate business
for 10 generations.

604
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,040
It's been known as a good housing lot
since the Joseon era.

605
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,210
And...

606
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,240
You know

607
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,680
how my career took a plunge here?

608
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,580
My career is almost over.

609
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,550
It happened right after I moved here.

610
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,150
Nothing worked out

611
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,820
after I moved here.

612
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,190
I lost people, money, and health.

613
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,460
It's only a superstition.

614
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,700
He can't go to a hospital?

615
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,840
And a policeman came to ask about him?

616
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,510
His father said that he's leaving soon?

617
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,550
His journal said three months left?

618
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,850
It's two months now.

619
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,180
Who is he?

620
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,520
I can't tell you.

621
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,120
I see red flags.

622
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,190
He sounds like a fugitive.

623
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,460
He's not like that.

624
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,790
Would criminals have it written on their faces?

625
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,260
Why couldn't he go to a hospital?

626
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,890
He's wanted.

627
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,760
Why would a policeman come?

628
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,660
Something is wrong with me.

629
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,700
3 months? It could be the statute of limitations.

630
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,340
Aren't you supposed to report him to the police?

631
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,240
You can't!

632
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,610
If you hide a criminal...

633
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,180
What is it called?

634
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,810
You can get charged for harboring a criminal.

635
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,420
I searched the internet, anyway.

636
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,020
If you are married to each other,
there won't be any penalty.

637
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,190
So,

638
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,490
you want to register your marriage
so you won't get any penalty?

639
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,590
Would it be really strange?

640
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,890
Is it only strange?

641
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,890
Why are you being like this?

642
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,560
You are Cheon Song-yi.

643
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,800
No matter how much you like
that person, keep your pride up.

644
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,820
Who's that good-looking cutie?

645
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,420
What cutie?

646
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,620
He's my little brother.

647
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,760
Really?

648
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,430
You look at that face every morning and night?

649
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,730
You lucky girl.

650
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,170
Who is it?

651
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,460
I thought you'd be hungry.

652
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,670
Who is this flower boy with the perfect body?

653
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,900
What's wrong with you?

654
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,740
It's Hee-kyung.

655
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,200
Hee-kyung?

656
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,610
He grew up so well!

657
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,510
Don't you remember me?

658
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,580
I'm Hong Bok-ja.

659
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,380
I don't know.

660
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,450
I sat next to you in 8th grade.

661
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,120
I guess you don't remember.

662
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,990
I cried a lot when you elbowed my

663
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,030
face for crossing the line.

664
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,960
I did?

665
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,660
So your mom had to

666
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,370
buy me a lot of stationery.

667
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:10,370
I see.

668
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,200
I'm sorry.

669
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,070
I guess only I remember.

670
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:16,170
What happened to your face?

671
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,810
You didn't eat today?

672
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,180
You like sushi right?

673
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,150
Here.

674
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,550
Here.

675
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,890
Lucky girl.

676
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,290
And?

677
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,460
Can I help you?

678
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,260
We're investigating Han Yoo-ra's death.

679
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,030
We found out that

680
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,030
you were dating her.

681
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,100
What?

682
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,800
Me?

683
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,570
Who told you that?

684
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,570
We can't tell you.

685
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:54,980
Someone saw you talking to Han Yoo-ra.

686
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,380
Can you tell us

687
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,720
what happened that night?

688
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,300
What?

689
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,470
He wants me to come?

690
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,800
Yes.

691
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,270
Where?

692
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,040
What a surprise.

693
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,650
When did you prepare all this?

694
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,650
I told you.

695
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,250
I like you more

696
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,320
than you think.

697
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,460
So I can put up with

698
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,920
some inconveniences for you.

699
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,760
You are not doing this because you are afraid

700
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,060
I am going to say something in public, right?

701
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,700
Let’s drink.

702
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,800
I can't drink right now.

703
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,440
It's non-alcoholic.

704
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,410
We haven’t been so happy for a long time.

705
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,340
You don't like?

706
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,760
Fireworks starts at 12, right?

707
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,930
It's going to start soon.

708
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,600
Why are you looking at me that way?

709
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,430
So that I can see you a lot when I can.

710
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:22,030
What?

711
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,910
To be honest, I’m confused a lot.

712
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:35,450
You can be this kind and sweet,

713
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:39,580
but why did your ex-wife do that?

714
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,120
That's why she's getting punished by you.

715
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,790
She deserved all the punishments.

716
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:50,930
Don't you worry.

717
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,030
I will never

718
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,430
betray you at all.

719
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:59,170
You won't be able to betray me.

720
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:01,170
I

721
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,410
know.

722
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,710
But,

723
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:11,050
Is this non-alcohol?

724
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,390
Why do I feel like I am getting drunk?

725
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,260
You're not getting drunk,

726
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,730
but getting paralyzed.

727
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,360
What?

728
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,030
You will soon

729
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:28,370
lose strength and won't be able to walk.

730
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,470
Your breaths will get short,

731
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,940
and your tongue will become numb.

732
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,740
And you'll eventually fall asleep.

733
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,940
Like you’re taking sleeping pills.

734
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,250
Even if it's detected later,

735
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,380
people will think that you took it.

736
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,780
So, you will be one of

737
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,860
the celebrities who killed themselves.

738
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,360
You…

739
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,960
are… kidding... Right?

740
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,180
I don't kid around.

741
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,210
So, why'd you do it?

742
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:16,650
I wanted to see you more often.

743
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:36,860
I don't know what you have heard.

744
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,360
But I was not dating

745
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,330
Han Yoo-ra.

746
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:43,270
She's the model of our apartment store.

747
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,340
We just met each other a little.

748
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,010
We were going to changethe model this season.

749
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,910
So I had to notify her

750
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:53,380
that night.

751
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,750
There was no argument

752
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,480
that you speak of.

753
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,220
Oh, excuse me.

754
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,550
I have plans for dinner.

755
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,130
I didn't expect this.

756
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:17,970
I didn't think you'd call me first.

757
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,740
I can't believe how well you are.

758
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,270
What exactly

759
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:24,610
are you?

760
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:28,050
I came to make a proposal.

761
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:30,280
I will do

762
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,050
what you want.

763
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,020
You want me to take all the blame

764
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,490
and disappear, right?

765
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,230
I will do it.

766
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,900
So…

767
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,330
Will you stop here then?

768
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,840
Is he home or not?

769
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,520
I think I can get over to that side.

770
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,930
Don't look down.

771
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,150
Damn it.

772
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,490
Do Min-joon?

773
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:43,250
Where are you?

774
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,420
Where am I?

775
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:49,290
I was risking my life to see you…

776
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,800
What?

777
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,630
I'm only on the verge of my death.

778
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,330
You can talk.

779
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,170
Can I see you for a sec?

780
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,440
You want to see me?

781
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,640
Okay!

782
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,910
I'll see you.

783
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,670
Okay!

784
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,530
What the heck? He's not even opening the door.

785
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,730
I guess I'll just have to open it myself.

786
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,630
It's not like I don't have a hand.

787
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,870
Are you really okay?

788
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,480
Your recovery was so fast.

789
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,980
Where are we going?

790
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,380
You said you wanted to ask me something.

791
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,920
Yeah, I did.

792
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,920
But I told you.

793
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,750
I don't want to know anymore.

794
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,160
Why not?

795
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,860
It doesn't matter now.

796
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,860
It doesn't matter who you are

797
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:33,160
or what happened in the past.

798
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,430
Or whatever you can't share.

799
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:40,340
I don't care at all.

800
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,840
You opened your eyes.

801
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,780
And you're awake.

802
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,620
And you're right next to me.

803
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,850
Nothing else matters.

804
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:57,890
But where are we going?

805
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,860
I like how you're keeping it a secret from me.

806
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,460
This is a date?

807
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:10,400
Just think that it never happened.

808
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:13,400
Why...

809
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,140
Why do I have to do that?

810
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:26,520
I have less than two months to see her.

811
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,890
I like her.

812
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,420
I like her.

813
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:38,360
I

814
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,200
like her.

815
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,170
Do Min-joon.

816
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:55,480
Where are you going in two months?

817
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,050
Is it far away?

818
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:58,850
Europe?

819
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,350
You know I can handle

820
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,990
distant relationships.

821
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:07,990
I have no problem going overseas.

822
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:10,530
When I go overseas for shooting,

823
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,800
I just had to pack a bit of kimchi

824
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,500
and I was fine to live there for months.

825
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:17,370
So,

826
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:22,610
if you push me away because you’re leaving...

827
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:25,080
I'm just saying...

828
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,410
You don't have to do that.

829
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,280
Two months is good.

830
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,760
One month is good.

831
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,760
I just want to be with her.

832
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,560
If I couldn't leave

833
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,870
and had to die here

834
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,470
like you said,

835
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:06,320
I'd rather not wake up from this happy dream.

836
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,320
I

837
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,190
want to do that.

838
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:23,630
Do you still think I can't do it?

839
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,040
Can't I?

840
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:37,150
You're not a fugitive, are you?

841
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,380
There's something called harboring a fugitive.

842
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,490
I don't want to get married all of the sudden.

843
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:47,390
It's not the statute of limitations, is it?

844
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:51,260
Oh! You have something on your arm.

845
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,700
They didn't lock the doors here?

846
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,270
How did you open it?

847
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,240
Aren't we getting dinner?

848
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,810
I didn't eat anything.

849
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:08,780
Hee-kyung got me sushi, but I couldn't eat any.

850
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,850
Cheon Song-yi.

851
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,120
I warned you

852
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,320
not to trust me.

853
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:19,660
The man you always trust

854
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:22,160
wants to tell you his secrets.

855
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,700
So I asked you out.

856
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,230
You don't need to tell me.

857
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:30,900
If you have to make a scary face like that,

858
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,700
then I'd rather not hear it.

859
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:41,580
Who saved your life 12 years ago?

860
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,980
Didn't you want to know?

861
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,020
The man who saved you back then

862
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:51,020
is me.

863
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:54,760
The reason I saved you is that

864
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:00,800
you looked like the girl from 400 years ago.

865
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:04,740
The owner of this hairpin.

866
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,740
You two looked so alike

867
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:15,480
that I was even confused.

868
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,750
What are you talking about?

869
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:23,320
The owner of the hairpin from 400 years ago?

870
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,490
How do you know her face?

871
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:33,060
Did you live 400 years or what?

872
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,800
Yes.

873
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:41,070
I came here from an outside world 400 years ago.

874
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:45,380
I could not return to my planet.

875
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,210
I had to live here for 400 years.

876
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:52,850
Do Min-joon.

877
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:54,620
Let's go home.

878
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:59,720
You're not well yet.

879
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,540
You said that you didn't care

880
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,650
who I was.

881
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,790
This is who I am.

882
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:36,860
Do you still think it’s okay?

883
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,850
The time for departure is near.

884
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,650
How do I feel about that?

885
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,290
I don't know…
