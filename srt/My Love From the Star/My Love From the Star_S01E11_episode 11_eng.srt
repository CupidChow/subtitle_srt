1
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,840

2
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,930
I need to take care of you first,

3
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,610
then I think it'll be easier to take care of Cheon Song Yi.

4
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,330
Goodbye.

5
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,810
What did I say?

6
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,090
I told you

7
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,630
that you can't ever kill me.

8
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,990
Listen to me carefully.

9
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,540
Stop here. Don't do anything.

10
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,890
How dare you order me what to do?!!!

11
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,430
Come out. Come out. Come out!

12
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,240
Oh, Yoon Jae!

13
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,150
It's me.

14
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,180
What do you mean where? You know that I'm next door.

15
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,450
Unit 2302.

16
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,150
Yeah, I'm at the door. I just left his place-

17
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,960
Yoon Jae! Yoon Jae!

18
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,070
What's the matter? What is it?

19
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,870
Hurry and call the police- I mean call the security guard.
 I think someone broke into the next door apartment.

20
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,550
What are you talking about? Did you go to the next door? Who's in there?

21
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,460
 Did he go on a date or something?

22
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,560
 Oh, Yoon Jae!

23
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,040
 It's me.

24
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,260
 What do you mean where? You know I'm next door... 
Unit 2302.

25
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,410
What bastard was he?

26
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,460
So why did you go in someone else's home?

27
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,460
You had the type of relationship between you where he told you his password?

28
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,350
Hurry up and contact the maintenance office for the security guard to come up.

29
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,470
Just drink this

30
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,800
and stop trembling like a little puppy.

31
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,330
It's only because I'm an actress that I survived,
 with my inspired acting ability.

32
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,540
My arms and legs are still trembling.

33
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,160
He's here.

34
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,370
Who is it?

35
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,220
 I'm here from the maintenance office.

36
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,470
 I'll give you your injection.

37
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,350
Yoon Jae!

38
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,790
What?

39
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,970
Don't open it.

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,800
It's strange.

41
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,310
Where did you say you came from?

42
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,840
I'm calling from 2301, the one that asked you to come 
up for a moment,

43
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,060
 Oh, I had something to take care of first. I'm coming up now.

44
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,490
It wasn't a maintenance person.

45
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,830
Why does this kind of incident keep-

46
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,190
Do Min Joon.

47
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,200
  Cheon Song Yi

48
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,160
 Do Min Joon, where are you?

49
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,040
 I just went to your house.

50
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,710
 Some man was in your house.

51
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,750
 Hello? Hello? Are you listening?

52
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,200
 Hello? Do Min Joon, are you listening?

53
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,400
 Just a minute, I think someone's here.

54
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,790
Who is it?

55
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,100
I said who are you?

56
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,450
It's me, Do Min Joon.

57
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,660
What happened?  I was just on the phone with you.

58
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,770
Are you alright?

59
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,920
Yes.

60
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,370
 My Love From the Star 
 Episode 11

61
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,120
Be careful Yoon Jae.

62
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,180
What is this?

63
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,680
What do you mean what is this?

64
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,710
He doesn't have a fever, but why is his body so cold?

65
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,400
You go and bring me the thermometer.

66
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,540
You know his password...and you're in a relationship 
where you lend your bed too?

67
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,820
I borrowed this guy's bed once too.

68
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,430
What?  Are you two dating?

69
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,390
-I said no!
-If not, then why are you two lending each other's bed and stuff?!

70
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,500
What does it matter to you! What does
 a high schooler know about the adult world?

71
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,750
Just go and get me the thermometer!

72
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,010
He said that he was better than a doctor,
 but he's the one bed ridden with sickness.

73
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:10,140
He gets hurt and fevers at the drop of a hat and
 now even collapses.

74
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,730
What man has such long eyelashes?

75
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,320
Oh! That surprised me!

76
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,900
Why are you surprised? Did you commit a crime?

77
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,170
What crime.

78
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,120
Do you like this man?

79
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,820
Jesus, hey. The Noona that you know,

80
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,770
am I a person to like someone by myself, am I?
 When he treats me like a piece of pottery?

81
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,650
Am I a woman who would do that on my own?

82
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,230
Is it a one-sided love, on top of that?

83
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,740
I said it's not! Go! Get out!

84
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,610
28 degrees? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

85
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,690
Can a person's temperature be 28 degrees?

86
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,450
Seriously.

87
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,380
What is this? Is it broken?

88
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,840
Omo! It's like ice!

89
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,910
Don't we have to go to the hospital?

90
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:20,300
Mom, Dad said that he was able to get a ticket.
 He'll get on the plane in three hours.

91
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,720
If something happens to our son, I will die too.

92
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,560
Mom why are you talking like that? That won't happen.

93
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,660
What bastard, what crazy bastard...to my son.

94
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,410
 Sunbae!

95
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,500
Yeah? Did you find out?

96
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,510
I looked into the fountain pen that was at the scene
 and found out that it's a limited edition.

97
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,580
Oh really?

98
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,040
They say that it's a fountain pen that was handcrafted by the master craftsman.

99
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,040
This product was made from orders he personally 
received, so there are exactly three made.

100
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,020
They say that one is tens of thousands of dollars.

101
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,850
Then it's a relief during this misfortune,
 when there aren't even any fingerprints.

102
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,310
Let's hurry up and find out who the three owners are.

103
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,420
Yes. I understand.

104
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,080
Just get caught.

105
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,890
I'm not going to let it go.

106
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,480
What about Jae Kyeong?

107
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,260
He'll probably come down. Eat first.

108
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,530
-Alright.
-But have the two of you...

109
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,580
have you heard news about Sister-in-law?

110
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,670
Why are you suddenly talking about that?

111
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,960
After that happened with Jae Kyung, didn't she
 go to England to study abroad?

112
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,140
Since then, every time I went to England I emailed her, but I couldn't even confirm it.

113
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,020
What do we need to talk about the news of a girl who cut 
off all contact?

114
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,230
Why is your face like that?

115
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,660
I was exercising.

116
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,810
But were you in the middle of talking about someone?

117
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,640
Huh? No.

118
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,880
Bring him rice and soup.

119
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,460
Hyung, are you also not keeping in touch with Sister-in-law?

120
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,970
What point is there in keeping in touch with an ex that
broke off with me?

121
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,160
I'll eat well.

122
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,200
-Perhaps the call from last time...
-I said stop!

123
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,940
Why do you keep bringing up someone who's not part of the family anymore?

124
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,840
What are you doing?

125
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,940
You woke up?

126
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,340
How about fried egg roll for breakfast?

127
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,440
Did you put jajang (black bean sauce) underneath?

128
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,340
It is okay.

129
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,840
We can eat the top.

130
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,640
How could this guy sleep for over 10 hours?

131
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,540
Do Min Joon.

132
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,440
Do Min Joon!

133
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,940
Look here.

134
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,650
Look here.

135
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,540
 Please look here.

136
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,140

His face and lips are purple. 
Also, his arms and legs are cold.

137
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,140
 It seems like he's poisoned by arsenic.

138
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,130
 Go ahead and take his pulse.

139
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,040
 Without a doubt, you will feel an abnormal pulse
 which is racing due to the five viscera.

140
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,540
 Looking at the complexion of his face,

141
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,140
 there is a greater probability that it will be
a type of pulse that will fluctuate between faster then slower.

142
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,740
 You could tell his pulses just by looking at him.

143
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,540
 You truly are a great doctor.

144
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,840
 Just take his pulse already.

145
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,140
 Yes, sir.

146
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,200
 M-Master.

147
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,040
 I cannot feel the repeated pattern of fast and slow pulse.

148
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,440
 This is a type of pulse
 which I've never felt before.

149
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,360
 A solid, fast, and sharp pulse like this. . .

150
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,140
 It's my first time taking a pulse such as this.

151
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,840
 The upper region of the wrist,

152
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,900
 if you are able to accurately find that spot, for certain,

153
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,840
 you will be able to feel that fast and slow pattern.

154
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,540
 For this man, it'll be faster to diagnose

155
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,740
 by checking below his elbow.

156
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,740
 Judging from his belabored breath coming from within,

157
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,740
 the flow of his energy is not smooth.

158
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,740
 Inspect his inner forearm.

159
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,840
 It must have gotten rough like the scale a dried fish.

160
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:56,640
 Master. . . Not even close to the scale. 
Rather, his skin is glowing.

161
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,940
 Thanks to you, Doctor, I survived.

162
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,070
 You were poisoned by arsenic, and yet

163
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,520
 you recovered so quickly. 
It's amazing.

164
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,340
 By the way, Lord, you have

165
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,440
 a very mysterious pulse.

166
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,540
 It's a pulse that's different from anyone I know.

167
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,320
  Of course.

168
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,360
  I came from there.

169
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,040
  Excuse me?

170
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,440
 I came from that star.

171
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,440
 Although it's a star different from here,

172
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:58,350
 all the environments are very similar.

173
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,840
 I guess you haven't fully recovered.

174
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,780
 I believe you're not in your right mind. . .

175
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,240
 I'm not from

176
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,140
 this world.

177
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,340
Do Min Joon, are you okay?

178
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,240
Wake up.

179
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,040
Are you coming to your senses?

180
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,940
Where is this place?

181
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
My room.

182
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,640
You slept for over 10 hours.

183
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,840
What happened yesterday?

184
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,340
I wanted to ask you since last time, but I kept holding it in.

185
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,540
By chance, are you seriously ill somewhere?

186
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,540
No.

187
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,540
By chance, possibly...

188
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,540
I know it won't be that, but

189
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,040
perhaps terminally ill with a chronic disease...

190
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,740
It isn't like that, right?

191
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,340
I mean, your diary, too. . .

192
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,650
It isn't like that, right?

193
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,640
No.

194
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,240
Let's go out to eat.

195
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,540
Do you like folded egg?

196
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,240
Do your senses still come and go?

197
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,540
That way is to the door. 
This way is to the dining room.

198
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,640
I will go home.

199
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,740
Why?

200
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,140
What I am trying to say is...

201
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,340
I became indebted to you while staying at your place. 
This is a good chance to pay you back-

202
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,440
It is okay not to repay.

203
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,110
What if there is still someone inside?

204
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,240
I will take care of it.

205
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,740
You mind your own business.

206
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,440
Didn't you say it wasn't one sided love?

207
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,550
It isn't!

208
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,040
It is.

209
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,540
Why did you come to my house?

210
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,740
I didn't come to your house.

211
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,540
I came here because I have some business with Do Min Joon.

212
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,940
Why? What kind of business?

213
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,740
I have some things to ask 
about the problem I just told you.

214
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,540
What did you talk about earlier?

215
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,740
What problem?

216
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,640
Let's go inside. 
- Yes.

217
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,840
Thank you.

218
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,640
HEY!

219
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,040
Do Min Joon isn't feeling well now.

220
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,140
Make it short.

221
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,070
Yeah, okay.

222
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,540
What are you doing?

223
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,540
I asked you what you are doing.

224
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,140
Do Min Joon, that human being heard me sing and scream.

225
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,540
He came here at once to complain.

226
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,640
How on earth did he hear me
 when the soundproofing system is this perfect?

227
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,530
Huh?

228
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,340
I am sorry to come here without contacting first.

229
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,640
I didn't know that the Prosecutor was your older brother.

230
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,440
How is his condition now?

231
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,340
He got a surgery last night 
due to a traumatic subdural hemorrhage. . .

232
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,340
The surgery is over, but

233
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,940
he hasn't regained consciousness yet.

234
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,940
I was told that they have to do an MRI again.

235
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,370
I heard this from the detective.

236
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,340
The reason my brother went there yesterday

237
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,140
was to meet you, Do Min Joon.

238
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,440
Yes.

239
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,940
We made a plan to meet at the cafe in that building.

240
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,840
Why were you going to meet my brother?

241
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,640
I had to hand something over to him.

242
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,440
Is there anyone who knew about that?

243
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,720
I think someone went there and waited for him, 
knowing the plan.

244
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,940
I was wondering if you have any idea who could it be.

245
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,940
  Was it you who made Prosecutor Yoo like that?

246
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,940
 Didn't I tell you?

247
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,340
 That the reason you and Cheon Song Yi are alive
 is because I am letting you guys live.

248
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,670
Anyway, what happened to your brother. . . It's my fault.

249
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,940
No. I am not saying that to make you feel that way.

250
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,590
In any case, I will try everything I can to solve this case.

251
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,240
Thank you for saying that.

252
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,640
But there is nothing that was captured by the CCTV.

253
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,640
There is no evidence except for a fountain pen found,

254
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,040
so they said that it would be hard to find the culprit.

255
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,740
When there is a distinction between man and woman, 
what are they doing at home?

256
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,480
It's teeming with cafes when you step outside.

257
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,340
 What must be talked about at home and not out there?

258
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,440
 Aish, why are they taking so long?

259
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,340
What's up?

260
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,540
It's nothing.

261
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,640
Leaving now?

262
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,340
Yeah.

263
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,990
Let's meet again.

264
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,140
Where are you going, Do Min Joon?

265
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,250
Supermarket.

266
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,040
Supermarket?

267
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,340
Good. I was going to go as well. I guess we can go together.

268
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,640
Are you going to go like that?

269
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,140
Oops. I'm going to put a jacket on and be right out, so 
wait for me.

270
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,940
Don't leave.

271
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
What should I wear?

272
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,340
What is this?

273
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,240
What is this? I told you to go together. 
 Why are you petty?

274
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,620
Let's buy together and split.

275
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,240
You are living alone. 
It's just Yoon Jae and me at my home as well.

276
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,540
Look at this. 1+1 (Buy 1, Get 1 Free). There are many of those.

277
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,840
We buy these bulk items for cheap and split it, okay?

278
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,440
I only buy as much as I eat.

279
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,940
I don't buy lot of unnecessary things lured by 
buy-one-get-one type of gimmick.

280
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,240
Do you like tofu? I don't really like it. It doesn't taste like anything.

281
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,660
I only eat it when it's already in stew.

282
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
Aren't you going to buy potatoes?

283
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,120
-I don't like potatoes. 
-Why? If you steam it and eat it, it tastes so good.

284
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,760
Do you dip your potatoes in sugar or salt?

285
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,300
Salt.

286
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,720
Aigoo, it seems like you don't know much. 
It tastes so good when you dip potatoes in sugar!

287
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,620
From now on, try eating them with sugar.

288
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,790
Can't I decide what I dip it in?

289
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,560
Of course you can.

290
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,360
What about chicken? Do you like the legs or the dry side (chicken breast)?

291
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,610
The dry stuff.

292
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,880
I'm all for chicken legs. Then...

293
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,610
Why do you keep going in front?

294
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,370
Looks like our tastes for food are exactly opposite.

295
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,220
I guess there won't be any need for us to fight
 about food forever.

296
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,120
There will be no reason for me to eat with you forever.

297
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,120
-Where's your car?
--In temporary storage.

298
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,800
Temporary storage? Why? Well, just 
get in my car. I'll give you a ride.

299
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,370
What is he? Why's he like this to me?

300
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,800
Managing Director says we should cancel today's meeting.

301
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,840
-Why?
--He said he's not feeling well.

302
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Wow, I guess there are times he doesn't feel well, too.

303
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,400
He's usually a man who knows how to take care of his health.

304
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,960
You all heard, right? We'll cancel the meeting today.

305
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,530
Um, why and where is the managing director not feeling well?

306
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,810
Why are you asking me that?

307
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,120
Did you know?

308
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,970
Of course I know that our Hui Kyeong
 is our managing director's younger brother.

309
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,940
F-From when?

310
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,910
From the day you put that family portrait of you, the managing director, and the chairman as your desktop background.

311
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,500
That's why you kept looking after me and took my side.

312
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,710
You must've been very uncomfortable because of me.

313
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,800
Yes, a bit.

314
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,030
No, no, no.

315
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,990
I only thought of myself.

316
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,330
I'm sorry, Director.

317
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,340
I said no, really no. Really.

318
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,740
The managing director left for a moment.

319
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,450
-I'll sit here and wait.
--Yes.

320
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,740

321
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,670
Still, before, he took care of me well.

322
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,100
While grumbling, he still bought me ramen when I wanted it,

323
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,040
and he bought me medicine to put on my foot when it got hurt,

324
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,550
and when I received my appendix
 surgery, he stayed with me overnight.

325
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,080
When I was locked in my car because of the reporters,

326
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,140
he defended me saying that I should
 only hide when I've done something wrong.

327
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,720
As time passed like that perhaps I've come to rely on that person,

328
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,540
and started to like him, so I confessed,

329
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,710
but the person changed 180 degrees.

330
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:32,720
It's like cold wind is blowing right at me. When I say something, he doesn't even talk back!

331
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,780
He's now completely indifferent to me.  Why do you think he's like that to me?

332
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,410
Does that person have feelings towards me . . .

333
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,660
or not?

334
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,250
-I think he does have feelings towards you.
--He doesn't, he doesn't.

335
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,180
You said he brought you ramen.  If he goes to the bookstore
 for you and buys you food, it means he likes you.

336
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,180
If he liked you, he should have accepted when you confessed.

337
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,150
That's right. Even the way I see it, I think it's a no.

338
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,010
It's a no?

339
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,250
Is it easy for the girl to confess first?

340
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:05,320
But once you confess he changes 180 degrees and closes his heart.

341
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,300
It means you're burdensome.

342
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,250
Burdensome?

343
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,490
No, it's not! He could be playing hard to get.

344
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,630
Look at the opposite side. It's not like she's
 some normal girl, she's Cheon Song Yi!

345
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,490
Right? Because I'm Cheon Song Yi? Because he
 thinks he'll look easy if he just says okay in one go?

346
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,580
I don't think that's it.

347
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,830
It isn't?

348
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:26,780
Usually when guys like someone, they 
interfere and get in your business, like Hui Kyeong.

349
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,260
If he really likes you, isn't that supposed to be normal?

350
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,370
 Still, isn't it weird to just pull away after you showed all of your cards?

351
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,490
 Just try being pushy.

352
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,850
 Hey, you may have faltered for the moment,

353
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,160
 but you're Cheon Song Yi.

354
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,440
That's right.

355
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,620
I'm Cheon Song Yi.

356
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,370
What are you doing?

357
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,780
-Where are you going?
--Fishing.

358
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,760
Where is it that you're going? Are 
you going far? Can I tag along?

359
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,290
I also like fishing. I followed my dad around when I was young.

360
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,250
-No. 
--I have something I really need to say, too.

361
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,010
It's a little weird for me to say this with my own mouth,

362
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,230
but I was Korea's #1 woman that
 single men wanted to date.

363
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,250
Of course, nowadays that has declined.

364
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,420
But still, I'm the woman who was #1

365
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,450
and the woman will become #1 again.

366
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,530
That kind of me,

367
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,140
I told you a certain something, didn't I?

368
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,070
You probably know what I'm talking about.

369
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,440
But you didn't give any response.

370
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,730
It's not just that you didn't give me a response,
 you're completely ignoring me.

371
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,200
Unbelievable.

372
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,590
How can you do this to me? I just can't understand.

373
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,590
Do you want to get off?

374
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,360
While we're on the highway?

375
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,120
That's what I'm saying.

376
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,940
Okay. I'll just continue my talk later.

377
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,980
It's really nice here!

378
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,490
There are no people. Really! It's so nice!

379
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,260
How did you know about this place? Do you come here often?

380
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,430
After staying home for so long and coming
 to a place like this, I feel so refreshed!

381
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,150
This is awesome!

382
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,550
It's nice.

383
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,750
I can skate well right?

384
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,560
When I was young, I did some figure skating.

385
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,500
If I had kept doing it,

386
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,470
don't you think Cheon Song Yi would
 have come out on top before Kim Yuna?

387
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,680
Are you boiling coffee water?

388
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,570
I'll ask you for mine, too.

389
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,810
Because you really wanted to hear my answer,

390
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,270
did you come all the way here?

391
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,210
No.

392
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,210
I wanted to be with you.

393
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,800
But . . .

394
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,680
I want to hear your answer, too.

395
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,220
Alright, then I guess I'll have to tell you.

396
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,460
I thought I already said it.

397
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,160
It seems like you didn't understand, so I'll tell you straight.

398
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,200
I don't like you.

399
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,620
Because you're acting like this,

400
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,650
I dislike you even more.

401
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,080
Then why did you help me?

402
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,870
Why were you by my side when
 I was going through tough times?

403
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,970
-Why?
--Because you were somewhat pitiful.

404
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,510
And also...

405
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,040
Because you're a celebrity, honestly, I was sort of fascinated.

406
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,920
I did it out of curiosity,

407
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,630
but you thought I did it because I liked you, didn't you? Making me feel sorry . . .

408
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:25,280
But since you're a woman with a lot of pride,

409
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,240
I didn't think you would go this far.

410
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:34,040
If I had known, I wouldn't have done those things.

411
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,130
So...

412
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,630
What do you want me to do?

413
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,680
I wish you would

414
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,310
get out of my sight.

415
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,250
But. . .

416
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,880
♬  You are my destiny.  ♬

417
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,070
Why do I feel like

418
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,850
♬  You are.  ♬

419
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,840
you are lying to me right now?
♬  You are my destiny.  ♬

420
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,600
♬  You are.  ♬

421
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,480
♬  You are my everything.  ♬

422
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,490
♬  While only looking at you,  ♬

423
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:30,350
♬  I'm calling out to you silently.  ♬

424
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:35,410
♬  You are the one my love.  ♬

425
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,930
♬  You are.  ♬

426
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:42,040
♬  You are my delight of all.  ♬

427
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:50,290
♬  You are my love forever.  ♬

428
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,710
♬  Where are you?  ♬

429
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,870
♬  Do you still not see  ♬

430
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,260
♬  My heart?  ♬

431
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,490
♬  You,  ♬

432
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,460
Song Yi.
♬  I miss you. You,  ♬

433
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,800
♬  I want to see you  ♬

434
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,610
Hui Kyeong.

435
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,020
How did you come here?

436
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,880
Get in.

437
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,590
♬  My feelings for you. 
I love you. ♬

438
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,800
♬  I need you.  ♬

439
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,160
♬  Those words I want to say to you.  ♬

440
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,360
♬  Those words that make my heart beat.  ♬

441
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,670
♬  I love you.  ♬

442
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,000
♬  I need you.  ♬

443
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,410
♬  Even if I'm somewhere else,  ♬

444
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:04,730
♬  I will only look at you forever.  ♬

445
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,220
I'm sorry.

446
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,820
It's okay.

447
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,940
I mean. . .

448
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,910
I assumed, but couldn't understand this feeling.

449
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,350
I see that getting rejected after confessing feels like this.

450
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,210
I'm really really miserable!

451
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,050
It's only like that the first time.

452
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,830
If you go through that for about 15 years, 
it gets easier.

453
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:37,080
You did that to me  in front of the whole class, 
the first time.

454
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,210
You must have been humiliated.

455
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,840
I felt like dying of humiliation even though there weren't any people watching.

456
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,040
Of course I have been.

457
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:52,190
Ah, even so, 
talking to you makes me feel a little bit better.

458
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,230
By the way, you might feel better, then

459
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,000
suddenly you might explode with anger in the middle of the night.

460
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,910
Be careful.

461
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,780
Is that so?

462
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,920
You will understand the feeling of kicking your feet in the air.

463
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,160
I see.

464
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,450
Right. You might call him in anger in the middle of the night. But don't do it.

465
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,710
Remember how much you hated it?

466
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,730
I remember.

467
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,220
It was freaking annoying.

468
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,940
Freaking annoying?!

469
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,480
I'm sorry.

470
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,380
Don't listen to. . . sad songs either.

471
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:36,300
If you listen to them, 
you can't control your emotions.

472
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,040
What about you then?

473
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,540
Whose song made it hard for you to control your emotions?

474
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:50,570
 Can't you love me?

475
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:56,610
 Can't you understand my heart a little?

476
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,340
 Or. . .

477
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,270
 If you could go love him,

478
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:08,020
 and live on.

479
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,140
 Only if you would stay next to me. . .

480
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:18,320
Bad girl. She should've accepted you.

481
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,410
I know, right?

482
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,220
If I had accepted you back then,

483
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,440
after dating me for a little while,

484
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,880
you would have found out my real side and gotten sick of me.

485
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,680
Then you could have met someone who likes you
 and went to whomever that may be.

486
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:39,690
But earlier. . . How did you come to me?

487
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,190
Did that person call you?

488
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,840
Yeah.

489
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,290
I guess he didn't want me to go alone.

490
00:35:54,290 --> 00:36:00,280
Hey, that's- That's a kind of consideration.
Just like how you do it to me.

491
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,740
It's meaningless.

492
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,510
What's so good about him?

493
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,460
Something that wouldn't work even though I kept trying for 15 years,

494
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,890
why does it work for him?

495
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,370
You haven't known him for that long. . .

496
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:25,530
Oh, you came? That call, I didn't mean for you to come here.

497
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,130
"What are you doing?"

498
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,990
"I'm just night-fishing by myself."

499
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,530
"No, I don't mean you should come."

500
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:38,730
How is that not asking me to come here?

501
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,280
Because you came. . .

502
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,440
it does feel nice.

503
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,270
My wife was about to start nagging anyway.

504
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,590
I was getting tired. So, I'm glad.

505
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,070
She wasn't like that when she was younger, but

506
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,070
her nagging gets worse as she gets older.

507
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,280
Lawyer Jang.

508
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,630
Yes?

509
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,640
Growing

510
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,270
old together. . .

511
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,670
What does it feel like?

512
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,380
Together. . .

513
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,650
I want to grow old together with her.

514
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:30,340
♬  You approached me accidentally and embraced me  ♬

515
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:41,240
♬  While looking at each other blankly, you said "Goodbye."♬

516
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:47,370
♬  You only passed by in my dreams,  ♬

517
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:52,770
♬  But right now, you're in front of me.  ♬

518
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,900
You don't seem well.

519
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,880
We should call it a day and leave now.

520
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,320
Yes.

521
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,520
It's cold.

522
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,720
Why do you keep saying it's cold these days?

523
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,140
Since you were never like that,
it's making me so anxious to death.

524
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,970
A very long time ago,

525
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:18,810
there was someone who saved me,
 who was about to die.

526
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,610
That person said...

527
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,340
 Lord, can you return

528
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:34,810
 to your place whenever?

529
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,860
 It's up to the universe.

530
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:42,950
 But if I wait, there will be a way.

531
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,470
 There's no other way right now.

532
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,390
 I guess I should wait.

533
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:52,380
 While treating you over the last 3 months, 
I've witnessed a lot, and

534
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,860
 was surprised many times.
And. . .

535
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,220
 I was able to break out of my prejudices and learned to see more.

536
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,570
 However. . .

537
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:07,690
 There's one thing I'm worried about.

538
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,440
 The human body consists of yin, yang, 
and the five elements of the universe.

539
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,850
 If any one of those

540
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:19,030
 cannot appropriately be in balance with heaven and earth, 
then life cannot be maintained.

541
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:27,210
 The origin of the universe is no different from
 the origin of life.

542
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,780
 "Tong Jok Bul Tong. Bul Tong Jok Tong."

543
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:36,570
 If energy flows well, you don't get sick. 
Otherwise, you get sick.

544
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,970
 But

545
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,770
 in your body, the energy of heaven and earth does not flow.

546
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,050
 So, Lord,

547
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,440
 how long will you be able to keep balanced here?

548
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,220
 Someday, all of your energy would run down.

549
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,760
 I wish

550
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,150
 you'd be able to return to your place

551
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,420
 before you become weak.

552
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,620
Most likely,

553
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,700
I think the limit he talked about

554
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,300
is drawing near

555
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,200
right now.

556
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,160
Then, are you saying that you can't stay here

557
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,440
even if you want to?

558
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,520
If I go against the natural law and stay here,

559
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,640
I guess it won't take so long for me to die.

560
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,130
What's this?

561
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,310
Yoon Jae, do you want a drink?

562
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,910
You can't, right?

563
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,540
My Yoon Jae is still in high school, right?

564
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,480
Drink what you can handle.

565
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,680
You can't even drink well, but you still like it so much.

566
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,550
I get it.

567
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,200
Are you going to school?

568
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,700
Of course I have to go.
I'm in 3rd year in high school, I have to study.

569
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,770
What happened? "Study" came out of your mouth.

570
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:16,100
After seeing you yesterday, I should study.

571
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,680
Study really well, and not live my life as a waste.

572
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,010
What about me?

573
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,850
You bastard, what about me?

574
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,040
 Like I got shot~
It hurts so much.

575
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,340
 Like I got shot~

576
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,150
 Manager Do!

577
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,380
 MANAGER DO!

578
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,360
 Manager Do

579
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:28,620
 19 calls to Manager Do: 
1:10 a.m.; 12:15 a.m. (11); 12:14 a.m.

580
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,850
 Why?! Why aren't you answering?!

581
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,020
 You bought a phone because I asked you to, 
but why aren't you answering? Why?

582
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,330
 You thought I wouldn't call anymore, right?

583
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,960
 I'm going to keep calling until you answer.

584
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,930
 Do Min Jooooo-!

585
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,000
 Hey. You bastard. Does "Myungshimbogam" 
(The Bible of Moral sense) tell you to do this?!

586
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,130
 You brat who'd get struck by lightning in the year of Byoongja.

587
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,970
 Go to the Beotigogae and sit  there the whole night!

588
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,170
 Can't you think about it again?

589
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,670
 I'll be good.

590
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,840
 Is it because of time when I broke the pottery?

591
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,140
 I said I will replace it.
 Let's go to Icheon together.

592
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,310
 What is it?

593
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,380
 Shoes...

594
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,790
 My shoes that you stole...

595
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,960
 You liked them, right?

596
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:20,660
 So much that you secretly stole them.

597
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:25,000
 You can keep them.

598
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,400
 The shoes that have our memories.

599
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,910
 The ones that have our memories.

600
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,330
Mom, Hyung left, right?

601
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,000
Of course he went out.

602
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,760
Why aren't you leaving?

603
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,860
I have a little bit of a cold, so I'm off for a day.

604
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,330
Is that so?

605
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:05,540
I will make some herb tonic tea and send it upstairs, so go up and rest.

606
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,710
Yes.

607
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,660

608
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,850
 Earlier...

609
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,980
 I'm thankful.

610
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,960
 Whatever the situation was, thanks for contacting me.

611
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:02,990
 For not letting Song Yi go alone.

612
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,960
 Did you wait

613
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,500
 just to say that?

614
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,470
 And 12 years ago,

615
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,500
 for saving our Song Yi... I'm thankful for that too.

616
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,270
 - I told you it wasn't me.
- Song Yi...

617
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,040
 Even though she doesn't know that you are that person,

618
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,180
 she seems to like you a lot.

619
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,980
 Do you really. . .

620
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,920
 not like my Song Yi?

621
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,060
 Or...

622
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,500
 Is there another reason?

623
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,400
 I see that you can be nosy in many different ways.

624
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,640
 The person you like. . .

625
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,840
 likes me,

626
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,880
 yet you are only curious about that?

627
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,870
 If you really like that girl,

628
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:57,810
 don't mind the feelings of anyone else,

629
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,080
 but protect that girl in your own way.

630
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,020
 And...

631
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,590
 Lee Jae Kyeong.

632
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,930
 How do you know my brother?

633
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:15,400
 Last time, my brother asked about you too.

634
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,360
 Yes, your brother.

635
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,800
 Cheon Song Yi...

636
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:23,640
 Protect her from him.

637
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:27,380
  What does that mean?

638
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:30,220
 I don't know you fully yet,

639
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,480
 so I can't tell you more.

640
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,390
One-person agency?

641
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,960
Last time, our Son-in-Law Lee..

642
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,640
No.. our Hui Kyeong briefly talked about that,

643
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,940
but you are really going make an agency just for Song Yi?

644
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,440
Yes, Mother.

645
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:02,810
I think of Song Yi's incident as very pitiful.

646
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:05,310
From now on, I would like to

647
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,580
take care of Song Yi personally.

648
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,050
I didn't know

649
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,420
you would think like this

650
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,520
really not at all.

651
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,990
If you are okay with it, would you like to have dinner together?

652
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,500
I...

653
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,830
will take you.

654
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,030
Of course.

655
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,010
One person is the chairman of a midsize company, 
but he's over 80 years old.

656
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:38,650
He's been receiving medical treatments in Thailand.

657
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:42,090
Another one is a dancer. 
He was in the Czech Republic on the day of the incident.

658
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,850
He hasn't returned to Korea yet.

659
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,420
The last person. . .

660
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,530
died 2 years ago.

661
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,690
Died?

662
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,400
He was a 32-year-old astrophysicist named Han Seo Jin.

663
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,730
He was on the missing persons list, then was later declared dead.

664
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,830
Then, what is it? You said that

665
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,600
there were only 3 pens.

666
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,270
All three people

667
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,610
are not related to this?

668
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:09,510
Are you sure this person, Han Seo Jin or whatever, died?

669
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,280
 Where did he go when it's cold outside?

670
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,190
 Did he go on a date or something?

671
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,420
  Since you are protecting Cheon Song Yi very well by being by her side,

672
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,390
 I found another method.

673
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,550
  What will you do? Decide.

674
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,150
Cut. Okay.

675
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:58,360
Good work. Good work. Good work.

676
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,390
Unnie, you are cold, right?

677
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,610
Are you going to the hospital, Noona?

678
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,530
No. I have somewhere to go.

679
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,600
I will drive my car there.

680
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,320
Get off of work first.

681
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,800
  Se Mi,

682
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:24,600
  I guess I need to take back what I told you last time.

683
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,620
  Which one?

684
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:31,310
  I told you that I don't want to lose you, Yoo Se Mi, as a friend.

685
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,950
 I realized how selfish and ridiculous that is.

686
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:43,040
  What is more important than me not wanting to lose you
 is you being happy.

687
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:49,180
  While appearing as a friend 
in front of the guy who can't love you,

688
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:52,930
  you can't be happy.

689
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,590
  You...

690
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,030
  You are doing that.

691
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:00,700
  I...

692
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,610
 I'm miserable right now.

693
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:11,470
  So I thought I shouldn't make you like me.

694
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:18,850
  From now, Yoo Se Mi, I...,

695
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,090
  won't see you even as a friend.

696
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,940
Why is she here suddenly?

697
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,920
Aish, I look like a mess right now.

698
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,960
Can I come in?

699
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,660
It is awkward.

700
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:19,320
I would have never imagined being awkward with you.

701
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,080
There were many times when I felt awkward while being with you.

702
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,280
You didn't notice because you were slow.

703
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,190
Is that so?

704
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,730
Anyway, I changed into different clothes 
when I saw you standing outside,

705
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:33,230
and tied my hair again.

706
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,520
I didn't need to do like that before, but

707
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,000
as wished, I think I care about what you think now.

708
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:44,100
Oh yeah? So...

709
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,790
you expect me to say thank you?

710
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,800
You are  really  twisted.

711
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,200
It isn't good for you. As a friend,....

712
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,640
No, as someone who used to be your friend, I will give you a piece of advice.

713
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,340
Live your life as you normally live and don't get screwed because of me.

714
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,800
My life is already screwed because of you.

715
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,030
Why because of me?

716
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:09,840
You...

717
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,380
You always said this like a habit.

718
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:19,540
You said you wanted to meet someday the one who saved you

719
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:26,250
on the night you almost died 12 years ago.

720
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,440
That was so random.

721
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,100
Yeah, I did. Why?

722
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,150
Did I do something wrong as well, by saying that?

723
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,460
I often think you are ridiculous.

724
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,190
Don't play with people, and say what you want to say!

725
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,330
Didn't you say you will recognize him right away?

726
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:55,160
Didn't you say you can recognize him right away
 if that person appears in front of you?

727
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:56,880
So?

728
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,200
With the excuse that you are waiting for that person,

729
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,960
with the reason that you will meet him some day, Hui Kyeong...

730
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,720
That foolish kid who only looks at you.

731
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,290
You  shackled his ankle preventing him 
from either leaving or getting closer to you.

732
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,510
After doing all that, 
how come you couldn't recognize him?

733
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:17,350
What. . . can I not recognize?

734
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:23,910
He is right by your side. I am asking why you can't recognize him.

735
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:25,930
By my side?

736
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,130
Where?

737
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,040
Who?

738
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,270
What are you saying?

739
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:24,030

740
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,510
  So?

741
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,190
  What do you want me to do?

742
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,840
  I wish you would get out of my sight.

743
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:52,760
  But...

744
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,890
  Why do I think that

745
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,700
  you are lying?

746
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:06,900
♬   You came to me by coincidence   ♬

747
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,720
♬   You only passed through in my dreams.   ♬

748
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:25,200
♬   You are in front of me now.   ♬

749
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:31,740
♬   The love came, but he left.   ♬

750
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,700
♬    I waited but I couldn't see you.   ♬
