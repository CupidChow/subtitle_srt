00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,410
A solid, fast, and sharp pulse like this.

171
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,050
It's my first time taking a pulse like this.

172
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,780
The upper wrist,

173
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:23,990
if you are able to accurately find that,
you will be able to feel that pattern.

174
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,930
For this man, it'll be faster to diagnose
by checking below his elbow.

175
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,600
[Qi skin: the skin between
upper arm and lower arm.]

176
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:42,270
His breath tells that his energy flow is bad.

177
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,810
Inspect his forearm.

178
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,980
It must have gotten rough like a dried fish.

179
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,790
Master, not even close.

180
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,120
Rather, his skin is glowing.

181
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,970
Thanks to you, doctor, I survived.

182
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,110
You were poisoned by arsenic,

183
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,610
but you recovered so quickly.

184
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,280
It's amazing.

185
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:26,490
By the way, you have a very mysterious pulse.

186
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,560
It's a pulse that's different from anyone I know.

187
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,330
Of course.

188
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,330
I came from there.

189
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,240
What?

190
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,280
I came from that star.

191
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,480
Although it's a star different from here,

192
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,450
all the environments are very similar.

193
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,490
I guess you haven't fully recovered.

194
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,800
I believe you're not in your right mind.

195
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:16,130
I'm not from this world.

196
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,570
Do Min-joon,

197
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,340
are you okay?

198
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,110
Wake up.

199
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,140
Are you wide awake now?

200
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,020
Where am I?

201
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,590
My room. You’ve slept for over 10 hours.

202
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,560
What happened yesterday?

203
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,400
I wanted to ask you since last time…

204
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,370
Are you seriously ill or what?

205
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,000
No.

206
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,530
Or…

207
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,540
By any chance,

208
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,510
I hope it’s not.

209
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,850
Perhaps you’re terminally ill with some disease?

210
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,210
I mean, your diary, too...

211
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,620
It isn't like that, right?

212
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,850
No.

213
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,220
Let's go out for breakfast.

214
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,050
Do you like egg rolls?

215
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,130
Are you still feeling dizzy?

216
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,560
That’s the door. This way is to the dining room.

217
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,960
I want to go home.

218
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Why?

219
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,000
What I am trying to say is...

220
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,340
I try to pay your back for letting me stay…

221
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,140
It is okay not to repay.

222
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,940
What if there is still someone inside?

223
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,380
I can handle it myself. Mind your own business.

224
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,360
Didn't you deny you have an unrequited crush?

225
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,160
It isn't!

226
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,030
It is.

227
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,470
Why did you come to my house?

228
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,510
I came here for Do Min-joon, not you.

229
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,950
Why? What?

230
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,780
I want to ask about the problem I just told you.

231
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,020
What did you talk about earlier?

232
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,620
What problem?

233
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,260
Let's go inside.

234
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,860
Yes. Thank you.

235
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,360
HEY!

236
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,000
Do Min-joon isn't feeling well now.

237
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,470
Make it short.

238
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,670
Yeah, okay.

239
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,120
What are you doing?

240
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,590
I asked you what you are doing.

241
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,120
Why Do Min-joon can hear me singing?

242
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,630
And came here at once when hearing me screaming.

243
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,160
How did he hear me since
the soundproof system is perfect?

244
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,069
I am sorry to bother you.

245
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,609
I didn't know the detective was your brother.

246
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,420
How is he now?

247
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,490
He got a surgery last night
due to a traumatic subdural hemorrhage.

248
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,890
The surgery is over, but he hasn't woken up.

249
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,130
I was told that they have to do an MRI again.

250
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,400
I heard this from the police.

251
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,170
That my brother went to meet you there.

252
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:45,510
Yes. We planned to meet at the cafe.

253
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,820
Why were you going to meet my brother?

254
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,520
I had to give something over to him.

255
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,360
Is there anyone who knew about that?

256
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,730
I think someone went there and waited for him,
already knowing the plan.

257
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,040
Do you know who it could be?

258
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,600
Is that you

259
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,970
who hurt Detective Yoo?

260
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,880
Didn't I tell you?

261
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,080
The reason why you and Cheon Song-yi are alive

262
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,250
is because I am letting you guys live.

263
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,190
Anyway, what happened to your brother

264
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,650
is because of me.

265
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,830
No. That’s not I mean.

266
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:39,460
I will try everything I can to solve this case.

267
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,800
Thank you for saying that.

268
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,540
But there is nothing captured by the CCTV.

269
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,810
There is no evidence except for a pen.

270
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,310
They said that it’s hard to find the culprit.

271
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,090
What are they doing at home? A man and a woman.

272
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,630
Cafe shops are all around. They can go out to talk!

273
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,400
Why must be talking at home?

274
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,370
Why it took they so long?

275
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,240
What?

276
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,780
Nothing.

277
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,490
Leaving now?

278
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,060
Yeah. See you.

279
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,430
Where are you going, Do Min-joon?

280
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,970
Supermarket.

281
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,340
Good. I was going to one. Let’s go together.

282
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,440
Are you going to go like that?

283
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,640
Oops.

284
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,010
I'm going to put a jacket on. Wait for me.

285
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,480
Don't leave.

286
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,620
What should I wear?

287
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,470
What?

288
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,610
Hey!

289
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,250
I told you to go together.

290
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,650
Let's buy together and split.

291
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,280
You are living alone.
It's just Yoon-jae and me at my home as well.

292
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,590
Look at this.

293
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,390
Buy one for two. There are many of those.

294
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,790
We buy these bulk items and split it, okay?

295
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,530
I only buy as much as I eat.

296
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,200
I won’t be attracted by
buy-one-for-two type of gimmick.

297
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,270
Do you like tofu?

298
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,200
I don't really like it.

299
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,170
It’s tasteless. I only eat it in stew.

300
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,580
Aren't you going to buy potatoes?

301
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,750
I don't like them.

302
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,080
Why? If you steam it, it tastes so good.

303
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,720
Do you dip your potatoes in sugar or salt?

304
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,750
Salt.

305
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,520
It seems like you don't know much.

306
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,690
It tastes so good when you dip them in sugar!

307
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,730
Try eating them with sugar.

308
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,830
Can't I decide what I dip it in?

309
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,560
Of course you can.

310
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,360
What about chicken?

311
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,670
Do you like the legs or the breast?

312
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,700
The breast.

313
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,840
I'm all for chicken legs.

314
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,940
So…

315
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,710
Why do you keep going in front?

316
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,410
Looks like our taste for food is exactly opposite.

317
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,320
I guess we won’t fight for food forever.

318
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,230
There’s no chance for me to eat with you.

319
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,100
Where's your car?

320
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,170
In the traction storage.

321
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,600
Traction storage? Why?

322
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
Well, just get in my car. I'll give you a ride.

323
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,910
What? Why's he like this to me?

324
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,850
The director ask us to cancel today's meeting.

325
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,690
Why?

326
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,920
He said he's not feeling well.

327
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,860
I guess there are times he would feel unwell.

328
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,490
He's usually a man who takes care of his health.

329
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,630
You all heard, right?

330
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,500
Meeting’s canceled today.

331
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,640
Why is the director not feeling well?

332
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,010
Why are you asking me that?

333
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,280
Did you know?

334
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,620
I know that you’re our director's young brother.

335
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,020
From when?

336
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,620
From the day when you put that family portrait
 of you, the director, and the chairman

337
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,290
as your desktop background.

338
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:06,530
That's why you kept looking after me.

339
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,800
You must've been very uncomfortable because of me.

340
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Yes, a bit.

341
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,110
No, no, no.

342
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,210
I only thought of myself.

343
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,410
I'm sorry, director.

344
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,050
It’s okay.

345
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,380
It’s really fine.

346
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,460
Director left for a moment.

347
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,260
I'll sit here and wait.

348
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,400
Yes.

349
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,650
Still, before, he took care of me well.

350
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,090
While grumbling, he still bought me ramen,

351
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,090
and he bought me medicine when I got hurt,

352
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,660
and when I received my appendix
surgery, he stayed with me overnight.

353
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,160
When I was troubled by the reporters,

354
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,130
he defended me saying that
only those doing wrong should hide.

355
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,540
As time passed,

356
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,210
I've come to rely on that person,
and started to like him.

357
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,480
So I confessed.

358
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,710
But the person changed 180 degrees.

359
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,080
It's like cold wind is blowing right at me.

360
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,680
He ignores me.

361
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,490
He's now completely indifferent to me.

362
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,790
Why he's like that to me?

363
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:43,030
Does that person like me... or not?

364
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,960
I think he likes you.

365
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,300
He doesn't, he doesn't.

366
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,700
You said he brought you ramen.

367
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,270
If he buys you food, it means he likes you.

368
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,270
If he liked you, he should have accepted you.

369
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,710
That's right.

370
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,210
Even the way I see it, I think it's a no.

371
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,080
It's a no?

372
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,250
Is it easy for the girl to confess first?

373
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,050
But once you confess, he changes 180 degrees

374
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,320
and closes his heart.

375
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,190
It means you're burdensome.

376
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,320
Burdensome?

377
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,790
No, it's not!

378
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,520
He could be playing hard to get.

379
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,430
It's not like she's some normal girl.

380
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,630
She's Cheon Song-yi!

381
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,290
Yeah. I'm Cheon Song-yi.

382
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,600
So he’s afraid to react to my feeling?

383
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,900
I don't think so.

384
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,870
It isn't?

385
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,240
Usually when guys like someone,
they’ll do something.

386
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,910
Like Hee-kyung.

387
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,510
If he really likes you,
isn't that supposed to be normal?

388
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,450
Still, isn't it weird to just pull away
after you showed all of your cards?

389
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,490
Just try being pushy.

390
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,890
Hey, you may have faltered for the moment,

391
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,590
but you're Cheon Song-yi.

392
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,030
That's right. I'm Cheon Song-yi.

393
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,100
What are you doing?

394
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,210
Where are you going?

395
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,670
Fishing.

396
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,390
Where are you going? Is it far?

397
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,060
Can I tag along?

398
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,300
I also like fishing.
I followed my dad around when I was young.

399
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,130
No.

400
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,900
I have something I really need to say.

401
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,950
It's a little weird for me to say this.

402
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,420
But I was Korea's top woman that
single men wanted to date.

403
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,330
Of course, nowadays that has come down a bit.

404
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,830
But, I was the top woman. And it will still be.

405
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:04,170
Such a woman, told you something.

406
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,510
You probably know what I mean.

407
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,810
But you didn't give any responses.

408
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,080
Plus, you're completely ignoring me.

409
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,250
Unbelievable.

410
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,180
How can you do this to me?

411
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,650
I just can't understand.

412
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,850
Do you want to get off?

413
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,460
While we're on the highway?

414
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,860
I know.

415
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,100
Okay. I'll just talk it later.

416
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,290
It's really nice here!

417
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,560
There is no person. Really! It's so nice!

418
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,630
How did you know about this place?

419
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,770
Do you come here often?

420
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,440
After staying home for long, I feel so refreshed!

421
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,970
This is awesome!

422
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,950
It's nice.

423
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,580
I can skate well, right?

424
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,580
I did some figure skating when I was young.

425
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,750
If I had kept doing it,

426
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,690
Cheon Song-yi would
have come out on top before Kim Yu-na.

427
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,790
Are you boiling water for coffee?

428
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,020
Please give me one cup too.

429
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,470
You come all the way here just for my answer?

430
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,900
No.

431
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,340
I want to be with you.

432
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,810
But...

433
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,650
I also want to hear your answer, too.

434
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,920
Alright,

435
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,820
then I guess I'll have to tell you.

436
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,360
I thought I already said it.

437
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,160
It seems like you didn't understand,
so I'll tell you straight.

438
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,730
I don't like you.

439
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,770
Because you're acting like this,
I dislike you even more.

440
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,680
Then why did you offer to help me?

441
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,750
Why were you by my side when I was depressed?

442
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,720
Why?

443
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,220
Because you are pitiful.

444
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,460
And also... you're a celebrity. It’s fresh.

445
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,960
I did it out of curiosity,

446
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,700
but you thought I did it because I liked you.

447
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,070
I’m sorry.

448
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,340
But since you're a woman with a lot of pride,

449
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,510
I didn't think you would go this far.

450
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,350
If I had known, I wouldn't have helped you.

451
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,580
So...

452
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,350
What do you want me to do?

453
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,830
I wish you would get out of my sight.

454
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,600
But...

455
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:15,390
♫ You're my destiny ♫

456
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,410
Why do I feel like

457
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,120
you are lying to me right now?

458
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:19,420
♫ You're my everything ♫

459
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,400
♫ I can do nothing but watch you ♫

460
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:30,400
♫ I call your name in silence ♫

461
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:37,880
♫ You're the one my love ♫

462
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,910
♫ You're my delight of all ♫

463
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:49,120
♫ I love you more and more ♫

464
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:11,640
♫ Where are you ♫

465
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:20,220
♫ Am I still out of your sight ♫

466
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,160
♫ Dear you, the one I miss so much ♫

467
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:32,900
♫ I'm dying to see you ♫

468
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,560
Hee-kyung.

469
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,360
What brought you here?

470
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,270
♫ My heart goes to you ♫

471
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,630
Get in the car.

472
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,500
♫ I love you ♫

473
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,740
♫ I need you ♫

474
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,040
♫ The words I want to say ♫

475
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,410
♫ make me sorrowful ♫

476
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,620
♫ I love you ♫

477
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,920
♫ I need you ♫

478
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,220
♫ I have only you in my mind ♫

479
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:04,860
♫ even if I’m not by your side ♫

480
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,300
I'm sorry.

481
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,330
It's okay.

482
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,940
It’s not…

483
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,340
I assumed it, but couldn't understand this feeling.

484
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,110
I see that getting rejected feels like this.

485
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:26,220
I'm really miserable!

486
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,090
It's only like that the first time.

487
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,860
If you go through that for about 15 years,
it gets easier.

488
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,160
The first time you did that to me
is in front of the whole class.

489
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,260
You must have been embarrassed.

490
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,930
I felt like dying of embarrassment
even though there weren't any people watching.

491
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,140
Of course I had been.

492
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,080
Ah, even so, talking to you

493
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,080
makes me feel a little bit better.

494
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,410
But

495
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,280
you might

496
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,020
suddenly explode with anger in the mid night.

497
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,020
Watch out.

498
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,860
Is that so?

499
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,159
You may fail to fall asleep.

500
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,929
I see.

501
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:13,370
You might call him in anger.

502
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,469
But don't do it.

503
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,070
Remember how much he hates you.

504
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,840
You remember?

505
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,800
Yeah.

506
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,210
It was freaking annoying.

507
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,409
Freaking annoying?

508
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,550
I'm sorry.

509
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,480
Don't listen to sad songs either.

510
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,320
They make it hard to control your emotions.

511
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,090
What about you then?

512
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,429
What songs made it hard to control your emotions?

513
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:50,469
Can't you love me

514
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:56,639
Can't you understand more of my heart

515
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,410
Or

516
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:08,190
You could go love him, and live on

517
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:13,030
Only if you would stay next to me

518
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,790
Bad bitch.

519
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,400
She should've accepted you.

520
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,470
I know, right?

521
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,270
If I had accepted you back then,

522
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,470
after dating me for a little while,

523
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,870
you would have found out my
real side and gotten sick of me.

524
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:32,680
Then you could have met someone and leave me.

525
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,850
But earlier.

526
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:40,390
How did you come to me?

527
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,190
Did that man

528
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,260
call you?

529
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,160
Yeah.

530
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,400
I guess he didn't want me to go alone.

531
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,330
Hey…

532
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,570
That's a kind of consideration.

533
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,340
Just like how you do it to me.

534
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,840
It's meaningless.

535
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,540
What's so good about him?

536
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,510
I’ve tried for 15 years.

537
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,280
Why does it work for him?

538
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,390
You haven't known him for that long...

539
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,160
Oh, you are here?

540
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,600
That call, I didn't mean for you to come here.

541
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,200
"What are you doing?"

542
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,040
"I'm just night-fishing by myself."

543
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,610
"No, I don't mean you should come."

544
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:38,580
How is that not asking me to come here?

545
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,550
Because you came... I do feel nice.

546
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:45,280
My wife was about to start nagging anyway.

547
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,650
I was getting tired. So, I'm glad.

548
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,090
She wasn't like that when she was younger,

549
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,130
but her nagging gets worse as she gets older.

550
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,490
Lawyer Jang.

551
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,200
Yes?

552
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,170
Growing

553
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,440
old together...

554
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,840
What does it feel like?

555
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:19,450
I want to grow old together with her.

556
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:24,390
♫ By chance you come close to me ♫

557
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:28,130
♫ and hold me in arms ♫

558
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,370
♫ We look at each other with no words ♫

559
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:39,910
♫ We say hello in a whisper ♫

560
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:47,210
♫ I long for that in the dream ♫

561
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:53,190
♫ only to find it comes truth ♫

562
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,990
You don't seem well.

563
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,990
We should call it a day and leave now.

564
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,290
Yes.

565
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,660
It's cold.

566
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,900
Why do you keep saying it's cold these days?

567
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,430
You are never like this.

568
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,270
It's making me so anxious.

569
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,870
A very long time ago,

570
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:19,680
someone saved me, who was about to die.

571
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,220
That person said:

572
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:34,860
Can you return to your place anytime?

573
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,900
It's up to the universe.

574
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,630
But if I wait,

575
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,900
there will be a way.

576
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,600
There's no other way right now.

577
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,470
I guess I should wait.

578
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,870
I've witnessed a lot,

579
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,410
while treating you over the last 3 months.

580
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,210
I was surprised many times.

581
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,350
I was able to break out of my prejudice

582
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:01,420
and learned to see more.

583
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,690
However,

584
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:07,690
there's one thing I'm worried about.

585
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,400
The human body consists of yin and yang.

586
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,870
If any one of those

587
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:20,440
cannot appropriately be in balance with
heaven and earth, then life cannot be maintained.

588
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:27,280
The origin of the universe is no different from
the origin of life.

589
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,850
If you understand it, you won’t feel pain.
If you don’t, you’ll feel pain.

590
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,720
If energy circles well, you don't get sick.

591
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,620
Otherwise, you get sick.

592
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,120
But,

593
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,830
in your body, the energy of
heaven and earth does not circle well.

594
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:48,570
So, sir, how long will you live?

595
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:53,270
Someday, all of your energy will run down.

596
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,910
I wish

597
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,110
you'd be able to return to your place

598
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:02,710
before you become weak.
That’s my only wish.

599
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:14,690
Most likely, I think the limit he talked about

600
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,400
is drawing near right now.

601
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,260
That’s what I thought.

602
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,100
So you’re saying

603
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,170
you can’t stay here?

604
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:31,940
If I go against the natural law and stay here,

605
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,820
I’ll die soon.

606
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,340
What's this?

607
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,280
Yoon-jae, do you want a drink?

608
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,950
You can't, right?

609
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,920
You’re still in high school, right?

610
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,550
Drink what you can handle.

611
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,790
You can't drink well, but you like it so much.

612
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,390
I see.

613
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,470
Are you going to school?

614
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,780
Of course. I have to study.

615
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,610
What happened?

616
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,740
"Study" came out of your mouth.

617
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,350
After seeing you yesterday,

618
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,050
I should study.

619
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,480
Study really well,

620
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,390
and not live my life as a waste.

621
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,990
What about me?

622
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,490
You bastard,

623
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,260
what about me?

624
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,510
Like I got shot

625
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:48,050
It hurts so much

626
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:57,690
Like I got shot

627
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:01,190
Manager Do!

628
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:07,000
Manager Do!

629
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,450
[Recent calls: Manager Do 19 times.]

630
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:33,630
-The number you dial…
-Why?

631
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,790
Why aren't you answering?

632
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,530
You bought a phone because I asked you to,
but why aren't you answering?

633
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,970
Why?

634
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,370
You thought I wouldn't call anymore, right?

635
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,510
-I'm going to keep calling.
-The number you dial…

636
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:54,950
Do Min-joon!

637
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,720
Hey.

638
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,270
You bastard.

639
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,610
Does The Bible of Moral Sense tell you to do this?

640
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,310
You jerk.

641
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,910
Go to the Beotigogae
and sit there the whole night!

642
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,550
Can't you think about it again?

643
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,780
I'll be good.

644
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,850
Is it because that I broke the pottery?

645
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,490
I said I will replace it.

646
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:36,220
Let's go to Icheon together.

647
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,890
What is it?

648
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,060
Shoes.

649
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,090
My shoes that you stole.

650
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,960
You liked them, right?

651
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,430
So much that you secretly stole them.

652
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:26,040
You can keep them.

653
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:31,680
Those shoes that have our memories.

654
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:40,790
The ones that have our memories.

655
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,930
Mom,

656
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,330
he left, right?

657
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,000
Of course he went out.

658
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,540
Why aren't you leaving?

659
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,740
I might catch a cold,

660
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,870
so I'm off for a day.

661
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,310
Is it?

662
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,140
I will make some soup and send it upstairs,

663
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,580
so go up and take a rest.

664
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,280
Yes.

665
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,690
Earlier.

666
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,330
I'm thankful.

667
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,970
Anyway, thanks for contacting me.

668
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,270
For not letting Song-yi go alone.

669
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:07,710
Did you wait to say this?

670
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,610
And 12 years ago,

671
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,210
for saving Song-yi.

672
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,650
I'm thankful for that too.

673
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,680
I told you it’s not me.

674
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,150
Even though she doesn't know

675
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,920
that you are that person,

676
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,090
she seems to like you a lot.

677
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:28,030
Do you really

678
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,600
not like Song-yi?

679
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,900
Or...

680
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,000
Is there another reason?

681
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,610
I see that you can be nosy in many ways.

682
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,880
The person you like

683
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,610
likes me,

684
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:52,620
yet you are curious about that?

685
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,990
If you really like that girl,

686
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,490
don't mind the feelings of anyone else,

687
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:02,360
but protect that girl in your own way.

688
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,200
And…

689
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,700
Lee Jae-kyung.

690
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:12,540
How do you know my brother?

691
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,470
Last time, my brother asked about you too.

692
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:18,080
Yes, your brother.

693
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:24,080
Protect her from him.

694
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,520
What does that mean?

695
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,890
I don't know you fully yet,

696
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:33,060
so I can't tell you more.

697
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,600
One-person Agency?

698
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,410
Last time, my son-in-Law Lee..

699
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,780
No, Hee-kyung briefly talked about that,

700
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:55,650
but you are really going make an agency
just for Song-yi?

701
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,820
Yes.

702
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,050
I think of Song-yi's incident as very pitiful.

703
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:07,730
From now on, I would like to

704
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:12,560
take care of Song-yi with my own hands.

705
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,730
I didn't know you would think like this.

706
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:17,340
If it is convenient to you,
would you like to have dinner together?

707
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,810
I want to do this.

708
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,010
Of course.

709
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,590
One is the chairman of a middle-size company,

710
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,220
but he's over 80 years old.

711
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,790
He's recuperating in Thailand.

712
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,190
Another one is a dancer.

713
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,230
He went to the Czech Republic on the day.

714
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,000
He hasn't returned yet.

715
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,600
The last person... died 2 years ago.

716
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,770
Died?

717
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:53,470
He was Han Seo-jin, a 32-year-old astrophysicist.

718
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,140
[ID. Career: Astrophysicist.
Name: Han Seo-jin.]

719
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,840
He was declared dead after missing.

720
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,910
Then, what is it?

721
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,710
You said that there were only 3 pens.

722
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,380
All three people are not related to this?

723
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:09,290
Are you sure Han Seo Jin was dead?

724
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,930
Where did he go when it's cold outside?

725
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,100
Did he go on a date or something?

726
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,560
You are protecting Cheon Song-yi very well.

727
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,720
I had to find another way.

728
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,760
What will you do? Decide.

729
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:53,930
Cut.

730
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:54,730
Okay.

731
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,370
Thanks for your hard work.

732
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:59,470
You are cold, right?

733
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,440
Are you going to the hospital?

734
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:05,610
No. I have somewhere to go.

735
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:07,710
I will drive my car there.

736
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,610
Get off from work first.

737
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:10,550
Okay.

738
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:19,490
Se-mi.

739
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,990
I guess I need to take back

740
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:24,600
what I told you last time.

741
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,830
What?

742
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,700
I told you that I don't want to lose a friend.

743
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:36,140
I realized how selfish and ridiculous that is.

744
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:40,110
I don’t want to lose you. But

745
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,250
your happiness is more important.

746
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,220
While appearing as a friend

747
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,890
in front of the guy who can't love you,

748
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,220
you can't be happy.

749
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,030
How about you?

750
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,060
You are doing that.

751
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:04,440
I'm miserable right now.

752
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:06,840
So I thought

753
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,610
I shouldn't make you like me.

754
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,850
From now,

755
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,750
Yoo Se-mi,

756
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:22,450
I won't see you as a friend.

757
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,250
Why is she here suddenly?

758
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,320
I look like a mess right now.

759
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,490
Can I come in?

760
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,640
It’s awkward.

761
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,180
I never imagined it’ll be awkward when with you.

762
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,250
There were many times when I felt awkward.

763
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,280
You didn't notice because you were slow.

764
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,820
Is that so?

765
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:31,790
Anyway, I changed into different clothes
when I saw you standing outside,

766
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:33,360
and combed my hair again.

767
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,560
I didn't need to do like that before,

768
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,130
but as you wish,

769
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,000
I think I care about what you think now.

770
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,370
Yeah?

771
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,370
So?

772
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,240
You expect me to say thank you?

773
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,810
You’re so screwed up.

774
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,440
It isn't good for you.

775
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,310
It’s the advice I give you

776
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:57,720
as a friend, no, once as your friend.

777
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,050
Live your life as you normally live

778
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,890
and don't get screwed because of me.

779
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:06,920
My life is already screwed because of you.

780
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,190
Why because of me?

781
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:09,590
You...

782
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,500
You always said this like a habit.

783
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,540
You said you wanted to meet someday

784
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,240
the one who saved you

785
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,380
on the night you almost died 12 years ago.

786
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,510
Why are you bringing it up?

787
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:29,510
Yeah.

788
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,180
Did I do something wrong

789
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,250
by saying that?

790
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:44,660
Sometimes, I can’t understand you.

791
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,190
Just say what you want to say!

792
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,460
Didn't you say you will recognize him at once?

793
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,130
If that person appears in front of you,

794
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:54,230
didn't you say you will recognize him at once?

795
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:57,070
And?

796
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,340
You said you are waiting for that person

797
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,710
and that you will meet him some day,

798
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,110
so you take Hee-kyung...

799
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,610
That foolish kid who only likes you.

800
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,480
He just protects you and can’t get you.

801
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,020
But now, how come you couldn't recognize him?

802
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,350
What can’t I recognize?

803
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:24,060
He is by your side. Why can't you recognize him?

804
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,600
By my side?

805
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,430
Where?

806
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,170
Who?

807
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:37,310
What are you saying?

808
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,060
So?

809
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,740
What do you want me to do?

810
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:44,280
I wish you would get out of my sight.

811
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,120
But...

812
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,120
Why do I think that

813
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,800
you are lying?

814
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:05,960
♫ By chance you come close to me ♫

815
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,900
♫ and hold me in arms ♫

816
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,770
♫ I long for that in the dream ♫

817
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:25,240
♫ only to find it comes truth ♫

818
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,750
♫ Love comes ♫

819
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:31,680
♫ You leave ♫

820
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,950
♫ I’m waiting ♫

821
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,260
♫ Hard to meet again ♫

822
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,860
♫ I'm a fool for love ♫
