00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,890
The most amazing superpower I have

3
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,120
is to freeze the time.

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,930
You can do that?

5
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,530
Of course.

6
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,870
I’m much more miraculous than you imagine.

7
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,340
I’ve tried many times to freeze the time.

8
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,270
And I’ve said this when you’re not aware,

9
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,510
“I love you, Cheon Song-yi.”

10
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,950
I feel that if I say this when time is passing,

11
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:22,190
everything will flow away with time.

12
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:28,700
So I choose to say it when time’s frozen.

13
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,570
I love you, Cheon Song-yi.

14
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,740
I love you.

15
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:47,650
Before and after I met you.

16
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,350
I love you.

17
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,250
400 years ago,

18
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,250
I first set foot on this planet.

19
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,090
I’ve been abiding by one principle.

20
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,530
You’ll get hurt when you lose something,

21
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,260
so you’d better not have it at the first place.

22
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,760
I’ll leave some day.

23
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,070
And I can’t take anything away with me.

24
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,340
So I can’t love or have

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,340
anyone or anything,

26
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,010
That’s my principle.

27
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,720
I’ve been keeping it well.

28
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,690
Until 3 months ago.

29
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,920
Everything was then ruined.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,130
Tell me, when did you fall in love with me?

31
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,740
The first time we met in the elevator?

32
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,040
Or when she broke in my place when drunk?

33
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,680
I can’t even tell now.

34
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,720
I love her. I want her to be mine.

35
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,690
I can’t afford to lose her.

36
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,930
Her need becomes my priority.

37
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,329
Now I’m thinking,

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,070
the last round of destiny will start.

39
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,640
But will I

40
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,310
defeat it?

41
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,960
[My Love from the Star  Last Record]

42
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,200
I’ve never seen the sky here shine bright at night.

43
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,769
Thanks to this rare comet shower.

44
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,410
Breaking news.

45
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,650
NASA reported just now that

46
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,520
Disawusi is approaching Earth.

47
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,320
It should be on an orbit 350,000 km away

48
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,120
and would pass by Earth.

49
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,460
But it deorbited as it came near to Earth

50
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,659
probably due to the gravity.

51
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,730
It is expected to shorten the distance to
40,000 km before passing by.

52
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,600
Meteor shower will ensue.

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,470
We kindly warn you of the potential danger

54
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,570
brought by the meteors.

55
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,610
Honey, look.

56
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,980
That’s true.

57
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,750
What’s that?

58
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,450
It’s amazing.

59
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,530
Let’s make a wish.

60
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,130
They are just stones.

61
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,200
To me, the most ignorant thing human beings do

62
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,470
is making wishes to meteors.

63
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,470
You won’t do it then?

64
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,820
Look at that!

65
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,730
The meteor shower!

66
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,710
See that, honey?

67
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,350
Mom, look at that.

68
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,120
Come make a wish.

69
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,450
OK.

70
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,070
Fantastic.

71
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,909
What’s that?

72
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,480
Did you see that?

73
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,280
Yes, meteors..

74
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,090
No, that one’s different.

75
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,290
Looks like a UFO.

76
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,460
Like you’ve seen one before.

77
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,790
Look at that.

78
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,300
God, it’s terrific.

79
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,980
Cheon Song-yi.

80
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,850
Cheon Song-yi, my love.

81
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,530
It’s getting colder now.

82
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,370
Don’t wear sexy clothes.

83
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,840
You look prettier when you cover yourself up.

84
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,410
Like I said before,

85
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,840
don’t act in scenes of kissing and hugging.

86
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,450
No way.

87
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,350
Scenes of sex are absolutely forbidden.

88
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,420
Don’t be sick. Don’t read online slanders.

89
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:45,800
Don’t start singing and end up wailing.

90
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,700
Don’t have meals alone.

91
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,040
Don’t break into strange places

92
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,610
when you’re drunk.

93
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,430
At the night,

94
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,760
don’t stare into the sky like a fool

95
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:27,570
guessing which star I’m on.

96
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,150
You can’t see it from here.

97
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:41,050
But I’ll be watching you

98
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,920
from there.

99
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:54,600
I’ll be watching this place every day.

100
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,840
I will be trying to find a way back here every day.

101
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,410
Whatever it takes,

102
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:16,490
I’ll find a way to stay with you forever.

103
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,430
I promise.

104
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,600
However,

105
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,840
if…

106
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,910
If I fail,

107
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,120
please forget me.

108
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,360
All of me.

109
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,200
I can’t.

110
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,400
How can I forget you?

111
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,570
Am I a loggerhead to you?

112
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,610
You shouldn’t have said that.

113
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,740
Right, Do Min-joon?

114
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,750
Answer me.

115
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,620
Answer me, Do Min-joon.

116
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,260
Are you there?

117
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,960
Are you there?

118
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,420
You’re not gone, right?

119
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,920
You’re not gone?

120
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,520
You just left right after finishing your words?

121
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,960
I haven’t even said goodbye to you.

122
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,960
How could you just leave like that?

I’m not sure about Song-yi,

You know how expensive the handbags are?

Song-yi is easier to deal with.

137

Her mom holds grudges.

I think I crossed the line at that time.

Wait a minute.

145

Please take this.

146

These are the latest bags of 2014.

President An.

148
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,410
Yes?

149
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,620
I sold all my bags during that hard time.

150
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,890
I see. But that’s even better.

151
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,860
I’ll make up for your loss.

152
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,890
You’re missing the point.

153
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:47,030
I’ve been in hell in the past 3 months.

154
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,230
I’ve been betrayed l for a whole season.

155
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,200
And where were you during that time?

156
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,540
I went from home to work and work to home…

157
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,240
Mrs. Cheon.

158
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,510
The whole nation is pitying for Song-yi.

159
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,220
They feel sorry for mistaking her as a murderer.

160
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,150
The top search online is “Sorry, Cheon Song-yi”.

161
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,620
You won’t find a better timing.

162
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,330
We gotta seize this chance to make her back.

163
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,600
If you want her to come back, work with me.

164
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,970
No one knows her better than I do.

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,300
Beom.

168

Yes?

169
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,380
I don’t want all that money or handbags.

170
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,910
I need you to help Song-yi.

171
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,920
She’s not eating or sleeping for days.

172
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,360
She’s not herself after Manager Do left.

173
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,600
I haven’t seen Do ever since.

174
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,200
Don’t touch my stuff even though I’m not here.

175
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,970
The porcelain you broke had the calligraphy

176
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,770
of Mr. Heo Gyun on it.

177
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,580
I’ve told you before, right?

178
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,110
You can’t buy things like that at a rest stop.

179
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,380
Fine.

180
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,800
[Defendant]

181
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,640
State the case.

182
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,490
On March 5, 2007, the Suspect, Lee Jae-kyung,

183
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,320
colluded with Shin Hyun-tae,
Director of Sky Metal Hospital

184
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,190
to confined his ex-wife
Ms. Yang Min-ju there for 7 years.

185
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,830
When the confinement came to light,

186
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,900
he kidnapped and confined Ms. Yang again

187
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,360
on Feb. 13, 2014.

188
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,880
Also, Ms. Han Yoo-ra was killed on Dec. 26, 2013.

189
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,040
Lee Jae-kyung was accused to be the suspect.

190
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,180
He once admitted to be the murderer,

191
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,650
but then denied it during investigation.

192
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,550
Despite his testimony, the accusation has been

193
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,720
proved to be true by his secretary, Lee Shin,

194
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,020
who was also involved in the case.

195
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,600
Therefore, we believe Lee Jae-kyung to be
the murderer of Ms. Han Yoo-ra.

196
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,970
Lee Shin also confessed other crimes.

197
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,840
Lee Jae-kyung is likely to destroy the evidence

198
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,910
and he may also abscond.

199
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,240
That why we apply for his detention.

200
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,080
That’s all about my statement.

201
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,050
Lawyer, you can start now.

202
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,490
We

203
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,300
have nothing further to say.

204
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,570
Then this is the end of the formal investigation.

205
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,490
What?

206
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,890
What’s happening, dad?

207
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,490
I know you’re disappointed at me.

208
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:38,130
But the truth will come to light.

209
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,100
I have nothing to do with those cases.

210
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,240
First, you should send Hee-kyung away.

211
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,240
Then?

212
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,550
My secretary will plead guilty to all crimes.

213
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,820
Contact his parents.

214
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,460
-They have financial problem…
-Jae-kyung.

215
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,430
Yes, dad?

216
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:11,600
I’ve decided to donate all your assets.

217
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,000
That’s a good move.

218
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,940
The priority now is to win back public opinion.

219
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,400
Also,

220
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,780
I won’t help you anymore.

221
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:34,850
You will spend the rest of your life in prison.

222
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,960
Pity.

223
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,990
Dad.

224
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,070
I… Don’t you care about what will happen

225
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,000
to the company if I am sentenced?

226
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,740
-First, the share price will…
-I will step back.

227
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,310
Let professional brokers to handle everything.

228
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,450
I don’t know what you’ve heard from Hee-kyung.

229
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,120
But this is not over yet.

230
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,960
You’ve toiled your whole life to build the company.

231
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,460
That’s right.

232
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,690
I’ve been too busy with my business

233
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:22,130
that I failed to notice the monster I kept.

234
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,240
I didn’t even know

235
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,140
that the monster ate my son up.

236
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,210
When you were a kid,

237
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,980
you blinded a friend’s eye

238
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,060
in a fight.

239
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,300
I shouldn’t have solved it with money.

240
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,540
It’s all my fault.

241
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,980
I didn’t expect that you killed Han-kyung.

242
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,620
Is that what Hee-kyung told you?

243
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,450
He said I’ve killed my own brother?

244
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,930
You believe that?

245
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,130
That record is fake.

246
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,570
He faked that to take my place.

247
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,200
Don’t be deceived, dad.

248
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,670
Get me out of here

249
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,710
and I’ll prove it to you.

250
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,310
Hee-kyung’s been lying to you.

251
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,010
Enough!

252
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,410
It’s over now.

253
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,720
You belong here.

254
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,130
You can’t treat me like this, dad.

255
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,330
No way.

256
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,940
I’ve still got many things to do.

257
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,910
I will get out of here.

258
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,950
You don’t think I can make it on my own?

259
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,580
Don’t stop me. Understand?

260
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,690
I demand you not do anything.

261
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,580
[You jerk! That’s not from the book!
You immortal bastard. What a fraud!
Can you give it a second thought?
I’ll do my best.]

262
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,990
[I miss you so much.]

263
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,190
You don’t read the message?

264
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,160
What?

265
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,930
Aren’t you gonna check your phone?

266
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,870
There’s no new message.

267
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,700
No?

268
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,590
I’ve brought you chicken and beer.

269
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,090
It’s really dark here.

270
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,990
Why are you here?

271
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,330
Your mom called me.

272
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,200
What are you doing here? Get back to your home.

273
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,740
No.

274
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,140
What for?

275
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,380
You’re waiting for him here. But where’s he?

276
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,780
When will he come back?

277
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,450
How could he even leave?

278
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,790
I’ve warned him

279
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,390
I’d take his place

280
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,190
if he left you behind.

281
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,700
I’ve explicitly told him so, and he still left?

282
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,670
Hee-kyung,

283
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,870
he’s done everything he could for me.

284
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,780
I’m upset only because

285
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,110
I’ve realized this too late.

286
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,320
That I’ve done nothing for him.

287
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,020
I couldn’t even say a proper goodbye to him.

288
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,330
He’ll keep on trying there.

289
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,130
He asked me to wait for him.

290
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,600
And so he must be trying his best now.

291
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,170
Maybe he will never come back,

292
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,010
but I won’t forget him anyway.

293
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
I will remember by heart what we had together.

294
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,390
I’ll be waiting for him earnestly every second.

295
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,460
But first you gotta eat something.

296
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,830
This is a favor I’m asking for.

297
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,970
A favor?

298
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:35,410
I’ll leave before long.

299
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,180
If Song-yi’s alone,

300
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,390
you’re the one that worries me most.

301
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,700
But you are the first one I can count on.

302
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,900
So

303
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,730
I need to ask you for a favor.

304
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,570
What favor?

305
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,570
Please take good care of her.

306
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,210
Sure. I’ll do that.

307
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,340
Asking me for a favor?

308
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,150
But remember, I only want you

309
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,320
to care for her, not take my place.

310
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,190
I won’t promise that.

311
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,290
I’ve got my own way to take care of her.

312
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:32,270
Did he really say that?

313
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,340
He did. So eat something.

314
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,510
You mom’s worrying about you,

315
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,810
I’ve got porridge here. You want some?

316
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,890
What’s wrong?

317
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,870
They’ve come to life!

318
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,310
What?

319
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,510
He must have arrived safe and sound.

320
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
He’s fine now, right?

321
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,580
Fully recovered.

322
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,460
What are you talking about?

323
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,020
You won’t understand.

324
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:33,100
Don’t fall ill again, little grass.

325
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,230
I’ll take care of you.

326
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,410
Hello, Mrs. Cheon.

327
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,610
I just saw Song-yi home. Getting back now.

328
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,410
Yes, she also had some porridge.

329
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,820
Yes. Don’t worry.

330
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,350
OK.

331
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:06,030
Nasty man.

332
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,740
This is Do Min-joon’s stuff. Why is it here?

333
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,270
He gave it to me.

334
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,840
He did? Why?

335
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,420
Hi, what’s the matter?

336
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:30,320
I’ll be away traveling for a long time.

337
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,760
Are you having that kind of travel?

338
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,460
What?

339
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,260
Do you need a bike? With a basket in the front?

340
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,170
Nothing like that.

341
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:52,480
Anyway, it might take a long time.

342
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,410
So I need to ask you for a favor.

343
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,280
Anything for you.

344
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,420
When I’m away, be nice to your sister.

345
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,560
Don’t upset her.

346
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,130
Do whatever she asks you to do.

347
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,760
Well, that’s…

348
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
I’ll do everything for you, but this is…

349
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,270
The telescopes.

350
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,670
You’ve been coveting them for a long time.

351
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,640
They’re yours now.

352
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,780
Both of them?

353
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,210
Both of them.

354
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,480
I’ll even die if my sister asks me to.

355
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,880
Good,

356
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,120
Don’t let her push herself too hard.

357
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,620
Please take good care of her.

358
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,860
Thank you, Min-joon.

359
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,230
Can I hug you?

360
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,030
No. Absolutely not.

361
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,770
So he asked you to take care of me?

362
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,710
When will he be back from the travel?

363
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,440
Where has he gone?

364
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,690
Cheon Song-yi’s phone is still power-off today.

365
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,490
What’s wrong with her?

366
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,560
Is two weeks off for personal reason not enough?

367
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,230
Just when she became popular again,

368
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,470
all her bad manners come up again too?

369
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,870
She thinks I won’t fire her?

370
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,640
Oh my.

371
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,240
My poor nerves.

372
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,710
Director.

373
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,780
Yes?

374
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,910
Are you firing Song-yi?

375
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,210
What?

376
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,020
That’s for the best.

377
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,490
I heard that many directors are out there for her.

378
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,690
And she’s getting more popular among the public.

379
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,200
Her scenes also increased judging from the script.

380
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,760
Honestly, that worries me.

381
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,400
This is the best time to fire her.

382
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,710
We’ll still make it if I star in this film.

383
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,810
What can it be? A disaster?

384
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,080
Well, I didn’t mean I’d fire her.

385
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,650
It’s just I “want” to do so.

386
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,580
And you? Can you get in touch with her?

387
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,150
Aren’t you good friend?

388
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,750
No, we’re not.

389
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,120
What style do you want?

390
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,960
Cut it nice and short

391
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,790
Shorter than this?

392
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:27,570
I want to cut my hair along with my love.

393
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,300
Man again?

394
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,640
How did you lose him?

395
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,270
I tried my best to play hard to get.

396
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,840
Though I didn’t “play hard”,

397
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,510
all I did was “get”.

398
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,780
What happened?

399
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,520
He fell in love with my best friend.

400
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,850
My god.

401
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,790
I used to be her love consultant.

402
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,490
They owe me big.

403
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,360
What a bitch.

404
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,030
Bitch will be too strong a word.

405
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,300
You have your hair cut every time you’re dumped.

406
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,170
I don’t think I’ll see you with long hair.

407
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,670
Welcome.

408
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,510
What’s wrong with you?

409
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,840
Cut my hair too.

410
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,580
No.

411
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,720
Shave it.

412
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,650
Stop it, you.

413
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,120
You think everyone looks good with short hair?

414
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,990
Only those with pretty face can handle it.

415
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,500
Look at your face. You’ll fall with hair cut short.

416
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,160
Stop it.

417
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,540
Is it that funny?

418
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,520
That’s hilarious. “I won’t buy it.”

419
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,850
That’s so Do Min-joon.

420
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:59,520
I was crying the hell out of myself,
holding those 1000 paper cranes.

421
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,130
I want to look at his face.

422
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,330
Tell me more.

423
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,260
What?

424
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,830
More about him.

425
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,740
I don’t have many memories about him.

426
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,400
That’s all I have.

427
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,380
Then tell me again the “I won’t buy it” story.

428
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,850
Cheon Song-yi.

429
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,990
Song-yi, are you crying?

430
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,240
It’s been long, Bok-ja.

431
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,670
I changed my name 10 years ago.

432
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,570
Please just call me Hae-in.

433
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,110
What’s wrong with her?

434
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,380
Do Min-joon.

435
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,580
Hey, Cheon Song-yi.

436
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,290
Director said he’ll fire you
if you don’t come tomorrow.

437
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,060
This is the schedule for tomorrow.

438
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,260
This should not be my job, you know.

439
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,460
Se-mi.

440
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,469
What about you?

441
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,739
You’ve met Do Min-joon, right.

442
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,810
Tell me some funny things about him.

443
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,080
Anything.

444
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,850
Tell me something,

445
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,380
will you?

446
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:42,730
Do Min-joon, come to my room.

447
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,670
What are you doing?

448
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,440
Nothing.

449
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,150
Don’t forget you’re Cheon Song-yi.

450
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,750
How long will that be

451
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:12,520
before you stop grieving over him?

452
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,060
Will that day even come?

453
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:21,030
Yes, the day when you think of him.

454
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,500
What do you mean?

455
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,810
He’s the only thing in your mind now.

456
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,080
And you can’t take a rest.

457
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,810
It’s even harder not to think of him.

458
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,820
But one day

459
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,550
when you think of him,

460
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,450
you realize he only pops up at intervals

461
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:48,330
when you’re thinking about other stuff.

462
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,130
That’s when you stop grieving over him.

463
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:54,730
You can think about other things ocassionaly.

464
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,970
You sound like a master of love.

465
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,970
How long did it take you to get there?

466
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,880
15 years.

467
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,110
Are you joking?

468
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,720
It took me 15 years

469
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,880
to get over someone.

470
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,460
That must be hard for you.

471
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,730
How can I live on

472
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,400
if it will take that long?

473
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,620
Se-mi was right.

474
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,550
It was even harder for me not to think of him

475
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,660
than just thinking of him.

476
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,090
So

477
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:59,230
I revisited every place we had been together.

478
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,270
To drown myself in the memories.

479
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,740
To look for his trace.

480
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,720
I was waiting for him.

481
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,590
Then, that day came.

482
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:28,130
We promised to meet 100 days later.

483
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:32,430
At Namsan Tower

484
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:35,290
♫ Finally I see you at a glance ♫

485
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:42,170
♫ Everything has changed greatly ♫

486
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:48,770
♫ You divides my world into two ♫

487
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,950
♫ When you breathe ♫

488
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,820
♫ I feel a warm breeze ♫

489
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,950
♫ When you smile ♫

490
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:04,820
♫ I see a shining star ♫

491
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,490
[Cheon Song-yi and Do Min-joon]

492
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,530
That’s when I started to see him.

493
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,900
I used to believe that it was just my illusion.

494
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,440
But then I thought I saw him.

495
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,040
No. I did saw him.

496
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,380
But that didn’t really make sense, right?

497
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,250
Am I going mental?

498
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,550
I’ve experienced this too.

499
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,990
I’m not sure about my mental state though.

500
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,460
Once…

501
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:50,540
You all look good.

502
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,070
That’s reassuring.

503
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,540
Lawyer Jang.

504
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,240
Yes?

505
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,750
Sir?

506
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,930
I felt so weird that I even went to the doctor.

507
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,930
It was schizophrenia due to PDST.

508
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,830
At least that’s what the doctor said.

509
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,900
Your loved one’s gone somewhere you can’t go.

510
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,540
That’s just like he’s dead. So you feel pressure.

511
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:34,310
Do Min-joon also means a lot to you, right?

512
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,180
Mom,

513
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,120
I’ve discovered a novel planetoid.

514
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,790
What?

515
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:48,160
I found it with Min-joon’s telescope.

516
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,660
This is my first time to discover a planetoid.

517
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,330
What are you talking about?

518
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,630
I was wondering what it was

519
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,330
at first sight

520
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,640
But I tried some more times
and it was still there.

521
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,640
So I’ve filed a formal report to the association

522
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,840
about its location and revolution period.

523
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,180
I even got an interim number for it from IAU.

524
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,880
What?

525
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,950
I’m totally lost.

526
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,380
So it’s a good thing then?

527
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,550
Of course it’s good.

528
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,890
How?

529
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,320
I can name it if I’m the one who discover it.

530
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,790
Is that so?

531
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,330
Like Yang Mi-yeon Planetoid?

532
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,590
No.

533
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,330
Like Do Min-joon Planetoid.

534
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,000
I’ve had enough.

535
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,770
He must be a deceiver, not an alien.

536
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:30,000
He left after winning your heart.
And why do you name the planet after him?

537
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,370
He’s gone on a trip.

538
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,110
I hope everything is going well with him anyway.

539
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,380
I heard that it’ll take three years to verify.

540
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,910
Three years?

541
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,010
Oh my.

542
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,580
Then when will that day come?

543
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,570
[Three years later]

544
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,810
Mr. Cheon, you are the 21st person in our country
to discover a planetoid

545
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:15,710
Three years after the discovery, you finally received the verification from IAU.

546
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,950
You can even name the planet yourself.

547
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,420
Are you a college student now?

548
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,690
I’m preparing for my 3rd NCEE in Noryangjin.

549
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,260
Is that so?

550
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,590
The observation, profiling, report writing and

551
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,700
other process for a new star are demanding.

552
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,900
It’s not for everyone.

553
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,700
How did you make it?

554
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,400
I got a lot of help from my teacher,

555
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,110
who is also my idol.

556
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,180
Did you name the planet after him?

557
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,840
Yes, that’s right.

558
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,150
I named the planet after him

559
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,280
Do Min-joon.

560
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,390
Thank you for your work.

561
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,120
Thank you very much.

562
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,390
Thank you.

563
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,960
-Thank you.
-Thank you for your work.

564
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,590
Goodbye.

565
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,730
You don’t need to come.

566
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:01,860
You need an assistant

567
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:06,100
to look classier.

568
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,400
We gotta make for another place for interview.

569
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,310
Hello? Yes, this is Cheon’s manager.

570
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,540
We’re setting off.

571
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,840
OK.

572
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,280
Let’s go.

573
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,420
My business is doing well.

574
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,720
You just grow up right in this way.

575
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,490
But get back to me in the future, OK?

576
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,460
I haven’t given myself up yet.

577
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,870
Look at you, playing hard to get.

578
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,140
Did you hear that?

579
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,570
Lee Jae-kyung has dropped the appeal.

580
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,510
Yes.

581
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,180
S&C leaves him at the mercy of the court.

582
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,350
That’s weird.

583
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,950
Rumor has it that he turned to his instructor

584
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,620
for help and is now in a medical room.

585
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,320
Why?

586
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,850
He said in tears that he’s been haunted

587
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,460
by the people he killed.

588
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,560
For anti-social people,

589
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,590
when their crimes are known to all

590
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,300
and they see no hope,

591
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,830
they tend to experience bipolar disorder.

592
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,370
That would seem so.

593
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:19,470
He’s reaping what he’s sown.

594
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,710
But

595
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,540
he did say something creepy.

596
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,710
What?

597
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,010
He said he had seen Do Min-joon.

598
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,450
He must have gone mad.

599
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,560
-Good morning.
-Here you are.

600
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,360
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

601
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,900
Look at this.

602
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,070
It’s already been popular.

603
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,170
This TV drama is great.

604
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,470
I heard something.

605
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:55,140
What?

606
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,540
Half of the production expenses
are covered by your company.

607
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,110
Really?

608
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,280
Maybe.

609
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,020
We’ve been investing in TV dramas lately.

610
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,750
Don’t say it’s a coincidence.
It’s the fifth one now.

611
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,890
You invest in all the works I star, right?

612
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:14,130
Really? Five already?

613
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,930
I have nothing to do with that.

614
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:20,830

Song-yi, you can’t cry.

The make-up…

655

I miss him badly.

656
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,970
I want to touch him.

I want to be with him. I can’t live without him.

00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,550
♫ You're my everything ♫

673
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,520
♫ I can do nothing but watch you ♫

674
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:30,530
♫ I call your name in silence ♫

675
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:45,540
♫ You're the one my love ♫

676
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,270
Am I back forever?

677
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,710
It’s hard to explain.

678
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,310
He did come back,

679
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,110
for a while.

680
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,510
♫ You're my delight of all ♫

681
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:57,320
♫ I love you more and more ♫

682
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,860
What happened?

683
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,320
-What’s the matter?
-He’s gone.

684
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,190
He disappeared!

685
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:25,620
♫ I’m calling your name ♫

686
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,830
Three years ago, when I left,

687
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,500
I went into something

688
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,170
called a worm whole.

689
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,770
[Worm hole:
a narrow passage through space-time in the universe.]

690
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:48,240
I fully recovered in that place.

691
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,110
Then I started to try coming back.

692
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:53,480
All I want

693
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,210
is not a long life in the hole,

694
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:59,580
but a curt stay on Earth.

695
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,160
When I made it for the first time
out of many goes,

696
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:12,060
I could only stay for 5-10 seconds.

697
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,870
That was the first success.

698
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,910
Though I didn’t even say a word before leaving.

699
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,180
So I didn’t get it wrong.

700
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,380
And I wasn’t mad.

701
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:37,090
I was able to speak
when I made it the second time.

702
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,960
But it was not Cheon Song-yi I spoke to.

703
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,240
Seems like you are in good health.

704
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,540
That’s reassuring.

705
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:55,010
Lawyer Jang.

706
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:56,840
Yes?

707
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:05,520
Then I tried many times.

708
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,920
There were failures of course.

709
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:13,530
An unexpected success drove someone crazy.

710
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,610
Do Min-joon?

711
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,410
Have you lost everything?

712
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:41,990
Money? Family? Reputation? Friends?

713
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,760
I’ve come to check it up.

714
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:09,410
The point is, I was able to stay longer.

715
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,950
Yes. That’s the point.

716
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:15,190
He’s been staying here for 14 months this time.

717
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:43,380
♫ Finally I see you at a glance ♫

718
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:50,020
♫ Everything has changed greatly ♫

719
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,490
That’s perfect happiness.

720
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:57,000
♫ You divides my world into two ♫

721
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:01,900
♫ When you breathe ♫

722
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,740
♫ I feel a warm breeze ♫

723
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,870
♫ When you smile ♫

724
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:13,150
♫ I see a shining star ♫

725
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:21,020
♫ You are there, one and only ♫

726
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:27,590
♫ Sometimes you lean on my shoulder without words ♫

727
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:30,130
Once there was a special rabbit
who can find his way home.

728
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:31,060
♫ For me ♫

729
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,870
♫ it’s a happy moment ♫

730
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:44,280
♫ This wish arouses waves of emotions about you ♫

731
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,750
Am I upset by his sudden disappearance?

732
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,560
Of course I am, more or less.

733
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,530
But that makes me love him even more.

734
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:06,600
Every second can be our last meeting

735
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:17,110
So every second is precious.

736
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,590
I’m back.

737
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:45,770
♫ You're my destiny ♫

738
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:49,910
♫ You're my destiny ♫
