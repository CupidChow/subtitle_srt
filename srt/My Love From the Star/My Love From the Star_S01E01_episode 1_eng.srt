00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,360
 Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, 1st Year of King Gwang Hae, Volume 20.
 Recorded on September 25th

2
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,850
 In Gan Sung Goon, Won Joo Mok, Kang Ryung Bu, and Choon Chun Bu sky, a shiny round washbasin-shaped object appeared.

3
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,440

4
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,110
 It was very large and fast as an arrow.
It made a thunder-like sound that shook heaven and earth.

5
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,890
 It disappeared with a flame.
The sky was clear at the time and there wasn't
 a speck of cloud in any direction.

6
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,460
 Year 1609 August 25th in Gangneung

7
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,880
Aigoo.

8
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,180
Won't you stop crying.

9
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,690
It's because My Lady is so pitiable.

10
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,210
What thunderbolt from a clear sky is this?
How can she become a widow before she even arrived at her in-law's after the wedding ceremony?

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,640
She's now only 15 years old.
 Madang Gwabu: a woman who became a widow after wedding, but before going to the in-law's.

12
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,330
She's not even seen the face of her husband
and she has to live her entire life as a widow!

13
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,910
What kind of luck is that?

14
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,710
Look there!

15
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,650
What is that?

16
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,510
Hey! Hey!

17
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,840
Someone take me out! Someone save me!

18
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,680
 Year 1609, 1st Year of King Gwang Hae

19
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,680
 In the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, 
it was recorded that an UFO

20
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,370
 was found in different regions, at the same time.

21
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,330
That very unidentified flying object

22
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,820
was what brought me to Joseon.

23
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,700
The name the humans gave my planet is

24
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,790
KMT 184.05

25
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,650
This planet's environment is very similar to Earth's.

26
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,810
I'm...

27
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,970
from there.

28
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,410
From the Joseon Dynasty until now,

29
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,550
when Hanyang became Seoul,
(Hanyang was the capital of Joseon),

30
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,380
I've lived here for over 400 years.

31
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,850
Thus, starting from the magnetic field to gravitational force, and even adapting to water,

32
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,250
I've fully acclimated to living on this planet, Earth.

33
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,370
My eyesight and hearing, as well as other senses, are
about 7 times better than people here.

34
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,490
Because of that ability, I can see things
 I don't want to see and

35
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,220
I can sometimes hear things that I don't want to hear.

36
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,330
There isn't any specific food that my body rejects,

37
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,770
but mixing with human blood or saliva is impossible

38
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,160
That's why I always eat alone.

39
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,640
Oh no! My bag!

40
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,360
What do I do?!   It's a purse snatcher!  What do I do?

41
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,170
- We're at the three-way intersection.  Yes, yes.
- My gosh!  My bag!

42
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,060
Oh, my!

43
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,630
You ask why I won't help?

44
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,990
It's because there is no point in getting
 involved in their lives.

45
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,800
Though I didn't ask for it, I came from 
another galaxy to Earth,

46
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,820
and lived for over 400 years. 
Whether I like it or not,

47
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,960
things that are meant to happen, will happen.

48
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,370
Earthlings call that...

49
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,750
'Fate.'

50
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,550
  Comet of this century; Brighter than the full Moon

51
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,070
 Visible from Earth after 3 months

52
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,260
A new fate is starting . . .

53
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,630
A comet that I've been expecting 
for 400 years is approaching Earth.

54
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,250
In three  months,

55
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,200
I can return to my planet.

56
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,280
 My Love  from The Star
Episode 1

57
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,720
Noona, here is your coffee.

58
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,770
-Mocha Latte? 
-Yes.

59
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,290
- You told me to buy that one. 
 - Move over.

60
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,070
- Here, you drink it. 
 - Huh?

61
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,930
Thank you, Unni.

62
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,250
Noona, I ran 200 meters to buy that.

63
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,950
Hey, don't you know how many calories
 are in a Mocha Latte?

64
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,140
I'm not going to jog for 2 hours just for that.

65
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,900
I knew you are so good at taking care of yourself.

66
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,260
Of course. You did well, right?

67
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,710
Of course!

68
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,950
I stayed to watch the end of the cleaning
 before leaving.

69
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,410
Noona?

70
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,910
What are you doing now?

71
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,670
Talking to my fans.

72
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,770
You're on SNS again?

73
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,080
What did you say this time?

74
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,280
 On a tiring afternoon, a sweet Mocha Latte is the best.

75
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,640
 I think I understand why Mun Ik Jeom smuggled 
mokhwa-ssi (cotton seeds-sounds like Mocha).

76
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
 Sir Mun Ik Jeom, thank you!

77
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,380
Noona,

78
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,740
What do you mean Mun Ik Jeom?

79
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,210
Don't you know that Mun Ik Jeom smuggled mokhwa ssi? (Cotton seeds: she confuses Mocha vs. Mokhwa)

80
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,430
You know he stole the cotton seed by secretly 
hiding it in the cap of his calligraphy brush.

81
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,220
So that the Chinese wouldn't know.

82
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,740
He's a very sly and skilled man.

83
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,100
It isn't Mocha, it's mokhwa-ssi!

84
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,420
 She said 'Mokhwa Latte'!

85
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,280
  'Total bonehead'

86
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,690
 Forwarding Tweet....

87
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,390
I told her not to tweet things like that so many times...

88
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,790
What were you doing? Huh?!

89
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,010
You should have stopped her!

90
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,400
Does she ever listen to me? 
I feel like dying too!

91
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,630
Has the article been taken down yet?

92
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,300
It almost was, but . . .

93
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,880
Number one in the search ranking is
 Mocha Mun Ik Jeom.  Number two is...

94
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,960
Mun Ik Jeom Cheon Song Yi...

95
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,110
How much of a bonehead do you have to be not to know
  the difference between mocha and mokhwa?

96
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,460
I bet Mun Ik Jeom never thought that in the future, he'd be ranked #1 most searched on the Internet for things like this, right?

97
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,680
This is a travesty that true ignorance begot!  A travesty!

98
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,020
I'm going mad...

99
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,070
Why would you summon a person who's
just finished filming? So tiring.

100
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,910
You're tired?

101
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,050
Hey... For someone who's tired, your skin is flawless.

102
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,190
This is a face that can shoot a makeup CF, right now.
 Isn't that so?

103
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,800
What is it? I want to go quickly and rest.

104
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,900
Right, I'll tell you quickly.

105
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,270
You heard about the mohkwa seed incident, right?

106
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,240
Is that something that can be a topic of interest?

107
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,800
That's what I'm saying.

108
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,180
Netizens are like that. 
Like they know everything!

109
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,000
I, too, only found out the difference between 
mocha and mokhwa today!

110
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,660
Right?

111
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,740
Of course!

112
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,120
They're so jealous that they have to nitpick 
everything and talk trash behind your back.

113
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,230
I know, that's the way people think.

114
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,020
That's right.

115
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,440
So don't interact with people like that.

116
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,410
Just don't go on any SNS anymore.

117
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,530
I don't want to.

118
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,310
Huh? Why?

119
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,860
Why don't you want to?

120
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,460
If I don't do even that, with whom do I converse?

121
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,390
With me! Me!

122
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,780
I'm even more put off.

123
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,000
Cheon Song Yi, this rascal. 
Because of this, the apartment CF shooting-

124
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,310
Ah, that's right. 
JK's President Park keeps calling.

125
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,200
Jin Kook? Why would he?

126
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,940
Who knows!

127
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,300
He's asking whether I'm going to renew 
my contract with you.

128
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,450
He says they've got investment from Japan and have
boatloads of money so would I consider joining them.

129
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,110
I heard you were BFF since the beginning?

130
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,210
Is that okay for him to do that?

131
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,040
Jin Kook, you jerk...

132
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,630
Ah, can I go?

133
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,160
Of course! Of course!

134
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,640
You're tired. Of course, you should.

135
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,930
We've unpacked all your stuff in the new house. 
I think you will like it.

136
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,820
Hey! Why aren't you chauffeuring her?

137
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,230
Did Cheon Song Yi say that because
 she really didn't know?

138
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,570
She's not trying to be funny?

139
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,200
The fact that she's ignorant is well known.

140
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,080
Ah, I almost forgot.  You all know that there's a Sahoe 
University dinner function for the lecturers tonight, right?

141
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,430
The Dean requests that we all be present.

142
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,710
Teacher Do Min Joon, you're attending today, right?

143
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,350
Teacher Do Min Joon?

144
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,010
There's a dinner tonight.  Why not go toge...

145
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,740
I can't go.

146
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,690
Aigoo.

147
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,470
It's been over a year since we started 
sharing the office.

148
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,290
Yet, we still haven't eaten together.

149
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,090
Teacher Do, do you even know my name?

150
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,510
You don't know?

151
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,040
Oh my! How can that be?

152
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,330
We see each other almost everyday.

153
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,100
Do you know my name?

154
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,940
Then, what about my name too?

155
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,760
I'll be going.

156
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,520
Noona, why don't you withdraw your membership?

157
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,000
I said I don't want to.

158
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,960
Hey, I have 20,000 friends on SNS.

159
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,580
What sort of friends are they?

160
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,490
They will turn into anti-fans at any moment.

161
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,440
And Noona, it hasn't even been a month 
since the garlic pizza incident.

162
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,740
 Everyone, strangely, from the garlic pizza,

163
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
 I can smell maneul.
(Maneul = garlic in Korean)

164
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,630
 Am I the only one who smells it?

165
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,860
So, for not knowing that garlic is maneul  (garlic),  
how much were you bashed?

166
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,560
All you have to do is not post.

167
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,060
Why do you keep posting nonsense and making things worse...

168
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,540
Right now, there are so many nasty comments.

169
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't care about those.

170
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,980
Noona, I'm going to tell you just one thing

171
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,170
as if I'm a soldier fighting for independence, okay?

172
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,190
A person, such as you, should not converse with fans.

173
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,510
The more you converse, the more they make fun of you.

174
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,480
It's better to remain mum,

175
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,000
so that you can maintain the mysterious imag-  Ouch!

176
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,310
Just drive.

177
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,180
Why are you getting out? Don't follow me.

178
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,350
You don't even know where your house is.

179
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,610
Why wouldn't I know?!  Just because I don't know maneul 
is garlic do you think I can't find my place?!

180
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,180
You said it was number 2301.

181
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,530
Even so, taking the elevator alone is a bit...

182
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,990
We will take you up to your place.

183
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,910
Forget it.

184
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,650
Unni!

185
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,440
Forget it! I'm going alone!

186
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,900
It's not . . . Your earrings . . .

187
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,890
They're from a sponsor.  So, you have to return them.

188
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,330
Done? I'm going.

189
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,780
Can we let her go alone?

190
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,930
Last time, she met a pervert on the elevator.

191
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,430
She threw a perfect fit.

192
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,880
Hey, do you remember how the pervert spent
 8 weeks in the hospital?

193
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,620
How hard must she have beaten him, 
with that studded purse; as if he were a rented mule.

194
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,010
He became such a mess...

195
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,790
Ah seriously,

196
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,650
that was the first time I felt sorry for a pervert.

197
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:03,940

198
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,560
Excuse me.

199
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,710
Why haven't you pressed?

200
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,880
Why haven't you pressed for the floor you want to go to?

201
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,600
That's right. I'm Cheon Song Yi.

202
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,660
Since when did you start following me?

203
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:54,090
How did you already discover my new house?

204
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,630
What should I do for you? An autograph?

205
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,430
Take a picture? Then, will you go?

206
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,040
You look young and I can understand that 
you're in your prime.

207
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,740
I understand. But, go and study.

208
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,640
Or, at least do some exercise to release your energy.

209
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,310
If you followed me all the way here
 to do something weird,

210
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,210
then, you're mistaken.

211
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,630
I haven't experienced this just once or twice-

212
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,370
That perverted bastard.

213
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,440
Hey! Are you disrespecting me right now?

214
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,210
Hey! Where do you think you're

215
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,590
go...ing? Ah,

216
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,360
so you were going next door...

217
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,210
Ah, you must live there.

218
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,810
I moved into number 2301, today.

219
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,120
You're surprised, right?

220
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,580
Don't you recognize me?

221
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,880
You don't know? Me?

222
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,070
Should I know?

223
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,270
No, it's not like that.

224
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,550
But, why are you looking at me like that?

225
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,900
I'm about to press my password.

226
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,790
Sorry. Sorry.

227
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,270
Ah, that little brat. 
What does he see me as?

228
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,300
Does he really not know me?

229
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,160
How can he not know?

230
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,030
Is he from North Korea?

231
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,200
Is he an alien?

232
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,170
There's not a single person in South Korea
 who doesn't know  Cheon Song Yi.

233
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,230
These days, everyone's called 
the nation's actor or singer.

234
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,920
But, you can't give that title so carelessly.

235
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,420
The entire nation has to know the person, 
in order to be called the nation's actor.

236
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,180
Just having one or two hit dramas

237
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,070
and calling them the nation's actor makes me laugh.

238
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,460
That's right. 
They have to be on Cheon Song Yi's level,

239
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,020
to qualify to hear that title.

240
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,880
Anyway, even though all our kids started out as child actors at the same time,

241
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,680
the only ones remaining in the industry
 are Song Yi and Sae Mi.

242
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,870
I heard that Song Yi's doing a new drama?

243
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,030
Yeah. Director Bong Jun Ho kept asking 
her to do a film with him.

244
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,700
But this is a drama she chose over that movie.

245
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,120
It has to do well.

246
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,010
Sae Mi is also doing the same drama.

247
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,480
I didn't see the article.

248
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,130
Oh, well...

249
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,770
Her role is something like my daughter's friend.

250
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,780
Articles only talk about the main character.

251
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,130
Oh yeah, are you not going to the 
new house Song Yi moved into?

252
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,330
Uhm?

253
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,670
Moved?

254
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,840
Oh my, Unni. 
By chance, you didn't know?

255
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,100
That your daughter moved?

256
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,540
Why wouldn't I know?

257
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,760
I know that she moved.

258
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,740
I was going to go over. But my daughter 
told me not to trouble myself.

259
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,190
Where did she move to?

260
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,900
What?

261
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,700
Just... Seocho-dong-

262
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,490
I heard she moved into the Golden Palace (apartment),
 in Daechi-dong?

263
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,180
Yeah! I know! Daechi-dong.

264
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,030
It was a slip of the tongue.

265
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,450
Wait.

266
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,180
Unni, get in. I will give you a ride.

267
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,480
No, thanks.

268
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,550
If you could, try to learn how to drive.

269
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,600
Or ask your "Korea's sweetheart" daughter for a chauffeur or something.

270
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,970
Why are you like this, all pathetic?

271
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,430
Song Yi always tells me to use a driver.

272
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,760
But it's bothersome and all too much. 
So I've been telling her I don't want one.

273
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,970
You know, streets are full of taxis.

274
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,140
Okay, then. 
You should watch out at night. Take care.

275
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,940
Yeah, alright. Bye!

276
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,160
Having been cut off after being caught 
ripping off her daughter . . .

277
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,680
Who does she think she is, trying to show off?

278
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,730
Hey, if your daughter is a supporting actress, 
 so are you.

279
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,500
How dare you act all elegant in front of the main character.

280
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:28,360
That girl. She should've told me if she was moving.

281
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,060
"She has neither common knowledge
 nor common sense"?

282
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,610
This, this, this... Just looking at the ID (account), 
this person is totally an elementary student.

283
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,690
"Did you inject Botox into your brain?"

284
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,380
"Your brain won't even have brain wrinkles (folds)."

285
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,050
Do elementary schoolers get lessons on how to 
write malicious comments these days?

286
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,870
Do they go to an academy as a group or something?

287
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,480
- Hello. 
 - This girl, you..!!

288
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,860
Do you really have to humiliate your mom like that?

289
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,390
 Do I have to find out, from Se Mi's mom, 
that my daughter have moved out?

290
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,800
You told me not to call you ever.

291
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,660
You said you want to end the mother-daughter relationship!

292
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,600
 Hey, girl! That was...

293
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,220
Since when did you start listening to me?

294
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,210
 I listened to you from a long time ago.

295
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,410
 Since the time you asked for money to open up 
a ridiculous French restaurant,

296
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,430
 and since you asked me for money to open
 a specialty shop with imported clothes.

297
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,740
This girl... That was a really long time ago.

298
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,800
 Should I talk about something recent? 
You blew money on some diet center.

299
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,230
 Or wasting money by investing in a doughnut shop?

300
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,270
Hey, girl. They don't even cost that much in total!

301
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,990
 You ... look into a mirror.

302
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,370
Your face and your body.  
Who gave you that million dollar beauty?

303
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,880
 Let's say if you didn't have a mom like me...

304
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,750
Do you think it's possible for you to have that beauty without getting any surgery?

305
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,450
To put it bluntly, you suck at acting.

306
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,390
 That you are making money from doing 
TV dramas and commercials...

307
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,570
It's only possible because you are pretty like me,
 not because you are a good actress, you know!

308
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,040
You should know that,  girl.

309
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,060
I look like Dad, don't you know?

310
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,930
 Oh my, look at this girl!

311
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:28,330
 What do you mean you look like your dad? 
Everyone knows that he's not good-looking!

312
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:33,120
Ah, right. You married Dad because of his money, 
not because of his looks.

313
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,930
And when he became broke, you dumped him.

314
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,840
Hey! What do you know?
 What do you know?

315
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,790
I'm like my dad.  So, I really really hate you 
for being like that.

316
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,610
So don't talk about Dad with that mouth!

317
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,570
I don't have enough living expenses. 
Send me another $5000.

318
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,810
 How nice it would be if you had your money 
automatically transferred to my account?!!

319
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:59,890
And give Yoon Jae a call.
 He hasn't come home for two days.

320
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,360
Ah, but Cheon Yoon Jae, this crazy punk... 
He ran away from home again?

321
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,460
 Cheon Song Yi

322
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,010
Hey, look at this.

323
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,200
Hey, Yoon Jae. Look at this, look.

324
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,860
It looks real, doesn't it?

325
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,220
Should I make it a nude next time?

326
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,160
Hey, what's with you?

327
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,690
Delete this right now. By the time I get back
 from the restroom.

328
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,450
Alright.

329
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,890
What's up with him?

330
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,700
Does he like Cheon Song Yi?

331
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:11,400

332
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:39,680
 That I'm a cruel! Ho! Woman! Ho! 
Don't swear at me!

333
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:45,330
I'd rather have you hate me.

334
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,250
Stop right now. 
Don't show me your lingering affection~

335
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:00,470
Ho! Don't ever look for me again!

336
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,080
You're more cruel.

337
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,850
I should swear at you.

338
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:28,300
Alwaaaaaaaaaaaaaays!

339
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,280
What brings you here?

340
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,390
I was wondering if you knew what time it is right now.

341
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,160
Right now?

342
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,920
What time is it? Is it little over 10 o'clock?

343
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,000
This late at night, it's common sense not to sing,
 even if you sing well.

344
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,920
You heard?

345
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,890
I moved here because I heard this building has great soundproof construction. Sorry, anyway.

346
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:08,860
When someone sings terribly, we should view it
 as making noise, rather than as singing.

347
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,480
- What? 
- Making noise which disturbs the neighborhood is actually considered a crime.

348
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,270
If I report it to the police, you could get fined too.

349
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,790
So are you saying you're going to report me 
to the police right now?

350
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,670
Because I sang a little? Between neighbors?

351
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,170
I didn't mean to report it to the police. 
If we look at it with common sense-

352
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:26,150
So you are saying I lack common sense, aren't you?

353
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,230
That's not it- 
- You're saying I don't have common knowledge 
or common sense

354
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,770
right now. No common sense. No brain. Botox.

355
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,890
Did you inject botox into your brain? 
Your brain probably doesn't even have folds.

356
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,240
You are saying that right now!

357
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:47,100
Even though I only had an apple and half slice of a cabbage all day because I'm on a diet, I'm really full.

358
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,390
Because I was served heaping spoonfuls of criticism!

359
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:56,190
I had no idea that I'd be served even more criticism, by the spoonful, in the middle of the night because I sang a little.

360
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,060
Can't I sing a little?

361
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,440
I was served so much criticism all day from people?

362
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,840
Then where do I release my stress?

363
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,960
An apple and half of a cabbage leaf, ALL DAY!

364
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,820
Forget it. You don't need to apologize.

365
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,670
I don't feel like talking to you anymore.

366
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,400
What did I do so wrong?

367
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,170
Do you guys know everything?

368
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,980
Are you that smart?

369
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,140
You said I'm the most beautiful.

370
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,290
You said you like me the most...

371
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,870
How can they

372
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,890
chew up a person like they would chew gum?
(Chew up: Korean expression for slander or trash-talking)

373
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,410
Ah, really. Those disloyal people!

374
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,740
 Dec. 18, 2013
 Record of last 3 months on Earth.

375
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,200
This is going too far.

376
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,980
Our Se Mi, they said have her on stand-by at 5AM.

377
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,320
So she woke up at 2AM, did her hair and make up by 3AM,

378
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,010
and came here at 4:30AM.

379
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,220
But it's 9AM now.

380
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,970
But then the director said he's not ready to film yet.

381
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,280
So what should I do?

382
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,030
Just because she's not a main character,
is it alright to do this?

383
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,340
To speak bluntly, would you tell Cheon Song Yi to be on stand-by at 5AM,

384
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,160
then delay the shooting?

385
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,410
Ah. Why are you bringing up Cheon Song Yi here?

386
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,820
Our Se Mi, she only filmed three scenes yesterday.

387
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,610
But after shooting the first scene in the morning,

388
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,360
she shot the second scene at 5PM.

389
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,090
Then, at midnight, she shot the last scene.

390
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,220
You scheduled 20 scenes for Cheon Song Yi 
within 7 hours.

391
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,490
Ah, then she should be become 
the main character or something!

392
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,470
If you don't like it, why don't you give up everything?

393
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,530
What?

394
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,460
Stop already, Chief Moon.

395
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,610
I'm sorry, Assistant Director.

396
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,990
Chief Moon is a little sensitive today.

397
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:26,260
Ah. Am I the neighborhood whipping boy? 
Irritating someone by calling out a busy person.

398
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,410
I.. Seriously. I feel like crap. Seriously.

399
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,490
You know that this isn't the first or second time 
this has happened. Just leave them be.

400
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,690
Cheon Song Yi is scheduled at 8 for her standby. 
Why hasn't she shown up yet?

401
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,050
Song Yi will be late today.

402
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,850
She might not even come at all.

403
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,260
Why?

404
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,500
You didn't see the news?

405
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:50,350
Every time college admissions are announced, 
we hear about celebrities getting special enrollment.

406
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:54,690
But celebrities, even in school, 
are stars rather than students.

407
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,270
 From an anonymous informant, 
we heard that the actress Cheon Song Yi

408
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,640
 hasn't been attending class for the past few months.

409
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,200
 We personally visited the school.

410
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,320
An anonymous informant?

411
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,180
What kind of a bastard did this?

412
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,130
That's not the important thing right now. 
 - I saw her yesterday.

413
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,490
 From where?
- On TV.

414
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,420
 She always appears on commercials.

415
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,690
 Then, did you see her at school?

416
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,700
 I've never seen her at school.
Kim Hyeon Wook, (age 23), Student

417
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,180
 Didn't she graduate?

418
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,800
I'm busy with the shooting. How can I go to school?

419
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,810
It's not fair, is it?

420
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,120
 The agency said the reason she didn't attend
 the classes was

421
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,410
 because of her busy schedule.

422
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,740
That's right. 
 - But

423
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,350
 this afternoon, when Ms. Cheon Song Yi was so busy that she couldn't go to school, SBC In-depth Coverage found

424
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,940
 a picture of her leisurely enjoying coffee uploaded on her SNS. Busy schedule as an excuse for lack of attendance.

425
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,660
 It doesn't seem like she has been following a busy schedule.

426
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,890
 How much longer will we overlook the awkward situation

427
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,170
 of using the status as an entertainer to enroll

428
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,760
 but not fulfilling a student's responsibility?

429
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,570
 This has been SBC news, Ha Jang Woo.

430
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,290
Song Yi, for the time being, don't read

431
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,100
comments online.

432
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,590
I've already asked for  Director Park's understanding.

433
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,500
For a while,  we will shoot your scenes at night
 or on the weekends all at once.

434
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,330
Today . . .

435
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,770
Let's go to school, Song Yi.

436
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,670
Doing that right away just because it was on the news,

437
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,440
it's cheesy and obvious.

438
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,160
Naturally.

439
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,930
if you go to school right after it was on the news,

440
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,240
you could get criticized for being cheesy and obvious.

441
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,660
But if you don't go,

442
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,390
they will criticize you for not even listening to a problem which was singled out.

443
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,710
And, you could even become branded 
as the "offensive" one.

444
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,300
Let's go

445
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,330
to school.

446
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,580
Isn't it the time for Hui Kyeong to arrive?

447
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,870
He probably arrived already.

448
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,370
I told him to finish school, then come.

449
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,090
He's been chasing after girls.

450
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,780
That pathetic buster.

451
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,170
How are you progressing on securing 
the land for the shopping mall?

452
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,730
Is that 31 pyeong (aprx 1150 square feet) punk,
who is firmly entrenched, refusing to leave?

453
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,730
Yes.

454
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,850
We're trying to persuade him, but it's not easy.

455
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:06,160
This needs be solved before the 
shareholders' general meeting.

456
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,960
I think it will be resolved.

457
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,110
- How? 
- The owner of that 31 pyeong unit

458
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,830
died a little while ago.

459
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,000
What?

460
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,010
I guess he dozed off at the wheel

461
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,980
and bumped the guard rail.

462
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,450
Is that right? That's really...

463
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,440
A person has died.

464
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,690
If I get happy about it, I think I will be punished.
However, ...

465
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,340
Did the work just get easier?

466
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,290
Of course. That person's son

467
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,130
wanted to sell it since he needed the money.

468
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,560
Really.

469
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,520
- Congratulation, Father. 
 - To Hui Kyeong,

470
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,170
make a call. Tell him that we should 
have a dinner together.

471
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,230
Yes.

472
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,650
Aigoo, I'm sorry. I would like to, but...

473
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,520
You know that I'm more for the girl than the family.

474
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,160
Ah. She probably is really pissed off.

475
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,120
I have to go and comfort her.

476
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,310
- Thank you for your efforts. 
- Good bye.

477
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,880
Please be careful going down the step.

478
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,090
- Hyung. 
- Cheon Song Yi.

479
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,780
Wow. You got prettier.

480
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,700
You'll become a real goddess
 with the way things are going.

481
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,390
When did you get here?

482
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,990
Thirty minutes ago.

483
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,760
It's been 6 months. You're not happy to see me?

484
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,650
I don't have time to be happy seeing you.

485
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,910
I heard you're going to school. I'll take you. Get in.

486
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,860
You seem to be in a good mood.

487
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,180
It's better for you.

488
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,890
Take this time to reduce your schedule.

489
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,640
You go to school consistently and graduate. 
After that, let's get married next year.

490
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,380
Can you stop in front of that taxi?

491
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,700
Why are you doing this again? 
You're never going to get married?

492
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,460
- Who said I will never get married?
- So then, you'll marry.

493
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,350
- I will, probably. 
- If you're going to, it would be better if you marry me.

494
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,130
And, if you're going to marry me,
 it would be better to do it early.

495
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,980
I'll get married someday, but it won't be next year.

496
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,800
- Why? 
- Because if I get married, I wouldn't  get scripts for melodramas.

497
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,510
They'll make me do old lady dramas.

498
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,820
No. No. Because you're pretty,

499
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,920
even after you get married, you can do the melo, romantic comedy. You can do everything.

500
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,330
If you can't get cast, I'll ask my father and
 I'll pay for the production cost.

501
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,550
I don't do romantic comedy or things like that.

502
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,990
I'm going to do passionate melodramas.

503
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,400
- Passionate? 
- Yeah. Is there something you don't like about passionate melo?

504
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,430
What do you mean I don't like it?

505
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,790
If you talk about melo, it's definitely the passionate melo.

506
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,610
- Who would like a lukewarm melodrama? 
- There will be kiss scenes, bed scenes, and everything.

507
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,030
Hey. I understand everything.

508
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,490
Don't you know I was born in the States?

509
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,130
My thinking itself is American-style. Meaning it's open.

510
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,530
I'm not a person who can't differentiate 
between acting and reality.

511
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,860
I don't care if you understand or not.

512
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,210
I just need my future husband to understand.

513
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,860
That's me.

514
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,900
I've told you thousands of times, since I was 
in second year of middle school, until now.

515
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,200
I'm not saying this in English which you don't like.

516
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,010
So please understand what I'm saying to you.

517
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,030
 Cheon Song Yi is here!

518
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,780
 It's her!  Cheon Song Yi!

519
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,040
 ♪ She may be the beauty or the beast.

520
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:39,130
 ♪ May be the famine or the feast. 
 May turn each day into a heaven or a hell.

521
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:47,470
 ♪ She may be the mirror of my dreams. 
 The smile reflected in a stream.

522
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,890
 ♪ She may be what she may seem

523
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,530
 ♪ inside her shell.

524
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,880
 ♪ She.

525
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,630
I'm sorry. Please don't take the picture.

526
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,070
Put away the cell phones. Hey, I said no pictures.

527
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,900
I want to be that book.

528
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,300
Me, that chair.

529
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,900
Me, that hair.

530
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,340
She did her nose, right?

531
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,910
- Yeah, totally. 
- Does it make sense that that nose is natural?

532
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,070
- She probably did it secretly. 
- How can one be born with that face?

533
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,470
Who wouldn't look at least that good 
after the nose job and a jaw re-shaping work?

534
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,700
If you did it, you'd be even prettier.

535
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,420
You guys should get surgery, so we can battle.

536
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,630
Noona, stay calm.

537
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,480
You came here for self-reflection.

538
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,400
Damn. Why isn't the class starting? If it starts soon, it ends soon.

539
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,840
-Hello. -Hello.

540
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,680
That young dude from next door...
 Why is he here?

541
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,940
Noona, do you know him?

542
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,170
Oh... yes. I know.

543
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,560
He lives next door.

544
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,590
Really. That's good.

545
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,130
This is not a class for the theater and film major. 
This class is really difficult.

546
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,510
You got an 'F' in this class, 
so you have to retake this course.

547
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,980
What?

548
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,890
You didn't make any mistakes toward 
your neighbor professor, did you?

549
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,940
I mean, you just moved in yesterday.

550
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,760
You wouldn't have had time to spare for that.

551
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,910
I had. I had time to spare for that.

552
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,020
 Taking a good look at you, I can tell that you look young 
and this is your prime.

553
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,880
 Go study something.  Or release your energy by working out.

554
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,900
Why?

555
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,440
 So are you saying that you're going to report me to the police right now?

556
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,690
 Did you inject botox into your brain? 
Your brain must have no folds.

557
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,980
 That's what you're saying right now!

558
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,830
In the world of the golden fly,

559
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,580
during copulation,

560
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,820
the female eats the male.

561
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,610
Male flies started to think that

562
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:02,870
they don't want to be eaten by females, 
even though they want to copulate.

563
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:06,250
In other words, it wants to have Eros (sexual life)
 without Thanatos (death),

564
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,470
to enjoy its life.

565
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:15,260
So, the male golden flies found one strategy.

566
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,420
They started to bring a piece of food as a gift.

567
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,270
When female flies get hungry, during copulation,

568
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,750
they would eat the food (insect) that the male fly brought.

569
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,160
So, the males could copulate without any risks.

570
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,380
Then, more evolved males started to use their brains.

571
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,040
They started to wrap the insect inside a transparent cocoon,

572
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,020
and gave it to females.

573
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,550
Because females have to unwrap it, 
they were able to earn even more time.

574
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,790
Since they thought that their method worked,

575
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,100
those evil males

576
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,850
started to bring a thick layered,

577
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:55,940
hollow one, that's just big in size.

578
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,770
Even if the females discovered that they were tricked,

579
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:01,070
the business would already be over.

580
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,970
Those females that were tricked several times

581
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,240
start to check the content of the gift by shaking.

582
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,650
But those evolved male flies, in preparation,

583
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,330
put their own poop inside.

584
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,720
Because their weights (food vs. poop) are similar.

585
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,080
Professor,

586
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,330
I mean...

587
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,080
You look so young, so I couldn't even imagine.

588
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,690
I was so surprised!

589
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,410
I'm happy to meet you.

590
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,190
Happy?

591
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,560
Of course, I'm happy.

592
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,320
Perhaps, because of last night...

593
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,560
You were shocked, right?

594
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,230
So was I.

595
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:11,320
I get bipolar sometimes. 
I guess yesterday was a period of depression.

596
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,470
It's like the flu to some people.

597
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,080
What is it that you want to say?

598
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,450
The assignment that you handed out earlier...

599
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:26,200
- The amount of work seems a bit much. 
- So?

600
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,640
What do you think is the reason that 
Asia became more unified?

601
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,150
I think it's because of Hallyu.

602
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,320
Culture brought us together.

603
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,040
And in the middle of it all is me-

604
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,690
Well... you see...

605
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,510
I'll just tell you straight up.

606
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,820
Because of filming, I'm so busy, 
but yesterday there was an article.

607
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,170
So I couldn't do anything else except come to school.

608
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,310
Writing this essay is going to be hard for me.

609
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,450
So what I'm saying is, please help me.

610
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,860
Do me a favor.

611
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,560
I know our first impression wasn't so great.

612
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,370
But what kind of fate is this?

613
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:15,660
I move, you're my neighbor. 
 I come to school, you're my professor!

614
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,400
You never know about fate.

615
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,310
If you help me just this time, 
there'll be a time when I'll definitely pay you back!

616
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,310
Isn't this how people live anyway?

617
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,610
Why?

618
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:37,620
That isn't the way people live.

619
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,330
What?

620
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,470
If I help you once,

621
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,750
twice,

622
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,690
thrice,

623
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,900
continuously asking for help and ingratiating yourself

624
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,340
That is the way people live.

625
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:59,350
And, paying me back whenever,

626
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,770
won't happen.

627
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,800
Life isn't long enough

628
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,600
for people to mature.

629
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,780
That bastard...

630
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,290
Did he just lower the level of language he uses with me?

631
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:33,580
That little... Does being a lecturer mean everything? By the looks of it, he's definitely younger than me.

632
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:38,080

633
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,950
Still, not knowing the actress 
Cheon Song Yi was just too much.

634
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,410
Even I know her.

635
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:45,460
I don't really know celebrities of these days.

636
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,560
They don't have any sense of
 refinement and they're just loud.

637
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,610
Maybe not with other things, but singers
 back then were much better.

638
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:54,180
Old songs are better, too.
 (Editor's note: He was in a famous band in the 70s.)

639
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,270
If we're talking about songs, then it's Bae Ho.

640
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,530
Of course, there's no singer that can follow Bae Ho.

641
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,560
And dramas, too.

642
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,810
I don't even watch the recent ones, so I don't even know.

643
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,950
But just hearing about it, I'm not even sure 
why they watch it.

644
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:07,220
Are those fun?

645
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,240
Old dramas were more fun, too.

646
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,670
Like 'Miss' or 'Passion.'

647
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,660
Ah yes, those were precious.

648
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:20,240
Is the new attorney's office that you've set up going well?

649
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,620
Well, it's mostly pro bono work.

650
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,930
Three months from now,

651
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,930
I'm going to need

652
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,500
you to write me another death certificate.

653
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,970
Ah, is that so?

654
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,870
It was normally something you did every  ten years.

655
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:37,480
It's only been two years so far.

656
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,080
Is there some sort of problem?

657
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,930
With your skills,

658
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,650
would there ever be a problem?

659
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,350
This time

660
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:48,190
will be the last death certificate, I think.

661
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,330
What?

662
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:56,600
Three months from now, I'm going back

663
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,700
to the place I originally came from.

664
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:04,290
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

665
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,640
It's so sudden.

666
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,820
You were my only friend, Lawyer Jang.

667
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:32,830
Then, this time, have you settled down for good?

668
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,710
Well, I can't even study anyway,

669
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,290
so it's waste of foreign currency to just stay aboard.

670
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:40,310
That's right, it's the right age for you to
 start thinking about the country.

671
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,240
With that in mind,

672
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,840
Se Mi.

673
00:47:59,170 --> 00:47:59,840
Yes?

674
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,020
Please stand as a witness.

675
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,150
I'm proposing.

676
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,340
If I've waited 15 years,

677
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,910
didn't I wait very long?

678
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,700
You remember this picture, right?

679
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:35,070
You really hated taking pictures, so 
this is the only one I have left.

680
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,950
I'm the only one who aged.  You are the same.

681
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:45,270
You look exactly as you did 30 years ago. 
Young and handsome.

682
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:48,090
I...

683
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:51,860
The reason I was afraid to make friends, was this.

684
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,490
People age quickly

685
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,700
and die quickly.

686
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,110
Only I'm left behind.

687
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:03,500
In the exact same...

688
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,770
Young

689
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,220
and in a handsome state.

690
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,360
Live a long life, even if I'm not here.

691
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:24,440
But, there's something I've always been curious about.

692
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,190
When you first came here,

693
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,380
why couldn't you return immediately?

694
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,410
There was an accident.

695
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:40,910
Because of that accident, I couldn't go back

696
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,200
and a child had to die.

697
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:49,090
What child?

698
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,500
A child who gave me

699
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,920
a present for the first time.

700
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,670
 It's a present.

701
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,060
 I drew it myself.

702
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,600
 The thing you rode when you arrived,

703
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,690
 it was floating up in the sky.

704
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:18,810
 Like the moon.

705
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:25,160
 But...

706
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,400
 Lord...

707
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,720
 Are you truly the Grim Reaper?

708
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:42,370

709
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:46,050
However,

710
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,700
there was something strange that occurred.

711
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,320
Yes? What...

712
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:54,150
Twelve years ago, in the winter...

713
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:58,230
It was the day before Christmas.

714
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:03,560
At that time I was working at a hospital
 in Gyeonggido as a general surgeon.

715
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:25,060
It happened for the first time.

716
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:30,090
Just like the girl you met 400 years ago,

717
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,120
she had the exact same face as her?

718
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,740
Yes.

719
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,310
And?

720
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,170
Did you go to the place where you saw her?

721
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,760
Hui Kyeong.

722
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,360
During our second year of middle school,
 on Christmas Eve...

723
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,700
You gave me a ring as a present.

724
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,370
Yes. You didn't accept it.

725
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,610
I'm not going to accept it today either.

726
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,180
I'm sorry.

727
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:17,990
It's not the first time.
 Now I'm not even hurt by it.

728
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,120
But...

729
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,980
let me hear the reason.
What's the reason?

730
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,070
The reason it can't

731
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,930
be me.

732
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:37,750
Do you remember that person's face?

733
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,360
Who?

734
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,900
 Song Yi, Merry Christmas!

735
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,720
 Why did you come here again? It's annoying!

736
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,780
 Move!

737
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,530
 Song Yi!

738
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:10,240
 Seongbook Street

739
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,630
 Song Yi! Cheon Song Yi!

740
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,910
  Don't come any closer! Leave me alone!

741
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,830
 Songjin Transport

742
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,310
 Cheon Song Yi...

743
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,880
 Song Yi!

744
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,030
Don't you remember?

745
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:05,560
I couldn't even see him properly.

746
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,680
Even if I did see him, how am I supposed
 remember when it was such a long time ago?

747
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,590
I saw.

748
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,000
I definitely saw him, but I don't remember.

749
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,530
Why do you care so much?

750
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:18,760
Song Yi said that he was her first love.

751
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,910
Hey, did she talk with that man or 
stay with him for a few hours?

752
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:24,690
Just for a couple of seconds!

753
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:28,450
How can a person whose face she
 doesn't remember be her first love?

754
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:31,770
Saying that he's my first love is a bit of an exaggeration.

755
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:36,120
I'm just saying that I just want to meet him again someday.

756
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,190
To say that I'm thankful to him for saving me.

757
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,290
To ask why he saved me.

758
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,690
I just want to ask once.

759
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,050
That's all.

760
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,700
That night,

761
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,440
I went there.

762
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,060
 Seongbook Street

763
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,330
 Cheon Song Yi! Cheon Song Yi!

764
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:12,790
 Don't follow me! Leave me alone!

765
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,530
 Songjin Transport

766
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,450
 Ahjusshi, who are you?

767
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,500
 Are you a ghost?

768
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,280
 Or...

769
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,460
 Something like the Grim Reaper?

770
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,700
 What happened that night,

771
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:46,070
 was it a dream?

772
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,530
 A person who looked so much alike...

773
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,640
 Would they really exist?

774
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,440
If, by chance, it wasn't a dream, 
before I Ieave,

775
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:07,070
I want to meet her again.

776
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,410
It probably won't happen.

777
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:43,470

778
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:49,410
 ~ Preview ~
What special?

779
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:54,580
 -A Cheon Song YI special.
-At school, I'm not a star, just an ordinary student.

780
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:58,380
 Cheon Song Yi, you plagiarized; copied and pasted. 
You did everything wrong.

781
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,390
 You get a zero.

782
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:00,470
 How old are you?

783
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:01,560
 Do I have to answer?

784
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,560
 Cheon Song Yi is a human too, 
can't I make mistakes?

785
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,800
 Bad bastard.

786
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,110
 The child that you met ten years ago, 
I'm looking for her.

787
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,200
 If there were a reason to meet, wouldn't we meet?

788
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,570
 Open...sesame!

789
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:19,980
 Teacher Do!

790
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,390
 What?

791
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:23,130
 That little jerk...

792
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:26,020
 Because he is standing at the podium as a professor at such a young age  he is so full of himself.

793
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,320
 So what if he is genius or went to Harvard?

794
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,990
 He has no social skills.

795
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:33,130
 It's because he hasn't returned
 from serving in the military.

796
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:36,100
 For disrespectful jerks like him, 
the military is the best place.

797
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,190
 Just kick him into the military first.

798
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:41,870
 Then, he'll come to his senses after being scraped and tossed around for about two years.

799
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:43,820
 All men are like that.

800
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:49,310
 Did you see a person who went to the army back then?

801
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,760
 Instead of bulletproof vests, 
there were cotton-padded clothes.

802
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:56,020
 We wore 29 layers of clothing to 
protect ourselves from bullets.

803
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:59,720
 With the liberation of Korea I thought 
it would become easier.

804
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:04,040
 But as the civil war came along, the country was divided.

805
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,020
 There isn't a place, army, navy, or air force, that I haven't been to since then.

806
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,420
 Every ten years I change my identity,

807
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,760
and I have to re-enlist each time.

808
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:16,070
 They seem to go on and on about
 how Psy went to the military twice.

809
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:20,860
 But starting from the Joseon Dynasty, all 
together, I've been to the military 24 times.

810
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:25,810
 While living on this Earth for 400 years, the time I'd spent in the military alone was 49 years and 7 months.

811
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:27,330
 Can you believe that?

812
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,560
 He needs to be sent to the marines!

813
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,900
 They'll fix him up in the marines.
