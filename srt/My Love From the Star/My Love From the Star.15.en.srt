00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,470
Dad?

3
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,930
Where have you been?

4
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,010
Where were you?

5
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,840
My daughter. I’m so sorry.

6
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,010
It’s been 12 years.

7
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,350
I’m a grown-up now.

8
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,020
Where were you?

9
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,920
Where?

10
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,390
Sorry, my baby girl. I’m so sorry.

11
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,800
How can you do that to me?

12
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,780
You’ve become so old.

13
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,010
How come?

14
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,200
Cheers.

15
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,170
Cheers.

16
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,270
You can’t drink alcohol.

17
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,840
Just a little bit.

18
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,340
No way.

19
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,450
When it’s snowy, you would buy fried chicken,

20
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,750
and said when I would be old enough

21
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,079
to drink alcohol with you.

22
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,750
Now I can even drink a whole barrel!

23
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,760
Absurd. You naughty.

24
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,520
I mean I’ve grown up.

25
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,400
Do you miss me in the past 12 years?

26
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,329
I’m glad that you made a name of yourself.

27
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,400
I’m so glad about that.

28
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,970
Because I can see you

29
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,210
on TV, newspapers and movies.

30
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,880
How old is she now?

31
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,850
How does she look?

32
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,680
I can see you every day.

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,150
What about me?

34
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,290
I can’t see you.

35
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:10,430
I don’t even know if you’re still alive.

36
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,860
My former manager’s dad

37
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,700
was so sick that he depended on

38
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,670
a breathing machine in hospital for years.

39
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,910
I even envy that.

40
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,780
As long as you’re alive and with me,

41
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,620
I just want you to be with me.

42
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,820
I mean it.

43
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,420
Do you ever hate me?

44
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,360
You don’t know me?

45
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,960
I’ll regret it every time I get angry.

46
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,870
I ran out that day and nearly had an accident.

47
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,010
I was thinking that I need to tell you this.

48
00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:00,610
A man saved me from an accident.
I wanted to tell you…

49
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,320
But you were gone when I was back.

50
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,960
I’m sorry.

51
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,160
Enough.

52
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,630
Thank you for not leaving me alone

53
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,160
after the surgery.

54
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:26,270
The grudge I’ve been holding
for 12 years is gone.

55
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,380
But dad, do you have a new family?

56
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,750
Do I have siblings?

57
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,220
Nonsense!

58
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,030
What?

59
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,730
You never dated anyone?

60
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,400
And you? Do you have a boyfriend?

61
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,570
No.

62
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,840
I don’t have one.

63
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,540
It’s true!

64
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,550
I’m like my mom, who’s picky about men.

65
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,820
I haven’t met a man who’s as good as you are.

66
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,020
You silly! Never do that!

67
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,260
A guy like me will be a disaster.

68
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,790
Really?

69
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:27,870
Right. If he leaves me alone like you did,

70
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:34,310
I would be so upset.

71
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,440
But it’s over.

72
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,110
He will never like me back.

73
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,380
What?

74
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,990
I don’t know who he is.

75
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,520
But you’ll be loved by someone.

76
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,560
No one knows you better than I do.

77
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,860
That guy must like you so much.

78
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,930
Stop talking about it. You know nothing.

79
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,470
I find that

80
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,570
it’s not easy to be liked back

81
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,440
by the one I like.

82
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:16,450
If so, that’s miracle.

[My Love from the Star Record 15]

85
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,700
Stop it.

86
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:19,240
I’m sure there must be a secret way out.

87
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,110
Not the door?

88
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,690
The wall, either.

89
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,270
Mr. Do… Do Min-joon?

90
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:47,640
You had some emergency, right?

91
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,080
I’m sorry about that.

92
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,380
I need to make it clear this time.

93
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,520
Okay. Go ahead.

94
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,860
But what I am telling you is totally different.

95
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,660
Maybe even unbelievable.

96
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,300
Can we talk at somewhere without CCTV?

97
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,500
Why?

98
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,540
What have we heard?

99
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,690
That day, I did go to the cruise.

100
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,990
Why were you filmed
by the CCTV at the apartment?

101
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,660
Because...

102
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,700
I can do teleportation.

103
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,740
Dude. Are you kidding with the civil servants?

104
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,780
Cut it out.

105
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,450
Please go on.

106
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:06,750
I think I need to tell you who I really am

107
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,760
or you’ll never believe what I’m going to say.

108
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,090
The reason I can’t make public

109
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,930
is the secret I have to keep.

110
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,640
I heard what the murderer
who killed Han Yoo-ra said.

111
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,880
I don’t know what it meant at that time.

112
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,410
But later I found that it’s related to that case.

113
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,850
Who’s that guy?

114
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,920
Director of S&C Group, Lee Jae-kyung.

115
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,260
Do you have evidence?

116
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,140
Miss Han Yoo-ra’s USB has the video of them.

117
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,680
But that USB prevents any replication.

118
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,950
And this one has reshot the video.

119
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,050
Does it have the decisive evidence
of Han Yoo-ra’s case?

120
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,720
Not exactly.

121
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,690
But it has the proof that they were dating.

122
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,960
Han Yoo-ra knows Lee Jea-kyung’s weakness.

123
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,430
She took it to force him to get married.

124
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,200
Please dig into it with this USB.

125
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,870
As long as you believe me,

126
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,240
I’ll provide my best help in the coming month.

127
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,620
Do you buy it? Teleportation?

128
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,830
What nonsense.

129
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,460
Do you buy it?

130
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,430
I think you were quite calm.

131
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,240
I’m not sure.

132
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,870
But what I can be sure of

133
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,240
is that Do Min-joon is not a common person

134
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,650
This is freaking me out.

135
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:19,650
I don’t buy it in my mind, but I somewhat

136
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,590
believe it in my heart.

137
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:26,120
Since when do I ever believed Do Min-joon?

138
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,960
This elusive man!

139
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,940
I bought this for you. Try it.

140
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,770
It’s okay. You can have it.

141
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,180
You’re waiting for someone?

142
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,450
I’m not.

143
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,250
I found your disappointed look when I entered.

144
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,660
You’re waiting for his call, right?

145
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,660
Someone doesn’t know I’m in hospital?

146
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,090
I don’t think so.

147
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,160
I think the entire country knows it.

148
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,900
You’re the spotlight of all over Asia.

149
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,340
Even the dogs in my neighborhood know it.

150
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,170
Your fans are everywhere.

151
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,340
But if someone has no access to the Internet,
he might not know it, right?

152
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,880
Who is it?

153
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,710
An alien?

154
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,550
Hey. Hush!

155
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,420
You crazy?

156
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,080
You!

157
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,090
Do you think that guy is an alien?

158
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,560
No...

159
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,860
And you know what, this is ridiculous.

160
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,830
You can’t do that.

161
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,730
What did I do?

162
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,940
Hee-kyung is in a coma because of you.

163
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,670
And you’re thinking of another man.

164
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,810
This is ridiculous.

165
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:55,150
If it were not Hee-kyung, you’d have been dead!

166
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,550
He ended up like this to save your life.

167
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,420
That alien or ghost man

168
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,590
disappeared when you needed help.

169
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,630
He said he hates you, right?

170
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,160
Does he?

171
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,830
It was random talks.

172
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,230
Men talk in different ways with women.

173
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,570
A woman may not mean it
when she says she hate you.

174
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,070
But when a man says so,

175
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,010
he really means it.

176
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,580
He hate you for sure.

177
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,480
Forget that alien this time.

178
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,980
Make some progress with Hee-Kyung.

179
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,720
This is what you should do.

180
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,250
Stop waiting for him.

181
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,420
I’m not!

182
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,620
I’m not waiting.

183
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,830
I need to go home.

184
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,050
Is he getting better?

185
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,750
It’s said the surgery went well. How...

186
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,560
No need to worry. He’ll be fine soon.

187
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,530
If it hadn’t been him, I’d have been dead.

188
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,200
Yeah. I heard that.

189
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,900
Oh, right.

190
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,530
Did the police officers come to you?

191
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,040
They did.

192
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,870
I was interrogated by him.

193
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:40,050
He mistook others as Yoo-ra’s boyfriend.

194
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,050
So I told him

195
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,150
that you are Yoo-ra’s boyfriend.

196
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,850
I know.

197
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,490
Do I get you in trouble?

198
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,030
I think you misunderstand us.

199
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,460
We’re not that relationship.

200
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,069
I can’t distain a late friend’s name,
so I can’t tell you more.

201
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,240
Oh, I see.

202
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,609
I believed in what I saw.

203
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,250
so I might tell the police something useless.

204
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,950
Do you tell anyone else except for that police?

205
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,119
I told Hee-kyung about it.

206
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:30,160
Oh, I see.

207
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,300
[Cheon Song-yi’s boyfriend is a rich guy.]

208
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,910
Gosh. Did you see that?

209
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,140
Cheon Song-yi was caught by a man in the scene.

210
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,410
And he is super rich!

211
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,210
Awesome!

212
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,250
We have such a rich and handsome man?

213
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,750
She’s so lucky. She always can make it.

214
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,820
A rich and handsome bachelor saved her life.

215
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,760
I can’t contact Mr. Lee Jea-Kyung.

216
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,500
I’m afraid I have to breach the contract.

217
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,000
My girl will leave the hospital tomorrow.

218
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,410
I can’t sign the contract without her consent.

219
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,440
Did you tell him that?

220
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,380
I did. But he disagreed.

221
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,650
Disagreed?

222
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,680
Why? I’ll return the contract amount.

223
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,450
Please review the contract.

224
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,050
It requires 3 times of the amount.

225
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,230
We’re acquaintances. How can he?

226
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,230
I have to talk to Mr. Lee Jae-kyung.

227
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,770
Where is he?

228
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,300
I’ll call you back.

229
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,780
Excuse me? Were you saying Mr. Lee Jae-kyung?

230
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,980
I was. Mr. Do Min-joon.

231
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,050
It’s him. So what?

232
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,150
You haven’t been updated?

233
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:37,290
Song-yi has signed a contract with him.

234
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,460
He’ll cover all the limousines and managers.

235
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,730
Has Song-yi agreed to it?

236
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,030
What?

237
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,200
She hasn’t.

238
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,770
Just drop it for now.

239
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,440
I have a question for you.

240
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,970
Who do you think you are?

241
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,440
Excuse me?

242
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,610
Are you blind?

243
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,710
My daughter is Cheon Song-yi!

244
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,780
How dare you refuse her?

245
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,220
Excuse me. You’re being unreasonable.

246
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,490
What do you mean by that?

247
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,760
And you are?

248
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,560
I’m his father.

249
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,060
So what?

250
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,600
Well...

251
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,500
My daughter is Cheon Song-yi.

252
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,200
She’s the dream girl of all men.

253
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,870
Every man wants to date her.

254
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,240
Are you serious?

255
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,410
Min-joon went to Harvard.

256
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:34,080
And as you can see, he’s a handsome gentleman.

257
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,610
Dad.

258
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,350
He’s my treasure.

259
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,880
What does it help even if he went to Harvard?

260
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,090
He’s so irresponsible.

261
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,690
You should have stuck to being her manager.

262
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,490
Oh, the manager.

263
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,960
He didn’t ask for it.

264
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,360
It was your daughter who begged him to be.

265
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,170
That’s enough.

266
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,300
That’s not enough. You silly boy.

267
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,970
What is going on here?

268
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,840
I told you not to do so.

269
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,140
Are you lack of money or are you bored?

270
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,580
How could you be her manager?

271
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,750
Alas. This is absurd.

272
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,750
Everyone in this world wants to be her manager.

273
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,820
Then just pick one!

274
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,250
Let’s get in.

275
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,890
What a fortune

276
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,630
that Song-yi would sign with S&C Group

277
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,960
and be engaged with Hee-kyung.

278
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,460
For god’s sake!

279
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,310
What are you waiting for? Get in.

280
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,510
Lawyer Jang.

281
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,540
Sorry about that.

282
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,150
I was too pissed off.

283
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,620
Are you still angry with what happened?

284
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,360
I didn’t mean to do that.

285
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,530
But that old lady pissed me off so I...

286
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,670
Yes?

287
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,270
What’s in your mind?

288
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,310
Nothing.

289
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,610
Still thinking about Cheon Song-yi’s contract?

290
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,010
Not only that.

291
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,850
Or her engagement?

292
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,290
She doesn’t like that guy.

293
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,020
It’s said she likes him as a friend.

294
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,720
They’re just friends.

295
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,690
A friend is not a boyfriend.

296
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,730
Boys and girls have no pure friendship.

297
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,560
That was before. Nowadays people won’t do that.

298
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,000
A lady can be friends with a man.

299
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,170
That’s true before her accident.

300
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,180
That man saved her life.

301
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,010
They must have made some progress.

302
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,610
I saved her life, too! I...

303
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,020
I rescued her for so many times.

304
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,020
So you mean she likes you more?

305
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,230
But this time it was that guy,

306
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,930
which means she likes him more now?

307
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,560
She likes whoever rescues her?

308
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,000
That means people would fall in love
with police and firefighter?

309
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,330
Why are you so angry?

310
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,070
I’m not. You’re talking nonsense.

311
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,240
Gosh.

312
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,340
You’re so mad. I can tell.

313
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,750
The actress Cheon Song-yi has engaged
with the bachelor who saved her life.

314
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,650
What the hell?

315
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,130
A name?

316
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,160
[Goddess Su-ji: As long as they’re in love. Wish them a happy life. Mr. Bigbang: Win him over! He’s so rich. Girl’s Day LOVE: She wins everything. Bah. B1A4: She’s old enough to have a fiancé. What puppy love?]

317
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,570
My favorite singer’s name?

318
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,100

[Name: Bae Ho
(Bae Ho, born in 1942)]

320
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,080
It’s totally rumor,

321
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,280
as I’m concerned,

322
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,080
of Miss Cheon Song-yi’s engagement.

323
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,690
I didn’t expect to see such rumors.

324
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,760
Are you jealous of her engagement?

325
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,990
How do you know it’s a rumor?

326
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,530
-Piss off.
-Bah!

327
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,200
You little brats!

328
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,500

Or I’ll be annoyed so much!

413

Why is he still in a coma?

423
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,530
MRI shows that

424
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:56,940
there are injuries in his brainstem and callosum.

425
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,340
Now he’s till in a coma.

426
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,940
It’s probably DAI caused by injuries on his head.

427

He’s a healthy young man.

430
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,550
There might not be sequelae.

431
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,990
If he does well, he’ll wake up in a few days.

Are you here to stop me killing her?

448
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,210
If I make your secrets go public,

449
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,840
what will you do?

450
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,480
Even your own brother

451
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,980
was involved in the accident.

452
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,120
Knock yourself out then.

453
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,620
But you will never be accepted by this world.

454
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,930
If my secrets go public,

There are countless people.

466
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,800
But the ones who can contribute are few.

467
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,230
The rest are good-for-nothing,

468
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,170
who should be eliminated like bugs.

469
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,540
But sometimes,

470
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,380
these bugs get in my way.

471
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,410
That’s when I eliminate them

472
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,810
so that I can get what I want.

473
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,920
This is not sin.

474
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,650
I’m doing this for the majority.

475
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,690
This is my mercy.

476
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,960
As for you, Mr. Do Min-joon,

477
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,889
you’ll be needed and can contribute.

478
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,929
If you change your mind,

479
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:14,900
it will be good for everyone.

480
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,400
For me, I need your ability.

481
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,639
For you, you need my shield.

482
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,610
In this way, we’ll be all-conquering.

483
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,909
For sure, Cheon Song-yi,

484
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:28,480
whom you’re trying so hard to protect,

485
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,150
will be in safe hands.

486
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,520
Think about it.

487
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,090
I will,

488
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:41,989
unless you won’t touch anyone.

489
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,699
Fine.

490
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,830
Seems that you don’t trust me.

491
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,000
Just think about it.

492
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,969
I’ll keep my promise

493
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:55,770

Get up.

500
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,330
I need some more sleep.

501

Hurry. Get up.

502

Honey.

503
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,120

What are you cooking, sweetheart?

506
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,660
I’m making egg rolls.

507
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,830
But it’s scorched.

508
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,370
I like scorched egg rolls.

509
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,400
You do?

510
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,370
I’m so glad!

511
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,540
Stop it!

512
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,970
Stop it! Stop it!

513
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,640
She said it’s itchy!

514
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,450
She said stop it!

515
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,380
You, stop it!

516
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,920
Stop it!

517
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,450
It’s itchy.

518
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,630
So sweet.

519
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,230
Taste good?

520
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,330
Have a safe trip.

521
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,070
Okay.

522
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,270
I’m gonna miss you.

523
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,470
I bought fried chicken and beer.

524
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,450
She can resume her normal life.

525
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,620
But her tissue was injured,

526
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:24,260
so bleeding or superinfection may occur.

527
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:28,160
Due to the pneumonedema,

528
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,130
vigorous aerobic exercise is forbidden.

529
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,640
Please go to the hospital immediately

530
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,470
if you have a fever or pain in the lungs.

531
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,940
Yes. Thank you.

532
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,140
Thank you, doctor.

533
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,680
Listen.

534
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,980
The doctor says vigorous exercise is forbidden.

535
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,550
Are you going to film?

536
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,450
It’s okay.

537
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,790
I’ll be cautious.

538
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,320
You can see me on TV

539
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,660
newspapers and movies

540
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,390
as long as I regain my fame.

541
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,560
Song-yi.

542
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,990
If you do this for money...

543
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,660
I’ve thought about it.

544
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,570
A person can live no more than 100 years.

545
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,440
And most of us fail to live that long.

546
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,210
In the whole lifetime,

547
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:17,880
the time is rather limited when I can be myself,

548
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,550


549
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,350
when I can be with the one I like,

550
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,920
when I can say my real thoughts,

551
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,360
and when

552
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,260
I can hold your hands like now.

553
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,700
We’ve lost 12 years.

554
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,440
I just want to hold your hands forever.

555
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,810
I want to film the movies I like.

556
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,550
I want to be a foodie, seeking for the delicious.

557
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,250
Of course I have to count calories.

558
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,250
I relive my life

559
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,690
after I fell and was saved.

560
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,590
I’m gonna make good use of my life.

561
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,670
The director says

562
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,440
that a stand-in would do the wire work.

563
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,110
He asked if you can go to the site tomorrow.

564
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,840
What do you think? Can you do that?

565
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,750
Where’s Yun-jae? I haven’t seen him.

566
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,180
Did he say hello to you?

567
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,650
I don’t think so.

568
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,550
This boy keeps avoiding you.

569
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,890
I’m leaving.

570
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:43,200
Song-yi, we’ll meet again soon.

571
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,330
I’ll be there for you.

572
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,400
Then please hurry.

573
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,340
Promise?

574
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,850
Well...

575
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,820
Song-yi is reluctant.

576
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,250
But we’re all set.

577
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,390
You know what...

578
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,730
Song-yi is under too much pressure.

579
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,660
Nice to meet you.

580
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,700
Which is true...

581
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,340
Forget it! Does she have a choice?

582
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,500
They’re all here.

583
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,610
Hi.

584
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,540
I’m Cheon Song-yi’s mom.

585
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,340
I’ll leave her to you.

586
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,510
Yes.

587
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,050
Just leave her to us.

588
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,050
She’ll be in safe hands.

589
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,450
Right.

590
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,550
Then I’ll leave you alone.

591
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,120
Thank you so much!

592
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,560
Mom, I said I don’t want it.

593
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,030
I don’t care. Tell them to leave.

594
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,500
Hello?

595
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,830
Mom?

596
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,580
What? Mom said everything’s been set.

597
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,520
Get in the car.

598
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,260
Well, well. It’s Mr. Do Min-joon, my neighbor.

599
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,430
Thank you for coming.

600
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,300
But someone will pick me up.

601
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,800
That man has left.

602
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,570
What?

603
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,340
Why?

604
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,910
I asked him to leave.

605
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,010
Have you confirmed?

606
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:40,880
I have.

607
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,580
Damages for breach of contract have been paid.

608
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,420
You can leave now.

609
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,990
Cheon Song-yi and S&C’s contract is breached.

610
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,890
I’ve sent the related papers.

611
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:49,520
Hey, no matter what...

612
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,220
I am now the legal agent of Cheon Song-yi.

613
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,760
An actress who has nothing to do with you
can’t get in your car.

614
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,300
If you insist,

615
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,800
I will apply for a prohibition.

616
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,830
Please go.

617
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,140
Why would you ask them to leave?

618
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,880
You can do nothing about it.

619
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,580
Hey! Hey!

620
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,710
I said I don’t want it.

621
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,450
On the count of three. Let go of me.

622
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,180
One.

623
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:15,880
Two.

624
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,550
Three.

625
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,280
Three and a half.

626
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,100
Tell me the reason at least!

627
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,330
Why would you do this to me?

628
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,200
You said you need a manager.

629
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,900
I can be your manager.

630
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
An alien manager?

631
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,840
What should I pay you with then?

632
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,570
An aerolite?

633
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,340
Or solar energy?

634
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,640
Stop kidding.

635
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,840
Stop...

636
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,410
Mr. Do Min-joon.

637
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,150
Given that I have to keep my distance,

638
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,680
I have been respecting you.

639
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,120
Can’t you notice it?

640
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,920
I don’t think we can have normal chats
like close friends.

641
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,060
Mind your manners from now on.

642
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,360
Do you know how many years am I older than you?

643
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,970
Why would you be my manager?

644
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,470
Are you interested with actresses again?

645
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:14,110
Or, are you bored when the lesson is over?

646
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,510
Or, are you curious about my relationship
with that girl?

647
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,050
Yeah, whatever.

648
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,270
Stop following me. It makes me uncomfortable.

649
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:44,940
Go back when you’re done. I’ll be here.

650
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,770
I don’t think so. Mr. Do Min-joon.

651
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:49,340
Don’t wait for me.

652
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,110
Go now.

653
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,180
Cheon Song-yi, I...

654
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,980
Mr. Do Min-joon, we...

655
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,820
We’re totally strangers now.

656
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,320
You said so.

657
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,190
You’re not into me.

658
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,760
You said you hate me.

659
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,400
Then do it. Just hate me.

660
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,640
Come on, let’s go.

661
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,720
Just a sec.

662
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,160
Okay.

663
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,930
How are you doing?

664
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,830
Fine.

665
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:51,100
I heard that Hee-kyung is still unconscious.

666
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,270
He will wake up soon.

667
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,780
The doctor said so.

668
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,450
What now?

669
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,350
Am I supposed to be seriously injured?

670
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,850
Now I’m here safe and sound and you hate it?

671
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:13,130
I’m tired. Can you please let me go?

672
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,830
Not long before the accident,

673
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:21,100
he said to me,

674
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,540
that we will never be friends.

675
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:29,910
And he will never see me.

676
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,210
He doesn’t want me to be sad.

677
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,150
Because...

678
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,690
He thinks he’s sad

679
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:43,590
after he falls in love with you.

680
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,430
Do you know

681
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:53,500
why I hate you?

682
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,500
How can you know?

683
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,470
For you,

684
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:06,410
Hee-kyung is just a good friend.

685
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,020
But for me,

686
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,550
he’s the only one
that I’m willing to pay everything to get.

687
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:18,220
He only cares about you.

688
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,830
I can do nothing about it.

689
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:24,700
You have everything you want.

690
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,870
In your eyes,

691
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:33,210
I just hate you so much behind your back.

692
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:39,310
It may seem like I’m in a mess.

693
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,810
But I...

694
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,120
Cheon Song-yi.

695
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:53,960
When I saw Hee-kyung risk his life to save you,

696
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,900
I hope I can die for him.

697
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,640
Hee-kyung may feel the same for you.

698
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,380
That’s why he rushed to you.

699
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:18,050
I’m so impressed

700
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:21,720
by his love to you.

701
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:26,120
So Cheon Song-yi,

702
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,830
please

703
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,000
accept his love.

704
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:40,070
Please.

705
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,540
Yoo Se-mi.

706
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,680
Hee-kyung is sad if you don’t like him back.

707
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,510
But if you do, you will not be sad.

708
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:56,720
That man will like you with all his life.

709
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,030
One of us

710
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,760
should be happy at least.

711
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,370
Mr. Lee Jae-kyung.

712
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:47,970
How are you doing?

713
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,340
Officer Park.

714
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,550
Can we talk outside?

715
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:59,380
It’s too crowded here.

716
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,590
Sure.

717
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,330
In fact, you’re a witness.

718
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:14,100
We should have sent you summons.

719
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,130
Thank you for your cooperation.

720
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,270
You’re welcome.

721
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,110
Let’s get started.

722
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:30,180
What do you want to know from me?

723
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,660
What?

724
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,560
Why Jae-kyung was taken?

725
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,700
Does it have anything to do with his ex-wife?

726
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,400
What is going on?

727
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,800
Find our connections in Prosecution Service.

728
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,400
Dig it.

729
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,970
If the press knows about that women,
we’ll be in trouble.

730
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,810
Make sure you block the news.

731
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,880
If it hadn’t been him, I’d have been dead.

732
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,510
Yeah. I heard that.

733
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,890
Do you tell anyone

734
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:16,460
except for that police?

735
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,660
I told Hee-kyung about it.

736
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,900
Oh, I see.

737
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,460
You wake up?

738
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,390
Have a safe trip.

739
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,500
Thank you for everything.

740
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,540
If I make you secrets go public,

741
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,180
what will you do?

742
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,080
Even your own brother was involved

743
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,380
in the accident.

744
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,320
Knock yourself out then.

745
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:16,960
But you will never be accepted by this world.

746
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,220
If my secrets go public,

747
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,990
so do yours.

748
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,230
Which one of them is more terrifying?

749
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,700
For people, a monster is more terrifying
than a murderer.

750
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,840
How many people...

751
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,040
Cheon Song-yi, Han Yoo-ra.

752
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:38,040
How many people were or will be hurt by you?

753
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,590
Stand by.

754
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,060
Hey.

755
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,330
Excuse me.

756
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,060
Excuse me.

757
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,400
I’m Cheon Song-yi.

758
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,200
How long will I be waiting?

759
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,770
Quite long. Previous shootings take too long.

760
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,740
Then why don’t you...

761
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:11,480
Excuse me?

762
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:15,950
It’d be so kind of you if you told me earlier.

763
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:18,380
Everyone here is occupied.

764
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,620
Wait inside. It’ll take a few more hours.

765
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,950
A few more hours?

766
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:26,390
How lucky.

767
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:29,590
I have to spend hours standing by.

768
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,000
Never occurs to me before.

769
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,800
Lucky me.

770
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:13,370
Cut.

771
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:15,640
Okay. Great.

772
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,580
Director.

773
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,180
Scene No.28 is supposed to be daytime.

774
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,110
Now it’s dark. We can’t film it now.

775
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,610
Is it Cheon Song-yi’s part?

776
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,080
Tell her we’ll shoot this part later.

777
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:23,750
Okay.

778
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,080
Thank you. Director.

779
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,850
Hey. Se-mi.

780
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,460
You did a great job today.

781
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,290
Are you in love?

782
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,930
I’m not.

783
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:37,160
Tomorrow’s part...

784
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,770
Attention. Let’s call it a day.

785
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,670
Thank you for your hard work.

786
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:42,130
Thank you for your hard work.

787
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:42,970
Buddy?

788
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:43,540
Yes?

789
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,240
Tell Cheon Song-yi we’ve finished.

790
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,440
Yes.

791
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:52,380
Excuse me. What’s the schedule for tomorrow?

792
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,180
Tomorrow?

793
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,480
Tomorrow...

794
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,980
Thank you everyone.

795
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,280
Thank you everyone.

796
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,480
Thank you everyone.

797
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,250
Thank you everyone.

798
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,820
Cheon Song-yi’s part is postponed.

799
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,470
What is going on here?

800
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,610
Chill.

801
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,750
Anybody here?

802
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,390
Excuse me?

803
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,260
They’ve left?

804
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,990
Hello?

805
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,130
They left me behind?

806
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:48,770
Really?

807
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,000
I’m Cheon Song-yi!

808
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,240
This is unbelievable!

809
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,180
I told you to leave.

810
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,620
I said I would be waiting.

811
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,720
Why?

812
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,960
Why would you?

813
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:23,270
Because I need to protect you.

814
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:28,510
Bullshit.

815
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,840
I don’t understand unless you explain it.

816
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,650
Why would you do this to me?

817
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,580
I need your explanation.

818
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,260
Do Min-joon, are you a playboy?

819
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,560
Do you think it's fun to make me flipped?

820
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,230
After you’ve stolen my heart,

821
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:53,530
you told me you’re sorry?

822
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:56,800
And I am like your ex?

823
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,540
Do you think I’m a fool?

824
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:09,450
You said you never had one!

825
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,980
You said you never did that!

826
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,750
You’re never into me!

827
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,550
You never had a crush on me!

828
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,460
You never cared about me!

829
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,160
You never had a vision with me in it!

830
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,160
You said I was just look like that woman.

831
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:32,770
I don’t think you understand it.

832
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,610
So I’ll make it clear now.

833
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:38,910
I hate you, Do Min-joon.

834
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,750
I even hate you more now.

835
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,710
Please keep your distance.

836
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,220
No. Please disappear from my life.

837
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,720
Please.

838
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:53,960
And, I hope you can be aware

839
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,960
how selfish you are.

840
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,660
What are you doing?

841
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:07,600
I am being selfish to you.

842
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,570
♫ When you breathe ♫

843
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:18,440
♫ I feel a warm breeze ♫

844
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,610
♫ When you smile ♫

845
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:25,750
♫ I see a shining star ♫

846
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:29,720
♫ You are there ♫

847
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,690
♫ one and only ♫

848
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:40,330
♫ Sometimes you lean on my shoulder ♫

849
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,470
♫ For me... ♫

850
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:12,030
Something is wrong with the elevator.

851
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:21,410
Excuse me. Are you Cheon Song-yi’s father?

852
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,280
You are?

853
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,750
She misses you so much.

854
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:31,520
If you can accompany her till she wakes up,

855
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,420
she will be so happy.

856
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:39,220
Are you a friend of her?

857
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:45,660
I like her so much.

858
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,170
Cheon Song-yi.
