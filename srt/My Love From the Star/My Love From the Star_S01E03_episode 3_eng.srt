1
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,170

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,960
Who is this?

3
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,150
Why are you looking at someone's picture without their permission?

4
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,030
Who is it?!

5
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,830
Do I have to answer?

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,160
What do you think you're doing? Are you nuts?!

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,730
You...

8
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,390
Who are you?

9
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,930
 Who are you? It's just that, it's very strange.

10
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,410
 You would suddenly float in the air.

11
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,360
 The weird clothes you were wearing,
and the hair you had that day.

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,160
 Even the strange object that came down from the sky.

13
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,800
 Everything is strange.
Just who are you?

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,990
  No matter what you say, I won't be surprised.

15
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,830
 Even though I look like this, I enjoy reading books,

16
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,500
  such as 'Imunchongrok' and 'Yojaejiyi'.
 (Occult and Ghost books of the era)

17
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,300
 My mother didn't like them, labeling them as trashy books about goblins and wizards.

18
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,060
 But, I don't think humans are the
 only ones in this world.

19
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,770
 Ghosts, imps, nine-tailed fox demons and grim reapers --

20
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,180
 I think their existence is all possible.

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,080
  Sir, which of those  are you?

22
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,140
 Can you not speak?

23
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,900
 Then, do you have a place to go to?

24
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,940
 What about family?

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,610
  Whatever you are, you are my life savior.

26
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,800
 If I say you saved my life,

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,020
 my mother-in-law will not kick you out.

28
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,300
  So, how about you come with me?

29
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,230
 With me . . . T.o.g.e.t.h.e.r. . . We go.

30
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,070
 I will help you.

31
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,010
 My . . . How did this tragedy happen?

32
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,970
 Lady Seo, the daughter-in-law of the head
 of our clan, committed suicide

33
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,620
 by hanging herself at Fox Hill last night.

34
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,150
 To memorialize her beautiful virtue,

35
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,080
 we will submit a request to the court
 for the title of "Lady of Virtue."

36
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,700
 Tonight, the coffin will be taken away from the house.

37
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,300
 Whatever you do, find that child and kill her.

38
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,950
This is a critical time, since we submitted
 the request for the  "Lady of Virtue" title.

39
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,210
 I do not want anyone to see her alive.

40
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,110
 Yes.

41
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,140
 They said ...

42
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,960
 this is my grave.

43
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,470
 Then what am I? 
 Am I a person or ghost?

44
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,030
 If they find out that I'm alive, then, what will happen?

45
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,430
 Now, where can I go?

46
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,520
 I'm going to Gangneung where my parents are.

47
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,720
 If I tell my father all that happened,

48
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,850
 he will tell me how I can survive this.

49
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,800
 Thanks for all you've done for me.

50
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,810
 I don't know where you came from . . .

51
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,000
 I bid you a safe return.

52
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,180
 I don't know what you are,

53
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,140
 but you seemed to possess a power much greater than mine.

54
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,050
 So, I will not worry about you.

55
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,870
 Let's go together.

56
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,100
 Go with me.

57
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,230
 I...

58
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,380
 will protect you.

59
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,600
Did you just ask who I am?

60
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,780
You still don't know who I am?   I am Cheon Song Yi.

61
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,180
Right . . .

62
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,650
You are Cheon Song Yi.

63
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,980
You can't possibly be that woman.

64
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,080
Who is "that woman?"

65
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,140
Does she look like me?

66
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,290
It figures . . .  People, nowadays, say to cosmetic surgeons, 
"Please make me look like Cheon Song YI."

67
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,710
So Cheongdam-dong is full of women who resemble me.

68
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,010
But, is the original the "original" for no reason?

69
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,510
Those fakes will never catch up with the original . . .

70
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,330
Look here. What are you staring at?

71
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,090
Those shoes . . .

72
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,780
Are they yours?

73
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,300
Of course they are.  Do you think they're borrowed?

74
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,840
There is precisely one pair in Korea.

75
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,200
I am not a woman who wears what everyone else wears.

76
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,080
 My Love From the Star
Episode 3

77
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,090
Perhaps . . . Is it something like "reincarnation?"

78
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,480
Ah, if not, doppelganger!

79
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,940
How can  a member of the legal profession make such an irrational assumption?

80
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,920
There's no way that exists.  Try to think logically.

81
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,800
Why can't there be doppelgangers
 when there are aliens?

82
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,420
That makes even less sense, thinking logically.

83
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,710
What are you going to do, by the way?

84
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,390
- About what?  
- The shoes.

85
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,140
You said they were the ones you saw.

86
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,270
If you've seen a future event,
 as you did 12 years ago . . .

87
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,860
It means the owner of the shoes could die.

88
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,060
Will you involve yourself in the event 
just like 12 years ago?

89
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,070
Or, will you look away as you usually 
have been doing up to now?

90
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,640
Just how much of a scene did you create
 with Han Yoo Ra at the hair salon

91
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,990
that everyone I see is talking about it?

92
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,680
I don't know.  She kept provoking me.

93
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,440
Then who was the man?  The guy that 
grabbed your hand and took off with you?

94
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,850
It's that guy who lives next door.

95
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,410
The professor of your class?

96
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,130
Yea.

97
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,140
OK, but why did he?

98
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,090
He probably came to return the wallet.

99
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,490
And he even said I looked like someone.

100
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,240
Who?

101
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,780
Isn't it obvious? If it's not his first love, 
then it's his mom who's passed away.

102
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,440
We both know the feeling.  
It looked like he was hitting on me.

103
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,320
What's wrong?

104
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,180
Ever since I ate dinner, my stomach started hurting.

105
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,360
Isn't it because you've starved yourself 
so much for the photo shoot?

106
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,540
Hello, Sunbae-nim.

107
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,730
Sunbae-nim, I watched the awards.

108
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,420
Congratulations.

109
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,940
Your dress was really chic and sexy. It was the best!

110
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,620
Where was it from?

111
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,790
Ms. Yoo Se Mi, we'll start the next scene.

112
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,570
Yes.

113
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,390
Hey, you two. Do you know Yoo Se Mi or not?

114
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,240
We know her.

115
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,540
Why didn't you pay your respects to her?

116
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,990
Where did you learn to greet only those you like? 
Where are your manners?

117
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,040
I'll be watching you two.

118
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,440
If I see you ignoring Se Mi once more,

119
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,070
I won't leave you alone.

120
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,510
You've heard that my personality is nasty, right?

121
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,560
That's not just a rumor.

122
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,550
It's true.

123
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,640
Aish, because of them, I forgot all my lines.

124
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,070
That's so funny, seriously.

125
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,730
If her career were to take a downturn, 
only then would she learn her lesson.

126
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,600
Hey, it's not like there's just one or two who
 would step on her if she's ruined.

127
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,460
Everyone wants her to really lose it.

128
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,200
The day she really does,  Cheon Song Yi
 will be totally dead

129
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,980
 If, as you said, that woman really were 
that famous and impressive,

130
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,240
 why would I believe that I should entrust her to you?

131
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,740
That punk . . .

132
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,710
I'm sure, I have seen him somewhere.

133
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,220
  6 o'clock

134
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,760

135
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,930
It's already 6. Aren't we going home?

136
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,440
I will go first.

137
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,630
You are leaving first?

138
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,100
Yes.

139
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,800
Hey, newbie!

140
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,460
I mean you.

141
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,600
I was going to say something before, too, but...

142
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,360
I will do it. I'll do it. 
 Department Head, I'll do it.

143
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,600
Mr. Lee Hui Kyeong.

144
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,870
Is the company your playground?
Did you come here to play?

145
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,000
It's just that I have finished everything for today.

146
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,610
If your sunbae's work is not finished yet, 
your work is not finished yet!

147
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,220
Slacking off while still being a newbie!

148
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,220
I should have known, from the start, when you had
 the photo of that celebrity as the desktop background!

149
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,820
She's my girlfriend.

150
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,260
Quiet!

151
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,480
If your girlfriend is Cheon Song Yi, then is my wife Kim Nam Joo?
 (His co-star in "My Husband has a Family.")

152
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,380
Your mental state is rotten!

153
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,060
People who work in our company, 
for their desktop background,

154
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,160
place work-related stuff or family pictures,

155
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,550
to re-motivate themselves.

156
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,310
'I need to feed and save my family.'

157
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,920
'I need to do my best,' that type of determination.
Strong determination!

158
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,020
- Is that so?
- What "Is that so?"! What, oh really!

159
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,130
Go change your desktop background quickly, 
and as you go around serving coffee, say,

160
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,510
'I'm sorry.' Do it!

161
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,150
Is society that easy for you?!

162
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,370
Huh?

163
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,520
Yes, I'll do that.

164
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,580
Is society that easy for you?!

165
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,320
 Why?

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,520
Chief Yoo.

167
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,450
That guy went to buy coffee, right?

168
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,360
I gave him a good scolding.

169
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,170
Why did you do that?

170
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,470
Lee Hui Kyeong just placed his family photo
on his desktop background--

171
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,640
I told him to.

172
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,890
No...I mean...
Why is the chairman in this picture?

173
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,460
And why is the managing director in this picture too?

174
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,150
Why would they be?

175
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,650
Lee Hui Kyeong is probably the chairman's son,

176
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,140
and the managing director's brother.

177
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,160
Chief!

178
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,740
Earlier, I . . .to this Lee Hui Kyeong ...

179
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,860
seemed to have an attitude towards Lee Hui Kyeong, right?

180
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,120
Aigoo, Chief!

181
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,920
Why did I do that?

182
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,430
Here is the coffee!

183
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,090
Oh...oh..

184
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,850
Earlier, I didn't know anything, so...

185
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,050
Even if I don't have anything to do, I 
 will wait until all the sunbaes leave work.

186
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,210
Our Chief Yoo taught me properly.

187
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,970
- I did?
- Yes.

188
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,740
Is there anyone who's not done with work?

189
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,950
I finished a long time ago.

190
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,010
Of course, everyone should finish work
within the work hours.

191
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,800
So, shall we . . .

192
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,810
all leave work together?

193
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,740
Okay. Yes.

194
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,200
- Well, I'll drink the coffee well.
--Oh, oh, it's hot.

195
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,160
You're doing well without getting caught, right?

196
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,630
Of course!

197
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,000
No one knows that I'm your brother.

198
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,380
Yes.

199
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,660
Director Hwang!

200
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,250
Oh, right. Hui Kyeong, long time no see.

201
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,000
- Have you been well?
- Yes, of course.

202
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,870
I did hear that you had returned to Korea. 
Let's have a meal together some time soon.

203
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,980
Of course, on the condition that you're buying it.

204
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,830
Since I'm a new trainee, my salary is not that high.

205
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,480
Of course, let's do that.

206
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,970
And..

207
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,400
- You can go first.
- Yeah.

208
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,670
Director, I'll barge in on you soon.
Let's eat something delicious then.

209
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,930
Okay.

210
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,960
What is it?

211
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,790
I told you a few days ago, but . . .

212
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,840
About Im Sae Wook . . .

213
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,770
The one who was related to the land, 
where the shopping mall will be built,

214
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,110
and was killed in a car accident.

215
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,010
Yes.

216
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,380
I think we need to investigate this.

217
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,420
I heard from his family members,

218
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,340
the circumstances before the accident 
don't seem to add up.

219
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,520
I told you before.

220
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,160
I don't think it is something 
 our company needs to worry about.

221
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,540
The police will probably take care of it.

222
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,270
Well, there's something unsettling about it.

223
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,860
They say, on the day before the accident, 
he met with someone from our company.

224
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,140
We don't know who that person was.

225
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,530
But, I think we need to find out the details.

226
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,110
Then, do so.

227
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,180
Look into it.

228
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,720
Yes, I understand.

229
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,860
How is your diabetes?

230
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,180
Ah, yes.

231
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,080
I check my blood sugar regularly, and get insulin.

232
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,190
I'm maintaining myself well.

233
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,430
You know that I like you.

234
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,080
Take good care of

235
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,990
your health.
- Yes.

236
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,120
Thank you.

237
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,150
 Hwang Ui Gyeong

238
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,660
 Ahh, why does my stomach hurt?

239
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,720
Cell phone...

240
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,450
Ah, Bom.

241
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,030
 Yes, Noona?

242
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,290
Oh, my stomach hurts so much right now.

243
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,550
In the lower right area.

244
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,380
 Last time, they said that it was because of stress.

245
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,470
It's different from last time.

246
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,150
Hurry and come here.

247
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,110
 It's my dad's memorial service, so I came down to Choongjoo.

248
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,430
 - Call 119.
 - You punk!

249
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,870
If I call 119, then the reporters are 
going to be everywhere.

250
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,580
 Then,  call your mother. Should I do it?

251
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,790
No, don't! Don't call Mom.

252
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,630
I will take care of it.

253
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,500
If it's her lower right abdomen,

254
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,630
it might be her appendix.

255
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,250
Whatever.

256
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,140
Ow, my stomach.

257
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,150
Stay focused.

258
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,520
I'm a star.

259
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,970
I'm Asia's star.

260
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,560
I'm the Nation's

261
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,530
Goddess.

262
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,470
It's so dark.

263
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,570
Is it this?

264
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,830
Even fashion for the hospital,

265
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,750
I should be number one.

266
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,900
Um, excuse me.

267
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,650
I'm sorry, but where are you going right now?

268
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,210
Me?

269
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,240
I'm going to So Min University Hospital that's nearby.

270
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,190
At 2:00am?

271
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,510
I have to take care of some things.

272
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,440
Okay then, anyway,

273
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,840
that's even better, then.

274
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,460
I don't feel so well.

275
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,220
So could you take me to the hospital on your way?

276
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,290
She seems to have symptoms of shivering and vomiting starting the evening.

277
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,030
And she has a fever.

278
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,430
If I press the stomach, the pain starts.

279
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:27,230
As soon I release, there is more pain.
 I think it might be appendicitis.

280
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,730
What are you doing?

281
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,060
You're a first year, right? Inform the 
Chief Surgeon and prep for emergency surgery.

282
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,070
Yes.

283
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,460
But, who are you?

284
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,130
Me?

285
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,840
So, what relationship do you have with the patient?

286
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,160
He's my manager, my manager.

287
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,440
I am?

288
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,680
As if!

289
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,860
What kind of manager gives me orders to give notification!

290
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,840
There are too many medical dramas.... too many...

291
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,540
They're rampant.

292
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,830
Why am I your manager?

293
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,070
I'm an actress.

294
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,520
If the fact that I came to the Emergency Room
with a man in the middle of night, leaks out,

295
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,640
'She's pregnant, suicidal, etc.'

296
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,570
There will be all kinds of rumors.

297
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,540
Still, suddenly labeling someone as your manager--

298
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,280
You're Cheon Song Yi's manager, right?

299
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,520
Please fill out the paperwork.

300
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,460
But if it really is my appendix,

301
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,890
will I have to have surgery?

302
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,480
Of course. Then, will you not?

303
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,680
There will be scars leftover.

304
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,240
It'll show when I wear a bikini.

305
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,690
Tell them to pay attention to that.

306
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,360
Why should I?

307
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,990
You said you will be my manager, didn't you?

308
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,020
When did I ever?!

309
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,270
Cheon Song Yi's manager?

310
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,860
Yes!

311
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,090
Is this the right number?

312
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,260
Yes.

313
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,910
Are there still people who use beepers?!

314
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,950
Wait a minute.

315
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,170
Excuse me.

316
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,010
Do Manager.

317
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,040
What?

318
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,140
You can't go.

319
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,170
Until I wake up, you can't go anywhere.
Stay right by my side.

320
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,990
We are going in.

321
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,700
Got it?

322
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,660
Do Manager! Don't go anywhere!

323
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,560
You can't go anywhere.

324
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,550
Guardian?

325
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,220
Yes.

326
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,940
Since she's had surgery, there's gas in her stomach. 
It's important to relieve the gas as soon as possible.

327
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,530
In the hallway are green directional arrows,

328
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,720
please take the patient and walk a couple of laps, 
following the arrows.

329
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,620
That way, she will fart and release the gas sooner.

330
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,670
I don't do that.

331
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,500
She has to fart to be discharged.

332
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,990
There's no way I will.

333
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,750
I'll let you know when she does.

334
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,040
Really...

335
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,400
These hospital clothes really suck.

336
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,050
I have to wear clothes that are fitted (tight) 
to make me look good.

337
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:28,220
Can you ask if they have red?
 I look good when I wear red.

338
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,100
Do you think I would ask something like that?

339
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,000
Just walk.

340
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,650
But, she must be stunningly gorgeous, huh?

341
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,360
What is?

342
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,700
That woman who looks like me.

343
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,650
If you confused me for her, 
she must be really gorgeous.

344
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,100
I was confused for a moment. But,

345
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,970
now that I look carefully, you're not.

346
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,320
You two are completely different people.

347
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,940
Oh, is it your first love?

348
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,910
No.

349
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,500
A person I feel sorry towards.

350
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:09,440
That probably isn't the only one you feel sorry to. Look at your life carefully. It's probably not just one or two people.

351
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,930
Just looking at you, you seem like someone
 who would cause people who hold a grud-

352
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,310
Try fixing your personality a little.

353
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,680
It worked.

354
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,960
It wasn't mine.

355
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,820
Nurse.

356
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,830
It wasn't m-

357
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,200
There's snow.

358
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,570
The first snow.

359
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,030
 The first snow has come.

360
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,210
 Do you know that?

361
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,300
 In Joseon, the day the first snow falls,

362
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,580
 any lie is forgiven.

363
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,520
 They say it is the only day that
 even lies to the king can be forgiven.

364
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,930
 My Lord.

365
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,730
 I have something to tell you.

366
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,380
 Truthfully...

367
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,020
 I...

368
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,510
 like you.

369
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,830
 I want to grow up quickly,

370
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,120
 and become a beautiful young maiden

371
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,970
 to show you.

372
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,570
 It's a lie.

373
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,930
 Were you surprised?

374
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,670
 I told you.

375
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,630
 Today is a day when any lie is forgiven.

376
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:20,330
 Because it is the day of the first snow.

377
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,470
The first day snow comes . . .

378
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:36,500
Chicken and beer,

379
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,250
or intestines and soju. Pig skin is fine, too.

380
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,820
I want to eat a seafood pancake
 and have some rice wine, too.

381
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,350
Jjangmyun and tangsuyuk.
 (Jjangmyun-black bean noodles, 
Tangsuyuk-sweet &amp; sour pork)

382
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,090
Look here.

383
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:50,300
Ah, I suddenly crave live octopus, too. If I dip
 that in sesame oil and chew on that squirmy thing,

384
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,780
it's seriously chewy.

385
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,490
Have you gotten brain surgery 
instead of appendix surgery?

386
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,790
I don't even remember the last 
time I ate everything I wanted to.

387
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,500
Black bean noodles and sweet
 and sour pork is 1,395 calories.

388
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,910
Seafood pancake, rice wine, 900 calories.
 (Pajeon- green onion pancake, 
Makgeolli- Korean rice wine)

389
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,990
My favorite, chicken and beer

390
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,170
Whopping 1,522 calories.

391
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,690
So what can I eat?

392
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,110
Wait a second, if my appendix was removed,

393
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,500
then, does my weight drop a little?

394
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,860
If you're going to talk nonsense, then just sleep more.

395
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,290
If I sleep, are you going to leave?

396
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,560
I told people that you're my manager. But,

397
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,490
if you leave, they'll think it strange.

398
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,480
What I'm saying is...

399
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,320
I'm not leaving.

400
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,630
What's your star sign?

401
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,820
I'm an Aquarius. Why?

402
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,700
Perhaps, is there a chance that you'll 
have to ride a boat anytime soon?

403
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,490
A boat?

404
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,030
They say that an Aquarian shouldn't ride boats

405
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,750
and to be careful of water.

406
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,330
Is that so?

407
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,200
I don't believe in that sort of stuff.

408
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,960
Even so,

409
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,120
there's nothing wrong with being careful.

410
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,120
Isn't that right?

411
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,030
No outsiders may visit.

412
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,610
I'm not some stranger.

413
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,740
How much do I have to reveal?

414
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:52,200
You can't spread any rumors, 
but I'm Cheon Song Yi's boyfriend.

415
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,330
No.

416
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,330
I'll verify it for you.

417
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,750
She turned her phone off.

418
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,170
But I'm really Cheon Song Yi's boyfriend.

419
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,380
This morning, over ten people have said the same thing.

420
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,480
I'm different from them. Really...

421
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:19,690
Where is Cheon Song Yi's manager? He knows me.

422
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,770
Her manager just came out.

423
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,210
This person says he's Cheon Song Yi's boyfriend.

424
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,580
Did he speak the truth?

425
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,520
Yo- ... Why are you here?

426
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,460
That person is not her manager!

427
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,590
What are you talking about?

428
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,030
Last night, together with Cheon Song Yi, 
he admitted her (into hospital), so

429
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,150
they even spent the whole night together.

430
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,070
What? All night?

431
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,140
Overnight?!

432
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,720
What should we do?

433
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,910
The patient needs to remain stable,

434
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,700
please prohibit outsiders.

435
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,950
Hey! Next door neighbor! HEY!

436
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,520
You are a close friend of Cheon Song Yi, right?

437
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,340
I heard you've been close since middle school.

438
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,120
Yes, we were together from middle school 
through high school.

439
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,960
We saw each other in school and
 at filming locations as well.

440
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,540
There's no way we couldn't be close.

441
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,840
They said Cheon Song Yi received emergency surgery 
this morning for appendicitis.

442
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,300
Are you going to the hospital?

443
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,810
I should go after this interview ends.

444
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,130
But then, back in the day, Cheon Song Yi...

445
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,330
Reporter. . .

446
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,190
Yes?

447
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:26,240
Isn't there anything concerning me 
about which you are curious?

448
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,370
Why isn't there? Of course there is.

449
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,990
Do you have a boyfriend?

450
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,870
For over 10 years,

451
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,250
I have had an unrequited crush on a particular man.

452
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,360
 Lee Hui Kyeong. Lee Hui Kyeong. 
It's Lee Hui Kyeong.

453
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,340
 What's this? Why are there so many lines?

454
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,970
 Song Yi, you are acting the child character 
of Jang Hui Bin.

455
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,620
 You must be so happy.

456
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,300
 If I was something like a lady's maid like you, Se Mi,

457
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,620
 I wouldn't need to memorize lines or
 fall in water when it's so cold.

458
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,350
 You don't have to do those things.

459
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,660
 Look, it's him!

460
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,900
 He's so cute!

461
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,860
 He's really cute.

462
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,890
 Hey, Cheon Song Yi.

463
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,390
 You know me, right?

464
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,630
 I am Lee Hui Kyeong.

465
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,790
 So who is that?

466
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,580
 You shot an ad for a chocolate this time, right?

467
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,380
 Because of that you became a hit 
and even got into a drama.

468
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,500
 The Chairman of that chocolate company is my dad.

469
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,610
 So?

470
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,730
 Oh, my goodness.

471
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,970
 I'm not trying to take credit for myself 
or anything, but . . .

472
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:02,720
 The one that pestered my dad for you
 to be the commercial model was me.

473
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,390
 So are you saying you are grateful?

474
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,770
 Not you, but me?

475
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,400
 Because I'm the model,

476
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,650
 the chocolate of your dad's company is selling well.

477
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,650
 I'm asking if you came to greet me 
in order to thank me for that.

478
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,960
 Who is greet ... It's not that--

479
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,410
 No thanks, I have no time to accept such greetings.

480
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,700
 - What the-  
- Will you look at that?!

481
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,240
 Hey, you wench!!

482
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,160
 Do you think you would be famous
 if it hadn't been for me?

483
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,640
 It's because I convinced my dad 
even though he didn't want to.

484
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,120
 Who told you to do such a thing?

485
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,750
 He's a person who has not looked at me even once.

486
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:49,270
 I don't know why I keep looking at that person.

487
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,710
How many times do I have to tell you I am her boyfriend.

488
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,310
I am Song Yi's boyfriend.

489
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:57,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

490
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,290
Hui Kyeong.

491
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,740
Hey.

492
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,180
If Beom couldn't come, you should
 have called me. Why did you call that bastard?

493
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,830
Coincidentally, that man said he needed to
 go to the hospital.

494
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,030
You said it was 2 in the morning.

495
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,270
He said he had something to do.

496
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,800
That bastard planned it.

497
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,900
Isn't he your stalker?

498
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,810
Come to think of it...

499
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,190
He lives next door and he's your professor.

500
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,750
Is Seoul just the size of a palm?
Isn't this a planned move?

501
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,480
Be reasonable.

502
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,540
I was the one who moved next door 
and enrolled in his class.

503
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,250
Should I move next door to you?

504
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,210
That punk... Does he own that place or is it a lease?

505
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,970
Se Mi, take him and go.

506
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,990
That's right. We should go, so Song Yi can rest.

507
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,560
You can go.
I will stay here and sleep here.

508
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,250
Why would you sleep here?

509
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,400
It's dangerous.

510
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,690
You are the most dangerous one. You are.

511
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,620
Oh right, did you call your mother?

512
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,010
Should I blow dry my hair?

513
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,290
Pictures of me may be taken as I walk in the corridor.

514
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,270
Your mother will be worried.

515
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,790
Hey, give me the newspaper.

516
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,560
I will read your horoscopes.

517
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,490
Horoscope?

518
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,600
Where?

519
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,570
I'm Aquarius. 
He said I'm supposed to be careful with water.

520
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,620
I shouldn't ride a boat.

521
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:27,010
What's this? It's not here.

522
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,030
What's with him?

523
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,600
Was he talking about horoscopes that aren't even here?

524
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,930
Talking about horoscopes which weren't even there,

525
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,920
I warned her not to go where water is concerned.

526
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,160
Did she bite (believe) it?

527
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,170
Originally, she isn't a person who would listen to others.

528
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,960
Then, will you just let her be?

529
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,390
I did as much as I could.

530
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,990
So I think it would be too much if I got involved any further.

531
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,430
But then, why did you call me?

532
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,290
Pardon?

533
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,900
No, I too. . .

534
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,590
have my private life. If you call me as you wish. . .

535
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:05,770
Since you said you won't concern yourself with matters 
regarding Cheon Song Yi, then just don't.

536
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,450
So, why are you always talking about her?

537
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,160
You are concerned about her, deep down inside.

538
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,260
Before you found me difficult.

539
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,630
Now I think you feel rather comfortable around me.

540
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,630
If it's been over 30 years,
 then it's about time to get comfortable.

541
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,160
And you can't underestimate visuals.

542
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,630
Whoever sees us, sees us as father and son.

543
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:37,560
So I did get a bit comfortable.

544
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,080
Where did the Confucian hierarchical order (that young must honor their elders) go in this Eastern country of courtesy?

545
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,230
When I look at how the world goes round, there
 are times when I just become speechless.

546
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,270
Isn't your beeper ringing?

547
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,560
No, wasn't I the only one who knew your beeper number?

548
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,960
It's the first time I've heard your beeper ring.

549
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,580
Try calling.

550
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,870
Professor Do Min Joon?

551
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,420
Oh my.

552
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,400
Do you really use a beeper?

553
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,540
It's Cheon Song Yi.

554
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,220
 How did you know my beeper number?

555
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,090
You placed it on my guardian's contact info.

556
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,130
 What's the matter?

557
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,740
The thing is... Where are the horoscopes?

558
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,590
I can't find it no matter how I look for it.

559
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,120
There is.

560
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,520
Did you call me just because of that?

561
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,930
Favor?

562
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,370
Haven't I granted enough of your favors already?

563
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,560
Do you think I would grant such a favor?!

564
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,720
What are you doing tomorrow?

565
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,200
It's a bit cold during the day.

566
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,350
- I'm thinking about going to Finland 
and go to a sauna or something. 
-- Too bad.

567
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,880
Why?

568
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,710
I wanted to invite you to my house 
if you didn't have anything to do.

569
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,450
I was planning to play billiards with Tiger Woods.

570
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,850
Yesterday, Jobs came to my house.

571
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:13,280
Since there was something wrong with my computer,
 I asked the person who made it to fix it.

572
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,150
Hey.

573
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,110
Look here. Jobs is dead.

574
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,290
Don't you have kimchi?

575
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,210
I buy these ramyeons at 80 cents and sell them at $1.
 How can I give you kimchi too?

576
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,570
You are really too much.

577
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,440
Heartless, so heartless.

578
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,660
Just go if you don't want it.

579
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,850
We'll enjoy it.

580
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,550
Welcome.

581
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:42,570

582
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:51,920
♬  You are my destiny.  ♬

583
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,750
♬  You share my reverie. You are ...  ♬

584
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,480
How can I help you?

585
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,510
Can you lend me some books?

586
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,900
Of course. Of course.

587
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,470
But then, what books?

588
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,850
"A Butler at a Studio Room,"

589
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,860
"Magnificent Seduction of the Man Next Door,"

590
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,810
"Overnight in the Office with My Greedy Boss,"

591
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:22,180
"Fake Dating With a Tyrant,"

592
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,770
Oh my.

593
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,540
Why?

594
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,040
What is it?

595
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,660
"A Butler at a Studio Room"?

596
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,780
Why is a butler needed in a studio?

597
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,390
One can get a 2-room house with the money
one uses to hire a butler.

598
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,260
Do you think it's literally a studio?!

599
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,950
You really lack imagination.

600
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:57,710
"Overnight in the Office with My Greedy Boss".

601
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,670
Do I need to imagine it?

602
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,960
Excuse me.

603
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,090
These are my life's books.

604
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,590
Don't insult them.

605
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,130
Then what kind of high level books do you read?

606
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,660
My life's book is. . .

607
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,280
"Kuunmong" ("The Cloud Dream of the Nine").

608
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,260
What mong?

609
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,320
"Kuunmong".

610
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,890
Heol! Isn't that a book from the Joseon times?

611
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,580
So old-fashioned and boring.

612
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,140
Do you think all the old stuff is boring?

613
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,430
"Kuunmong" was a new type of fantasy novel, 
written during the Joseon era.

614
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:33,040
Of course it's 400 years ahead of Harry Potter,
 but it's a masterpiece that is of equal or better quality.

615
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,200
Look here. I've been curious since a while ago.

616
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,520
In what year were you born?

617
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,470
HEY! You rascal.

618
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,140
You haven't been coming home.
 Where have you been all along?

619
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,610
Where is this girl hurt that she had to be admitted?

620
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,270
What do you mean 'this girl'? She's your older sister.

621
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,120
Anyway, let's go in already.

622
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,980
Wait a second.

623
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,440
Oh, Representative Ahn! Here!

624
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,220
Ah, yes.

625
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,770
Ah, Mother.

626
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:14,990
These are the director and staff who are 
shooting the "Cheon Song Yi Special."

627
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,480
I appreciate your hard work.

628
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,410
I am Cheon Song Yi's mom.

629
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,270
This is... her brother, Cheon Yoon Jae.

630
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:28,120
Certainly, Ms. Cheon Song Yi looks 
a lot like her mother.

631
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,030
Everyone says that.

632
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:37,420
By the way, you're not using a reflector?

633
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,860
With the lighting, this is it?

634
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,010
Yes...

635
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,200
I'm pretty sure you will do well. But our concept is

636
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,530
of a family, who couldn't keep in touch 
because of their busy schedules,

637
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,420
gathering urgently after hearing 
that she had  surgery, you know?

638
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,840
A happy family is our concept.

639
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,830
Representative Ahn.

640
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,450
Don't worry.

641
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:04,010
Then, how about you start filming
 from where I get out of the taxi?

642
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,320
While crying... I can manage to cry in 3 seconds.

643
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,300
- That's a good idea. 
 -- Right?

644
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,470
Then, we should get a taxi first-

645
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,930
Stop filming before I break that camera.

646
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,450
Alright?

647
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,130
That rotten b-

648
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,110
You know about 'high school senior illness', right?

649
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,200
You know, there's this saying.

650
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,650
'Even aliens are scared of 8th graders and high school seniors.'

651
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:33,730
So, they can't invade the Earth.

652
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,620
What should we do? A happy family is our concept.

653
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,850
For now, tell them to film me 
without that brat, Yoon Jae.

654
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,710
I will do my best to make us look happy.

655
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,020
Ah, yes.

656
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:49,020
Honestly, I'm better at acting than Song Yi.

657
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,140
Cheon Yoon Jae.

658
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,070
You're still alive?

659
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,710
This brat...

660
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,890
You don't even pick up my calls.

661
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,960
Mom said you've been running away from home often-

662
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,080
Shut your mouth and just lie down. 
It's enough to see you alive.

663
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,470
You're leaving just like that when it's been 
a year since we've seen each other?

664
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,650
Come here. I will give you some pocket money-

665
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,010
Forget it.

666
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,930
I work part-time jobs to earn a living at least.

667
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,180
Who told you to work part-time? 
I told you to stay home and study.

668
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,380
You didn't know?

669
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,990
I ran away from home because
 I didn't want to use your money.

670
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,350
If I stay home, I'd have to use your money.

671
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:30,550
You... Are you really going to talk to me like that?

672
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,590
So... Don't send money home.

673
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,040
Because of your money, our family's like this.

674
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,680
If it wasn't for you, Dad would also not be like that.

675
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,730
Hey. Cheon Yoon Jae! You-

676
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,060
Song Yi.

677
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,480
My daughter.

678
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,570
How much have you been hurt? Mom's here.

679
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,730
Aiyoo, my son. You must be so upset because
 your sister is hurt. Look at this expression.

680
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:12,820
These kids... They deeply care for each other.

681
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,620
Excuse me.

682
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,500
Ex-excuse me.

683
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,110
Song Yi!

684
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,860
Please don't do this!

685
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,440
Get out, Mom!

686
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,290
Everyone, please get out.

687
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:42,760
That girl... Her temper gets worse as she gets older.

688
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,830
Her face and body may resemble mine, 
but her personality doesn't.

689
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,540
I know, right?

690
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,990
Well, Mother, her contract will expire next month. 
You are going to renew the contract, right?

691
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:54,120
Since you are the one who has been 
signing the contract . . .

692
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:59,850
I don't know. Jeguk and Phantom have been calling me.

693
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,170
They're saying, hasn't she worked too long with the 
same company; ever since she was a child actress.

694
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,700
Saying that.. Isn't it the time to move to a different 'nest'?

695
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,530
What's so good to move the nest?

696
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,990
It's just troublesome, you know. 
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.

697
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,240
An old friend is a true friend.

698
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,560
Representative Ahn.

699
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,530
But you know...

700
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:21,690
I like new products.

701
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,190
Mother, should you and I go 
to the department store in a while?

702
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,310
I heard there are a lot of new products!

703
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,590
I heard Cheon Song Yi's is hospitalized here.

704
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,880
Really? Is she hurt somewhere?

705
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:55,490
 ♫ If you allow me again ♫

706
00:45:55,490 --> 00:46:03,090
 ♫ If I could see you again ♫

707
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:08,320
 ♫ In my past memories ♫

708
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:16,740
 ♫ In that pain, I cry out to you ♫

709
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:21,670
♬  You are my destiny.  ♬

710
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:29,290
♬  You.
You are my destiny.  ♬

711
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,650
♬  You.  ♬

712
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:31,890
 My daughter!

713
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:32,800
 Dad!

714
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,500
 Come here.

715
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,430
 It's cold. You should've waited for me inside.

716
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,860
 Did you get it?

717
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,010
 Of course, I did. My chicken ghost.

718
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:44,350
 Whether it's snow or rain, 
when something falls down from the sky,

719
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,830
 chicken and beer are definitely the best.

720
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:49,070
 This kid... You can't drink beer. Cola.

721
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,080
 I know, I know.

722
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,440
 This girl... 
When will you grow up

723
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,680
 to drink beer with me?

724
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,690
Ah, why am I like this?

725
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:30,600
 Director Hwang Ui Gyeong.

726
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:55,850
Hello?

727
00:47:55,850 --> 00:48:00,680
 Director, could you come up to my office for a minute?

728
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,880
Ah, yes. I will.

729
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,550
What?!

730
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,660
What happened to Director Hwang?!

731
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,440
I heard he died of cardiogenic shock due to hypoglycemia.

732
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,800
They think he overdosed on insulin.

733
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,460
How on earth did this happen?

734
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,650
Why did that happen?

735
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:27,830
It's not like it's just been a day or two 
since he has had diabetes.

736
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,990
He's not the type of person who would 
make such a mistake.

737
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,390
Get Driver Jang ready. Let's go straight to the funeral.

738
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,680
I got it.

739
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,870
I should look fragile and pure,
 but not shabby.

740
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:48,830
Okay.

741
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:50,600
Look.

742
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:54,780
Isn't my hair parted too precisely?

743
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,210
You know... A look which is kind of messy and frizzy, 
as if I just got out of bed.

744
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,750
But, with a sexy side to it...

745
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:05,400
You know those concepts when 
we make fabric softener commercials...

746
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,440
I will blow dry your hair again.

747
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,340
Noona, I looked everywhere, but couldn't find your heels.

748
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,340
Why wouldn't they be there?
 I wore them on my way to hospital.

749
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,310
I heard that professor took your stuff.

750
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:26,550
How come those heels are missing 
when everything else is there?

751
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,610
 Those heels...

752
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,070
 Are those yours?

753
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,040
What is this? I didn't think he was like  'that'.

754
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,850
Love has the weapon of sexual pleasure, 
which is based on sexual desire.

755
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:45,920
In the process, humans create the hottest and sweetest

756
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,010
fantasies.

757
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:53,140
All of you will, at some point, wonder
 whether love will last forever.

758
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:58,740
However, your love will not last forever.

759
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,430
The expiration date of love follows the law of nature.

760
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:05,130
And a person can never escape from that reality.

761
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,790
If love is something sacred,

762
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:11,160
it's because it maintains and reproduces species.

763
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,040
Nothing less or more than that.

764
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,460
Therefore, do not allow the 
precious things or people in your life to suffer

765
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:21,450
because of the brief illusions
 which are provided by love.

766
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,670
I told you to stop beeping me.

767
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:44,970
I'll tell you plainly. I hope 
you will delete my beeper number.

768
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,570
-- Confess.
-- Of what?

769
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,040
Where are my shoes?

770
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,840
Shoes?

771
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,190
How would I know?

772
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:58,060
I'm telling you my shoes went missing,
 but everything else is still there.

773
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:02,030
This is why we're not supposed to take care of 
black-headed animals.

774
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,950
I know nothing of it.

775
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,240
Are you seriously going to be like this?

776
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,060
I mean, I was thankful that you helped
 me at the hospital last time.

777
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:16,570
So I thought, "I had thought otherwise, 
but he seems like an okay person after all."

778
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,470
But are you going to hit me in the back of my head like this?

779
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,030
I really have no idea what you're saying.

780
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,800
What are you planning on using women's shoes for?!f

781
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,400
I told you I didn't take it!

782
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:40,130
I heard your younger brother is still 
really attached to Cheon Song Yi.

783
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:43,420
You try to stop him.

784
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,270
What for?

785
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,180
What do you mean "what for?"

786
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:50,310
You and I are getting married. So if your younger
 brother and Cheon Song Yi also get married,

787
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,810
then, that Cheon Song Yi and I will be related.

788
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,850
Ah! I hate her.

789
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:59,950
I...am getting married to you?

790
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,480
Then, are you not going to?

791
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,830
It's been a year since we've been 
seeing each other like this.

792
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:08,610
It's just that we've always met secretly like this, 
so people don't know about us.

793
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:12,370
Dispatch doesn't seem to be working hard lately.
 Dispatch: celebrity gossip media

794
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,460
When there's a jackpot source like this.

795
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,100
Why?

796
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,480
Do you want to let others know?

797
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,460
What? 
Are you saying you won't marry?

798
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:32,310
If you wouldn't, then let's just break up.

799
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:42,710
And, if you don't want that either, then let's marry.

800
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:49,090
Are you perhaps like this because of your ex-wife?

801
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:52,860
I'm different from that woman. You know that.

802
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,460
And also,

803
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,910
everything that I know,

804
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:05,690
I won't ever tell other people.

805
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:17,290
Oh, I received an invitation to attend
 Noh Seo Yeong's wedding.

806
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,330
L Group's second son is your friend, right?

807
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,440
Yeah.

808
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,100
You received an invitation, too, right? Let's go together.

809
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,320
All right. Let's do that.

810
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:36,180
Is it because you suffered after the surgery? 
I think you've gotten prettier after losing weight.

811
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,690
It is like that, right?

812
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:41,940
I get so much prettier when I go to other people's weddings.

813
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,360
That's why people always curse at me during weddings;
 calling me a complete and utter nuisance.

814
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,640
Is that so?

815
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,940
Then, shall we make you a little less pretty today? 
If you go just like this, you'll be a nuisance to the bride.

816
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:59,450
I'll show them today what being a nuisance really is.

817
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:04,200
Ah, but Noh Seo Yeong, this wench, why would 
she have her wedding on a cruise ship?

818
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,430
Does she expect me to freeze to death
in this cold weather wearing a dress or what?

819
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,150
They say it's because of security.

820
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:12,990
Even if she holds it at an elite hotel, there 
are always ways for people to secretly sneak in.

821
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,090
You've here?

822
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:16,180
Yes.

823
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,880
But, they didn't have your size.

824
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:23,220
And, this is the only size.

825
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:27,660
I really thought I was going to die, just 
trying to get my hands on these.

826
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,040
I have no choice, then.

827
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:35,030
I had to lose those perfectly fine ones.

828
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,810
Can you give me my phone?

829
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,650
Yes.

830
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:42,050
Here you go.

831
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:47,250
 If you'd like to send a page, press 1.
If you like to record a message, press 2.

832
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,110
Excuse me, Professor Do Min Joon,

833
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,480
it's I, Cheon Song Yi.

834
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,900
I bought those shoes again, after going 
through a lot of trouble for them.

835
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,690
I'm overlooking this matter this time because of 
the favor I owe you from last time.

836
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,340
But please apologize to me sincerely at some point in time.

837
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:07,380
I still really don't understand why you took them.

838
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,990
You.

839
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:15,180
I told you not to pass before my eyes, right?

840
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,430
I told you I didn't want to.

841
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:23,400
What should we do? It seems like we'll see
 each other at the wedding today, too.

842
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,770
While I'm saying it nicely,

843
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:27,180
don't come.

844
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,620
Why?

845
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:33,460
Are you afraid only my pictures will come out in the
 articles even  though you've groomed yourself so prettily?

846
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,520
You put in a lot of effort. Why?

847
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,070
Have some confidence.

848
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:38,670
Hey!!

849
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,170
Oh, right.

850
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,840
Director Ma Jong Bong's movie made me an offer.

851
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:48,160
I heard that you really wanted to do it even if you have to  reduce the guaranteed compensation.

852
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,880
I didn't want to lose Director Ma's offer either, so I 
said I would do it after cutting the guarantee.

853
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,120
I thought that would be the only way to not run into you
 as much, if I were to go to the Cannes.

854
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:12,490
I'll either kill that bitch or kill myself!

855
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,180
 It's I, Cheon Song Yi.

856
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,620
 I bought those shoes again after going 
though a lot of trouble for them.

857
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:26,440
 I'm overlooking this matter this time because of 
the favor I owe you from last time,

858
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,090
 but please apologize sincerely at some point in time.

859
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:34,400
 I still don't really understand why you took them.

860
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:37,470
 The Wedding of the Century

861
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,450
Yes, right now, we are at the wedding of 
actress Noh Seo Yeong and

862
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,710
the 2nd son of the L Group's Chairman, Jang Hwae Chul,

863
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,840
Mr. Jang Joon Young, which is being held on a cruise ship.

864
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,250
Amid tight security, many elite business leaders and

865
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,770
big stars (celebs) are entering right now.

866
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:54,440
Do you see the massive crowd of reporters now?

867
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,930
As I'm speaking, actress Cheon Song Yi is entering.

868
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,670
Let's go see.

869
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:06,070
 Entrance of Korean stars in the entertainment industry

870
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:31,700

871
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,190
You ask why I don't believe in love?

872
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,650
I totally believe in it.

873
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:37,730
There were a lot of people back then, too.

874
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:43,100
Saying that they were in love, where class didn't matter. 
A madam and a servant had an affair and fled in the night.

875
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:47,010
But the love that they put their lives
 on the line for didn't even last 3 years.

876
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:51,140
The madam ended up chasing after the servant who is having an affair, with a hoe in her hand.

877
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,320
A proposal?

878
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:57,320
Someone singing a song just for me?

879
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,690
While kneeling?

880
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:03,490
People who get on their knees and sing and beg for marriage,

881
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:04,750
they're so childish.

882
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,940
They're doing it for the childish taste. That's what love is.

883
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,620
Love cannot defeat time.

884
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,910
A love that defeats everything,

885
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:13,570
I think I will be able to meet someone like that soon.

886
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,670
If I do meet him, then I'll surely get married, too.

887
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,400
It's time for me to marry, isn't it?

888
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:23,390
 Are you saying she eventually
 went aboard that boat wearing those shoes?

889
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:27,170
 Are you confident that you will be okay if
 something bad really does happen to that person?

890
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,680
 Song Yi disappeared.

891
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,030
 We can't find her no matter how hard we look.

892
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:32,040
 How am I supposed to believe that?

893
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,750
 When this man disappeared, 
Cheon Song Yi disappeared, too.

894
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,630
 Something weird really did happen to me that night.

895
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:40,200
 Were you, perhaps, there that day?
