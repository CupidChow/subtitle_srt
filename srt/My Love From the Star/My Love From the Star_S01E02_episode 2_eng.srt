1
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,990

2
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,400
 All right! All right!

3
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,610
 It's yut!

4
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,300
 4 nyang to 10 nyang, 10 nyang to 16 nyang!

5
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,410
Here... Put down money and eat up money. 
Any children, go away.

6
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,460
Here... try guessing, please.

7
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,800
This one!

8
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,330
Here...

9
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,170
What the!

10
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,830
What do we do? Here it is!

11
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,630
Aigoo, what do we do about this?

12
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,770
Putting money on and taking money back. 
This isn't a game that comes everyday!

13
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,190
This is...

14
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,090
the money for my daughter's medicine.

15
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,320
If I lose this, I'm going to throw myself 
into the Han River and die.

16
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,370
Here... Here...

17
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,240
Here...

18
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,510
This!

19
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,240
Then, the result is...

20
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,750
What the!

21
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,070
Die from hanging oneself by the neck, 
die from falling into the water,

22
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,110
die from starving, die from crying...

23
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,200
Really... they sure died from every kind of method.

24
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,080
Why does mother want me to copy out this Book of Loyal Widows?

25
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,170
What? Is she telling me to follow 
my husband and die too or what?

26
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:42,270
Why should I? It's already unfair that I became a widow 
in my prime, at the age of fifteen.

27
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,050
Sir.

28
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,370
Aren't you the person who helped me that time?

29
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,860
Your appearance was different, 
so I was unable to recognize you immediately.

30
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,550
But,

31
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,590
what brings you here?

32
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,530
Perhaps,

33
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,690
just a moment ago too, was it you who helped me?

34
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,440
Really, how should I offer my gratitude...

35
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,090
Today, I'd like to ask for your name, at the very least.

36
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,590
My name is Seo Yi Hwa.

37
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,940
This hairpin is an important folk artifact.

38
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,740
The official designation is "Crystal Bamboo Hairpin."

39
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,840
They made the head by polishing a crystal 
to resemble a bamboo tree root.

40
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,700
They rolled up the copper and inserted it as the body.

41
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,580
Originally, that portion too would have been crystal, but

42
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,920
while we do not know the cause,

43
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,270
it broke and became lost.

44
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,520
We're assuming that it was created around early 1600.

45
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,070
There's nothing known about the owner of the hairpin.

46
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,920
For reference,

47
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,470
all the artifacts displayed in this room were,

48
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,280
at the time our school was established - 1914,

49
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,870
said to be donated by an anonymous sponsor.

50
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,430
Since there were many artifacts that were 
so meaningful and valuable,

51
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,360
they moved heaven and earth trying to find the donor.

52
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,420
Ultimately, it is said that they could not find the person.

53
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,350
 My Love From the Star 
Episode 2

54
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,280
Hey there.

55
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,250
Earlier, at the school, I was a bit taken aback.

56
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,370
I didn't say what I had to say properly.

57
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,820
If I don't say everything I want to say, it's my personality 
to start a martial art kick even while asleep.

58
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,160
I wanted to say how about saying a bit
 when we run into each other.

59
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,950
You don't even respond when a person is talking to you?

60
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,630
Well, anyway . . .

61
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,490
How old are you?

62
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,220
Do I have to answer?

63
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,960
Look at this! He is even speaking informally. 
 (His speech is rude.)

64
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,890
Of course, I do have an extreme baby face.

65
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,130
Even so, the day after tomorrow, I'll be thirty years old.

66
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,590
I don't know with whose backing you became 
a college professor at your young age,

67
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,280
but, since I have a few years on you,
 informal speech is a bit...

68
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,260
Acting like a dam during the year of Byungja.
( He's using descriptions from long time ago)

69
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm trying to talk nicely and you're...

70
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,390
Did you just call me  Nyeon  (bitch)?

71
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,410
The 13th year of Gojong's reign was the year of Byungja.
( "year" - homophone for "bitch" )

72
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,620
What did you say?

73
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,750
That year was extremely dry, so anything worthy of 
being a dam in Joseon's eight provinces, all ran dry.

74
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,420
People called them Gun (dry) Bangjuk (dike, embankment)
 (Gunbang = arrogant, intended pun to call her arrogant.)

75
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,350
Now, is he doing  Following Folklore over 3000 Li's   or something?  ( A collection of Korean folkore )

76
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,780
What are you saying?
What do you mean Gunbangjuk?

77
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,540
Gun Bangjuk.

78
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,860
That became the root for the present-day word 'arrogant.'

79
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,430
So during that time, people behaving recklessly without knowing their subject matter, were described as such.

80
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,830
Acting like an arrogant dam in the year of Byungja.

81
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,730
So right now...
 They're not even current insults,

82
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,450
but insults from the Joseon era...?!

83
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,510
Hey, there! Look here. Look here for a bit!
HEY!

84
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,410
How could there be a crazy one like th...!

85
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,870
Ah, really.

86
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,380
Who is he to care if I act arrogant or not?

87
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,530
He's one to say something like the year of Byungja, really.

88
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:30,300

89
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,330
Just like twelve years ago,

90
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,230
wouldn't it be that you're seeing in advance
what will happen in the future?

91
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,310
It could also be some kind of sign being sent,
 as the time to leave draws near.

92
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,780
What sign?

93
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,580
I mean, since you only have 3 months left here on Earth,

94
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,260
before you leave,

95
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:12,060
with your special abilities, you should help
 those in need or some sort.

96
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,370
Help those who are having a difficult time.

97
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,380
Then, would anything change?

98
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,320
Pardon?

99
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,670
Without knowing anything, there was a time I did do that.

100
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,630
 You can have my child. How much would you give me?

101
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,710
 This person came again!
If you don't have money, you should go away!

102
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,290
 Because of  this, I've lost my house,
 and my wife has run away too.

103
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,280
 All that I have now is this sick daughter. 
So I should at least exchange her for something else!!

104
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,170
 This crazy bastard!

105
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,350
 Father!

106
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,160
 You should've stopped when you won some money.
Someone like you!

107
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,040
 Father!

108
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,730
 You shouldn't have made money
 (from gambling) then!

109
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,140
 - You've been crazy gambling since then!
 It serves you right, you punk! 
-- Father, why are you like this?

110
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,340
 That beggar-like bastard!

111
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,280
Although I might have helped briefly, 
there wasn't anything that improved.

112
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,340
In the end, things that were bound to happen did happen.
Bad things. . .

113
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,540
became even worse.

114
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,670
What special?

115
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,970
It's a Cheon Song Yi's special.

116
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,170
I'm special from deep down in my bones.

117
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,770
As if people won't know I'm special
 if I don't do that kind of thing?

118
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,520
They do. The whole nation knows.

119
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,970
But, there are some thoughtless people
 still doubting you.

120
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,080
Saying that you're going to school is all for show.

121
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,460
But then, if a day in your life is revealed,

122
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,500
then those talks will go away.
You could have a more friendly image-

123
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,070
What's good about making a more friendly image? 
To become a president of neighborhood home association or something?

124
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,750
But, still, Noona, in order to put this deal together,
Representative Ahn worked really...

125
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,940
Forget it. I won't do it.

126
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,830
If you don't do it, I heard Han Yoo Ra will do it.

127
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,430
What?

128
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,670
I heard from her coordinator that they are
 just waiting for you to decline this offer.

129
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,650
It will become Han Yoo Ra's special.

130
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,640
Oh my! What on earth!

131
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,710
Hey! How is she special?

132
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,460
If she does it, it wouldn't be "Han Yoo Ra's Special."

133
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,450
It will be "Han Yoo Ra's Nooooormal", noooormal, really!

134
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,400
Wow! Our Noona's English has improved!

135
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,980
It was worth having a native speaker 
as her English teacher, for sure.

136
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,480
I am doing this because I am worried for Han Yoo Ra.

137
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,310
People will laugh hearing "Han Yoo Ra's Special."

138
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,440
When I got the best main actress award, 
at the Grand Bell Awards last time,

139
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,560
what did she get?

140
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,060
The Popularity Award?

141
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,900
But Han Yo Ra got the best main actress award 
at the Blue Dragon Awards, instead of you.

142
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,840
It's Representative Ahn's birthday soon, right?
I think I should give him a birthday gift ahead of time.

143
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,710
Tell him, I will do it.
That special or whatever.

144
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,490
Really, Noona?

145
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,370
Yeah.

146
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,830
It's not a bad idea to have a friendly image sometimes,
especially when the public wants something.

147
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,570
I'll do it then.

148
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,990
She's doing it?

149
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,360
Yes.

150
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,480
Cheon Song Yi said she would be doing it.

151
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,990
You said it looked as if she wouldn't do it. Why?

152
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,070
I don't know for sure either.

153
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,090
You really wanted to do that special.

154
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,140
What should we do?

155
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,900
Shut up!

156
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,380
It's been a long time, Unni.

157
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,300
You, aren't you working these days?

158
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,740
Why? I am doing a drama.

159
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,860
The drama that Cheon Song Yi is in.
You're in it, right?

160
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,130
What was your role again?

161
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,200
Oh, right!

162
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,530
You are close with Cheon Song Yi, right?

163
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,480
Yes. Well. . .

164
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,050
Cheon Song Yi, did you know she's 
filming a special documentary?

165
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,930
I heard.

166
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,510
No. . .

167
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,810
Doesn't she dislike those kind of things?

168
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,490
Why is she suddenly doing it?

169
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,940
I'm not so sure either.

170
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,150
But then . . .

171
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,530
Although Song Yi doesn't mind me,

172
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,460
she really minds you a lot.

173
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,620
What do you mean?

174
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,840
I, well, am not fit to be her rival.

175
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,440
So, she befriends me and is nice to me,

176
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,510
but it says she sees you as her rival.

177
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,760
What are you saying?
Say it in a way that I would understand.

178
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:56,690
Even a dress that she wasn't planning to wear, if  
she hears you are going to wear it, she'll reserve it first.

179
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,980
Even a drama that she wasn't going to do, 
if you say you want to do it, she rushes to sign a contract.

180
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:07,060
That's Cheon Song Yi. In a way, she's like a child.

181
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,230
What is this, then?

182
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,480
This time too, knowing that I wanted to do it...

183
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,520
Is that why she's doing it, is that it?

184
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,070
Oh, could it be?

185
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,980
It's Cheon Song Yi!

186
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,780
Hello!

187
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,550
You're working hard this early.

188
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,550
You're going to ride a bike (to campus)?

189
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,850
Oh, usually, I use the bike 
when I don't have any event scheduled.

190
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,200
I'm the ambassadress of "Protect the Green Forests," 
you know.

191
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,660
 As expected.

192
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,000
By the way, I don't have any make-up on 
since I was in a hurry.

193
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:15,380
And, you're already filming me? 
This program is going to be really realistic.

194
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,760
 Make it look like I don't have any make-up on.
No make-up.

195
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,270
 That's even harder.

196
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,090
 Hey, you can only be called a real pro 
when you can do something difficult.

197
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,000
 That damned HDTV! It's a horrible world where even
 the sebum (oil) of your nose can be seen clearly.

198
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:39,740
 Just because people want to see the bare face
 if you actually go bare faced, you'll get buried alive.

199
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:46,390
 No pores can be seen. Make it look moist and silky. 
Thinking that you're doing photoshop using make-up, okay?

200
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,840
I came out after having washed my face only.

201
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,480
I should have applied some lotion, at least.

202
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,040
You're pretty already.

203
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,710
Oh, my! Really?

204
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,180
How do you usually do your beauty regimen?

205
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,280
I don't do anything special.
I smile a lot, eat healthy. . .

206
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,790
And have positive thoughts?
 I think those are most important.

207
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,750
Also, I have some things I always take. 
They are vitamins and

208
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,870
Omega ttthree.

209
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,690
Ah, and I also use propofol.

210
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,010
Seriously, I think the results are amazing.

211
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,350
I feel like my body is flying.
 My mood gets better, too.

212
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,700
Excuse me.

213
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,930
Just a second, Director, I think there is a misunderstanding.

214
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,820
Noona! What do you mean Propofol?

215
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,290
What? I take it everyday recently. 
You told me it's anti-aging.

216
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,970
Unni! That is Propolis! The one you bought 
when you went to Australia last time.

217
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,100
That's right. Are the two very different?
 Aren't they sister-product?

218
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,120
No! Do you want to present yourself
 at the police station?!

219
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,370
Did you just yell at me?

220
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,980
No.

221
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,850
No way. Wait a bit, Noona.

222
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:14,120
PD-nim! She must have confused 
Propofol and Propolis.

223
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,100
Isn't our Noona so cute?

224
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,420
You'll edit it, right?

225
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,140
This situation is fun though.

226
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,660
I know, right. 
It's such a waste to throw it away.

227
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,470
Just because it is fun for a moment, 
an actress could be affected.

228
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,990
Don't take pictures. 
Don't take pictures.

229
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,710
Do you usually get along well with your classmates or  
your sunbaes and hoobaes (seniors and juniors)?

230
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,770
Of course.

231
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,700
I may be a star (celeb) outside. 
But, at school, I'm just

232
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,440
an ordinary student.

233
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,270
  Lee Hyeon Soo, D.O.B.: 1987.05.17 (age 27) ... 
I've been hanging out comfortably with older &amp; younger alums alike.

234
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,710
In the direction of 2 o'clock. Blue shirt. Same major. 
Lee Hyeon Soo.

235
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,540
Oh my, Hyeon Soo.

236
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,520
Me?

237
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,410
Yeah, Lee Hyeon Soo.

238
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,410
We should go eat together sometime.

239
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,760
With me? But why?

240
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,800
I will call you.

241
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,860
Call me? But why?

242
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,360
In the direction of 6 o'clock, Park Young Ha.

243
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,640
Hey, Young Ha.

244
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,550
- Professor. 
 -- PROFESSOR!

245
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,930
You look younger every time I see you.

246
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,710
So young that I want to call you "Young Ha". 
(In Korea, students usually don't call professors 
by their first names)

247
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,700
You've been doing well, right?

248
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,960
Edit this, please.

249
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,710
Ms. Cheon Song Yi.

250
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:07,980
Yes?

251
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,110
It seems like you don't know my class policies
 because you've not come to my class.

252
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:19,170
When you write essays in my class, you cannot plagiarize, copy-and-paste or mash-up things, ever.

253
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,910
But you did them all.

254
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,520
 Noona, really, even a ghost won't know this.

255
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,850
 We copied and put it together from 
so many different sources.

256
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,900
 It's done by an expert. He won't know. 
He will never find out.

257
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,800
No, it's not. I didn't do that.

258
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,820
Your introduction on the first page is from 
a thesis published in 1999.

259
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,860
"Using Davidson's philosophical psychology 
and comet theory

260
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,540
and seeing terms of cause in the logic of love".

261
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,840
You copied the whole thing.

262
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,580
"Love is not an option, but a condition."

263
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,420
"What is the mind is human nature."

264
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,170
Even exact quotes are included.

265
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,580
And the following cases and examples are from

266
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,850
a thesis published in 1996,

267
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,800
"Love Attitude Scale".

268
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,620
With great technique, you did an 
amazing job with cutting and pasting.

269
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,830
From a thesis published in 1959,

270
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,110
"Empirical Reason of Love,"

271
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,540
you copied and pasted its conclusion exactly as is.

272
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,210
You also skillfully plagiarized some research articles.

273
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,180
Reporter Kim Ki Suk's article that was published in  The World of Thought  (Sasangge Monthly) in November, 1953.

274
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,890
Titled, "Phenomenology of Love, Eros and Agape".

275
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,350
Therefore, this essay gets a zero.

276
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,230
Do you have any objections?

277
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,130
It's a zero, zero.

278
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,850
Aish, seriously...

279
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,980
Hey, did you see Cheon Song Yi's expression earlier?

280
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,300
 What a sight! I took a video, you know.

281
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,940
 "This essay gets a zero."

282
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,770
Awesome! Upload it on the notice board!

283
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,350
Hey, it will totally explode with viewers!

284
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,850
 Title: Zero Song Yi.

285
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,720
Look at how fast hate comments are being updated.
 It's LTE, LTE!

286
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,880
 "Cheon Song Yi, who's gotten botox on her brain.
Now, plagiarism even?"

287
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,580
 "Of course, no common sense or brain."

288
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,070
 So you are saying that I don't have
 common knowledge or common sense,

289
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,330
 right now. No common sense. No brain.

290
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,860
- How embarrassing!
-- I know, right? 
 - If I were her, I wouldn't be able to keep my head up.

291
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:42,290
 Even though I only had an apple and half of a
 cabbage leaf all day because I'm on a diet, I'm still full.

292
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,860
 Because I swallowed so much cursing 
from people that my stomach could burst.

293
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,040
 - Hey, hey, hey. Post it somewhere else again.
-- Okay, should I post it here? 
- Yeah.

294
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,800
What are you doing?

295
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,450
I don't know. It just dropped by itself.

296
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,490
Hey, is your cell phone haunted or something?

297
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,620
"Cheon Song Yi. Freakin' humiliated in classroom. 
Have you heard the news?"

298
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,580
"That professor should be praised. ㅋㅋㅋㅋ."

299
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,710
 Cheon Song Yi is a human being after all. 
Don't you think she can make mistakes, too?

300
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,900
 "Ms. Cheon Song Yi. You shouldn't be posting here."

301
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,130
Well, Noona.

302
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,790
'Even a ghost won't know?'

303
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,600
Is that person a ghost then?

304
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,460
Ah, really. How did he know?

305
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,250
That was something he absolutely couldn't have known.

306
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,790
Get out. Leave me alone.

307
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,560
Why are you like this, Noona?

308
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,940
Just beat me like any other day. 
That will ease my mind.

309
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,270
Forget it. It's because I really want to be alone for a bit.

310
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,970
Please get out.

311
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,790
 Korea card (0*5*)Ms. Cheon * Yi. 12/20 14:30 
Paid in full $3200 Royal Department Store

312
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,540
Unni.

313
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,240
I get to see you here.

314
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,830
But what are you doing, Unni?

315
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,780
Would I be praying at a department store?

316
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,750
I've been shopping a bit.

317
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,880
There are many cheap items.
Why don't you pick up some, too?

318
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,760
But do you have time to do that? 
Don't you need to go?

319
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,910
Go where?

320
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,280
Unni, perhaps... You don't know?

321
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,990
Know what?

322
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,130
I heard they're shooting "Cheon Song Yi's Special."

323
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:46,210
When they previously filmed other people,
 they included the house and families too.

324
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,170
So, aren't you doing interviews, Unni?

325
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,970
You're still her mom.

326
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,610
Oh, that.

327
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,120
I agreed to do it, of course.

328
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,820
We are going to shoot a segment where I 
eat together with Song Yi and In Jae.

329
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,210
By the way,

330
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,950
will my Son-in-law Lee come, too?

331
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,810
My Hui Kyeong.

332
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,450
They are not even dating yet. Don't you think 
you're going too far by calling him Son-in-law Lee?

333
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,200
Hey, it's only because my Song Yi hasn't said "Okay."

334
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,050
When she says "Okay," it will go directly to marriage
without going through annoying dates and such.

335
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,540
But this girl is playing hard to get.

336
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,480
I feel so sorry to my Son-in-law Lee, seriously.

337
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,700
His title is the 2nd son of

338
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,130
S &amp; C Group, you know.

339
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,930
Aish, what kind of a bastard gave my Song Yi a zero?

340
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,690
 My Song Yi~♡

341
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,750
Well, should we each have a cup of coffee?

342
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,420
Cafe latte for me.

343
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,230
Choco latte for me.

344
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,390
Chamomile tea for me.

345
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,130
Cafe mocha for me.

346
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,310
Americano for me.

347
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,130
Rookie?

348
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,450
Yes?

349
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,340
Cafe latte for General Manager, choco latte for Manager Kim, chamomile tea for Assistant Manager Na,

350
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,180
cafe mocha for Assistant Manager Choi, and
 cafe mocha for me. Did you not hear that by chance?
-- Ah!

351
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,540
Milk tea for me, then.
   Where are you Song Yi?  I'm almost done with my wo...

352
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,370
Rookie.

353
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,180
Rookie?

354
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,420
I will drink it well! (Thanks for the drink!)
  Should I go to where you are?

355
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,500
- Hey, rookie, you!
 -- Hello?

356
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,800
Yeah, Se Mi.

357
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
- No, no, no. 
-- You-

358
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,580
- I'm fine. We can talk.
 -- Where are you going? Rookie!

359
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,260
- What the-
 -- General Manager,

360
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,450
You know I'm an expert with that kind of a person. 
So, don't get upset.

361
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,920
I will take care of it within my purview.

362
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,780
Today? What kind of a day is it today?

363
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,370
That's right. It's my birthday.

364
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,810
If you're sorry, buy me dinner.

365
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,170
 Of course, you're my best friend.

366
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,730
 Be prepared.
 I will buy you the most expensive food I know.

367
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,810
Really?

368
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,090
We should call Cheon Song Yi, too.

369
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,870
Song Yi will be busy today.

370
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,140
You saw that she's been talked about on-line all day.

371
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,890
When she's sensitive, it's better we leave her alone.

372
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,050
 Is that so?

373
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,510
Of course. I know Cheon Song Yi well, you know.

374
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,950
 Okay. When does filming end? I will pick you up.

375
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,650
Around 8PM? Alright.

376
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,940
We're here.

377
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,270
Customer?

378
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:11,440

379
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,350
Don't ask for a discount. Just buy it full price.

380
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,850
Just buy with a billion and give President Oh 2 million.

381
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,840
Okay!

382
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,050
- You are here? -- I'm here!

383
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,870
What took you so long?

384
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,260
Ah, it feels like my eyes will rot.

385
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,660
I need to purify my eyes (by looking at hot guys).

386
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,710
This girl becomes the number one 
searched person as easily as someone eating.

387
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,290
Aigoo... hateful comments...

388
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,530
I am Cheon Song Yi's

389
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,690
middle and high school classmate.

390
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,970
It seems you have some 
misunderstandings about Cheon Song Yi.

391
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,350
She didn't start being rude because 
she became famous, everyone.

392
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:07,000
Her rudeness was pounded into her from the beginning.

393
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,380
- Is it something exciting? 
- Huh?

394
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:22,950

395
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,020
What is this all of a sudden?

396
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,520
I moved into this neighborhood.

397
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,970
Why?

398
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,560
You don't like it?

399
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,550
No way is that possible.

400
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,610
Here, eat it.

401
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,740
Can you just eat ramen like that?

402
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,840
You don't have a shoot tomorrow?

403
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,340
Just pour some soju.

404
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,830
I saw it on the internet.

405
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,100
Is it because you got a zero?

406
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,890
You got a similar score in high school once, too.

407
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,360
Wasn't it a 4 on a math test?

408
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,500
I told you to fill in at least one row and you didn't listen.

409
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,960
It's not because I got a zero, Bok Ja. I...

410
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,970
I'm sorry for interrupting you.  But it's been 10 
years since I registered for a new name.

411
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,150
So, will you call me Hae In?

412
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,160
I can't understand it.

413
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,750
Why do people say they like me in front of my face,

414
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,670
and then hate me from behind?

415
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,360
Just why on earth would they do that, Bok Ja?

416
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,680
That's because you choose to do 
all the things that deserve...

417
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,840
I don't know. Why would they do that?

418
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,670
Awful bastard.

419
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,330
Who?

420
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,020
Is it my turn now?

421
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,110
I'm like this... Wait a sec.

422
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,660
I'm sorry.

423
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,900
It's come.

424
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,690
It's unbeatable.

425
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,640
What?

426
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,930
Wow, this...

427
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,970
This is just unbearable.

428
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,430
Where did a young person learn something like this?

429
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,270
Are you his father?

430
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,230
Excuse me?

431
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,280
Ah, yes.

432
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,000
Are you perhaps...

433
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,380
Kim Woo San?

434
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,170
 Eight!

435
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,050
 Kim Woo San, you . . .

436
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,330
 Do you not even eat and just play mahjong?

437
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,200
 How do you not lose even once?

438
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,490
Are you Kim Woo San's grandson?

439
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,870
That person is my father, who passed away.

440
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,730
And, this gentleman is...

441
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,090
is my son.

442
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,710
The grandson is exactly like his grandfather.

443
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,890
How can you be exactly like him?

444
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:43,150
It seems like he has all my father's mahjong skills.

445
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:47,230
Skills, yeah right! I won against him all the time.

446
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,250
Your grandfather

447
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,020
always lost to me.

448
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,220
I don't see how that's possible.

449
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,290
From what I heard, my grandfather

450
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,050
was Gyeongseong province's greatest mahjong player.

451
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,980
Yeah, right!

452
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,820
Gyeongseong's greatest mahjong player was me!

453
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,030
It seems as though your grandfather lied.

454
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,590
From what I know,

455
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,220
he's not someone who would lie about that.

456
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,860
Then, are you saying I'm lying, right now?

457
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,120
Without a doubt, Gyeongseong's 
greatest mahjong player was me!

458
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,570
I, who lived at that time, would know better.

459
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,190
Did you see it?

460
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,130
Did you see your grandfather 
beat me? I asked, did you see it?

461
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,860
I even remember his name, Kang Sam Shik.

462
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,060
That friend was so good at insisting back then, too.

463
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,200
But 60 years have gone by.

464
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,220
I guess people really don't change after all.

465
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,750
It seems like funny things do happen as we live on.

466
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,840
That time seemed like it was just yesterday.

467
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,070
Is that so?

468
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,810
Whether we live 80 years or 100 years,

469
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,350
there's no person that would say life is long enough.

470
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:09,640
Everyone says it feels as short as taking a nap.

471
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,490
Even though I've lived here for 400 years, 
now that I look back,

472
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,140
I don't have many memories to take back with me.

473
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,200
There's that one you mentioned last time, isn't there?

474
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,200
The child you met 12 years ago.

475
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,240
I'm looking for her right now.

476
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,480
There were three middle schools in that neighborhood.

477
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,180
If I look at the graduation photos from around that time,

478
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,360
I thought that she might be among them.

479
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,360
Even though it's not a definitive method.

480
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,430
You don't need to go that far.

481
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,780
But you said you wanted to see 
her once more before you leave...

482
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,050
I am curious, indeed.

483
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,580
But...

484
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,110
If there is a reason for us to meet,

485
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,470
then, don't you think we will?

486
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,510
If I leave, without meeting her,

487
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,800
then, it will be because there was no reason to.

488
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,080
Having lived here for a long period of time,

489
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,980
that's what I've learned.

490
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,790
 The password you have entered is incorrect.

491
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,990
No way.

492
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:13,150
2832.

493
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,800
 The password you have entered is incorrect.

494
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,990
But why?

495
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,590
Just stay there and don't fall down.

496
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,270
You aren't going to listen to this unni?

497
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:36,780
If you keep falling, I'll look like a ghost, 
especially because I'm wearing white.

498
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,260
Hmm.

499
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,160
Again.

500
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,910
 2832.

501
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,890
 It is now locked-out.

502
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,310
You locked it?

503
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,120
You dare lock me out?

504
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,570
 Open...Sesame!

505
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Open...Sesame!

506
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,300
 Open...Sesame!

507
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,510
Open...Sesame!

508
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,960
It really opened.

509
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,660
Of course it opened, since I opened it.

510
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,000
Hey, Insult Master of Joseon.

511
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,760
-I'm not someone who insults.
-Hey, Insult Master!

512
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,830
Why are you in my house?

513
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,260
Because this isn't your house, it's mine.

514
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:38,080
Does it feel good? After giving
 me a zero and utter humiliation,

515
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,000
does it feel good? You seem like the type

516
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,530
that would bleed blue 
 if someone were to stab you.

517
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:48,140
You punk who wouldn't even put chewed gum 
in a donation box...

518
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,390
Look here, Miss Cheon Song Yi.

519
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,370
What? Are you the only one who can insult in Joseon?

520
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,010
I do it, too!

521
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,190
You, who'd throw a jukbang in the year of Byungja!

522
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,120
-It's not a jukbang (punch). It's a bangjuk (dike, dam). 
-Ah, whatever!

523
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,810
Where do you think you're entering?

524
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,720
What? How can you tell me something like that only now?

525
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,840
Then you haven't been able to contact her
 since the afternoon?

526
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,840
 Yes. She won't pick up her phone 
no matter how many times we call her.

527
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,560

528
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,760
- Who is it? 
 - Who...

529
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,110
Who are you? 
Why are you picking up Song Yi's phone...

530
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,910
Put Cheon Song Yi on the phone!

531
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,750
Why is she...

532
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,050
Why is she sleeping next door, 
instead of in her own house?

533
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,100
If a person mistakenly

534
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,310
comes into your house, isn't it appropriate for you
 to quietly send her home?

535
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,050
Especially when the woman has come in completely drunk.

536
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,360
To send her home quietly, I picked up your call 
and let you into my house.

537
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,240
Isn't it appropriate for you to say thank you?

538
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,910
Song...

539
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,630
You definitely didn't do anything to my Song Yi, right?

540
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,290
Just hurry and remove her from my house.

541
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,680
What? Remove her?

542
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,180
This punk, look at the way you talk.

543
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,790
Is my Song Yi some kind of trash?

544
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,240
What is there to remove?

545
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,350
I can't let it go like this.

546
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,650
Hey, you punk.

547
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,350
Give me your cell phone.

548
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,070
I said, give me your cell phone.

549
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,980
You know Cheon Song Yi.

550
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,800
The hottest actress in Korea

551
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,960
came here like that, completely drunk. 
Who knows what kind of pictures you took?

552
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,870
Why should I believe you and leave obediently?

553
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,360
That's right, really.

554
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,630
According to what you just said, 
that woman is  famous and great.

555
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,910
So, why should I believe you and 
give her to you obediently?

556
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,590
Even though she's the hottest star in Korea,

557
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,370
right now, she's only a woman who is completely drunk. Who knows what you might do to her?

558
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:52,030
What? You bastard. 
 I'm her boyfriend.

559
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,770
Ah, shut up!

560
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:58,050
I'm sleeping.

561
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,650
Cheon Song Yi. Do you know you're
 sleeping in a man's house?

562
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,530
- Where am I? 
- That's what I want to ask you.

563
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,100
Stand up. One, two, three.

564
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,470
Get ahold of yourself.

565
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,870
Be careful there.

566
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,610
Ah..where..

567
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,400
Your house.

568
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,510
- Why did you follow me in? Go! 
- Because I'm concerned about you.

569
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:49,670
Even though you were out of your mind, 
how can you go into another person's house?

570
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:53,650
 What if he did something weird to you?

571
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:56,380
 Just looking at him, he didn't give off a good impression.

572
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,670
 I'm tired. I'm going to sleep, so you go now.

573
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:03,160
 I'll have a cup of coffee and go.

574
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,240
 No. Do you have a beer?

575
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,040
It's a cold day.

576
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,310
When should I go home?

577
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,930
Ah. Hey, is it already this late?

578
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,890
Do you want to die?

579
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,040
You weren't sleeping?

580
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,290
 - Hey. I'm going. I'm going to go. 
- Hurry and leave.

581
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:30,260
 Hey. I'm warning you. Don't hit the back of my head.

582
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,630
 I'm going to get annoyed. Hey! I said-

583
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,570
 Not the back of my head!

584
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,450
Ah. I'm going to go crazy!

585
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:51,600
Hello?

586
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,030
Is it Se Mi?

587
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,970
I'm sorry. I forgot.

588
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:01,310
No. Cheon Song Yi, that girl got drunk and
 went into the neighbor's house.

589
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,430
It's okay.

590
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,530
Shooting was taking long, so I was thinking 
we wouldn't be able to meet anyway.

591
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:12,350
Well then, we'll eat a meal next time.

592
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:18,270
Ah. I have to go back to shooting. I'll hang up.

593
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,030
Hyung.

594
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,470
You got out of work late.

595
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:41,660
Today was a volunteer service day at the 
abandoned dog protection center.

596
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,570
You're like Gandhi in the world of 
second-generation conglomerates.

597
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:49,600
In the Republic of Korea, which second-generation conglomerate does service work when there's no camera around?

598
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,770
Even though you've returned home,
 I hardly see your face.

599
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,500
I'm busy because of my woman whom I can't control.

600
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,350
Your woman? Yeah, right. 
You're always being dragged by her.

601
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,930
At least I have a woman who drags me around. 
But do you have anyone who comes even close to that?

602
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:05,300
Working everyday, are you not going to get married?

603
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,880
The heir of S &amp; C Group. Are you scared
 because you've already gone there before?

604
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,740
Did you go to work well?

605
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,410
People don't know about your background. 
So you do it well.

606
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:18,300
When you started, he gave you a position of a 
team leader.  I'm just a new recruit.

607
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,040
I thought eldest brother would inherit the company.

608
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,970
So, I'm someone who's never even
 received lessons on becoming the successor.

609
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,290
You know that, right? My dream 
was to become a veterinarian.

610
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,300
I know.

611
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,670
After that happened to eldest brother,
 I know you've worked hard.

612
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:37,050
So you also..

613
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,590
Hyung, you are a perfect person.

614
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,180
I can't follow you.  And,

615
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,540
I don't want to follow you.

616
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,750
Do you want to go in first?

617
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,330
- I have to take this call. 
- Okay.

618
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,270
  K

619
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,230
 Please save me. Get me out.

620
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:06,460
 I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. I swear.

621
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,480
 You're not a bad person like that.

622
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,880
Of course, I'm not a bad person.

623
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,850
More than those I've killed so far . . .

624
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,810
There are a lot more people that I've kept alive,
 even though I wanted them dead.

625
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,370
You belong to the latter.

626
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,990
So you shouldn't beg me,

627
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:30,130
but I hope you'll thank me.

628
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,800
You're the professor who gave my noona zero point.

629
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,120
Where is Cheon Song Yi?

630
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,890
Why are you suddenly looking for my noona?

631
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:36,220
So you're going to change noona's score?

632
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,390
Where is she right now?

633
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:18,290
Unni, did you get hit by something on your face?

634
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:19,430
Why?

635
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:22,170
Your face is immensely swollen.

636
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:25,750
Yesterday, I drank SoMaek (mixed drink of soju 
and beer). Also I ate ramen.

637
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,260
- Is my face swollen that much? 
- The angle's not coming out.

638
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,280
I think you should put aside shooting for today.

639
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,840
No. I can't. Yesterday I... Wait, just a second.

640
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:48,400

641
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,190
Hello, Unni.

642
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,980
Hey, move to a different hair salon.

643
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:09,890
Did you say that to me?

644
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,010
If you are stupid, does that mean you can't 
understand what I say either?

645
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,200
Who else is here besides you?

646
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,730
But why should I move to a different hair salon?

647
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,980
When I run into you,

648
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,690
I get pissed off.

649
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,550
That goes for me too. How about you switching?

650
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,910
How dare you talk back when your sunbae is talking?

651
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:32,710
I am sorry that I talked back to some old unni.

652
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,070
But, we should get something straight.

653
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:38,800
While It is true that you are older, 
you are not a sunbae.

654
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,440
What?

655
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,160
I debuted when I was 15.  So, it's been
 12 years since I started working.

656
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,870
Unni, from the time you debuted, 
hasn't it been about 5 years?

657
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:51,500
To be honest, I don't care about power or hierarchy,
 so I've never said anything.

658
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:56,560
But if we were to figure this out, I am the sunbae here.

659
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,900
I heard that you, originally,

660
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,460
didn't want to do the Cheon Song Yi special.

661
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,870
Only after you heard that I wanted to do it,
 you said you would do it.

662
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,140
Yes. How did you know?

663
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,850
Do you have some inferiority feelings toward me?

664
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,550
No, isn't that when one feels less worthy 
than another person?

665
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,080
I may be stupid, but I know that much.

666
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,940
What I feel towards you is superiority.

667
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:24,370
Oh really? You are so superior that

668
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:28,480
you only do some melodramas, 
that keep recycling those Cinderella stories?

669
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,920
You only pick out those ones?

670
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,800
When people gather these days,

671
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,680
they only talk badly about your drama.

672
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:41,530
But why is it that when people gather, 
they only talk about me or my dramas?

673
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,900
I guess there's nothing besides that.

674
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:48,150
I like it. Regardless if it's insulting
 or complimentary, it's better than

675
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:50,120
doing 4% dramas

676
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,130
that no one knows who starred in it or when it ended.

677
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:56,110
Are you now talking about my drama?

678
00:52:56,110 --> 00:53:01,240
Oh right. You finished that drama with 4% last month.

679
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,560
That's the one I turned down because
 I didn't want to do it.

680
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:08,140
Since it turned out so badly, I felt so sorry about it.

681
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:12,110
You, viewing percentage isn't everything.

682
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:15,470
My drama was praised for being so well-made.

683
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:19,490
Do you know how many people were dejected
 when my drama finished?

684
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,720
I know that many people were dejected over it.

685
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:27,200
But I heard the drama director became
 dejected too, after failing so badly.

686
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,320
Contact him and buy him a meal.

687
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,170
A person should have some sort of conscience.

688
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:33,490
Hey, you.

689
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,710
One more thing. Do you want me to tell you what I know?

690
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:42,570
I know that you are spreading some 
absurd information to tabloids to start a rumor.

691
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,720
I was going to sue you for defamation of character,

692
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,720
but I am trying to hold it in.

693
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,890
You didn't know, right?

694
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,030
So, do only so much.

695
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:15,260
You, I heard you're working hard 
at seducing S&amp;C's 2nd son.

696
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,690
Is that a rumor, also?

697
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:18,540
It's not a rumor, but the truth.

698
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,580
But, something's switched around.

699
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,840
It's not me, but him who's trying to flirt with me.

700
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:30,100
Oh, is that why?

701
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:34,190
Your mother, who made money 
by selling you and even receiving loans . . .

702
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,120
There are a lot of rumors in this field, saying
 she goes around even selling S&amp;C.

703
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,520
Saying that the person who is to become 
her son-in-law is that household's son.

704
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,430
Aren't you getting too far ahead of yourself?

705
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:48,220
Let's not mess with family.

706
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:55,780
Why? I'm just saying because I might become 
one of their family members.

707
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:01,670
You should stop making a fuss and admit that you 
can't swallow it all, then just give up already.

708
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,990
It's not that I can't swallow, but won't.

709
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,090
I guess you didn't know, but

710
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:16,690
I don't want to be pathetic like someone whose life improved through the help of someone else's money.

711
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,680
Because I make enough to support myself.

712
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,530
What? You-

713
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,530
What is this?

714
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,030
How did you come here?

715
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,450
Let's go.

716
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:36,420
Go where?

717
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,470
Hey, don't you see me talking to this her?

718
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,900
Don't get in the middle of it and get lost.

719
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,170
Do you know that I am so flabbergasted right now?

720
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:06,560
How did you even know I was here?

721
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,390
Why?

722
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:17,240
What? Is it because I went to your house
 accidentally yesterday because I was drunk?

723
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,930
Are you being like this now to argue about that?

724
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,200
It was a mistake.

725
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,640
Things like that can happen.

726
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,270
As one lives, one will drink. And when 
one drinks, one can get drunk.

727
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:33,190
And after one gets drunk, one will make mistakes.

728
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,210
Who is this?

729
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:41,050
- Why are you looking at someone else's picture 
without the person's permission?
- Who is this?!

730
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:43,600
Do I have to answer?

731
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:50,560
What are you doing right now? Are you crazy?

732
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:53,870
You.

733
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:57,060
Who are you?

734
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,760
 Regardless of whether you want it or not,

735
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,840
 things that are bound to happen will happen.

736
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:13,200
 Earthlings call this 'Fate.'

737
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:20,340
 ♫ You are my destiny. You. ♫

738
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:27,870
 ♫  You. You are my destiny. ♫

739
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:34,200
 ♫You are.  You are my destiny.♫

740
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,170
 My first love?

741
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,590
 Oh my, the question is so tacky!

742
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,190
 I've been on a couple of dates.

743
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:47,930
 But I've never had anyone to call a "first love."

744
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:52,290
 When I was young, there was a moment 
when I could've been in a big accident,

745
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:54,900
 but some ahjussi saved me.

746
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,890
 I can't remember his face in detail.

747
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:00,520
 But, he was quite tall, and the gentle and warm type?

748
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,110
 A style I like in a girl . . .

749
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:06,150
 I have none.  But, I have a style that I don't like.

750
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:09,010
  I definitely hate drunken women.

751
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,570
 And, women who have bad habits when they're drunk,
 I hate them even more.

752
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:16,410
 Women who act like they know everything. Women 
who act ignorantly or boast around, I dislike them a lot.

753
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,930
 There's a woman that I know

754
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,510
 who has all those features.  She's the worst.

755
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:28,460
 It was the best. Even if it was a short moment,

756
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,830
 it was very mysterious and yet, 
very warm at the same time.

757
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,120
 Even now, still I remember.

758
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:39,110
 I don't know if that ahjussi will remember me.

759
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:44,810
 But, if I see him, I think I would recognize him right away.

760
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,860
 Like fate.

761
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,490
 Cut. Okay.

762
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,350
 Great job.

763
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,950
 That jerk...

764
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,480
 Who is that man who grabbed you
 by the wrist and dragged you away?

765
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:15,550
 We know those feelings.
 I think he was trying to flirt with me.

766
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,040
 Reincarnation or doppelganger.

767
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,500
 Aren't you concerned about her?

768
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,640
 My stomach.
 I am the 'Goddess of Asia.'

769
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,500
 I'm not in good shape, so...

770
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:28,660
 Did you think I would accept those type of requests?

771
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,210
 You can't go. When I wake up, 
you have to be next to me.

772
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,550
 It means that the shoes' owner might die.

773
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:37,940
 Are you going to involve yourself
 like you did 12 years ago?

774
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,310
 Or are you going to turn away?
