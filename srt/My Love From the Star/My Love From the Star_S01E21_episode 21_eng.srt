1
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,920
The greatest power I possess

2
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,090
is stopping time.

3
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,990
You know how to do things like that?

4
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,590
Of course.

5
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,100
I am a more capable guy than you think.

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,300
For an uncountable number of times, I've stopped time,

7
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,400
and during those times that you do not know of,

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,040
I said this.

9
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,610
"I love you, Cheon Song Yi."

10
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,530
If I told you while time was flowing by,

11
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,270
I felt that everything would flow away

12
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,580
and disappear.

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,820
So...

14
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,860
I told you while time was stopped.

15
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,120
I love you, Cheon Song Yi.

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,670
I love you.

17
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,930
The you, in the time I know of,

18
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,460
also you, in the time I don't know of,

19
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,570
I love you.

20
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,790

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,330
400 years ago,

22
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,270
after I came to an unfamiliar star,

23
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,060
 there was a principle that I guarded absolutely
 from the beginning until now.

24
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,540
 If it is something that could be lost or
 difficult to endure,

25
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,240
 I must not possess it from the start.

26
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,700
 At some point in time, I will leave.

27
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,410
 And since I can't take anything (with me) when I leave,

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
whether it is a person or a thing,

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,310
let me not possess or love it.

30
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,340
That was the way I thought.

31
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,020
And I guarded that one principle well.

32
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,700
But...

33
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,310
in my last 3 months,

34
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
everything collapsed.

35
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,120
  Tell me when you liked me for the first time?

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,880
Whether it was when I first met her  in the elevator or

37
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,360
when she drunkenly barged into my house...

38
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,660
From the time that I can't exactly pinpoint when,

39
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,700
I've liked her and wanted to have her.

40
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,690
And, I became afraid that I'd lose her.

41
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,930
 What is the best thing I can do for her...

42
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,580
 I am thinking about it now.

43
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,760
 My last destiny is beginning.

44
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,760
Can I...

45
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,700
defeat

46
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,060
this destiny?

47
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,830
 My Love From The Star 
 Final Chronicle

48
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,400
This is the first time I see the Seoul sky glittering like this.

49
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,180
It really must be making of the space show in 400 years.

50
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,630
 This is breaking news.

51
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,970
 The American aerospace body, NASA, 
said that a little earlier at 10pm the comet, Deep South,

52
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,510
 deviated from its orbital path 
and is approaching Earth rapidly.

53
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,160
 Deep South had been expected to
pass Earth at a distance of 35,000km,

54
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,480
 but as it approached Earth, it was affected by
celestial bodies near Earth, which

55
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,740
 has changed its trajectory.
"Near Earth passing predicts large scale meteor shower"

56
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,700
 As it passes within a distance of almost 40,000Km,
between itself and the Earth,

57
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,600
 a large number of meteors are expected to fall.

58
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,660
 As such, damage from a falling meteorite is possible 
and special caution should be taken.

59
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,450
Honey, look over there.

60
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,980
Wow!

61
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,880
It's for real.

62
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,910
What is this?

63
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,470
It is pretty.

64
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,450
Should we make a wish?

65
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,190
Those are only rock-like things.

66
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,300
Truthfully, the thing that I found most flabbergasting, 
while living on Earth, was

67
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,630
that people made wishes on shooting stars.

68
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,840
So you won't make a wish?

69
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,940
It has come.

70
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,450
Wow!

71
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,340
 Wow!  It's cool, huh?!

72
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,030
Meteor shower!

73
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,390
Ye Dam, over there!

74
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,830
Mom, look at that.

75
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,350
- Ye Dam, make a wish.  A wish!
 -Yes.

76
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,280
 So pretty!

77
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,060
 Wow, it's pretty.

78
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,840
 Wow, they're clearly visible!

79
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,470
What is that?

80
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,580
Did you see that earlier?

81
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,270
Yeah. Meteor shower, right?

82
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,020
Wasn't that something a little different?

83
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,330
I think it is some kind of UFO.

84
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,470
Have you ever seen a UFO?!

85
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,020
Look over there! It is so pretty.

86
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,950
Cheon Song Yi.

87
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,120
My beloved,

88
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,060
Cheon Song Yi

89
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,000
It is cold.

90
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,650
Don't wear things that have openings here and there.

91
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,360
You're prettier the more you cover yourself.

92
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,420
As I told you last time,

93
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,830
kiss scenes and back hugging scenes...

94
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,960
You can't do those things.

95
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,360
You can't do passionate melodrama. Never.

96
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,750
Don't get sick and

97
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,460
don't read malicious cyber comments.

98
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,230
Don't act all pitiful alone and

99
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,510
cry while singing.

100
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,090
Don't eat alone.

101
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,680
And don't just enter anywhere

102
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,710
after drinking.

103
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,470
At night,

104
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,800
don't uselessly look at the sky and say

105
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,730
"Is this the star or is that the star?"

106
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,960
Don't do things like that either.

107
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,180
It's not a place that you can see from here.

108
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,690
But...

109
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,030
I will watch every day

110
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,960
from there.

111
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,730
This world that you are in.

112
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,050
I'll be looking at it every day.

113
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,460
Every day...

114
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,140
I will try hard to come back.

115
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,400
By any means,

116
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,320
I will find a way  to enable me

117
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,890
a way to be by your side for a very long, long time.

118
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,920
I will definitely do that.

119
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,100
But...

120
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,250
If...

121
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,530
If I ...

122
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,120
can't come back,

123
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,700
forget everything.

124
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,050
Everything.

125
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,660
How can you say that?

126
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,030
How can I forget?

127
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,490
Am I really so stupid?

128
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,620
How can you say such an irresponsible thing?

129
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,620
Huh? Do Min Joon.

130
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,030
Answer me. Okay?

131
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,520
Answer me, Do Min Joon.

132
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,620
Are you there?

133
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,850
Are you still there?

134
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,360
It isn't time yet, right?

135
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,840
Not yet, right?

136
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,440
How could you just leave after saying
what you wanted to say?

137
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,940
I haven't even said goodbye.

138
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,960
You left after saying  just what you wanted to say.

139
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,860
Don't play around. Okay?

140
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,560
Come out!

141
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,700
COME OUT PLEASE!

142
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,900
Okay?

143
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,050
Please!

144
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,420
  ♫ Why am I only saying sad things to you? ♫

145
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,040
  ♫ How many more tears ♫

146
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,230

  ♫ Where are more tears like today’s going? ♫

152
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,810
Will she forgive you just because you go there?

153
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,400
Even though I don't know Song Yi, it will be 
game-over for her mother with this.

154
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,060
Have you any idea how expensive this bag is?

155
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,050
Surprisingly, Song Yi Noona is cool about it.

156
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,310
It's her mother who holds grudges.

157
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,460
All this time, did I go a little overboard?

158
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,100
Very much.

159
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,700
NO!  No way!

160
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,960
Let's not lose hope.

161
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,800
That's right.

162
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,720
- She will like it.
 - Um-hm~

163
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,010
Mother!!

164
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,710
Hello!

165
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,030
Aigoo, why are you like this?

166
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,850
Take these first.

167
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,850
This is 2014 S &amp; S, the new line, Mother~

168
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,600
President Ahn.

169
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,370
Yes.

170
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,520
Struggling through this difficult period,
 I sold off all the bags.

171
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,270
Did you do that?

172
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,900
Then it's turned out well.

173
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,690
I will be the one to fill up your empty closet.

174
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,830
Did you become stupid, why can't you see my point?

175
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,980
For the past 3 months, seriously I was in
 a continuous state of total mental destruction

176
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,200
and a season of betrayal.  That's what I'm saying!

177
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,910
Where were you then, Prez Ahn?!

178
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,250
I was...home, work, home, work, home...

179
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,610
woRK!  MOTHER!

180
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,180
The entire nation

181
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,500
is feeling apologetic towards Song Yi.

182
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,110
They're really, really sorry for
 misunderstanding Han Yoo Ra's case.

183
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,250
How else would the top internet search 
be "Sorry Cheon Song Yi?"

184
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,720
There wouldn't be such an opportunity again.

185
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,180
We have to take this opportunity to make a comeback.

186
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,960
And if she's going to make a comeback,

187
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,550
then, it might as well be with me, Ahn Dong Min!

188
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,770
Honestly, is there anyone who knows Song Yi better than I?

189
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,180
-President Ahn. 
 -Yes!

190
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,500
-Yoon Beom. 
 -Yes!

191
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,370
I don't need a signing bonus or new designer bags.

192
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,120
Please try doing something about my Song Yi.

193
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,240
For over several days, my Song Yi hasn't eaten

194
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,520
or  slept.

195
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,640
She hasn't  even come out from Manager Do's house.

196
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,810
I don't know where Manager Do has suddenly
 run off to, but he's nowhere to be seen.

197
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,080
You better not go carelessly touching
 everything just because I'm not here.

198
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,880
That ceramic you broke last time, it had been 
personally signed by Scholar Heo Gyun.

199
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,940
I told you.

200
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,620
They aren't things you can easily obtain in this world.

201
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,540
I got it.

202
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,750
  Defendant.

203
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,140
Please make your opening statements.

204
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,380
The accused, Lee Jae Kyeong, beginning on March 5, 2007,

205
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,570
and his accomplice Haneul Mental Hospital
 Director, Shin Yeon Tae,

206
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,230
confined his ex-wife, Yang Min Joo, 
for the last seven years in a mental hospital.

207
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:59,710
After this was discovered, on February 13, 2014, 
he kidnapped and confined her again.

208
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,730
In addition, he was singled out as the prime suspect in the 
case of Han Yoo Ra's death which occurred on Dec 26, 2013,

209
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,920
by the Prosecution.

210
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,580
Despite his own admission of guilt in the case,
he continues to repudiate his own statements.

211
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:22,630
However, in addition to his own admission, 
 Lee Jae Kyeong's personal secretary,

212
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,880
Lee Jin has also attested to all the facts.

213
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,170
Therefore, the Prosecution believes the defendant 
Mr. Lee Jae Kyeong  to be the prime and real culprit of this case.

214
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,850
Lee Jin also alluded to threats of bodily harm to himself, 
made by the defendant.  Further,

215
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,710
he heard the defendant discuss destruction of evidence

216
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,720
and his intent to flee.  Hence,

217
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,540
we request an investigation in custody.

218
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,080
That will be all.

219
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,870
The defendant's attorney, please state your defense.

220
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,000
We have nothing to say.

221
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,240
Then this will conclude the hearing to
determine the validity of the defendant's arrest warrant.

222
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,970
This...

223
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,530
How did this happen, Father?

224
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,010
I know that you're disappointed in me.

225
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,950
However, everything will be revealed soon.

226
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,650
All of this has nothing to do with me.

227
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,400
First,

228
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,050
send Hui Kyeong far away.

229
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,070
And?

230
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,600
All the blame will fall

231
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,890
on my chief secretary, as the sole perpetrator.

232
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,260
Please help me contact that guy's parents.
You know their financial situation isn't all that...

233
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,850
Jae Kyeong.

234
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,380
Yes, Father.

235
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,380
I have decided to transfer all the assets in your name

236
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,320
to society.

237
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,120
You did well.

238
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,820
To quiet down the public opinion, at least.

239
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,790
And...

240
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:25,330
I have no desire to assist you.

241
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,790
You will come to spend

242
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,260
the rest of your life in this cold prison.

243
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,440
I feel pity.

244
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,120
Father.

245
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,360
A-a-as I receive the actual prison sentence,

246
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,920
aren't you concerned about what influence that will have
 on the company?  At the very least, the stock price...

247
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,040
I am planning to step back from the front line.

248
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,750
I will cede all responsibility to an expert management CEO.

249
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,710
I don't know what you heard from Hui Kyeong,

250
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,640
but it isn't a decision to make so lightly.

251
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,790
It is the company you have cultivated throughout
your entire life.

252
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,660
Yes, it was.

253
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,230
Because I spent a lifetime developing the company,

254
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,700
I had no idea

255
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,990
what kind of monster had been growing in my home.

256
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,830
I still didn't know, until that

257
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,630
monster captured and devoured my son.

258
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,310
When you were young . . .

259
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,910
You fought with your friend

260
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:44,410
and caused him to lose his sight 
in one eye in that accident.

261
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:52,640
I shouldn't have resolved that incident using money.

262
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,200
It is all my fault.

263
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,110
And, you made...

264
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,530
Han Kyeong like that. 
(You killed him)

265
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,990
Did Hui Kyeong tell you that?

266
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,110
That I did it to Hyung?

267
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,260
Do you actually believe that?!

268
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,460
The recorded file was fabricated.

269
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,400
Hui Kyeong is tricking you in order to take my position.

270
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,680
You mustn't be fooled!

271
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,520
First, just let me out of here.

272
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,470
When I get out, I will prove it all to you.

273
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,110
I'm saying that Hui Kyeong is lying to you!

274
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,450
Just stop it now!

275
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,060
It's all over.

276
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,140
Why do you think I came in here quietly?

277
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,630
You're putting me in a difficult position by doing this to me.

278
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,320
You mustn't do this.

279
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,700
I'm saying that I still have a lot of work to do.

280
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,750
I will get out of here.

281
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,650
With my own ability.  Do you think I can't?!

282
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,540
Just don't get in the way.  Do you understand?!

283
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,270
I'm telling you not to do a thing.

284
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,670
 Hey, you jerk! Is that what is writtem in the
 Myongshimbogam  ?

285
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,390
 You're a jerk who got struck by lighting in the Byoongja Year!
Go sit on Beotigogae Ridge all night!

286
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,480
 -Won't you reconsider?
-I miss you.

287
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,950
 Aren't you going to look at your text?

288
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,110
 What?

289
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,620
 You said you were going to check your texts.

290
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,490
 What is this? There isn't anything.

291
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,530
 There isn't?

292
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,850
The Chi-Mek delivery is here.
(chicken and beer)

293
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,410
What are you doing in the dark?

294
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,270
How did you know to come here?

295
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,680
Your mother called me.

296
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,480
What are you still doing here?

297
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,120
Let's go home now.

298
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,190
I don't want to.

299
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,360
So?  Where is this Do Min Joon that
 you're sitting around waiting for?

300
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,830
When is he coming back?  No, why did he go?

301
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,770
I made sure to tell him

302
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,670
that if he left you alone and goes, 
I would take his place.

303
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,280
How could he go even after I told him that?

304
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,980
Hui Kyeong,

305
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:20,230
he did everything that he could for my sake.

306
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,130
The thing that I can't handle right now,

307
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,400
is that I realized it too late.

308
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,720
I couldn't do anything for him.

309
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,350
And I couldn't even say a proper goodbye.

310
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,710
Even there, he's going to do everything that he can.

311
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,660
Since he told me to wait,

312
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,620
he's probably making every effort while there.

313
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,320
And even though at the end, he might not be able to return,

314
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,170
I won't forget.

315
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,720
I won't forget a single thing,

316
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,840
and I'm going to earnestly wait.

317
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,810
If you're going to wait, eat while you're doing it.

318
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,490
I was asked for a favour, too.

319
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,220
A favour?

320
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,780
 In a little while,

321
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,990
 I might have to go somewhere.

322
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,840
 If Cheon Song Yi ends up alone,

323
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,690
 I'm most worried about you.

324
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,730
 But, at the same time, I'm most comforted by you, too.

325
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,450
 So, I'll ask you a favor.

326
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,940
 What?

327
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,440
 Stay by her side.

328
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,230
 You don't have to tell me that for me to do it.

329
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,240
 Who's asking who for the favor?

330
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,050
 I'm merely asking you to be by her side.

331
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,320
 I'm not telling you to barge in and take that seat.

332
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,120
 I'll take care of that on my own, too.

333
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,430
 As you do it your way,
I'll protect Cheon Song Yi my own way.

334
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,250
Really?

335
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,360
That's what he said?

336
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,200
Yeah, so eat.

337
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,900
Your mother is really worried.

338
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,710
I bought porridge, too. 
Do you want to eat it first?

339
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,760
What?

340
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,740
It came back to life!

341
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,280
What has?

342
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,590
He must have arrived safely.

343
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,500
He must be okay now.

344
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,430
He must not be sick anymore.

345
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,290
What are you talking about?

346
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,070
There's just something.

347
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,110
Hey there plants,

348
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,610
Don't be sick anymore.  I'll take good care of you.

349
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,810
Yes, Mother.

350
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,600
I brought her home and I'm on my way out.

351
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,080
Yes, and she ate some porridge.

352
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,080
Yes, don't worry.

353
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,480
Yes.

354
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,690
Rotten jerk.

355
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,700
What are you doing?
This is Do Min Joon's. Why do you have it?

356
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,190
Min Joon hyung gave it to me.

357
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,410
This?  To you?  Why?

358
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,560
 Hyung, why did you call me here?

359
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,790
 Oh.

360
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,420
 I'll be going on a trip.

361
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:36,430
- Is it the kind of trip that I'm thinking of?
-Hmm?

362
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,870
 Do you need a bicycle? 
 With a basket on the front?

363
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,720
 It's not like that.

364
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,420
 In any case, I think it might be a slightly lengthy trip.

365
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,660
 So, I wanted to ask you for a favor.

366
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,760
 Yes, please say it. Whatever it is.

367
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,330
 While I'm gone, listen well to your sister.

368
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,510
 And, don't upset your sister.

369
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,040
 And, just do whatever she tells you to.

370
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,740
 That's well . . . Even though it's you asking that of me ...

371
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,190
 The telescopes . . .

372
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,220
 Didn't you say you wanted them?

373
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,640
 I'll give them to you.

374
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,830
 Both of them?

375
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,570
 Both of them.

376
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,660
 If Noona tells me to die, I will.

377
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,980
 Okay.

378
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,690
 Don't make things difficult for your sister,
and stay by her side, dependably taking care of her.

379
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,960
 Thanks, Hyung.

380
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,390
 Can I just hug you once?

381
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,790
 No, nev....

382
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,000
What is this?

383
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,100
He told every punk out there to take care of me.

384
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,780
But, when does Min Joon hyung's trip end?

385
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,820
Where did he go?

386
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,190
Cheon Song Yi's phone is turned off today, too.

387
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,550
What is this?!

388
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,590
We already gave her two weeks for personal reasons!

389
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:23,530
I thought things were getting better,
 but I see that her old habits are coming out again.

390
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,160
I should just fire her!

391
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,110
Just a minute.

392
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,800
Ow! My head!

393
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,140
Director,

394
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,960
Are you going to fire Song Yi?

395
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,670
Huh?

396
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,120
You have thought really well.

397
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,460
Anyway, there are a lot of articles here and there about waiting for Cheon Song Yi. . .

398
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,740
The people's response too. . .

399
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,220
they all seem to be moving towards Song Yi's side.

400
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,290
Actually, I felt a bit... You know...

401
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,540
Why don't you cut her out completely this time?

402
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,680
With me alone, we could probably be successful somehow.

403
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,620
Could it possibly be ruined?

404
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,120
No, I'm not saying I'm firing her.

405
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,680
It's just I would want to.

406
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,190
Miss Se Mi, can't you get in touch with Song Yi?
You're friends, right?

407
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,260
We're not close.

408
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,540
How should I do it?

409
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,930
Please cut it short.

410
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,730
Shorter than this?!

411
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,430
In cutting  my hair,

412
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,570
I want to cut off all the regrets too.

413
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,350
Another man?

414
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,600
Why did you break up this time?

415
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,630
In my own way, he was a man I played hard to get.

416
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:41,530
Although... there wasn't any pulling, but rather
 he just pushed pushed pushed.

417
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,770
But then?

418
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:46,590
--With my trusted friend. . .
--Oh my god!

419
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,820
And, I gave her all the dating advice, too.

420
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,500
It's as if it was because of me that 
they went well together.

421
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,730
She's a wicked woman!

422
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,960
She's not, to that extent.

423
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,350
Every time you break up with a man, you cut your hair.

424
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,220
If so, then, there won't be a day for you to have long hair.

425
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,010
Welcome.

426
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,060
What's it now?

427
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,240
Cut my hair too.

428
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,460
No.

429
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,690
Shave it all off!

430
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,760
Hey! You can't.

431
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,150
Do you think just anyone can pull off short hair?

432
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,940
This style is something one gets 
 when one has confidence.

433
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,460
Your hair makes half of your image.

434
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,050
You can't.

435
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,850
Hey, is it that funny?

436
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,590
It's so funny!
"I'm not buying."

437
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,860
That is just so typical of Do Min Joon!

438
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,910
Hey, do you know how much I cried that night
holding those thousand cranes.

439
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,050
I wonder what Do Min Joon's facial expression was like. Seriously!

440
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,280
Do it again.

441
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,220
What?

442
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,850
Tell it again. Tell me something about him.

443
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,400
Hey, I need to have a memory for me to tell you.  That was all.

444
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,280
Then tell me again. The "I won't buy" story.

445
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,970
Cheon Song Yi.

446
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,410
Song Yi.

447
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,530
Are you crying?

448
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,250
Bok Ja, it's been a long time.

449
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,630
I changed my name ten years ago.

450
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,990
Call me Hae In, please

451
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,110
What's wrong with her?

452
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,670
Because of Do Min Joon.

453
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,670
Hey, Cheon Song Yi, the director said he will fire you 
if you don't come tomorrow.

454
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,140
This is tomorrow's filming schedule.
Must I even do this?

455
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,700
Se Mi.

456
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,320
Don't you have one?

457
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,070
You also met Do Min Joon, right?

458
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,820
Did anything interesting happen?

459
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,170
Any kind of story is fine,

460
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:28,760
so say anything.
Please?

461
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,610
Do Min Joon.

462
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,850
Come to my room.

463
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,470

464
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,350
What are you doing?

465
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,670
Just.

466
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,410
Are you really Cheon Song Yi?

467
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,810
How long will it take?

468
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,660
For it not to be painful when I hear stories about him,

469
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,450
how long will it take?

470
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,020
Will that day even come?

471
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,670
When you start to think about him,

472
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,930
that's when it isn't going to hurt.

473
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,490
What are you saying?

474
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:26,940
You are only thinking of that person right now.

475
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,080
There is no time when you are not thinking of him.

476
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,720
Not thinking is harder.

477
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:40,880
But then, when it's time, you will suddenly  
think of that person.

478
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,330
"Ahh. . . I was thinking of something else, 
but then now I'm thinking of that person."

479
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,140
It's at that point that it will not hurt.

480
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,300
Eventually, you will think of other things.

481
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,940
It looks like you have become
 some kind of pro at this.

482
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,570
How long did it take?

483
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,990
15 years.

484
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,030
Are you kidding me?

485
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,850
It took me 15 years.

486
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,190
It doesn't hurt now.

487
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,140
It must have been hard.

488
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,020
If it's going to take that long,

489
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,890
how do I survive?

490
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,620
What Se Mi said was right.

491
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,580
It's harder now not to think of him than

492
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,460
it is to think of him.

493
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,500
That's why,

494
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,750
 I go alone to the places that we went to together.

495
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,660
 Reflect and . . .

496
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,060
 long for him and . . .

497
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,160
 look for traces of him.

498
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,060
 I'm waiting for that person.

499
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,720
And, also that day has come.

500
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,470
The day that we promised, 100th day.

501
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,570
The appointed place, the Namsan Tower.

502
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:38,230

503
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,780
 ♫ Eventually,

504
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,500
♫  I recognized you in a glance

505
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:42,150
 ♫ Everything was obviously different.

506
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:50,110
 ♫ My world was divided between before and after knowing you.

507
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:57,920
♫  When you breathe, a warm breeze blows.

508
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:05,430
♫  When you smile, a dazzling sun shines.

509
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,610
I think it was about that time.

510
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:20,500
I used to think I was mistaken,
but it felt like I really did see him.

511
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,930
No, I did see that person, Do Min Joon.

512
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:26,730
But this doesn't make sense.

513
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,570
Am I slowly going crazy?

514
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,590
It's the same for me as well.

515
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:40,440
I don't know what's going on with my mind.  The last time...

516
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,520
 It must be all good now.

517
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,630
 This also relieves my heart.

518
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,050
 Lawyer Jang.

519
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,600
 Yes!

520
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,490
 Teacher!

521
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,930
It was so strange that I went to the hospital.

522
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:21,400
They said I was out of touch with reality 
as a reaction to acute stress.

523
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,910
Having someone go to a place where
you can no longer see them,

524
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,450
is the same as the stress when someone you love dies.

525
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,600
Probably, Do Min Joon was also that kind of person to you.

526
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,800
Mom, the thing I discovered was a new asteroid.

527
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,750
What?

528
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,150
What I discovered with Min Joon hyung's telescope

529
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,690
was an asteroid that I discovered first.

530
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,340
What do you mean by that?

531
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,340
When I first spotted it, I was wondering what it could be.

532
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,690
But after multiple observations, I kept seeing it.

533
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,910
So, I submitted an official report to the astronomical
 society, noting its location and orbital period.

534
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,240
I received an acknowledgement letter from
 the International Astronomical Union.

535
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,020
What is that? I don't understand a thing you are saying.

536
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,350
So, this is a good thing?

537
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,950
-Of course, it is a good thing. 
 -Why?

538
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,490
It means that I'll get to name the star that I discovered.

539
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,800
Oh yeah?

540
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,490
For example, Yang Mi Yeon star. 
Something like that?

541
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,300
No. Do Min Joon star.

542
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,770
What the? That alien, a con-man or whatever,

543
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,920
he stole your noona's soul and left. 
Why would you use his name?

544
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,360
Hyung is just on vacation.

545
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,130
Anyway, I wish it would really happen.

546
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:38,370
I heard it will take about 3 years for this to be  confirmed.

547
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,970
3 years? Aigoo...

548
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:44,330
In whose lifetime?

549
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:52,490

550
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,450
 3 years later

551
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,620
Cheon Yoon Jae is the 21st person, in our nation, 
to discover an asteroid.

552
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:15,210
You received official acknowledgement from the International Astronomical Union 3 years after the discovery.

553
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:19,400
So, you were able to name the asteroid yourself.

554
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,080
Are you a college student?

555
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,460
I'm studying at Noryangjin*, preparing to take the college entrance exam for the 3rd time. (Area famous for prep classes)

556
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,870
Ah I see.

557
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:29,250
Work, such as observing an asteroid, collecting material
 on it and reporting the discovery,

558
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,360
needs a lot of professional knowledge.

559
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,440
They say that this is difficult for an average person to do. 
So, how was it possible for you to do this?

560
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,660
My mentor, the person I respect the most, 
gave me a lot of help.

561
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,970
Oh, could the name of that asteroid possibly be ...

562
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,690
Yes, that is correct.

563
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,420
It's the name is of the man I respect most . . .

564
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,590
Do Min Joon.

565
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,920
-Thank you for your work. 
 -Thank you for your work.

566
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,530
-Bye. 
-Thank you for your work.

567
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,310
Thank you for your work. 
Thank you for your work.

568
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,500
You should have just stayed to take care of the store.
You didn't have to come here.

569
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,840
But still, if you have someone taking care of you,
 it makes you look better off.

570
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,080
Let's get going to the next interview.

571
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:14,160
Yes, Reporter. I am Manager Hong.

572
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,930
Yes. We are leaving  now. Yes.

573
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,370
Leave then.

574
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:27,140
My shop is growing steadily.

575
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:31,510
Yoon Jae, stay cute as always and
 when you grow up,

576
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,220
come to Noona.

577
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,410
I don't want to waste my life.

578
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,840
Mildang. 
(Push and pull/playing hard to get)

579
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,790
Did you hear about it?

580
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,350
Lee Jae Kyeong gave up on appealing.

581
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,260
Yes.

582
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,790
The fact that S&amp;C isn't helping him
 and leaving him alone is also strange.

583
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,040
That's why.

584
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,150
I heard that a while ago, he asked the Prison Warden
 to place him in protective solitary confinement.

585
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,050
Why?

586
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:03,970
He said the people he killed kept appearing and pleading.

587
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:09,380
When people with anti-social disorder
have their crimes  fully exposed,

588
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,110
and they don't see any way out,

589
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,970
they can show signs of bipolar affective disorder. 
It seems like that's exactly what has happened to him

590
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,220
He's the one that committed all those crimes.

591
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,100
But Lee Jae Kyeong said not too long ago . . .

592
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,230
What did he say?

593
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,450
He said he saw Do Min Joon.

594
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,250
I guess he really went crazy.

595
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,900
Hyung.

596
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,620
Thank you.

597
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:49,720
Wow, people are already beginning to show 
so much interest!

598
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,900
I have a good feeling about this drama.

599
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,840
I heard a strange rumor.

600
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,180
More than half of the production cost
 for this project was paid by your company.

601
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,840
Ah, is that so?

602
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,640
I guess it's possible. Our company is investing a lot
in the entertainment business these days.

603
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,370
Is it a coincidence? This is already the fifth one.

604
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,660
Your company seems to invest in all of my work.

605
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,850
Really? Is this the fifth one?

606
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:16,660
I don't pay attention, so I had no idea.

607
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:20,460
Isn't this fate instead of coincidence?

608
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,160
Aigo, Team Leader Lee!

609
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,560
You even came to the set.

610
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,120
Yeah, well, I was just passing by.

611
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:35,200
You have no idea how grateful our production team is since you're providing everything unconditionally.

612
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,700
When we are fortunate to have a sponsor like you,
 you can bet we are excited to come to work!

613
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,010
Please go and do your work.

614
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:50,640
Thank you for always sending us the food truck!
We're enjoying the food!

615
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,060
-Thank you. 
 -Thank you.

616
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,270
Not paying attention?  It's fate?

617
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:04,440
We happened to cross paths because you have
 a good eye for selecting successful projects.

618
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,620
Seriously.

619
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,710
Noona!

620
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,750
 Excuse me! Just a moment!

621
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,010
Do Min Joon.

622
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,740
What's wrong with her?

623
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,200
 Unni!

624
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,120
Do Min Joon.

625
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,970
Do Min Joon.

626
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:38,430
Do Min Joon, Do Min Joon.

627
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,260
Do Min Joon!

628
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,730
Do Min Joon!

629
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,540
Do Min Joon!

630
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,220
Stop, Song Yi!  That's enough.

631
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,110
Do Min Joon.

632
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:00,090
It is okay. Please calm down.

633
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,370
-Hello. 
 -Yes.

634
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:09,950
What happened?  Why did you cry on the set?

635
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:14,170
Why did you do that when you have 
an important award ceremony coming up?

636
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,500
Are you okay?

637
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,650
Dad.

638
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,400
Yeah.

639
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,780
I miss him.

640
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:29,850
Unni, you can't cry.
Your eye make-up...

641
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,450
I miss him and

642
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,440
want to touch him.

643
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:41,660
I feel like dying because I want to be together with him.

644
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,750
 2017 Korea Film Awards

645
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,770
Aigoo! 
Wow!

646
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:04,870
 ♫ One day when the stars were shining ♫

 Thank you to page designer Mimilyn

663
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,000
Didn't I tell you not to wear things that expose so much

664
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,590
when you're running around?

665
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,780
Do Min Joon?

666
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,670
That's right, it's me.

667
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,050
It's me.

668
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:48,220
I'm sorry.

669
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,750
I'm really late, right?

670
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,480
♫  You are my destiny  ♫

671

673

674

♫  You are the one, my love.  ♫

676
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:39,130
Have I returned for good?

677
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,420
How do I explain it?

678
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,040
He did come back, but he disappeared again.

679
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:53,930
♫  You're my delight of all. You're my eternal love.  ♫

680
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,680
 What happened?

681
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,950
 Where did Mr. Do Min Joon go?

682
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,990
 Miss Cheon Song Yi.

683
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:05,980
 Miss Cheon Song Yi, please explain.

684
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:25,780
 ♫I'm trying to call you.  ♫

685
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,420
When I left this place three years ago,

686
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,740
I entered some place rapidly.

687
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:40,280
In one word, wormhole.

688
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,080
 Wormhole: Hypothetical shortcut  
between a black hole and a white hole.

689
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,410
I went back to that place.
After I had recovered,

690
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:51,470
I tried my best to return here.

691
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:55,910
Anyway, I did not need a long time in  that place.

692
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:59,660
I just needed a short time on Earth at the most.

693
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,860
The first time I succeeded, after many attempts,

694
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,360
the amount of time that I was able to stay 
was from 5 to 10 seconds.

695
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,580
That occasion was the first time I succeeded.

696
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:26,790
Of course, I had to disappear even before
 I could even say a word.

697
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:28,870
It wasn't that I mistakenly saw him.

698
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:31,690
And, of course, it was not that I went crazy.

699
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:37,110
The second time I succeeded, I was able to utter a word.

700
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:41,880
That. . . It was a shame that it was not Cheon Song Yi.

701
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:50,360
 You must be all good now.

702
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,860
 My heart is also relieved.

703
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,130
 Lawyer Jang.

704
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:57,040
 Yes!

705
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,400
After that, I tried countless times again.

706
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,210
And I failed a lot of times.

707
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:10,790
Though I finally succeeded,

708
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,910
I, unintentionally, caused someone 
to experience extreme fear.

709
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:33,030
 Do Min Joon, you. . .

710
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,530
 Have you totally lost everything?

711
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:40,380
 Money, family, reputation. . .

712
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,820
 your people.

713
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,090
 I came to confirm that you lost it all.

714
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:07,190
The important thing is, the time I was able to stay. . .

715
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:09,330
continues to increase in length.

716
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,820
Yes, that's an important truth.

717
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:15,470
This time, he's been staying for one year and 2 months.

718
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:43,490
♫  Eventually, when I recognized you at first sight, ♫

719
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,600
♫  Everything was obviously different.  ♫

720
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:57,200
I am perfectly happy.
♫  Everything in my world is divided between before and after you.  ♫

721
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:05,720
♫  When you breathe, a warm breeze blows.  ♫

722
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:13,370
♫  When you smile, a ray of sun shines brightly.  ♫

723
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:21,090
♫  Because you're here for me, because it's you.  ♫

724
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,050
 A long time ago, miraculously. . .

725
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:30,350
There was a rabbit that found its way back home.
♫  You know I exist. ♫

726
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,900
♫  I am full of joy.  ♫

727
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:43,500
♫  Just thinking about it, my heart is overwhelmed.  ♫

728
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:55,270
 Isn't it hard having him disappear suddenly without warning?

729
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,990
 Of course it is, but. . .

730
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,750
 That's why I can love him even more.

731
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:06,960
 When I think that the appearance of the man in front of me now may be the last,

732
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,780
 that moment ...

733
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,650
  feels truly precious.

734
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,070
 I'm back.

735
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,600
♫  You are my destiny, you are.  ♫
