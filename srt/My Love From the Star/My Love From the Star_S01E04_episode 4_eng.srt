1
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,700

2
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,540
 Please look over here!

3
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,550
 Excuse me!

4
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,640
Are you saying she ended up going
 aboard that boat wearing those shoes?

5
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,310
Yes.

6
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,300
And, you're still here?!

7
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,270
Will you be okay not going?

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,330
Lawyer Jang.

9
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,880
Yes?

10
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,530
I've lived in this place for 400 years.

11
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:42,750
There have been many, many occurrences.  
Some so terrible as to be unimaginable.

12
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,730
 Mother, Father! I've come home!

13
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,830
 I've come home! Mother!

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,430
 My Lady!

15
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,310
 My Lord! The lady has returned!

16
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,600
 The Lady, who was said to have 
died, has returned!

17
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,360
 My Lord! Please come out!

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,620
 My Lord!

19
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,040
 Mother!

20
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,470
 What has happened, my daughter?

21
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,730
 Thinking you dead, I prayed for
 your rebirth in paradise.

22
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,000
 Let me look at your face.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,340
 I did almost die, Mother.

24
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,790
 The in-laws tried to kill me.

25
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,640
 In order to receive the 'Virtuous Woman's' memorial arch.

26
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,400
 Oh, my goodness.

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,410
 Is there anywhere where you've been hurt?

28
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,430
 Yes. I'm fine, Father.

29
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:03,630
 The man over there saved me 
and helped me return here.

30
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,210
 That man is my life's savior.

31
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,340
 I owe you a debt of gratitude for saving my daughter.

32
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,510
 I don't know what I should do to repay you.

33
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,810
 Please treat our home as your own and eat 
and rest comfortably while you remain.

34
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,760
 Why...?

35
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,890
 It is better to die honorably,

36
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,430
 than live as 'filth'.

37
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,810
 This is what I've taught you.

38
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,870
 If you had a conscience to be embarrassed about

39
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,870
 having defiled your body and soiled this household's honor,

40
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,170
 how could you have stepped foot back to this house?

41
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,060
 Mother...

42
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,060
 Die!

43
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,390
 You are already a dead daughter to us, so just die!

44
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,550
 Please!

45
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,220
 Please save me! Save me!

46
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,190
 Hurry and run away.

47
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,630
 Go, hurry!

48
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:40,510
 If your father comes, you and I will 
both die in his hands.

49
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,060
 I argued with him that if we were to 
 kill our child, I would do it myself.

50
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,580
 Go already!

51
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,990
 Go anywhere

52
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,990
 and live in secrecy as if you were dead.

53
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,890
 Mother.

54
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:08,010
 Why did you bring an unknown stranger with you?

55
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:15,990
 To your father, our family's honor is 
 more important than his child's life.

56
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,870
 Did you really not know that?

57
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,220
 That person...is someone who saved my life...

58
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,900
 Mother! What about that person?
 What happened to that person?

59
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,740
 Is he not dead yet?

60
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,610
 How could this be?

61
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,380
 He definitely ate the food laced with arsenic.

62
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,980
 It's the kind that would have killed a bull instantly,
so I'm not sure why he isn't dead.

63
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,340
 The likes of us can't make heads or tails about it.

64
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,520
The pain that I thought I would never forget

65
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,390
passed away over time.

66
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,600
I don't really understand since 
 I haven't lived such a long time.

67
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,770
But I do get these thoughts as I live.

68
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,550
People . . .

69
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,940
live really diligently even though
 they know they're going to die.

70
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,960
Even though they know they will break up at some point,

71
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,080
when they love, they love like
 there's no tomorrow.

72
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,740
Such foolish beings are humans.

73
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,390
Things will get better as time passes.

74
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,780
It could even become as if it never happened.

75
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:04,900
But...although the future is important, 
isn't the present just as important?

76
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,870
if something bad really does happen to that person,

77
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,160
are you confident that you can be indifferent?

78
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,830
 The child star, Cheon Song Yi, who became  famous with her popular chocolate CF, made her first drama appearance

79
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,760
 in a historical drama that would have been 
difficult even for an adult actress.

80
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,000
 Despite the fact that she played the main character's
childhood role,

81
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,190
 she achieved the high-teen stardom
 with her mature and strong image.

82
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,000
 All the dramas and movies she has acted in 
have become unprecedented hits.

83
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,060
 Even up to today, she has continued 
her walk as the nation's goddess.

84
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,840
 First love?

85
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,940
 Ah, the question is so outdated!

86
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,570
 Ah, first love...

87
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,660
 Well, I have gone on a couple of dates,

88
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,600
 but there's no one who I would
 call my 'first love' yet.

89
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,300
 Although, when I was young, there was a time 
when I could have gotten into a big accident,

90
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,080
 there was a man who saved me.

91
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,820
 I can't really think of his face, but he was 
rather tall, and was a handsome type.

92
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,450
 It was the best.

93
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,270
 Though it was just a short moment,
 it was very  mystical,

94
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,740
 and felt warm at the same time?

95
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,240
 I still remember it.

96
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,270
 I don't know if that man will remember me though.

97
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:56,410
 But you know, if I see that person, I 
think I would recognize him immediately.

98
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,630
 Just like 'Fate.'

99
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,160
 60 hours later

100
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,930
With the bizarre case of a top actress 
gone missing during a cruise party,

101
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,190
the whole country's been on edge for 3 days.

102
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,490
While searching around the Han River at 4 pm today,

103
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,110
to the southernmost tip of Sogang University,

104
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,330
 a body was found and retrieved.

105
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,940
The body is being identified.

106
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,130
 The scene is crowded with reporters and media personnel,

107
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,450
 heatedly vying for better coverage.

108
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,500

109
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,040
 My Love From the Star
Episode 4

110
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,190
Has identification been made?

111
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,780
We're investigating. We're investigating.

112
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,950
We're investigating. We're investigating.

113
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,350
It's so obvious.

114
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,690
From my experience, this is definitely a suicide.

115
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,260
She was taking antidepressants.

116
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,660
And she even left a twitter message
 a few days before she died saying,

117
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,000
"Living is so hard" and whatnot.

118
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,050
I listened to all the people at the venue as well.

119
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,040
They said she was really drunk. Really drunk.

120
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,730
The answer is immediately obvious.

121
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,070
A top actress was unable to overcome depression

122
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,580
and committed suicide while under
 the influence of alcohol. That is it.

123
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,050
Our prosecutor is new,

124
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,750
so he's over-passionate.

125
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,630
He wants to know as much as he can for now.

126
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,240
Why does a case like this have 
to happen in our jurisdiction?

127
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,260
I can't even work because of the reporters.

128
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,930
We have to end the case soon.

129
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,400
What are you doing?

130
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,220
Here.

131
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,160
You're Officer Park, right?

132
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,930
- Nice to meet you. I am...
-  Yeah I know, you're Prosecutor Yoo Seok.

133
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,400
Could you please close this case soon?

134
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,080
The  bereaved family don't want 
an autopsy to be performed.

135
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,800
According to Forensics, there was no sign of resistance.

136
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,840
There was no sign of force on the exterior of her body.

137
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,530
- It's like that.
- Oh, is that so?

138
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,910
It's so obvious.

139
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,110
- From my experience, this is definitely...
- Should we start with checking the CCTV?

140
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,810
I already kind of

141
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,330
scanned all of it.
- You can't just kind of scan it.

142
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,450
You have to check it carefully.

143
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,860
There were 77 people invited in total on that day.

144
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,590
They boarded the ship only after passing

145
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,780
a thorough identification check.

146
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,270
It was a place where no one could enter 
except guests and employees.

147
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,000
Because both the bride and groom are celebrity and from a Chaebol family, so even the guest were

148
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,600
the people who you would have recognized by sight.

149
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,130
Most of them were who's who in their worlds.

150
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,670
This is a total celebrity red carpet event here.

151
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,810
 The day of the incident

152
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,560
 Oh, so cold.

153
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,400
 Look at the goosebumps on my arm.

154
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,690
 I'm so cold.

155
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,550
 Who told you to wear something so revealing?

156
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,430
 Wear the ones with long sleeves.
 Like turtle necks that come up to here.

157
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,900
 I'm so cold.

158
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,310
 Why can't the managers come in?

159
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,740
 They're worried that pictures will leak out.

160
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,090
 - Why are they making such a big fuss?
- That's right.

161
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,610
   let's not make a big fuss and get married quietly.

162
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,870
 In a place like a Catholic church, with elegance.

163
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,060
 Please do that. I'll elegantly bring a huge money gift

164
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,610
 and attend for sure.

165
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,180
 - There you go joking again and making me disappointed.
- I don't joke around.

166
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,400
 - Oh, Oppa.
- Hyung.

167
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,970
 - Hello, Oppa.
- It's been such a long time.

168
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,040
 - You're doing well, right?
- Yes. Good to see you.

169
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,990
 By the way, I'm curious about something.

170
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,290
 Do you have someone you're dating?

171
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,620
 - Why?
- It's just that Han Yoo Ra

172
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,080
 said she was going to marry 
a guy from SC Group.

173
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:44,300
 There are only two sons in that household. You and

174
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,400
 Hui Kyeong.

175
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,690
 It's not me. I don't even know Han Yoo Ra.

176
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,840
 If you're talking about Han Yoo Ra, because 
she's our department store's model,

177
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,530
 I have made her acquaintance, but that is all.

178
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,650
 I know, right? Han Yoo Ra. I knew it.

179
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,560
 How can she lie so sincerely?

180
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,390
 Try acting like that.

181
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,070
 Hey. People are watching.

182
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,050
 There are already rumors that 
you're not friendly with Han Yoo Ra.

183
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,060
 It's true that we don't get along.

184
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,550
 Where's the waiting room for the bride?
I've got to put in my appearance so she'll know I'm here.

185
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,450
 Omo, Unni.

186
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,330
 You've probably been busy 
preparing for the wedding.

187
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,510
 So, when did you (have time to) go and
 come back from the hospital?

188
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,030
 Unni, I have to say that your diligence is

189
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,590
 something I should emulate.

190
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,430
 I touched up   a bit.  
Does it look okay?

191
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,440
 You look so young that Suzy will come 
and try to be friends with you.

192
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,620
 Hey, it's not that much.

193
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,250
 Congratulations, Seo Young.

194
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,190
 Thank you.

195
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,340
 Oh right.

196
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,650
 I'm going to catch your bouquet.

197
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,260
 Na Rae Mi said she was catching my bouquet.

198
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,600
 She said she broke up with her boyfriend.

199
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,640
 Then, what about you? Do you have someone?

200
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,520
 Are you going to get married?

201
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,250
 You're doing fireworks at midnight, right?

202
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,610
 Yes.

203
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,240
 Keep your expectations up.

204
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,290
 There will be a surprise announcement at that time.

205
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,390
 Why would you garner attention for yourself at 
another person's wedding?

206
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,260
 As if you haven't copied everything else I do,
are you copying my shoes now?

207
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,070
 I didn't copy anybody.

208
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,890
 - I am the first one in our nation to...
- Why do you guys fight whenever you meet?

209
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,910
 Just stand at the side. We're going to take pictures.

210
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,690
 - Please take a picture of us.
- Yes.

211
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,450
 Please gather closely around the bride.

212
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,600
 What are you guys doing?

213
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,600
 Please take it. Now.

214
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,570
 I closed my eyes. Take one more, please.

215
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,810
 So pretty.

216
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,130
 We're smiling again.
Look here, please. 1, 2, 3.

217
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,460
 Where's Han Yoo Ra?

218
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,670
 I haven't seen her. Why?

219
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,280
 I met her in the restroom a while ago. 
She left this.

220
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,580
 Did you guys fight again?

221
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,850
 Am I somebody that fights every day?

222
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,490
 I'm hungry. What is this?
They only have this kind of food?

223
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,820
 You want something else? 
They have foie gras and caviar.

224
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,700
 You eat those things.

225
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,600
 Excuse me.

226
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,940
 Do you have spoon worms (penis fish) here?

227
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,320
 Excuse me?

228
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,340
 Hey. Why are you looking 
for things like that here?

229
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,610
 We are by water. 
Shouldn't I eat that, at least?

230
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,590
 Soju and 1 plateful of spoon worms. Perfect fit.

231
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,260
 Why?

232
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,610
 Are you embarrassed of me?

233
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,150
 No.

234
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,000
 Director Park?

235
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,960
 How have you been?

236
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,280
 You're making a new movie, right?

237
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,030
 I saw the script. It was really good.

238
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,350
 Why was that sent to you?

239
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,310
 We were thorough with the security 
on the script.

240
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,490
 What?

241
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,680
 You gave it to Song Yi.

242
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,630
 So, I saw a bit of it while Song Yi was reading it.

243
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,960
 If you have a good role, call me too, please.

244
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,330
 Yes. We'll see.

245
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,320
 Sometime

246
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,780
 you should come over and have a drink.

247
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,520
 --Pardon?
-- But ...

248
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,560
 You told me to call you over.

249
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,060
 I'll call you sometime, so just come.

250
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,520
 Is that movie even going to be filmed?

251
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,550
 You can make it only if someone invests.

252
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,660
 Director Park Yoo Kon, your movie can be made 
only if S&amp;C Entertainment invests in it.

253
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,190
 If they don't invest, then you can't make it.

254
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,290
 Who are you?

255
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,610
 I'm Lee Hui Kyeong, younger brother of 
S&amp;C's Lee Hwi Kyeong.

256
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,830
 So, my brother's decided to invest
 in something like this.

257
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,840
 But, that guy has no artistic sense,
so he doesn't know much about a movie.

258
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,360
 He always asks me to tell him if it's interesting or not.

259
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,310
 I saw the script.

260
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,620
 It was boring.

261
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,990
 So I'm going to tell him not to invest.

262
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,540
 I'm going to.

263
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,740
 Hey.

264
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,800
 - Why did you do that?
- Why else?

265
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,810
 Have you not heard the rumors about him?

266
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,060
 He's like a perverted gangster.

267
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,970
 Don't even come into contact 
with guys like that. Got it?

268
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,900
 I got it. Let go of this.

269
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,680
And also, apart from me, all men are wolves.

270
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,190
If you ever get a boyfriend, tell me.

271
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,880
Only after I have seen him and given you
 the approval, can you date him then.

272
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,630
Who do you think you are?

273
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,200
Me?

274
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,800
I'm...

275
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,920
your BFF's soon-to-be husband.

276
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,740
By the way, where did your BFF go?

277
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,850
She went to get a drink.

278
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,270
Again?

279
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,330
Ah, Cheon Song Yi. 
Is she a goddess of alcohol or something?

280
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,820
 Why is it that she needs to go the max,
 when she starts drinking?

281
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,430
Song Yi, it's dangerous over ther-

282
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,360
Hey, be careful. 
Are you okay?

283
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,100
Yes, I'm fine.

284
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,680
Where did Song Yi go?

285
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,880
You said she went to get a drink.

286
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,670
She was at the edge over there just a moment ago.

287
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:07,150

288
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,000
Did something happen?
There's still an hour left until it's over.

289
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,470
It seems like someone's disappeared.

290
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,370
A person? Who?

291
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,470
Hey, Se Mi. Did something happen?

292
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,840
Song Yi has disappeared.

293
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,270
We can't find her, no matter how hard we look.

294
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,610
What? My Noona?

295
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:35,140
And...Yoo Ra has disappeared too.

296
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,310
People are looking for them inside, right now.

297
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,690
What?

298
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,740
Cheon Song Yi!

299
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,860
This way.

300
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,840
How much did you drink?

301
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,620
At that moment, it was 1:42 AM.

302
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,430
 Ms. Cheon Song Yi was the last person
 to get off the cruise boat, Prosecutor Yoo Seok.

303
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:28,660
We investigated later,
 but couldn't find Han Yoo Ra until the end.

304
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,650
What is the estimated time of the death?

305
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,310
Ah, this.

306
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,900
The last time she was seen...

307
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,000
Ah,

308
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,950
she was last seen in the women's restroom 
with Cheon Song Yi.

309
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,340
I heard they fought a little then.

310
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,280
And that was around 11:30 PM, they said.

311
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:53,810
Since people noticed around 12:30 
that Han Yoo Ra had disappeared.

312
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,410
So this incident occurred during that one hour period.

313
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,880
Aigoo. Prosecutor, reporters keep calling me.

314
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,120
They're asking if it's because of Cheon Song Yi 
that  Han Yoo Ra became like that.

315
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,350
How is Han Yoo Ra dying due to Cheon Song Yi?

316
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,660
I don't know. Their relationship wasn't very good or something. 
Anyway, that's what the rumors say.

317
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,760
The worse the rumor,  the stronger it is.

318
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,700
In olden times, at the well of a town,

319
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,320
would be where all rumors started.

320
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,300
Nowadays, instead of at the well,

321
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:33,050
around coffee vending machines, cafes, pubs,

322
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,750
rest areas, internet blogs, and so on.

323
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,660
Anywhere people hang around and rest,

324
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,630
rumors start.

325
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,970
I'm talking about the deadly rumors

326
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,160
that could even kill a person.

327
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,090
Did you hear that? 
After Han Yoo Ra was fed up with Cheon Song Yi,

328
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,800
she committed suicide because 
her depression got worse.

329
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
I heard she (Cheon Song Yi) harassed 
her (Han Yoo Ra) a lot.

330
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,920
Really?

331
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,230
Cheon Song Yi didn't come to school today, right?

332
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,560
After doing such a thing, wouldn't it be 
even more weird if she showed her face anywhere?

333
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,650
Have you seen the video uploaded on YouTube?
Cheon Song Yi is really no joke.

334
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,960
What is it, what is it?

335
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,690
Look.

336
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,260
 How is it that when people get together, 
they talk about me and  my dramas?

337
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,000
 It seems they have nothing better to talk about.

338
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,510
 Fine.

339
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,930
Oh my, she's no joke.

340
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,870
 With doing a drama which earns a rating of 4%, who doesn't even know who started and ended,

341
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,720
 More than no-one knowing it. 
Ah, that's right.

342
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,020
 Your drama just finished at  a 4% rating, right?

343
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,630
 I had rejected that drama, you know. 
Oh my.

344
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,270
I really don't get women. Seriously.

345
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:31,940
I'm speechless.

346
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,340
Aigoo, it's a big problem.

347
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,430
Oppa, I brought this juice for you.

348
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,050
 This afternoon, at the Han River, the corpse found

349
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,800
 was revealed to be top actress Han Yoo Ra.

350
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,290
 Ms. Han attended actress Noh So Young's
 wedding on the 23rd, where she went missing.

351
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,120
 The police started their investigation after her manager reported her disappearance.

352
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:05,580
 Many people are in a shock by the death of an 
actress who remained on top for such a long time.

353
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,070
 There are suppositions that Han Yoo Ra's death was caused by troubles between her and actress Ms. C.

354
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,300
 Yoo Ra did have  depression.

355
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,000
 But it's true that it got worse because of Cheon Song Yi.

356
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:25,760
 Honestly, who wouldn't be angry after  being humiliated

357
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,010
 and spoken to disrespectfully, especially by someone younger, in front of everyone?

358
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,430
 Since our Yoo Ra was nice and kind-hearted, so

359
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,880
 she tried so hard to endure.  But,

360
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,710
 even the day before she died, 
she said that because of  ,

361
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,030
 she was having a really hard time.

362
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,840
Eish!

363
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,250
 It is causing shock as the dead body found in the Han river was identified as the top actress, Han Yoo Ra.

364
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,120
Don't exchange the mangas secretly.

365
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:13,000
Please don't do that! 
You, who play billiards with Tiger Woods and get your computer fixed by Steve Jobs, shouldn't do that.

366
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,380
After all, it's only 80 cents.

367
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,220
You know, those who own a lot (wealthy)
 are supposed to be worse.

368
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,670
Do you know money is earned from nothing?

369
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,750
But, what happened?

370
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,450
So they are saying that Han Yoo Ra committed suicide

371
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,260
because Cheon Song Yi harassed her, right?

372
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,500
Cheon Song Yi is really evil.

373
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,620
I was considering marrying her. I guess I'll have to 
 remove her from my "women's list."

374
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,070
Excuse me! It's true that Cheon Song Yi has a bad personality,
 but she's not that sort of a person!

375
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,720
She's my middle school and high school friend, so I know her well.

376
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,500
Why are you laughing?

377
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,340
You told us not to lie.  
But you're saying she's your friend?

378
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,890
You've gone too far, too far. Why?

379
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,890
You should just say Cheon Song Yi comes here occassionally.

380
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,850
What a lie, really.

381
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,230
The articles aren't very good.

382
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,080
Public opinion is also deteriorating.

383
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,290
Reporter Choi, you won't answer your phone?

384
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,430
You only call me Hyungnim when I
 buy you drinks and play golf with you?

385
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,650
Bomi, hurry. Go to Song Yi's house and move her.

386
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,200
If reporters barge in, it'll be out of control. Hurry!

387
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,980
Yes!

388
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,260
 Noona.

389
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,840
What?

390
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,300
Come to the basement parking lot, hurry!

391
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,110
Why? Did filming get scheduled?

392
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,830
 Have you not seen the news?
They finally found Han Yoo Ra.

393
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,530
She died?

394
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,860
 Yes.

395
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,150
How? Was it an accident?
What happened?

396
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,790
 We don't know that much yet.
But it looks worse for us.

397
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,940
Why?

398
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,160
 Firstly, come out. 
The reporters are going up, so hurry!

399
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,050
 Quickly take the elevator! Quickly!

400
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,220
I'm going, you bastard!

401
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,640
 No! Not the elevator!

402
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,060
No? Why not?

403
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,350
 The reporters are taking the elevator. 
The emergency exit!

404
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,850
The emergency exit?

405
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,840
 No!

406
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,300
No? No? What is it now?

407
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,310
 A few have gone up that way too.
Just go back inside for now.

408
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,990
Go back in?

409
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,020
Hey! Why do I have to run away?

410
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,910
 Can you run away first and talk about that later?

411
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,170
 We don't have  time!

412
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,470
Is that so?

413
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,130
Hey,

414
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,490
what's the password to my house?

415
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,700
 I don't know. You changed it.

416
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,850
So what number did I change it to?!!

417
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,760
Eish!

418
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,500
Wait a moment! Wait!

419
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,970
Cheon Song Yi!

420
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,440
You're sure she's home, right?

421
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,870
Yes. I overheard her manager on the phone.

422
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,410
Then, she'll come out sometime.

423
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,530
What is th-

424
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,300
 Cheon Song Yi is home, but she's not coming out.

425
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,890
Please just let it go.

426
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,580
If I go out now,

427
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,060
I will be bitten to death by those people.

428
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,700
I'm very sorry for saying these words in this situation.

429
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,340
But do you have any ramen or cold rice?

430
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,750
I didn't eat well last night, so I'm a little hungry.

431
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,870
Get out.

432
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,330
I said, get out.

433
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,260
 Yes, Vice President.

434
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,510
Then you can just give it to me as a whole.

435
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,060
Why don't we make it half page Cheon Song Yi, 
and half Han Yoo Ra.

436
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,300
We are, now, in front of 
actress, Cheon Song Yi's home.

437
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,250
We came to hear her opinion 
on the death of Han Yoo Ra.

438
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,120
First of all, I'll try ringing the bell.

439
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,520
There is no response.

440
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,490
Ah, we'll ask her neighbor over here.

441
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,610
Excuse me, did you see Cheon Song Yi earlier?

442
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,410
Move the camera.

443
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,620
Yes.

444
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,470
What's with him?

445
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,580
Hey, does that make any sense?

446
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,770
Why would Han Yoo Ra die because of me?
 Are people seriously believing that?

447
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:48,750
 Yes, the atmosphere right now isn't good.  So,
 I think it's best if you're not exposed.

448
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,620
 You got home safely last night, right?

449
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,500
 Please don't read the Internet for one day,
 and just stay home, alright?

450
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,540
That...

451
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,910
Aish, the battery.

452
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,580
What is this?

453
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,710
He doesn't even have a cell phone
 and he uses a beeper.

454
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,880
Does he not even have a home phone?

455
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,300
Aish, this person. Does he live his life alone?

456
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,030
Am I locked in here right now?

457
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,380
What? I'm tired.

458
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,290
Where's Song Yi?

459
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,620
Even at home, am I also just Cheon Song Yi's friend?

460
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,970
I'm not your daughter?

461
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,710
What?

462
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,170
I received so many calls asking how
 is Cheon Song Yi, so I turned it off.

463
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,130
I can't contact Song Yi, either.

464
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:53,490
Is that so? That's worrisome.

465
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,370
What about oppa?

466
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,730
Your oppa is busy these days.

467
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,310
But it's really strange.

468
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,120
What is?

469
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,460
I went to someone to look at the future.

470
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,220
And, they said that

471
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,300
Cheon Song Yi's fame would last only up to last year.

472
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,900
After that, she would  face something terrible this year 
and the rest is dark, as if she can't see anything.

473
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,680
But, for you, they said it's the exact opposite.

474
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,710
After Cheon Song Yi's luck fades, your luck blooms.

475
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,400
Mom.

476
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,880
Are you trying to make me disappointed in you?

477
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,590
I'm her friend.

478
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:27,050
There are many times I've disliked her, 
but we've been friends for more than 10 years.

479
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,940
Did you think I would like it if 
I heard something like that?

480
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,360
And also, is Song Yi your daughter?

481
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,970
Why would you look at Song Yi's future?

482
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,660
So...

483
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,000
Until when are you going to live as
 the supporting character?

484
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,600
Do you like being the supporting character all your life?

485
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,170
I don't like it.

486
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,230
Since my daughter is the supporting character, so am I.

487
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,070
-Mom.
--You

488
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,080
Do you know why life is interesting?

489
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,480
It's interesting because you don't know 
what's ahead of you.

490
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,800
It's something you don't know,

491
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,760
how everything may turn around.

492
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,790
The Hui Kyeong that you've liked for so long,

493
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,700
you can make him yours.

494
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,640
And, you can receive the spotlight
that was made just for you.

495
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,580
I wish my daughter would

496
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,690
overturn the board like that for once.  (Change her own fate)

497
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,580
What kind of mess is this? You said
 it was still under investigation!

498
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,100
And, they've said they don't even know if it's a suicide 
or an accident.  So, what's with everyone?

499
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,600
Don't worry too much.

500
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,570
I will try to straighten up everything...

501
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,200
Representative.

502
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,590
I'm in the middle of a conversation.

503
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,900
Right now, there's mayhem happening from advertisers.

504
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,100
That we violated the contract on the model's character.

505
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,210
Some are threatening to sue...

506
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,620
The people from the drama want to see you, too.

507
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,030
Why?

508
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,870
They said the viewer ratings are spiraling down right now.

509
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,530
Well, Mother, we will try to manage this
 well, so please go back home for now.

510
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,020
I'll get up now since I have something to finish.

511
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,330
Oh, right, Representative Ahn.

512
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:02,680
What I told you last time, 
about Song Yi's renewal issue.

513
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:09,070
You said that we should expedite it by a month?
 We'll do that, then.

514
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,100
Pardon?

515
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,030
I said, let's just do that.

516
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,250
In consideration of all the time we've spent together,

517
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:19,110
I can't just fall over for other agencies just 
because they try and persuade me otherwise.

518
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,630
I'm not a woman who's that disloyal.

519
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,590
When should I sign the contract?

520
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,320
Should I sign it now while I'm here?

521
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,030
Ah, Mother, today we don't have a prepared contract yet.

522
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,690
So let's talk about it slowly another time.

523
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,880
I will leave first.

524
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,600
 This phone is turned off...

525
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,590
What is this girl doing?!

526
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,720
Agh, that awful bastard.

527
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,920
I begged like that saying I was hungry.

528
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,850
Yet, he sneaks out of here and is nowhere to be seen.

529
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,900
That cold-hearted bastard.

530
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,950
They said the tiger comes on its own feet, too.

531
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,850
You mean "tiger comes when he's talked about"
(Jae Bal (his own feet) vs. Jae Mal (talks about him, word play)

532
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:34,200

533
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,970
Do you not want to eat ramen together?

534
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,640
Then just sit in front of me, at least.

535
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,750
Why should I?

536
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,500
Because I don't want to eat alone.

537
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,830
Because if I eat alone, I lose my appetite.

538
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,630
That inhumane bastard.

539
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,000
That alien-like bastard.

540
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,020
A person is asking you earnestly like 
that, but you just completely ignore them?

541
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,210
What is this? When did I eat all of this?

542
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,110
I was going to stop eating after 3 bites.

543
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,430
Ah, I'm ruined!

544
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,350
Where exactly is the bathroom?

545
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,580
It seems like he knows his paintings.

546
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,400
It's a complete fake, but it looks real.

547
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,390
Aigoo, what is all this?

548
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,980
"Records of my last 3 months on Earth?"

549
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,720
What are you doing?

550
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,740
Oh, my god, you surprised me.

551
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,330
What are you?

552
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,100
Without any warning!

553
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,940
When did you come in?

554
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,860
That's what I want to ask.

555
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,820
When and why did you come in here?

556
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:35,520
I was looking for the bathroom.

557
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,060
But...

558
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,960
what is this place?

559
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,970
And what's all this?

560
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,230
Are you running two jobs?

561
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:48,500
Such as buying books and paintings from olden days?

562
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,410
Antique dealer and stuff like that?

563
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,190
Come out.

564
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,640
Get out.

565
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,500
I am sorry about going into your room.

566
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,650
How can I go out now?

567
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,620
As if  I care.

568
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,470
Everyone's thinking about  how to kill me.

569
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,490
"Should I rip her to death?"
"Should I dry her to death?"

570
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,940
Everyone's like that...

571
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,750
So, if they see me coming out of a man's house,

572
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,780
I will really be dust and die.

573
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,870
That's none of my business.

574
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,270
I think of  it this way.

575
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,890
It's the duty of a teacher to take care of his student.

576
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,590
Even if our society has become heartless,
 the relation between a teacher and a student is...

577
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,550
Shouldn't be like this.

578
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,580
When the student is in trouble, 
the teacher should help a bit.

579
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,800
Who's your teacher?

580
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,620
You?

581
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,210
I've never thought of you as my student,
not even for a second.

582
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,770
Get out now if you don't want to be dragged out.

583
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,570
HEY! 
(Informal)

584
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,350
Hey?

585
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,630
Let go of this. 
(Informal)

586
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,200
What?

587
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,170
You said you are not my teacher.

588
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,970
I've been using honorifics for nothing. 
I should've just talked informally.

589
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,080
Look here, Ms. Cheon Song Yi.

590
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,190
What's up, Mr. Do Min Joon?

591
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,190
Come to think of it, why don't you show me your ID?

592
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,410
How old are you? 
You're younger than me, right?

593
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,030
If I step out of this house, 
I'm not the only one who's going to die.

594
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,250
Mr. Do Min Joon is going to die, too.

595
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,450
Why? Because news articles saying that 
you're my secret lover will be out.

596
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:17,770
Everyone will know your face. 
Do you want to live a noisy life?

597
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:20,170
While every little movement of yours 
is being watched by people...

598
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,800
That's more terrible than you think.

599
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,920
Please let me stay for a while.

600
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,000
I ask a favor of you.

601
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,860
First, don't touch anything

602
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,920
in this house.

603
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,220
I won't touch anything. I won't.

604
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,330
Second, don't ask me any questions.

605
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,030
I won't ask any. I won't.

606
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,790
Then, in appreciation, 
  a handshake?

607
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,680
Third,

608
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,060
keep your distance from me; 1 meter at least.

609
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,050
Ah, what's this?

610
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,530
Keep  your  distance from me, you.

611
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,490
Do you know with whom I have made movies?

612
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:09,560
Jung Woo Sung, Kang Dong Won, Won Bin. 
With such amazing people-

613
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,190
It's so unusual.

614
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,500
It's impossible for a man to not like me.

615
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,980
Does he have a different taste? 
(Is he gay?)

616
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,530
 The bereaved family don't want to
 carry out an autopsy.

617
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,340
 The Police assume that it was a suicide.

618
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,350
The media is also driving it that way.

619
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,200
It's likely that they will close the case in this way.

620
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,440
 But...

621
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,120
 In Ms. Han Yoo Ra's laptop, some video clips of you and some phone conversation recordings were found.

622
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,460
I took care of the laptop. But there was evidence
 that she kept copies of those files somewhere.

623
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,730
Where are the copies, then?

624
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:52,020
When I checked the black box in the car,
 I saw that she put a USB in her clutch bag.

625
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,070
It's the clutch bag that she brought to the wedding.

626
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,960
Have you found it?

627
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,540
No. It wasn't on the cruise ship.

628
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,830
Get the CCTV data. 
Find out

629
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,560
who took it.

630
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,170
Yes, sir.

631
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,860
Hyung!

632
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,970
You can go now.

633
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,450
What?

634
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,910
You saw the news, right? Why is it my 
Cheon Song Yi's fault that Han Yoo Ra died?

635
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,360
I think I'm going to lose my mind.

636
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,870
Gather some reporters you know.

637
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,580
It might not be a suicide.

638
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,710
It could be an accidental death.

639
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,660
Bluntly saying, it could be a homicide.

640
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,440
There are a lot of similar cases abroad, too.

641
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,670
On a boat or a cruise they fabricate about
a homicide  being a suicide

642
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:38,120
It's being investigated now, so the truth will come out.

643
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,390
How can I believe that?!

644
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,110
Let's eat first, eat.

645
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,690
Hey, here!

646
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,490
That's why...

647
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,670
What's with these people?

648
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,220
Excuse me.

649
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,550
Which reporter are you?

650
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,100
I'm reporter Kim Hyuk Soo,
 from the Dae Han Daily News.

651
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,530
I'm Na Jae Ho, from the Yu Il Newspaper.

652
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,050
She's not coming out.

653
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:33,540
We've already rung the doorbell.

654
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,800
It would be really big news, 
if Cheon Song Yi's boyfriend or someone

655
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,800
comes at a time like this.

656
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,550
Excuse me.

657
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,230
Don't just stand there. 
Come and eat these fried dumplings.

658
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,920
Aiyoo, it's fine. Come on.

659
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,040
No, it's fine...

660
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,240
She's not going to come out now.

661
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,500
Here.

662
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,550
Are you sure that she's inside?

663
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,540
We're sure. Her manager tried to 
bring her out, but failed.

664
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,290
Then, she's-

665
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,050
Ms. Cheon Song Yi.

666
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,850
Wouldn't she be starving right now?

667
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,340
By the way,

668
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,460
is it true that Han Yoo Ra died because of you?

669
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,410
You saw at the hair salon.

670
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:53,120
Is she a type of person who would jump into 
the Han River because she wants to avoid me?

671
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,740
She definitely would never do that.

672
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,940
When I saw her for the last time,

673
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,220
how much she bragged,

674
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,660
saying that she's getting married soon..

675
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,690
She was only 30 years old.

676
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,290
How on earth did this happen?

677
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,790
I did nothing wrong, but

678
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:31,420
why does it bother me? Why do I feel so sorry?

679
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,450
When did you last see her?

680
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,980
Last time when I saw her...

681
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:51,020

682
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,050
 Why can't I say anything?

683
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,580
 What's going on?

684
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,050
 Bluntly saying, are we having an affair?

685
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,930
 Han Yoo Ra.

686
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,830
 Let's go in.

687
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,790
 I think everyone who knows me

688
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:22,850
 and knows you are here.

689
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,370
 Count on me.

690
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:27,540
 What would I say to those people.

691
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,690
 I'm going to make a surprise announcement later.

692
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:36,230
 When you hear it, you'd probably

693
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,570
 be surprised, too.

694
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,420
 Yoo Ra.

695
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,920
 What?

696
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,810
 How's your depression these days?

697
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,740
 My depression is up to you, Oppa.

698
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:55,330
 I stopped taking medicine a while ago.

699
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,730
 You know I like you, right?

700
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,080
 Take good care of your health.

701
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:06,550
 What is this? They  are  dating.

702
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,240
 Jae Kyeong oppa's being so coy.

703
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,660
 Oh my.

704
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,900
 What are you doing?

705
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,370
 By chance, were you eavesdropping?

706
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,110
 A little?

707
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:27,930

708
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,460
 I'm going to announce our wedding.

709
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,430
 But, does it have to be Jae Kyeong Oppa?

710
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,590
 What do you mean?

711
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,430
 No, I mean...

712
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,650
 Even though you're not my style, Unni,

713
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,770
 I think men would consider you quite attractive.

714
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,900
 Why?

715
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,450
 Do you think I'm clinging onto Mr. Jae Kyeong, 
when he doesn't like me?

716
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:56,070
 It kind of looked like that.

717
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:58,570
 Don't be flip with me.

718
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,810
 There's something you don't know.

719
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:05,440
 The inside story of why Oppa can't 
openly ask me to marry him.

720
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,560
 And, what is that?

721
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:13,210
 Do you think I'd tell you?

722
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,640
 I mean, I'm not that curious, either.

723
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,430
 As soon as I get married, 
I will immediately retire.

724
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,150
 If I'm gone, you can do all you want.

725
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,870
 Don't worry.

726
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:29,580
 Even now, I'm doing well enough.

727
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,400
 Rude girl.

728
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,760
 You won't let me win, not even once.

729
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,200
 Look who's talking.

730
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,470
 Ah, why did she leave this behind?

731
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,530
That was the last I saw of her.

732
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,180
I looked everywhere for her to to return her bag, 
but couldn't find her.

733
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:10,440
After that, I got too drunk, so my memory is a bit...

734
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,100
Why?

735
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:19,720
Truthfully, something was really strange that day.

736
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:27,470
I'm pretty sure you've watched enough.
 Let's just call it a day

737
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:30,940
Everything's been answered and accounted for.

738
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,870
Huh?
Come on, give it a rest.

739
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:37,140
Who is this?

740
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,990
This person isn't on the list.

741
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,250
Who?

742
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:46,420
Right here.

743
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,340
Who?

744
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,680
That's Cheon Song Yi.

745
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,350
No.

746
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,470
Next to that.

747
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:05,500
That night I fell asleep on the boat,

748
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,900
and I had a dream.

749
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,170
In my dream, you appeared.

750
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,860
It was so vivid that

751
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:20,070
I wondered whether it was really a dream.

752
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,240
It's true.

753
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,640
I checked and this person isn't on the list.

754
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:38,620
He's not on the worker's list either.  Who could he be?

755
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:43,600
But, what is this?

756
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,830
What the heck?

757
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,600
Where did that person go?

758
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,130
Exactly.

759
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,530
Ah, I'm getting goosebumps.

760
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:54,950
A ghost, isn't that a ghost?

761
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,710
Right. It must have been a ghost.

762
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,730
This video hasn't been tampered with, right?

763
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:07,210
Is it something like those water ghosts 
who died by drowning?

764
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:10,740
This is freaky...

765
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,880
Aish...

766
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,660
But,

767
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,940
they both disappeared.

768
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:21,250
Now what?

769
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,000
When this man disappeared,

770
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,140
Ms. Cheon Song Yi also disappeared.

771
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,880
This thing...

772
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,720
What could it be?

773
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:45,670
Because it was so vivid, I couldn't help
 but think it was real.

774
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,000
Perhaps,

775
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,360
did you come that day?

776
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,470
That couldn't have happened.

777
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,220
That's right, you couldn't have been there.

778
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,390
But I feel like

779
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,870
I definitely saw you there.

780
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,960
Then, what were you doing that day?

781
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:37,000
 Get out!

782
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,020
 What the heck?

783
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,280
 ♫ In my memory of the past ♫

784
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:43,820
 ♫ In that pain, I call you. ♫

785
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:48,790
 ♫ You  are my destiny. ♫

786
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,290
 ♫ You ♫

787
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:56,250
  ♫ You are my destiny. ♫

788
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,640
 ♫ You ♫

789
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,550
Kiss?

790
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,210
It's not like I didn't have a chance, but

791
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,790
I've never done it before.

792
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:08,400
Honestly, because of my looks,

793
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,720
there have been a lot of temptations.

794
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,540
 What is it that you need to tell me?

795
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,470
 Mr. Scholar,

796
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,680
 This ...

797
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:31,270
 You've heard of Dan Won?

798
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,250
 Dan Won Kim Heung Do.

799
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,090
 He's the one who even drew 
a portrait of the eldest grandson of the king.

800
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,790
 He's a painter

801
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,850
 who's most popular in Han Yang these days.

802
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:43,930
 Since it's my heart,

803
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:47,030
 please accept it.

804
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,740
 Also,

805
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,390
 this too . . .

806
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,870
 The request of the most beautiful woman in Han Yang,

807
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:07,090
 I can't reject that.

808
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,720
 However, first, I have a confession to make.

809
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:16,360
 Do you know where I'm from?

810
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,360
 What?

811
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:25,870
 I came from that star.

812
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:30,190
 Would it still be okay with you?

813
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,590
 It wouldn't, right?

814
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:36,350
 Since we are people from different planets . . .

815
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,150
 If you didn't like me, you should've just said so.

816
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,250
 How could you make up some nonsense like that?

817
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:48,080
 Such an absurd lie...

818
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,720
 You're too much.

819
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,190
 Good morning!

820
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:09,560
 You're dead!

821
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,560
 Hey!

822
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,550
 Oh, Father

823
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,220
 If it's really a suicide, then Han Yoo Ra . . .

824
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,720
 She died because of our Song Yi?

825
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,150
 Then, what's going to happen to my Song Yi?

826
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:18,980
 Look, it's her will.

827
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,520
 It's game over.

828
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,470
 Should I teach you how not to be hurt by people?

829
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:27,370
 Don't give or accept anything. 
Also, don't expect anything.

830
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,700
 Jae Kyeong Oppa?
 But, how do you know where I live?

831
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,400
 Mr. Do Min Joon!

832
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,200
 Mr. Do Min Joon, are you not there?
