1
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,840

2
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,870
 Do Min Joon!

3
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,840
Who. . .

4
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,250
are you?

5
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,020
What?

6
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,020
Could you possibly be...

7
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,200
From 12 years ago, the one who saved Song Yi. . .

8
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,040
Are you that person?

9
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,570
Are you?

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

11
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,690
There is a picture taken when that accident happened, 
and I saw it.

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,200
I'm absolutely certain that it was your face.

13
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,100
In this world, there are a lot of people who look alike.

14
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,410
Also, if that happened 12 years ago,

15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,540
isn't it too long ago

16
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,640
for you to be absolutely certain?

17
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,440
Exactly.

18
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,900
How can you have the same face as 12 years ago?

19
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,300
How old are you exactly?

20
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,310
You saw it wrong.

21
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,170
I was hoping that I was

22
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,670
More than anyone else.

23
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,450
I came here praying desperately that you would say that.

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,480
But. . .

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,410
Not only in the picture, 
but also, you were in my memories as well.

26
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,240
That person was you.

27
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,760
No matter who you remember or whatever you think,

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,810
it's up to you.

29
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,530
Believe whatever you want
 because it doesn't matter to me.

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,620
Do you have. . . more things to say?

31
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,600
It doesn't matter to me either.

32
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,240
No matter who you are or what your identity is. . .

33
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,150
But,  if you are someone who continues 
 to be involved with my Song Yi,

34
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,320
it's a totally different story.

35
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,850
As to a man, who is mysterious in many ways,

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,310
and whose identity is unknown,

37
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,640
associating with the woman I love,

38
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,540
what kind of an idiot would just sit and watch that?

39
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,710
Don't get involved

40
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,580
with Cheon Song Yi

41
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,790
in any possible way.

42
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,300
  Hui Kyeong, I can't go down now.

43
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,370
  There is  something I must check with Do Min Joon.

44
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,760
What is it?

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,570
You see me as an idiot, right?

46
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,410
What are you saying again?

47
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,560
On the day of the accident, where I almost died,

48
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,820
you told me you weren't there, right?

49
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,490
But what is this?

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,460
What is that?

51
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,320
To me, it appears to be the shards of my headlight.
And it has blood on it.

52
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,880
I found this in your waste basket.

53
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,710
So?

54
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,950
On that night, you went there and

55
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,610
stopped my car.

56
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,620
While doing that, the car headlight broke and a piece
of it was embedded in your hand.

57
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,530
And you came home and treated your hand.

58
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,430
As a result, this was left behind as  evidence.

59
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,030
Explain to me what happened.

60
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,030
I...

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,140
didn't see you as an idiot, but

62
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,010
I guess you are an idiot.

63
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:16,760
What?

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,750
Do you think the broken glass from your car is the only broken glass in the world?

65
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,440
The last time the glass vase broke,

66
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,000
your foot also got hurt from the broken glass, right?

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,350
The shape of it is different from that...

68
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,680
Didn't you say you went to the hospital? 
 What did they say at the hospital?

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,400
Did they say you being like this is normal?

70
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,650
It wasn't some kind of delusion?

71
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,840
You told me that you went to the police station 
on that day, right?  Is there anyone who saw you?

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,330
I think you can just check with Gangnam police station yourself.

73
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,180
You said that your hand got hurt because of a fender-bender.

74
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,160
You didn't say you got hurt from the glass, right?

75
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,010
So?

76
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,370
Let me see. Let's check.

77
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,440
Whether you were pierced by a shard of glass, bruised 
or were otherwise injured due to the fender-bender.

78
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,380
I told you to show me!

79
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,100
What is this? It's almost all healed.

80
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,820
Why did you put this there? Was it a lie?

81
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,100
Now did you check everything?

82
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,430
Let go of my hand.

83
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,210
You know, on that day,

84
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,620
there wasn't just one or two strange things.

85
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,520
I can't pinpoint it exactly, but

86
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,710
you are really strange.

87
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,050
Cheon Song Yi,

88
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,960
Since I became involved with you, 
my peaceful life has become a mess.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,720
Now it would be nice if you would leave.

90
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,150
Even if you didn't say that, I was going to leave.

91
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,230
Make immediate plans to do so.

92
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,860
Aren't you curious about where I am going?

93
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,970
What did you talk about (with him)?

94
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,190
What was it that you wanted to check?

95
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,670
It was nothing special.

96
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,470
Let's go.

97
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,910
Hui Kyeong,

98
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,970
wait a minute.

99
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,700
Yummmm.  This tangerine is sweet!

100
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,730
I can't sleep together with someone else. If you barge in suddenly like this,....

101
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,560
Hey, can't you tie your hair?

102
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Did you find someone you like?

103
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,380
When you had someone new you liked, 
you made the origami cranes and gave it to him.

104
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,530
How about you? You found someone you like?

105
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,570
What are you saying?

106
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,120
Since you came to my house, you have been continuously looking at the phone.

107
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,560
I think you are waiting for his call.

108
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,040
No, it isn't it!

109
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,940
I found one.

110
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,710
A kind of man who doesn't seem to exist on Earth...

111
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,810
like someone who came down somewhere from the beautiful star

112
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,880
A man who has that kind of proportions and aura.

113
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,690
I have fallen in love at first sight.

114
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,070
But you just saw him once and no more after that?

115
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,470
No, I met him one more time.

116
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,310
When meeting him occurred,

117
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,110
I lost my heart to him.

118
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,380
When our eyes made contact,

119
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,960
he captured my heart.

120
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,180
Although I couldn't meet him

121
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,130
once we were out of step.

122
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,050
My love who lives far away only in my memory...

123
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,620
I feel I might meet him coincidentally at least once.

124
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,240
But I haven't been able to see even a man who looks like him.

125
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,070
Would I be able to meet him, were I to turn into this alley?

126
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,170
  Excuse me.

127
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,720
  Don't you know me?

128
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,560
  Who are you?

129
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,010
  I told you the last time that your impression is good.

130
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,200
  And by the way, this....

131
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,990
I won't buy it.

132
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,870
 My Love From The Star
Episode 10

133
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,080
This is finger scan entry system, right?  
No one else can ever open it, correct?

134
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,000
After you finish this, please install the alarm system 
and CCTV that I mentioned as well.

135
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,640
Here? 
There.

136
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,130
Right. There, too.

137
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,070
I mean, what kind of a crazy bastard broke into your house and made a mess?

138
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,670
Did you report it to the police?

139
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,040
It's all set.

140
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,600
Well, Mother. . .

141
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,470
Should we all go out to eat something delicious?

142
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,040
Of course... that sounds good.

143
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,810
Forget it, I'm tired.

144
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,130
And you, why are you doing something I didn't ask you to? Why did you call Mom and Yoon Jae?

145
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,340
You won't go to Cheongpyeong. 
You said you don't like hotels.

146
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,380
You also said you don't like Mother's home.

147
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,140
Why do you not like my home?

148
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,920
Can you all please go now, I'd like to rest.

149
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,140
I'm not leaving.

150
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,360
I said I'm not leaving. 
I'll stay here for a while.

151
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,740
That's right, that's good!
 If our Yoon Jae stays here, I'd feel reassured.

152
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,610
I, too, will come here a lot.

153
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,410
Fine... I'll stay here, too, then.

154
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,480
You should leave, Mom. Please take my mom with you
 when you leave, Hui Kyeong.

155
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,510
Even if you ask me to stay, I won't!

156
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,360
Ah, right. Did you get a call from 
Representative Kang Jae Gab by chance?

157
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,770
- No. 
-- That crazy bastard-

158
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,770
If Representative Kang calls you, don't answer him. 
Don't even talk to him, alright?

159
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,710
I understand.

160
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,780
The speed of the elevator at the building is 120 m/min.

161
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,800
It's about 69 meters,
 from the 23rd floor to the 1st floor.

162
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:08,330
If we say the elevator comes down without stopping at any floor, it takes about 34.5 seconds.

163
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:14,200
It's physically impossible for a human being to run down from the 23rd floor to the 1st floor at a constant speed.

164
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,260
He has to run through a story or more 
in 1.5 seconds at least-

165
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,240
It's impossible. . .

166
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,610
What are other possibilities?

167
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,490
There is another elevator right next to the one you were in, but it was not operational because of an inspection.

168
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,150
I definitely saw that punk,
 whom I saw on the 23rd floor,

169
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,140
on the 1st floor again.

170
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,170
So. . . did I witness something impossible?

171
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,130
Don't you think he noticed something's strange?

172
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,620
Why did you get yourself swayed by emotions and make a mistake? You've never made one before.

173
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,370
I thought I should take his gaze off her.

174
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,710
What gaze?!

175
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,830
He's after Cheon Song Yi.

176
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,970
What about we tell Ms. Cheon Song Yi the truth?

177
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,870
That she should be careful of him because he's a dangerous person. That she shouldn't get close to him.

178
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,520
Based on what I've grasped so far, 
he's not a kind of person we can avoid even if we try.

179
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,340
Also, it's better for Cheon Song Yi 
to not know of his true identity.

180
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,170
If she finds out his secret, 
she will be in an even bigger danger.

181
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,390
Then, what about you, sir?

182
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:41,550
What about your safety? You've lived quietly over the last 400 years and waited for the day to return.

183
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,660
For several decades,
 I've reported your death many times.

184
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,400
Missing, fire, drowning, car accident.

185
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,150
There are so many more than these.

186
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,850
But you know. . .

187
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,690
Not like those things, 
but you could actually die.

188
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:04,040
Before you get to return to the place you're from,
 you could really die right here!

189
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,480
Don't you think about that?

190
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,560
I told you I have nothing to say.

191
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,140
If my parents find out about this, 
they will faint again.

192
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,470
Please go back now.

193
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,720
Ah, let me ask you just one thing. 
Did your sister have a boyfriend?

194
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,390
I told you she didn't have one!

195
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,570
Ms. Han Yoo Ra was pregnant.

196
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,330
What did you say?

197
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,230
We've already checked her hospital reports and all.

198
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:38,440
If Ms. Han Yoo Ra was seeing someone, we have to know everything about that man.

199
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,690
That. . . Are you going to tell other people?

200
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,180
That's killing her twice,

201
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,110
if you tell people that an unmarried woman was pregnant!

202
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,120
Does that matter right now?

203
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,030
When we are saying that your sister's death could possibly be a homicide?

204
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,150
Ms. Han Yoo Ra even stopped taking the pills for her depression.

205
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,500
That means, she wanted to have the baby, and

206
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,110
she could have confronted an unwanted death.

207
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,980
Her sister thinks she was seeing someone. 
She had gotten a very expensive gift.

208
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,560
But she (Han Yoo Ra) wouldn't tell her who that guy is.

209
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,280
But she said he's an extremely wealthy person and
 they were going to get married soon.

210
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,440
We should dig into her phone call history. 
There should be something.

211
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,180
Don't you think it's Do Min Joon 
the more we look at it?

212
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,830
Well, I'm not sure.

213
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,880
Do Min Joon, that guy is really rich, I hear.

214
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,840
My points are starting to tally up.

215
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,390
Are there just one or two rich people in the Republic of Korea?

216
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:04,210
Mom, there. An Ahjussi just puffed into the air.

217
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,400
Like a fairy.

218
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,310
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

219
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,050
Put someone to follow Do Min Joon.
 I think that side should be taken care of first.

220
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,190
Yes, sir.

221
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,410
Yeah, Song Yi. Nothing's new?
 Is Yoon Jae there?

222
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,090
If there's something wrong, 
call me right away, okay?

223
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,100
Anyway, that crazy bastard 
who got into your house and tried to kill you-

224
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,750
If I find him, he's dead in my hands.

225
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,280
Yeah, yeah. Good night.

226
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,890
Did something happen to Song Yi?

227
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,890
I don't know. 
There are a lot of psychos these days, you know.

228
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,810
Do you know. . . someone called Do Min Joon?

229
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,300
How do you know Do Min Joon, Hyung?

230
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,540
What is he like?

231
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,330
It seemed like there's something special between 
Cheon Song Yi and him.

232
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,270
Have you ever noticed anything strange about that guy?

233
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,160
I haven't.

234
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,110
He's just someone who lives next door to Song Yi's.

235
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,380
Because he lives next door, they became acquainted 
as they pass each other by.

236
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,900
Is that so?

237
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,360
Yeah.

238
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:41,830
By the way. . . Why do you pay so much attention to my Song Yi these days?

239
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,900
It's because she's the woman you like.

240
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,890
Also, you asked me to help her if it becomes necessary, remember?

241
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,770
Rest. Alright?

242
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,810
 Because I found out his secret.

243
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,800
 What's that secret?

244
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,690
 I can't tell you. 
Please get me out of here.

245
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,370
 You keep yourself away from him.

246
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,990
 If you don't, you could die, too.

247
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,450
 Oppa. Where did say your ex-wife went to study?

248
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,940
 England. Why?

249
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,750
 No. Just. . .

250
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:53,110
 I was just wondering what great country she's
living in after divorcing a   guy like you.

251
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,640
 But. . . why don't you contact me directly?

252
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,030
 You always order someone to call me-

253
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,800
 It's the same for me but. . . You're an actress.
 It's good to keep our relationship private, no?

254
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,900
 I like to keep it private, too, but. . .

255
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,190
 I don't like how no one knows about our relationship.

256
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,430
 I want to brag to people about our relationship. . .

257
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,410
 《The Cloud Dream of the Nine》
a 17th century Korean Fantasy Novel about a young monk who dreamt of having 8 wives

258
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,090
He was all high and mighty talking how the book of
his book of life was Goowoonmong (9 clouds of dreams: ancient novel),

259
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,590
In the end, it's a story of a man having relationships 
with eight women.

260
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,670
Offensive!

261
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,740

What are you doing?

262
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,110
What's this? Why isn't he reading it?

263
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,850
Is he sleeping?

264
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,940
 Are you asleep?

265
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,540
 What are you doing? 
Are you asleep?

266
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,190
Oh... he read it!

267
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,220
What? After reading it, why isn't there a response?

268
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,080
I will survive!

269
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,400
Why?

270
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,610
  Is this Cheon Song Yi's cell phone?

271
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,660
Yes. Who is this?

272
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,820
I am the owner of Golden Palace Room No 2301.

273
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,250
The rent didn't come in yesterday.

274
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,760
How is that possible?

275
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,140
The balance of your account is not enough (to pay the rent).

276
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,430
Why would it be not enough?

277
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,510
A little while ago, you withdrew most of your money to pay the breach-of-contract damages.

278
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,100
Then first I will get it as a loan.

279
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,240
Because you sold off all your real estate holdings  ,

280
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,680
it'd be difficult to obtain a secured loan with real estate as collateral...

281
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,610
You've cancelled all CDs you had as well...

282
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,430
I think issuing a loan on credit would be somewhat difficult.

283
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,990
Team Leader, it is me, Cheon Song Yi.

284
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,240
Is it hard for Cheon Song Yi

285
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,230
to get a loan in Korea?

286
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,660
No matter how much of a superstar you are,
once you go before the loan committee,

287
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,100
you are only a freelancer.

288
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,160
When you assess the job class, your vocation's job stability is low,

289
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,220
so the loan rejection rate is high.

290
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,950
In addition, you haven't had any income

291
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,740
for the past few months.

292
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,640
Still, how many years have I been loyal to your bank?

293
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,760
I've deposited fortunes.

294
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,970
Aren't I a VVIP?

295
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,300
Not anymore. Your credit standing is rather bad.

296
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,260
Because you've gotten cash in advance very often.

297
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,420
I have never used that kind....

298
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,950
I guess my mother used that.

299
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,570
For the apartment I'm in, I'm paying monthly rent fee right now. There's a deposit money, you know.

300
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,680
Can't you take that money as a security and 
give me some loans?

301
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,130
For level 1 financial institutions,  a secured loan against the security deposit of your rental

302
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,460
is pretty much impossible.

303
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,510
Of course, I could submit it to the loan assessment panel,

304
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,230
it's fairly accurate to assume that the probability will be low.

305
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,780
Should I sell him (the car)?

306
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,590
What am I thinking?

307
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,860
Boom Boom, I am sorry.

308
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,680
Pretend you didn't hear it.

309
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,770
Since I have the one with the similar color, should I sell it?

310
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,770
Am I crazy? These babies are like my other self.

311
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,460
As soon as my living gets better,
 this Unni will come find you.

312
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,640
I promise you. It won't take long.

313
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,580
Take care of yourself in the meantime.

314
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,380
Be careful not to get scratched.

315
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,060
Song, what is all of this?

316
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,430
What do you mean what's what?

317
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,370
They are my babies that I've worn and carried around

318
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,390
once or twice because I valued them so much like my life.

319
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,540
But why (are you selling)?

320
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,030
I'll hand them over to you at half the price.

321
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,330
I bet everyone will snap them up like crazy if you told
them that Cheon Song Yi used them.

322
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,970
I think they will buy them only if I say these are not from Cheon Song Yi?

323
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,790
What?

324
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,970
Song, you need money?

325
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,620
What?

326
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,350
Excuse me? What did you just say?

327
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,340
There must be some misunderstanding

328
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,930
I'm giving these up in a sense of giving back to society.

329
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,580
You know. . . What should I say. . .

330
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,510
Should I say that I started to doubt my decision to 
decorate myself with luxury brands, when I AM already

331
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,780
a luxury brand?  Well, help out the unfortunate as well.

332
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,660
Aren't you the needy neighbor?

333
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,940
Offering the Cheongdamdong building at a bargain price
to sell it off in a pinch

334
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,330
is well known throughout this town.

335
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,110
I will give you some money, so take these and leave.

336
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:38,640
Instead, I would like you not to ever come into my store.

337
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,660
I beg of you.

338
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,520
You dare to treat me like this?

339
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,510
You think I have nowhere else to sell beside you?

340
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:05,640

341
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:15,340
Cute.. cute
♬    The stars were sparkling, that day   ♬

342
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:22,870
 Cheon Song Yi's bags, coats, shoes.  Price varies.
♬ My heart stopped beating. That person  ♬

343
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:30,090
 First compare to see whether they're reasonably priced 
  ♬ whose eyes were dazzling beautiful. Your love    ♬

344
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:36,440
♬  fell down like the white snow.  ♬

345
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,110
William James stated in Principles of Psychology that

346
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:43,750
It would be hard to think of punishment crueler than
to be excluded from society,

347
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:48,120
and to be ignored by the members within that society.

348
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,230
  Is discount possible?

349
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,680
I am sorry.

350
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,960
Humans are much weaker than expected, so

351
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,230
get excited or hurt deeply by

352
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:06,120
the attitude and manner in which others treat them.

353
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,890
  How about Woonpo 45?

354
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,290
Who are you that you kept calling?

355
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,190
What is "Woonpo" exactly?

356
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,780
 I mean, how about $450, shipping included?

357
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,520
 Aren't you the one who's selling Cheon Song Yi's bag? 
ID: songforyou?

358
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,520
What did I tell you?

359
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,400
I told you not to pay the penalty for breaching of the CF contract, didn't I?

360
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,750
More bills for cancellation fee came in, my girl.

361
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,440
What are you going to do now?

362
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,040
What is this?

363
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,300
  Statement of Damages

364
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,720
I don't know about this. I've never signed this.

365
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,930
Listen, I wasn't always this money hungry person.

366
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,790
Don't you know that the generosity breeds pushover.

367
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,020
This girl still thinks of the world as a fairy tale?

368
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,130
I will talk with President Ahn tomorrow.

369
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,230
Go together with me.

370
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,350
I have someone to go together with.

371
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,280
Why?

372
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,700
I have a favor to ask you.

373
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,070
 Hey, are you sure the bag is scratch-free?

374
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,480
 Is there a discount?

375
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,510
Even if you don't say anything, I was going to tell you.

376
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,240
Did you give my number to a bag selling website?

377
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,220
Did someone contact you?

378
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,870
How can you put my number there?!

379
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,320
I've been getting texts asking for a discount.
 It's driving me crazy!

380
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,130
No discount. 
I already feel bad for selling my babies,

381
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,510
I can't ever sell them cheap.

382
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,910
Reply back and tell her she can't.

383
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,010
That isn't what's important now.

384
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,850
Yeah, that isn't important.

385
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,030
I have to go to my agency tomorrow.
 Let's go together.

386
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,210
Why would I?

387
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,880
Because I am going there to make demands.

388
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,530
Isn't that your specialty, making demands?

389
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,560
If I go alone,

390
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,200
I feel like I might get caught.

391
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,930
What?

392
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,730
That I'm not the Cheon Song Yi I used to be.

393
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,790
To make myself look strong, 
I painted leopard prints on my nails, but

394
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,260
my mind is not strong.

395
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,210
I don't have confidence.

396
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,290
I think I might get found out, I think I might get found out,

397
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,980
the current me, that is.

398
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,350
Not having money? It's fine.

399
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:32,280
Money is something that comes and goes.  One can always make more.

400
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,090
But, if I get my shabby self found out,

401
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,480
I feel like I might really break down.

402
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,980
So. . .

403
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,690
If it seem like I'm about to get caught,

404
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,230
I'm asking my smart Mr. Do Min Joon to step up for me.

405
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,560
Okay?

406
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,820
I already finished reviewing it with our lawyer.

407
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,770
This falls strictly within the part you said you'd cover,

408
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,070
I said I'd be responsible on the ethical stand point.

409
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,760
I'm not saying that I'll go back on my words now.

410
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,020
But...

411
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:31,120
this is not it. When did I say I would do this movie?

412
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,760
You never showed me these scenarios.

413
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,640
And the travel company commercial. 
When did I say I'd do that?

414
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,690
These are all the points you've entrusted to our company...

415
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,290
I told you to do it with my consent.

416
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,970
When did I ever give you the right to sign the contract for dramas/movies and CF's on your own?

417
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,650
Cheon Song Yi!

418
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,110
Do you know how much damage my company got 
because of you?!

419
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,310
I've looked over your contract with her.

420
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,670
But...

421
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,860
why. . . is this person here?

422
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,670
Who is he?

423
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,980
My legal representative.

424
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,090
There are a lot of breaches.
 Especially,

425
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,530
"A" must try its best to ensure that "B's" personal life
and her privacy must not be violated

426
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:13,270
in conjunction with her life within the entertainment industry.

427
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,630
- This part. 
-- Wait.

428
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,980
I'm Party B? Why? I like Party A.

429
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,000
Okay.

430
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,520
And if you look at the article IV, when "A" acts as an agent
to sign the contract in her stead,

431
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,870
"A" must consider "B's" physical and mental state of readiness,

432
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,240
and is not permitted to sign contracts 
which are contrary to "B's" expressed intent.

433
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,060
And the last: article 7-5,

434
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,960
If an occasion to pay a third party arises due to a derogation of "B's" rights,

435
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,000
the total amount must be

436
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,460
paid by Party "A."

437
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,040
According to this clause,
 Miss Cheon Song Yi can receive back

438
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,240
the payments and penalty fees that she has already paid to this company.

439
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,850
If you really want to receive this payment,

440
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,260
please prepare for a compensation claim lawsuit.

441
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,270
At that time then, we will proceed forcefully by the letter of the law.

442
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,120
And we will, of course, receive back the payments and penalty fees that have already been paid.

443
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,840
Do you want to proceed?

444
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,070
Do you want to do it that way?

445
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,670
Suddenly this saying comes to mind.

446
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,100
"Bastards who would go and hide at Beotigogae at night."

447
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,050
Beoti. . . What?

448
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,110
There's a saying like that.

449
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,650
Song Yi Noona.

450
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,990
Unnie.

451
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,510
How did the Professor come to be here...

452
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,310
Hello, Song Yi.

453
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,350
You came together with her, Professor.

454
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,160
Yes.

455
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,580
Song Yi, are you busy right now?

456
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,230
Can we have a cup of coffee together?

457
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,540
Do you have the time for a moment?

458
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,940
- We're really bu-
- We have time.

459
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,460
Americano for our noona.

460
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,550
Hot chocolate for me.

461
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,930
It's been a long time.

462
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,430
I don't think that we had any time apart like this.

463
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,140
Why are you suddenly like this?

464
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,530
Say it like last time.

465
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,030
I was sorry.

466
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,680
I was disappointed with you who didn't acknowledge my sincerity,

467
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,340
and I know that refusing that position to replace you was the right thing,

468
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,820
but I don't like myself for being unable to do that.

469
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,510
That's why I wasn't in my right mind.

470
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,200
Hey.. don't put a show on.

471
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,010
Cheon Song Yi!

472
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,090
If you don't know, don't get involved!

473
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,410
Yoo Se Mi, I knew very well that you were sly,

474
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,880
but I didn't know that you'd be like that even to me.

475
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,520
Since you were found out, you tried to swallow me whole,

476
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,710
what's the reason you're coming here and lowering
 your tail now?

477
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,130
Stop it.

478
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:59,410
No...no... Song Yi has plenty of right to do that.

479
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,210
If you're acting like this, what becomes of me?

480
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,350
Coffee... oh!

481
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,750
Oh Unnie, are you okay?

482
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,320
Oh ... what to do? You have to wear this at shooting this time.

483
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,520
Ah... is it hot, Noona?

484
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,310
I'm fine.

485
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,610
Song Yi, are you okay?

486
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,590
Noona...

487
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,850
Unnie...

488
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,350
Forget it.

489
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,660
Professer, are you okay?

490
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,750
It got on you. What should we do?

491
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,600
I'm okay.

492
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,640
You've said everything you wanted right?

493
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,800
Let's go now, Manager Do!

494
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,570
Let's go.

495
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,080
That Professor and our noona,

496
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,630
when did they get so close?

497
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,230
You said that you didn't have an ideal type.

498
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,280
I guess Yoo Se Mi is your ideal type.

499
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,770
Stop with the words that don't make sense.

500
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,060
Were you just embarrassed?

501
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,420
You said you hate it when people touch your body.

502
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,580
Earlier when Se Mi was wiping for you saying that you had something smudged there, you were still.

503
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,270
It seemed like you were enjoying it too.

504
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,230
Anyway, before in front of President Ahn,

505
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,320
you did well, Manager Do.

506
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,590
If you're Cheon Song Yi's manager, it's right that you have that amount of knowledge.

507
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,420
Cheon Song Yi.

508
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,750
Yes?
  (using formal, respectful speech)

509
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,050
What? 
 (using casual, lowered form of speech)

510
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,610
Get your head screwed on straight as you live.

511
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,250
What?

512
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:40,150
Whether you know the world or not, the world won't 
take it easy on you.

513
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,200
Even if you crash unceasingly,

514
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,880
even if you say you feel like you could die from how unfair it is, the world doesn't even care.

515
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,660
You're on a cliff's edge right now.

516
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:56,140
If you take a wrong step, you'll fall down into a bottomlessness wilderness below and disappear without a trace. So

517
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,010
So...

518
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,280
I'm asking Manager Do to stay next to me.

519
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,400
Why do you trust me?

520
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:11,190
Don't trust me either. I...

521
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,210
can't stay at your side always.

522
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,060
Why?

523
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,470
Perhaps...

524
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,840
Because I'm poor...

525
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,270
That's why you won't stay by my side? Because I might not be able to pay you?

526
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,310
No way. I'm Cheon Song Yi.

527
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,460
Do you think I'll take away your salary? I won't.

528
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,970
Of course, I may not be able to give you as much as due to my situation.

529
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,960
Instead I won't make you do a lot of work.

530
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,880
All you have to do is stay by me from time to time when I tell you to.

531
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,130
You can't do that either?

532
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,200
You can't?

533
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,940
Go inside.

534
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,560
What about your fever?

535
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,810
You don't have a fever now?

536
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,600
No.

537
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,690
What about dinner? You have to eat dinner. I do too.

538
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,260
Same with Yoon Jae.

539
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,210
If he's at home, should we eat together?

540
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,080
No.

541
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,820
Okay then have it your way.

542
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:30,680

543
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,700
Mom left a radish kimchee for you before she left.

544
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,500
Okay.

545
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,860
She did?

546
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,010
Cheon Yoon Jae, go next door for a moment.

547
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:46,750
Why?

548
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,590
What do you mean why? I'm indebted to my next door neighbor,

549
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,350
so if we have something good to eat we should share it together.

550
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,560
Go give him some kimchee and come back.

551
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,740
You go and come back. Who are you ordering around?

552
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,220
You go give it to him.

553
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:09,350
Hey, you punk! How old are you that you're laying around watching E.T.? Are you in elementary school?

554
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,270
Really.

555
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,450
Go and tell him! That I'm the one giving it to him!

556
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,610
That I'm home!

557
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,800
My noona told me to bring this.

558
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,350
Did you give it to him?

559
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,240
Can you not tell by looking?

560
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,840
What did he say?

561
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,430
What do you mean? He took it because I gave it to him.

562
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,400
Did you tell him it was from me?

563
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,410
Yes.

564
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,250
But he didn't say anything?

565
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,920
He didn't!

566
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,170
Did you tell him I'm at home?

567
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,720
Why would I need to say that?

568
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,590
Why didn't you bring back the container?

569
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,240
I didn't bring it back because he didn't give it back to me.

570
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,680
You thoughtless boy.

571
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,350
That container is eco-friendly, so it's expensive.

572
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,480
Kimchi containers are kind of a strange item.

573
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,610
Once times passes, you can't quite ask for it, but I don't want to give it away.

574
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,540
Go and bring it back.

575
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,180
I'm getting really angry.

576
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,120
If the kimchi container's too good to give away,
 you go and bring it back!

577
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,830
Me?

578
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,710
If you say, so there's nothing else I can do about it.

579
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,680
Is this too much?

580
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,630
What is it this time?

581
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,790
I came to get the kimchi container.

582
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,750
Wait.

583
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,500
You were about to close it on my fingers!

584
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,330
What are you doing?

585
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,790
You didn't change your password.

586
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,670
Don't change it.

587
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,600
I keep forgetting mine, but I never forget yours. It's weird.

588
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,170
Oh, you cleaned.

589
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,470
Did you water the plant?

590
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,200
It was withering, so I was going to water it anyway.

591
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,600
It came back to life.

592
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,040
That radish kimchi, it's really good.

593
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,160
Even if my mother doesn't look like it, she makes a really delicious kimchee.

594
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,970
Leave it out for a day, and put it in the refrigerator tomorrow.

595
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,280
Okay.

596
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,190
Now leave.

597
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,200
Go?

598
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,880
Didn't you come to get the kimchee container?

599
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Oh, that's right.

600
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,930
I did come to get this.

601
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,500
Okay! I'll go now.

602
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,220
There's no more calls about people wanting to
 buy my bags?

603
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,320
Because I can't lower the price, there aren't anymore calls.

604
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,370
You should try lowering about 20,000 won.

605
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,950
While I'm telling you nicely, change the number that you put up on the website.

606
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,020
All right. You're so mean.

607
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,960
I'm going! I was going anyway.

608
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,020
Have you gone crazy?!

609
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,730
What have I just done?

610
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,930
Did I just want to stay in that house right now?

611
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,650
Cheon Song Yi! Come to your senses!

612
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,920
So I...

613
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,540
I'm Cheon Song Yi, why do I have to...to that kind of man.

614
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,170
To Do Min Joon, that human being.

615
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,500
The length of his legs... I like it.

616
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,940
He has great proportions. His small face 
and the gleam in his eyes too.

617
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,420
Last time when I saw. . . 
it seemed like he's been working out to stay fit.

618
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,120
But still. What am I lacking to that Do Min Joon?

619
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,760
He graduated from Harvard and became a professor.

620
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:58,040
Even though it was his first kiss, it wasn't that bad-

621
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,060
Omo! Omo! Omo!!

622
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,390
Am I rethinking about the kiss with that human?

623
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:09,090
Perhaps. . . am I longing for him?

624
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,290
No... no... no!

625
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,800
This is really clean.

626
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,460
No phone records. . .

627
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,430
Be it (credit) card records too.

628
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,370
Not even one paparazzi cut too.

629
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,910
There is not a single sign of a man. . .

630
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,050
How did she have a child?

631
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,360

632
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,940
Aren't you. . .

633
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,910
the actress, Yoo Se Mi?

634
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,120
Yes. You're working hard.

635
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,020
I'm right!

636
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,020
But what brings you here?

637
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,500
Oppa!

638
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:04,660
You even have your busy younger sister bring underwear for you.

639
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,480
Thank you.

640
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,840
Mom is worried. Drop by the house sometime.

641
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,260
Yes.

642
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,020
Oh, right.

643
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,430
Se Mi.

644
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,400
Yes?

645
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,260
Could it be that Han Yoo Ra. . .

646
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,080
Are you still investigating that case?

647
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,510
Wasn't that ruled out as suicide?

648
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,190
People stopped paying attention to that now.

649
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,430
You should wrap it up.

650
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:31,580
Have you heard of any relationship with a man?

651
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,570
Man?

652
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,390
 Oppa, do you have someone you're dating?

653
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:42,270
 No, Han Yoo Ra was saying things about marrying a man from S &amp; C.

654
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,730
 There are only two sons in that family.

655
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,030
 If it's Han Yoo Ra, I only know her as our department store's model.

656
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,210
 It's just to that extent.

657
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,300
Why?

658
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:58,080
No matter how I see it, it seems that this case has Han Yoo Ra's man involved.

659
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,510
Have you heard of anything or know anything?

660
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,550
I'm not so sure.

661
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,820
Hyung.

662
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,770
Hello. 
- Jae Kyeong.

663
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,890
 Come see me for once. 
 Please come listen to me.

664
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:36,500
 You know I'm not crazy.
The people here don't believe me.

665
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,090
 You can take me out of here.

666
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,220
Excuse me, who--

667
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,300
Hyung.

668
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,130
Why are you answering someone else's call?

669
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,880
Sorry.

670
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,410
But who was that?

671
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,920
She was asking you to take her out or something.

672
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,410
She's a crazy woman.

673
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,060
She said. . .

674
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,870
she's not crazy.

675
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,990
When you do office work,

676
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,310
it's inevitable that you meet strange people, Hui Kyeong.

677
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,860
It's something you don't need to know.

678
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,720
Don't worry about it.

679
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,410
Okay.

680
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,100
I understand.

681
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,120
Hello.

682
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,930
This is Do Min Joon.

683
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,680
 Yes, what's the matter?

684
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,930
 I would like to meet up.
There's something I need to give you.

685
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:38,020
 Yes, where should we meet?

686
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,740
Meet up with me for a bit.

687
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,350
Do Mana-

688
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,430
Do Min Joon.

689
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,260
What have you done to me?

690
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,710
What  is "what?"

691
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,010
You did do something to me.

692
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,510
You did... you have.

693
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,290
There's no way for me to be like this if you didn't do anything.

694
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,360
Say it so that I would understand.

695
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:19,580
I clearly tried to seduce you for 15 seconds.

696
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,790
Did I get seduced too?

697
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:25,910
What?

698
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:31,110
What do you think of me? ... No, no, no! Don't answer that! You're dead if you answer!!

699
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,960
Because I'm somewhat embarrassed,

700
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,890
I will say it with my back turned, so you just need to listen.

701
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:52,590
I'm not usually like this.

702
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:55,490
Of course, I acknowledge that I'm grateful for all this time.

703
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:59,100
But still, am I not someone who can't differentiate that feeling against feeling grateful?

704
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,660
No, I'm not.

705
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,940
If we're going with being grateful, I should be much more grateful to Hui Kyeong.

706
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,390
But why should I be thinking about you?

707
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,140
I'm a woman who's been thought about.

708
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,470
My airport fashion, the lipstick that I use, my shining hair. . .

709
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,580
I was always the topic of others..

710
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,050
Why should I. . . with your words. . .

711
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,260
Why you. . .

712
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,500
The kiss with you. . .

713
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:30,280
Ah, have I gone crazy?

714
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,620
How am I as a woman?... No, don't answer! 
You're dead if you answer that!

715
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,680
Do Min Joon.

716
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,640
Did you leave?

717
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,690
You can answer this.

718
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,720
Are you gone?

719
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:12,660
♬  Wherever you are.  ♬

720
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,820
♬  Whatever you do.  ♬

721
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,770
♬   In my heart,   ♬

722
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,850
♬  I can feel you.  ♬

723
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,810
♬   I think it must be love.   ♬

724
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,850
Ah... what do I do?

725
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:37,040
♬  It can't be anything but love.   ♬

726
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,450
♬  Because in my eyes,  ♬

727
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,390
♬  Inside my heart,  ♬

728
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:48,310
♬  You are shining like a star.  ♬

729
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,070
What is this? 
A rumor that Cheon Song Yi was a school gang?

730
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,240
Hey, some blogger is close with

731
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,380
Cheon Song Yi's high school schoolmate's  in-laws' third cousin's neighbor.

732
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,230
That person clearly heard.

733
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,810
When Cheon Song Yi was in grade school, she was chewing gum. . . (rebellious)

734
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:12,300
The kids she bothered were not just one or two.

735
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,630
- They all died if they get caught. 
- Hey.

736
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,080
If they are Cheon Song Yi's high school schoolmate's  in-laws' third cousin's

737
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,660
neighbor.

738
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,840
That sounds like reliable info.

739
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,300
With that past, did she harass that nice Han Yoo Ra too?

740
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,880
It seems like it.

741
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,300
Are you sure?

742
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,890
Are you sure I was a bully?

743
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:35,890
That they would be dead if they get caught. . .

744
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,670
are you sure of that?

745
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:44,540
Just because a person is staying still. . . they think I can't react.

746
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,610
Nonsense rumors just spread.

747
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,820
This won't do. I should do a press conference.

748
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,470
-- Do. Do it!
-- Right?

749
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,060
I was just hiding. What did I do wrong?

750
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,210
I should say what I need to say. Press conference.

751
00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:00,400
I will show you the standard example of this kind of a press conference. Look at me.

752
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,890
First, don't smile.

753
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:06,420
Be as depressed, miserable, and pathetic as possible.

754
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,730
Your eyes need to be lowered 15 degrees.

755
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,890
That's good. Whatever someone says. . .

756
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,990
the expression where you look like you'll cry right away.

757
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:16,980
You're good.

758
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,490
Don't wear any accessories.

759
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,820
But it has been a while since I've been in front of the camera.

760
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,010
You're not there for a photo shoot.

761
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,700
Your clothes.
It should be black, top and bottom.

762
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,660
- Gaunt-looking make-up is even better.
-- Gaunt-looking?

763
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,940
It's better if you look dead tired.

764
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,460
Would that suit me?

765
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,750
Don't you want sympathy?

766
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,720
And prepare a handkerchief.

767
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,190
-- Why?
-- You will cry at the end.

768
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,480
You will be look like you're about to cry throughout the press conference. . .

769
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,500
but never cry.

770
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,740
It might seem low,

771
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:53,390
But you need to pour it out in the last 5 minutes.

772
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,790
Hey, you seem like a pro.

773
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,130
Of course.

774
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:59,340
Where will you hold the press conference?

775
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,200
I'm not sure.

776
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,990
Should we do it at a hotel? Reserving the biggest room.

777
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,160
Will your agency be doing it?

778
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,870
I don't have one.

779
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,690
Then do you have money?

780
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,860
I'm poor. Like really poor.

781
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,710
No matter how I look at it, I don't understand why you live like this.

782
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,080
Hello.

783
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,860
 You're the person who put Cheon Song Yi's shoes, right?

784
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,080
Yes, that's right. Cheon Song Yi's shoes.

785
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,370
How much are you thinking about to pay? 
$150, shipping included?

786
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:29,470
That's a bit troublesome.

787
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:34,460
You're trying to get it for nothing. She personally went to Milan to get that, you know.

788
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,940
It's not fake!

789
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,080
 It looks like somebody got hurt.

790
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,660
 Is he dead?

791
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,650
 How would I know?

792
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,990
 How could this thing happens in our neighborhood?

793
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,700
Hey, you should eat rice.

794
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,470
Wait a bit, I'll order something for you.

795
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,390
Forget it. I ate already.

796
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,500
Where did you go the whole day that you just came back now?

797
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,850
I am always busy.

798
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,950
By chance, did anyone call me?

799
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:47,300
Did someone come look for me? For example, someone from next door.

800
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,820
No.

801
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,690
A woman mustered up the courage to say something like that.

802
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,440
But why isn't there a call throughout the whole day?

803
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,260
See if I associate with him ever again!

804
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,600
Omo.

805
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,460
Where is my purple hair band?

806
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,200
I cherish that a lot.

807
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,350
I guess I left it at the Manager Do's house.

808
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:21,110
What should I do?

809
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,800
Do Min Joon!

810
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,330
Hasn't he come back yet?

811
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,940
Is he in the study room?

812
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,610
Do Min Joon!

813
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,050
Are you here?

814
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:39,640
He isn't here.

815
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,250
It is cold. Where did he go?

816
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,950
Did he go on a date?

817
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,010
Is that you who made Prosecutor Yoo like that?

818
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:53,850
Didn't I tell you?

819
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:59,180
The reason why you and Cheon Song Yi are alive is because I am letting you guys live.

820
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,490
So be grateful.

821
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:07,410
I most hate people who don't know to be grateful.

822
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,630
Is this what you want?

823
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:17,200
Will you stop everything if I just surrender this?

824
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,730
Yeah, I should.

825
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:23,420
Then, I should give you something in return.

826
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,030
Do you know what this is?

827
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,520
It's a tranquilizer gun used to capture animals.

828
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,180
It makes people like you fall asleep with one shot.

829
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:50,690
Inside of this. . . 
I mixed Zoletil (anaesthetic) and Rompun (sedative) well.

830
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:55,480
So you can collapse without pain with one shot.

831
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,500
I don't usually do this kind of thing.

832
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,540
But you provoked me.

833
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,490
So I wanted to send you away myself.

834
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:12,710
Your death will be disguised as a suicide
 more natural than any other death.

835
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:17,780
After killing Han Yoo Ra and 
after assaulting even the prosecutor in charge of the case,

836
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,360
you could not bear the pressure.

837
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,910
So you chose to kill yourself. . .

838
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:28,650
Around this time, your computer probably has a suicide note written by you.

839
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:50,340
 Never again in front of that person, or any other person actually, should you show your true self.

840
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,420
  Are you going lose everything that you protected so hard all this time?

841
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:03,080
You need to be taken care of first.

842
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,840
Only then, it seemed, taking care of Cheong Song Yi would be easy too.

843
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,030
Well, the order . . .

844
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,810
doesn't matter a  lot.

845
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,430
Farewell.

846
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,180
What did I tell you?

847
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:39,640
Didn't I tell you that you can never kill me?

848
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:51,640

849
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,480
 Doctor, please answer me.

850
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,320
 Can the feeling of dependence change to love?

851
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,060
  Even though I can't say it is impossible,

852
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:14,760
 it is possible for you to confuse your desire to rely on a particular person with love.

853
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,630
 I rely on chicken and beer.

854
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,170
 I always eat chicken and beer when I'm depressed.

855
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:22,210
 However, my heart doesn't flutter when I see a chicken leg just because of that.

856
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,920
 But this flutters.

857
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,770
  Lub Dub Lub Dub. (heart beat)

858
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,270
  Should I give you another example, doctor?

859
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:34,250
 When I hold brand new bags, my heart flutters. 
My heart beats fast too.

860
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:38,250
 However, just because I don't see them,
 my lips don't get dried.

861
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:42,020
 Or just because other girls are carrying them around,

862
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,970
 I don't have the urge to kill the girls.

863
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,170
 But this is just like this.

864
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:55,710
 My heart flutters and my lips get dried.

865
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:59,240
 If I don't see him, I feel anxious.

866
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,860
 The girl that flirts with that man, I want to just...

867
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:11,450
 I am sorry. I am sorry. 
I am sorry, Doctor.

868
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:15,300
 The girl that got coffee on that man and then wiped it off.

869
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:19,110
 I want to break her hand completely.

870
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,660
 What is this kind of emotion, Doctor?

871
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,930
  First, let's just change the medication

872
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:36,400
 to something stronger.
Make sure you take it regularly.
