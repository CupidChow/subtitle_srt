THE ROSE OF SIN

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 04

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,080
 I can't pay that much.

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,039
 Please forgive me.

11
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:05,965
 This is the first time I made a mistake, I won't do it again.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,359
 Please forgive me.

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,200
 Be a nice person.

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
 Then I have to re-educate you.

15
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,280
 Everyone else go out.

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
You too?

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,800
That's right, me too.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,760
Departure!

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,520
This is really a small matter, you can let it go.

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,560
But there must be some small punishment.

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,880
As for you, are you willing?

22
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:13,605
Whatever you do, just do it, no need to beat around the bush, I'm too lazy to guess.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Thong.

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Thong!

25
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,240
Thong.

26
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,680
What did he do to Thong? Say it.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,320
Don't ask, okay?

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,960
I don't want to talk about that anymore.

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,560
Say it. If you don't talk, you won't come back.

30
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,440
He wanted to touch my breasts so he wouldn't make a big deal out of it.

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,560
You bastard.

32
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,560
So why don't you scream for me? Why leave it alone?

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,799
Can calling me help?

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Do you have 23,000 baht to pay him?

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,800
Just have to accept it. It's better than both of them going to jail.

36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
So can I record a clip?

37
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,080
Are you crazy? After being forced like that, who could record the clip?

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,840
Never mind. Consider it a blessing to feed the dog.

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,720
Let's go home. I want to go wash my chest thoroughly.

40
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,920
His hands are disgusting. The skin on your hands is as rough as the skin on your feet.

41
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm not coming back. The store is about to close.

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,560
I will wait for it here.

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,920
You will know my hand, you bastard.

44
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,200
Oh.

45
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,160
- What is it? - Did you touch my wife's breasts?

46
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,920
You touched my wife's breasts, right?

47
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,719
 Do you want it so much?

48
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
 Which hand do you use to touch my wife's breasts?

49
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,399
 You say it. Which hand do you use?

50
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,759
 - You didn't do that. - Is this the right hand?

51
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,920
 You didn't do that.

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
 Oh.

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
 Or this guy?

54
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,920
 Oh, I didn't do it.

55
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,280
 Please calm down.

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,560
 Remember carefully. If you want too much

57
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,640
 then go and rub your mother's breasts,

58
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:30,560
 Don't touch someone else's wife's breasts.

59
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
 Got it?

60
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,279
 The name...

61
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
 Leave it alone, friend!

62
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,519
 Hey, stand up.

63
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
 Oh my god!

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,559
 If you're going to go to the police,

65
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,720
 If you don't believe me, just try it.

66
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
 Got it?

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
 Understand.

68
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,720
How much money? Please share it so I can use it.

69
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:07,200
Hurry up!

70
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:08,800
Yes, here sir.

71
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,640
This bastard!

72
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,800
As a manager, you only have 500 baht in you?

73
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
I...

74
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,000
 What's wrong? Can't you touch it a little?

75
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,440
 The pain from being hit yesterday still hasn't gone away.

76
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
 Sorry!

77
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:53,667
 You've already taken your revenge.

78
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,472
 I promise later

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,040
 I won't let anyone do anything to Thong anymore.

80
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,800
What do you want to do next time?

81
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:05,479
Can we talk to each other first?

82
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,560
Even though he had such a stupid plan, he could do it.

83
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,039
Who knew there were surveillance cameras there?

84
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,800
You can see in movies that people can do it.

85
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,707
Did you follow that in the movie? What the hell?

86
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,439
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,399
What's more annoying? Just want to help Thong save money.

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,279
I hate the word "saving", I have saved enough in this life.

89
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,039
I want to spend money freely,

90
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,039
No need to think, okay?

91
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,840
- Do you really want money? - YES.

92
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:35,320
Okay. If you want more money, I'll go earn more for you. Are you satisfied?

93
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,479
Like you, what talent do you have that makes you want to make money?

94
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,959
Are you begging your father?

95
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,560
How much money does a lowly officer like that have on him?

96
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,360
 Pete, do you dare slap me?

97
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,319
 Because you touched my father first.

98
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,959
 I ran away from my mother to live with you,

99
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
 not to get slapped by you.

100
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
 You!

101
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,599
 Bad husband, bad husband.

102
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,119
 A husband who beats his wife is a bad person.

103
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,359
 My life has ended up like this

104
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,319
 You dare slap me again, you bastard?

105
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,319
 Get out of my room, get out of my room.

106
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,640
 Go away, I don't need you anymore, go away.

107
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,560
 Just keep arguing in small talk, it's too deafening.

108
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,999
 What? At home, does your mother argue in a whisper?

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,839
 If you have an argument, you have to scream.

110
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,280
 If you can't stand it, jump off the building and die.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,479
 You're the one who should be dancing.

112
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,159
 I have been here peacefully for a long time,

113
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,119
 Since you moved in, you've been causing trouble every day.

114
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,759
 Something that parents don't teach.

115
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,479
You probably ran away from home and followed your boyfriend here, right?

116
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,639
I don't want to get involved

117
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,479
But your loud voice resonates all the way here.

118
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,479
Some nonsense of yours,

119
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,999
I don't want to know.

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,679
What effect does it have on you if I quarrel with my husband?

121
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,039
You are a talkative person.

122
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,839
Next time you should find a husband so you have something to do.

123
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,680
Don't meddle in other people's affairs anymore.

124
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,640
Enough, it's so annoying.

125
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,839
Do you hear that?

126
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
My husband is annoyed, please shut up.

127
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,560
You too, Thong.

128
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,520
What's up, does it taste delicious?

129
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Thong.

130
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,800
You worked hard to prepare to atone for your mistakes.

131
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,720
Can you forgive me?

132
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,800
That day he really couldn't control his hands.

133
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,600
From now on I will pay more attention.

134
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,000
But Thong can't talk about his father like that anymore, okay?

135
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,480
It's okay to forgive because it's delicious.

136
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,080
Where did you get the money? Why order so much?

137
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,600
The money was taken from that perverted manager.

138
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,720
Eat a lot to get rid of your enemies.

139
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Fertilize me.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Here.

141
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Thank you.

142
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Dear Wi, next time please be a little more selective about who rents the room.

143
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,039
The little girl just moved in yesterday,

144
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,639
Oh my god, it's been loud since the first day we moved in.

145
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,679
And in the morning she beat her husband

146
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,200
It's noisy and chaotic all over the floor, Wi.

147
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,239
So what? So let me remind you.

148
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,959
That's good, Wi. I have to go and remind you.

149
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,119
And if Wi reminds her but she doesn't listen

150
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,439
then Wi chased her away.

151
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,639
I think it would be better to chase it away.

152
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,439
Hey, that vagabond is living with such a naughty girl

153
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,560
The room will definitely be 1,000% damaged. Believe me.

154
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,080
Believe me, Wi. You really have good intentions.

155
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Yes.

156
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,479
Because she bothers others too, Wi.

157
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,120
I understand.

158
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:57,440
I'll go remind you.

159
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,520
The noise is unbearable.

160
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Who is that?

161
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,960
What's the matter?

162
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah... the thing is...

163
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,600
Mr. Wi, Mr. Wi come here first.

164
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Come in.

165
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,840
Yes, please.

166
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,559
We're eating pizza, do you want to eat together?

167
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
It's okay, I've eaten.

168
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,680
You sit down.

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
YES.

170
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,960
What's wrong with Mr. Wi coming to look for Thong?

171
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,479
I came to ask

172
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,920
Have Thong done anything noisy lately?

173
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,240
What's the noise? Still talking normally.

174
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,760
That's right, did anyone tell Mr. Wi anything?

175
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,400
The old lady in the next room whispered to Mr. Wi, right?

176
00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:16,240
How could she gossip to you? Are you acquainted with her?

177
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,840
She is also a tenant.

178
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,440
The room next door is also his room.

179
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,279
Really?

180
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Yes.

181
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,400
Mr. Wi has two rooms for rent?

182
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,399
This apartment has two rooms.

183
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,200
There is another apartment with three rooms.

184
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Brag.

185
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,360
Just saying that.

186
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,800
He has five rooms for rent.

187
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,640
Room rental fee per month is 10,000 baht, five rooms is 50,000 baht per month.

188
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,200
He doesn't do anything and has 50,000 baht per month.

189
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Always feel comfortable.

190
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,759
It's not comfortable, I still have to work at home.

191
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:54,281
Do you have another business at home?

192
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,440
Pete, look at him, he's good.

193
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,800
Mr. Wi, if Thong also wants to do his own business

194
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,604
Mr. Wi, please teach Thong.

195
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,640
Chicken gets teeth.

196
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,719
Let's talk again next time.

197
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,320
I'll go today, I won't bother you anymore.

198
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,479
See you again Mr. Wi.

199
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
Yes.

200
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,600
 What's wrong with you? Why did you do that to Mr. Wi?

201
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,680
 I don't like that guy's face, I don't like you talking to him.

202
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,880
 What? Jealous?

203
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
 Yes.

204
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,160
 I'm jealous for nothing.

205
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,959
 I have a handsome and cool brother here,

206
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,160
 Why are you still looking at other people?

207
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,000
 I don't like seeing you talk to him with that expression...

208
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
 Whiny?

209
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
 Yes.

210
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,640
 - Well, I want to seduce him. - What?

211
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,040
 What?

212
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,199
 Listen. If I can seduce him,

213
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,320
 makes it easier to ask him for any help, right?

214
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,040
Next month I want to ask him to let me stay for free.

215
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,760
Just make a pitiful face and say,

216
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,879
Honey, I feel sorry for you.

217
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,640
I really don't have money.

218
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,759
Except for free accommodation,

219
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,440
Who knows, maybe it will give us more money.

220
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,919
Exchange benefits?

221
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
YES.

222
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
That's OK.

223
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,280
But surely you don't think anything more than that?

224
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,200
Sure.

225
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,679
His face looks like a child's,

226
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,960
Who can like it?

227
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,640
Only good at one point is being rich.

228
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,680
Hello Pete.

229
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,800
How do you know my name?

230
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,039
Well, my God, you guys argue so loudly

231
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
I still know your father's name.

232
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,520
Let me tell you my name, my name is Si.

233
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Yes.

234
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,079
Hey, is there a problem? It's okay to tell you,

235
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,360
We are neighbors after all.

236
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,560
It's nothing, I just came out to smoke a little.

237
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,199
Hey, stressed about money, right?

238
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
I heard you two arguing.

239
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,239
When I first came to Bangkok,

240
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,079
I also have problems with this.

241
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,040
But anyway, she still has something to eat and spend.

242
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:51,329
It's been more than 10 years now.

243
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,080
So what do you do, tell me?

244
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:09,826
If you want to know,

245
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:13,646
Then go to my room, I'll tell you.

246
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,320
Go inside first.

247
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,840
Hey, go ahead!

248
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,480
Hey, you can sit anywhere, or

249
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,160
Sit on my bed!

250
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,479
Sit down, feel free.

251
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Hey, let's drink something cool.

252
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,280
For comfort.

253
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,880
Relax.

254
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,240
Think of it as hanging out in your friend's room.

255
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Thank you.

256
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,279
So where is your house?

257
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,240
Why did we move here together?

258
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,320
It's better not to know, it's not interesting.

259
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,160
Hey, don't say it's evasion.

260
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,840
Just kidding, just kidding!

261
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,080
Young boys and girls like this,

262
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,479
It's probably a family matter that prohibits it.

263
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,080
then ran away together. So is it?

264
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,880
Right.

265
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,275
I took my girlfriend to escape.

266
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,360
I want to take good care of her.

267
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,360
I also don't have a penny to invest.

268
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,600
I haven't finished studying yet.

269
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,480
so I can't apply.

270
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,320
When I first arrived in Bangkok,

271
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,440
I don't know anyone.

272
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,840
No money, no education.

273
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,680
There is only will.

274
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,440
That's why I had to take my body,

275
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,847
Use your body to make money.

276
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,760
But... Let me see.

277
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,600
Handsome. The face is also beautiful.

278
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,280
Such a good person,

279
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,360
I think we will definitely make a lot of money.

280
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:54,954
You want me to sell my body? I don't drink anymore.

281
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,559
No no no. Not.

282
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,480
I won't let Pete go sell himself to any brothel.

283
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,520
Only selling to me alone.

284
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,080
 Do it? She gave 2,000 baht at a time.

285
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,040
 No, sister. I still love my lover.

286
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,680
 No. Then just love the person who loves you.

287
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,759
 I didn't say anything to you either.

288
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,920
 I'm not asking you to be my lover.

289
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,320
 I just want you

290
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,960
 just came to have fun temporarily.

291
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,800
 Did you really do it? I'm really asking.

292
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,919
 I also did that job,

293
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,760
 So why do you want me to do it again?

294
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,960
Buyer's feeling

295
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,640
and the person who buys it is different.

296
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,600
Come on, Pete.

297
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,240
Pete doesn't need to ask you much. Hey.

298
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,040
Quickly make her happy

299
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,480
then take the money back. Hey.

300
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Hey, sister.

301
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,200
And tomorrow Pete gets the money

302
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,040
Go buy beautiful clothes for your lover.

303
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,400
See? Good both ways.

304
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
 Hey.

305
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,000
 But that's not good for Pete's lover.

306
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,399
 No.

307
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,800
 Pete.

308
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
 Pete.

309
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,680
 Oh, I almost did it.

310
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
 So boring.

311
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
 Pete.

312
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,000
 Where did you disappear to?

313
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,000
 I couldn't sleep so I went for a walk in the park.

314
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,719
 Why don't you say where you're going? Shocked all over.

315
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,160
 I thought you would abandon me.

316
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,240
 Oh my god, what are you thinking?

317
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,520
 My lover is so cute, how could he leave her?

318
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
 You also know that I have no one in my life.

319
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,560
There's only one of you.

320
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,800
Next time don't startle me again.

321
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,119
Oh my God. If you let me say it a hundred times or a thousand times

322
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,240
then he will also say

323
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
I love you.

324
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,920
And will be faithful to you.

325
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,440
I will never leave you to go anywhere.

326
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,960
If you break your promise

327
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,560
you will be hit by a car and die.

328
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,160
Do you drink alcohol?

329
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,480
Have a little drink

330
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,480
to sleep well.

331
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
Go to sleep.

332
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,320
I'm back.

333
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,960
Let's eat again, Thong.

334
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,960
Yes, wait a minute.

335
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,520
Well, I talked to my aunt at the restaurant,

336
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,040
He said there was a lathe factory two alleys away.

337
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,520
They are also hiring staff.

338
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,200
Can you register?

339
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,840
What is a turning mill? Is it like school?

340
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,959
It's mechanical, soldering iron and all that.

341
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,720
 I studied this field, so I should be able to do it, do you think it's possible?

342
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,880
 I don't like it.

343
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:04,680
 After doing that, you look very dirty,

344
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,920
 please find another job.

345
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,280
 Pete, please watch this show again.

346
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,960
 People take them to bars, they're all upper class people.

347
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,439
 Life is good

348
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,679
 must start by getting to know people with a lot of money first,

349
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
 do you see that?

350
00:22:32,113 --> 00:22:33,393
[Bull Pub]

351
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,200
 People here in Bangkok don't like to dance very much, do they?

352
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,560
 I don't feel happy at all, the bar in my hometown is more fun.

353
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
 You have to dance like that.

354
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,360
Pete.

355
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Pete, stop.

356
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,678
 Don't jump around here

357
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,840
 pulling and pounding rice, very embarrassing.

358
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,880
 Look at people, see how they dance.

359
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,360
 Let's just dance and let others dance too.

360
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,154
 Stop it. Where to sit now?

361
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Pete.

362
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,120
I don't know what music to play.

363
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,920
I don't see anything funny. It's better to go home, Thong.

364
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,319
What are we here for, Pete?

365
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,240
We come to find friends, we have to meet rich people.

366
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,880
If you have a wide relationship, the road will be open.

367
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,960
I only know how to get acquainted with rustic people like those rice sellers

368
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,400
then life is just like them.

369
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
Pete!

370
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,320
Someone raised a glass to you. Can I go talk to people?

371
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,760
Ai?

372
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:58,920
That person sitting alone there.

373
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Is that so?

374
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
No, don't give it away.

375
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Face looks like he wants to punch. Looking at it, I knew it was a goat.

376
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,280
If you only think like that, when will you know anyone?

377
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,560
He looks very polite.

378
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,840
Okay, let me go with you.

379
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,800
No need, don't go.

380
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,119
Stay here.

381
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,640
I'll introduce it later.

382
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,720
If you take it away from the beginning, it will ruin everything.

383
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,600
Wait here.

384
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,960
When you came to greet me like that, didn't your lover say anything?

385
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,400
Don't say anything, I asked my lover for permission.

386
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,919
Besides, there's nothing to lose.

387
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,080
Just wanted to come raise a glass to my new friend.

388
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,560
New friend? New friends are new friends.

389
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,800
His name is Matt. What's your name?

390
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,520
My name is Thong.

391
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:07,760
What name?

392
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Name...

393
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,400
My name is Thong. Thong.

394
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,880
Never seen you here.

395
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,640
Yes.

396
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:16,760
Just coming for the first time?

397
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,600
Yes.

398
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,640
I just moved from out of town and still don't have any friends.

399
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,600
When you have free time, Matt will take you out for a bit.

400
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
What?

401
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,800
Thong said, can Matt take Thong out?

402
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,519
Do you want to go out?

403
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,079
Yes.

404
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,960
Okay.

405
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:33,441
Actually, Thong just moved here.

406
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,119
What are you doing?

407
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Pete.

408
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,919
- What are you doing? Don't hit him. - Don't touch my wife.

409
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,760
Pete, what is it? What are you doing?

410
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,000
Pete, stop, are you crazy?

411
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,319
Get over here, go home, Pete.

412
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,199
You bastard.

413
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,713
Pete.

414
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,153
Don't let me see you again.

415
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:50,280
Pete.

416
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Pete.

417
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,199
Pete, can you please stop being unreasonable?

418
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,880
I'm going to find new friends.

419
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,080
 New friend or new husband?

420
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,640
 Talk and laugh.

421
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,400
 Think I don't know? You want to sleep with it.

422
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,159
What the hell are you talking about?

423
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,440
 Nonsense, you're drunk.

424
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,719
 I'm drunk, yes, I'm drunk.

425
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,439
 But I'm not blind.

426
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,920
If you come with me, please respect me a little.

427
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,240
What does someone like you have to respect?

428
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,679
Your father is just a second-level official.

429
00:26:21,684 --> 00:26:24,764
 And you are poor and drive an old car.

430
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,520
The clothes you wear are all stolen money.

431
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,199
Let me tell you, your whole life

432
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Not even worth as much as Matt's shoes.

433
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,399
I ask him to help make our lives better,

434
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,239
You're nosy trying to talk to him.

435
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,119
 With a husband as stupid as you, when will my life get better?

436
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,080
 Stop praising other guys in front of me.

437
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,880
First it was that guy at the store, now it's this guy.

438
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,040
 I'm a country playboy.

439
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,000
 I don't have luxury things like them.

440
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,600
 Only a flirtatious wife like you.

441
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,919
Do it, if you want it then do it.

442
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,400
Go find a new husband!

443
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Hey, Pete!

444
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,960
Wherever you go, go!

445
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,959
I tell you, I won't coax someone like you.

446
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,360
YES.

447
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:13,159
I'll get someone to drive a Mercedes to pick me up.

448
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,280
Yes, do it!

449
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,600
Do you dare leave me?

450
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,399
Tell me clearly!

451
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,080
Hey, Pete, hey, Pete!

452
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,000
Hey, little brother. You pushed me just now.

453
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,120
Still not resolved.

454
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Okay.

455
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,920
Want to solve it right?

456
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,480
Come here and solve this problem.

457
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,120
Pete.

458
00:28:16,106 --> 00:28:19,455
THE ROSE OF SIN
