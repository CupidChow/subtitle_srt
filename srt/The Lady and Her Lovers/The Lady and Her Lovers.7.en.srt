THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 7

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,960
 A dozen eggs, [Market]

10
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,560
 Type 10 A.

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,840
 3,900 baht! Wait a minute.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,960
 Ms. Na,

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,959
 Why did you write it by hand?

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,519
 Because my son has not arrived yet,

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,039
 so I have to write this by hand.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,639
 If you can't wait,

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,879
 then come tomorrow.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,479
 Come here!

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,120
 There!

20
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,760
 - My child is here. - Hi everybody.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,879
 Where are you going?

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,839
 Sorry, let me handle it further.

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,119
 Hurry and do it.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,720
 Yes.

25
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:23,960
 - Wait a minute. - Wait a minute.

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,320
 - Ieng, do you have rice yet? - Here it is.

27
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:31,873
 Done?

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
 Yes.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,520
 Thank you.

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,679
 Mom woke up in the morning and didn't see my face.

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,120
Where have you been since morning?

32
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,480
 The tenant has a little problem.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,760
 The tenant said there was a problem,

34
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
 is that 18 year old kid?

35
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,760
Yes.

36
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:52,960
What's wrong with it?

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
To be...

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,640
She just broke up with her lover.

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,239
Just broke up with your lover?

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,119
Then he needs me to make him happier?

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,519
Is that your job?

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,160
- Is it your job? - That's not true, mother.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,760
I saw it last night

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,760
she looks so sad.

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
So child

46
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,440
- Stay and comfort her. - Really?

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,120
Is that your problem?

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,359
The thing is

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,080
Does she pay her mother's rent?

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,839
She has some financial problems.

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,920
So ask for debt this month and then pay it when you have money next month.

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Do you also agree?

53
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,640
Right?

54
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:39,759
How can I do business like this?

55
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,560
Impossible.

56
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:44,479
An 18 year old kid is just a scammer.

57
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,199
Okay, let me think about it.

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,799
I called to tell her that

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,680
mother did not accept.

60
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,639
Tell her to pack her things

61
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,639
leave the house immediately.

62
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,359
If you don't do what your mother wants

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,320
I'll send security guards up and chase her away.

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Do you understand?

65
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,800
Wait a minute.

66
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,520
Mr. Wi.

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,495
Thong just finished showering.

68
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,200
So Thong, go get dressed first.

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,520
I wait out here.

70
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,200
It's okay, come in.

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,520
Thong just gets dressed for a bit.

72
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,840
Mr. Wi takes good care of Thong like this

73
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,480
Thong will definitely get fat.

74
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Eat a lot.

75
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
I almost forgot.

76
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm Thong.

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,280
Is this anklet Thong's?

78
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
Mr. Wi.

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,640
Where did Mr. Wi get it?

80
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,159
I once heard Thong tell me about her lover Thong

81
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,719
Take the anklet to pawn, right?

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,879
So I think

83
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,720
Redeem it to create a surprise.

84
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,719
There are very few pawn shops in this area.

85
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,519
So I went to find out

86
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,799
Does anyone have a baby anklet?

87
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,240
Then he found this anklet.

88
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
That's it, right?

89
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Mr. Wi.

90
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,360
Mr. Wi is the best with Thong.

91
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
Thong doesn't know how to thank Mr. Wi.

92
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,840
If given a chance,

93
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,840
Thong will repay Mr. Wi.

94
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,039
Mr. Wi, is there anything wrong?

95
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,560
Why do you look so sad?

96
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,600
Thong...

97
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
From now on

98
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,200
you and me Thong

99
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,200
may not see each other again.

100
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,960
Your mother

101
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Don't let Thong stay in this room anymore.

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,920
Because Thong doesn't have money to pay the rent.

103
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,480
Why did Mr. Wi tell his mother?

104
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,200
his mother asked.

105
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,560
So why don't you say that Thong will pay as usual?

106
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,440
The thing is

107
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:24,151
I don't want to lie to my mother.

108
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,640
Actually, I can't lie to anyone, Thong!

109
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,160
So where does Mr. Wi want Thong?

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm a girl,

111
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,880
I can't go to the temple and sleep with the monk.

112
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,200
You may have to sleep at the bus stop.

113
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
It's okay too.

114
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,160
 Whatever happens, let it happen.

115
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,520
 Em Thong!

116
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,520
 Em Thong!

117
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
 The thing is...

118
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,400
 Is...

119
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,394
 I don't want that either.

120
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,080
 So why Thong

121
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
 won't you go home?

122
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,840
 I no longer have a home.

123
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,120
 My parents are all gone.

124
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,320
 That's why I had to go to Bangkok to make a living.

125
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
 Em Thong!

126
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:19,925
 I'm sorry. Because

127
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,840
 Your mother only thinks about profits.

128
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Besides,

129
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,720
He himself could not disobey his mother.

130
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,120
So like last month's rent,

131
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,680
That's what I answered you.

132
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,240
Does your mother know about it?

133
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,840
Don't know.

134
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,679
Well, I'm the one who makes up for the rest for you.

135
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,279
So let's just use the old way.

136
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,479
Mr. Wi just pays for the room for me.

137
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,760
And say you've already earned the payment.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's all.

139
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,200
- Ms. Ieng! - Yes?

140
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,639
Where did Wi go? Going to the market?

141
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,480
Oh no.

142
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,920
I heard that they will come to the apartment so the tenants can move out.

143
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
This!

144
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,480
Do you find it strange?

145
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,800
I feel the same way.

146
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,800
If I let you guess,

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,799
I think Wi,

148
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,799
I'll definitely go see the girl who rented that room.

149
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,119
Mom, stop looking for a man for Non.

150
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,799
Non has always followed her mother's wishes since childhood.

151
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,679
I've been working and giving money to my mother all this time.

152
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,039
Oh, so you forgot my favor?

153
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Then what?

154
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,999
Are you sleepy, Mr. Wi?

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,760
Do you know how to remember my grace?

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,400
Just a little bit.

157
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,000
Whatever I order you to do, you must do it.

158
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
EH!

159
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
If so, I can sleep.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Mr. Wi, will you stay with me one more night?

161
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,480
- But I'm afraid of my mother, she... - Mom again.

162
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,840
Why do you always use your mother as an excuse for everything?

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,840
How old is Mr. Wi?

164
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,840
25 sir.

165
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,680
Here it is.

166
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,999
Big enough to have a wife and children.

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,359
I only know how to act like a baby and cling to my mother's skirt like that.

168
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
When will you grow up?

169
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
To be...

170
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,960
It's not like I encouraged Mr. Wi to argue with his mother.

171
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,120
Thong only wants Mr. Wi

172
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,759
be yourself.

173
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,360
Do whatever you want.

174
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,080
That's all.

175
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,399
It shows masculinity

176
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,080
mature enough.

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,200
Thong likes.

178
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Very cool.

179
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,640
If so then fine.

180
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,640
I will stay with you Thong one more night.

181
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,920
Mr. Wi.

182
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:01,919
Thong once asked Mr. Wi that

183
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,280
Does Mr. Wi have a lover or not?

184
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,280
Mr. Wi hasn't replied to Thong yet, right?

185
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Not yet.

186
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
No reply yet

187
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
or not yet?

188
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,480
Both.

189
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
To be...

190
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,039
When he was young, he only knew how to study.

191
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,959
Once you graduate, go straight to work.

192
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
So I don't have a chance to meet many people.

193
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,319
I'm about to turn 25.

194
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,319
Life is all about study and work.

195
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,840
Must be very boring, right?

196
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,120
This must also be the path your mother has outlined for you, right?

197
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
YES.

198
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,359
But that's okay.

199
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,959
It's impossible to be sure about your lover.

200
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,120
Maybe one day we'll run into each other.

201
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
Who will be that lucky woman?

202
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Why so?

203
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,005
How lucky?

204
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,000
Mr. Wi.

205
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:54,559
Doesn't Mr. Wi know that he is very cute?

206
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
Is someone who takes good care of others.

207
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,399
All day today.

208
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,160
Thong felt like a princess with a prince coming to take care of her.

209
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,159
This is not even a lover.

210
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
If you're already in love, then to what extent?

211
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Tonight,

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,399
Thong asked for permission to sleep holding Wi's hand one more night.

213
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,399
When holding Mr. Wi's hand

214
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,840
I feel warm and sleep well all night.

215
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
Okay.

216
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,200
I forgot.

217
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,840
If you sit holding hands like this

218
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
then Mr. Wi won't be able to sleep all night.

219
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,040
It's okay, you can sneak in some sleep tomorrow.

220
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
Let's go to sleep together.

221
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,600
No way.

222
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,039
It's OK.

223
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,080
Thong is okay.

224
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,919
Thong wants Mr. Wi to be alert and go to work.

225
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
I don't want your health to be affected.

226
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
Come on up.

227
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,360
But...

228
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:45,953
 Ms. Ieng?

229
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,920
 Yes?

230
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
 Where is Wi?

231
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,520
 Wi didn't come home last night.

232
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
 Na to,

233
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,280
 I think

234
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,000
 What should I do?

235
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:04,602
 Bag.

236
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,800
 Car keys, cards!

237
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
 Here's my bag.

238
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,160
 Car keys, cards.

239
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,120
Mr. Wi,

240
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,879
I didn't sleep all night,

241
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,200
Just keep looking at Thong until morning?

242
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
No,

243
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
I just woke up.

244
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
God!

245
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,000
We just woke up and saw each other's faces.

246
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
Miss you?

247
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
YES.

248
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Mr. Wi!

249
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,479
 You're so decent.

250
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,679
 Lying holding your hand all night,

251
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,000
 without doing anything.

252
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,879
 If it was someone else, it would be fine

253
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
 I don't know how much I've done.

254
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,640
 Mr. Wi is truly a good person.

255
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,000
Mr. Wi,

256
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,360
if you

257
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,760
 Do you want me to take care of you for the rest of my life?

258
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,040
Okay, Thong.

259
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,600
I'm very willing.

260
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,120
I will help you with everything.

261
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,959
From today, if anything happens to you,

262
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,479
Just call me.

263
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,600
I will come find you soon.

264
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,089
Because Thong is my beloved sister.

265
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,560
 I don't want to be a sister,

266
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,880
 I want to be your lover.

267
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
What's wrong with Mr. Wi?

268
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't like it?

269
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Prefer.

270
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,560
Liked it very much.

271
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,200
So why is my whole body so stiff?

272
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:32,387
People having sex with each other just need to be hard in one place and that's enough.

273
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,519
I'm sorry.

274
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
The thing is

275
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,319
you have never been.

276
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
So don't know what to do.

277
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Really

278
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,400
This is Thong's first time.

279
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,160
With my previous lover

280
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,160
We never had anything together.

281
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,360
Even though we're in the same room together

282
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,960
Thong let him sleep on the sofa.

283
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
But

284
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,999
just now

285
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,160
Thong looks very good.

286
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,360
Thong likes to dance, so his emotions flow out.

287
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,090
Mr. Wi, Thong is hungry.

288
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,479
Mr. Wi, go take a shower.

289
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,720
Then we went together to find something to eat.

290
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Okay.

291
00:16:57,523 --> 00:16:58,706
 Uncle.

292
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,000
 You entered the wrong room.

293
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
 How could I enter the wrong room?

294
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,679
 If I enter the wrong room, how can I get a room card?

295
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,760
 I ordered you to pack your things and leave here.

296
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,199
 Haven't you cleaned up yet? I give you time

297
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,519
 an hour, pack up all your stuff and leave.

298
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,480
 Otherwise I'll call security to drag you away.

299
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,759
 Uncle, who are you?

300
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,359
 come here and order this and that?

301
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,039
 The homeowner hasn't said anything yet.

302
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,600
 I'm the homeowner.

303
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,279
 Oh, I'm so dead.

304
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,679
 Are there still such thick-skinned people in this day and age?

305
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,200
 The homeowner is in the bathroom over there.

306
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,279
 Mr. Wi, please stop walking so hard,

307
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,519
 Can you wash your butt and come out here for a bit?

308
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,799
 An old woman from somewhere I don't know came here and said she was the owner of the house.

309
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,279
Is Wi here too?

310
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,960
That's right.

311
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,399
Mr. Wi is my husband and also the homeowner,

312
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,159
I guess this house is also my house.

313
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,320
Thong, Thong.

314
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,519
- Don't talk anymore. - Why don't you let me say it, Mr. Wi?

315
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,039
This guy broke into the house and demanded that Thong go away.

316
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,599
Mr. Wi brought out the red book, hit her in the face and chased her away.

317
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,160
 Thong, this is my mother.

318
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
 Mom?

319
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,200
Hello, Mr. Wi's mother.

320
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,400
 In real life, mom still looks so young and beautiful.

321
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,760
I have something to tell my son.

322
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,160
Go outside and wait.

323
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,480
Yes, please feel free.

324
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,640
Wi, is there anything you want to apologize to mom?

325
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,920
How old is Mr. Wi?

326
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,320
25 years old.

327
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,719
I'm old enough to have a wife and children.

328
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:46,045
If I keep clinging to my mother's skirt like that, when will I grow up?

329
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
No sir.

330
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:54,613
I have nothing to apologize to mom, because I didn't do anything wrong.

331
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:58,008
Is that still not wrong?

332
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,079
Is it okay for you to repay your mother like that?

333
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,960
I wasn't like that before.

334
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:05,599
Ah, it's because of that woman, right?

335
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,999
It's stuffed into your head so you can repay your mother, right?

336
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,600
Mom, I'm grown up, I'm not a kid anymore.

337
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,420
I have my own thoughts, no one puts them in my head.

338
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:19,271
Mom.

339
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,320
I really love Thong.

340
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,440
She is my lover.

341
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,560
Actually, it is correct to call me and her husband and wife now.

342
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,840
I slept with her.

343
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,864
So I want to be responsible for her.

344
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,280
By letting her stay here without paying for a room.

345
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Con.

346
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,399
From birth until now,

347
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,640
I've never had a lover.

348
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,320
Then you know what love is?

349
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:57,469
Please answer me. Then I took this kind of woman home

350
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,799
to be a wife again?

351
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,440
That's because I've never had love even once, mom.

352
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:06,538
So I know the feeling I have for her

353
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,559
It's not the same as the feeling I had before with someone else.

354
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
I'm telling the truth.

355
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,280
Wi, I told you that

356
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,880
This is not love, this is ignorance.

357
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,920
You're infatuated with it, do you understand? It's ignorance.

358
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,400
Mom, please remind me, child

359
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,679
Please get out of this game.

360
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,999
Otherwise, I will be the one who gets hurt.

361
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,640
Mom, can you stop giving me orders?

362
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Whatever your feelings are for her, leave it alone.

363
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:46,144
Let me slowly figure it out, okay? Is that okay, mom?

364
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:48,214
In the end, if someone has to get hurt

365
00:20:48,276 --> 00:20:49,996
then it's me, isn't it?

366
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:53,127
It's me. Why are you interfering?

367
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,120
Why do you interfere?

368
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,160
I think it's your condition

369
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,520
it's already so heavy.

370
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,039
Go, go home and talk.

371
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,120
I won't go.

372
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,400
Mom, if you want to go home, then go home.

373
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,520
I'll take her out to eat and drink, then I'll go home.

374
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:34,585
The water is here.

375
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,359
Has Wi always behaved like that?

376
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,279
You really didn't expect it.

377
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,879
Oh, sister, even I didn't expect it.

378
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,239
He scolded me straight in my face.

379
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,817
It was so ferocious that I couldn't say a word.

380
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:50,599
- Really? - Oh, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

381
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,999
So what are you going to do?

382
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,360
What can I do? I can only stand there stunned.

383
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,880
So what does that girl look like?

384
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,840
A country girl, a cunning girl.

385
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,480
First,

386
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,360
 Thong bowed his head and apologized to his mother.

387
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:10,245
For being disrespectful to my mother.

388
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:15,201
I really didn't know you were Mr. Wi's mother.

389
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,800
No matter who I am

390
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,879
then you shouldn't either

391
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,320
behave so disrespectfully towards adults.

392
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,870
Never mind, I don't care anymore.

393
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
How old are you?

394
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,720
 18 years old, about to turn 19 years old.

395
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:44,414
18, almost 19 years old.

396
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,880
Actually, if a child is raised properly

397
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,790
I'm probably in college now, right?

398
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,280
 Actually

399
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:01,511
 I also want to go to college.

400
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,520
 I have a plan

401
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,720
 means studying pedagogy or studying nursing.

402
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,440
 But unfortunately, before the exam,

403
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,840
 Your father and mother had an accident.

404
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,639
 Both passed away.

405
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,080
All money was stolen.

406
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,560
 I only have a little money left on me.

407
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,480
So I went to Bangkok to look for a job.

408
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,400
Didn't you just break up with your lover?

409
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,559
Breaking up with your lover doesn't take much time

410
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,479
to soothe sadness,

411
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,280
Don't you cry or feel any pain?

412
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:40,516
 Are you in a hurry to have someone new?

413
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,360
 Actually, I'm also very sad, Mom.

414
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,880
 But my ex is not a good person either.

415
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,520
 When I met Mr. Wi,

416
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,760
 he treats me very well.

417
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,199
 So I...

418
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
 Hurry to cling.

419
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
 Mom.

420
00:24:00,762 --> 00:24:04,082
 So I asked Mr. Wi to heal my heart.

421
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720
 Because I'm really depressed, mom.

422
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,640
 If it weren't for Mr. Wi

423
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,920
 I would probably be dead by now.

424
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,320
I'm really asking you.

425
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,360
I love Wi,

426
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,360
love it because it is what it is

427
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,720
or she loves Wi because

428
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,919
he has money to buy food for her to eat,

429
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
Is there a place for her to sleep?

430
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 Mom.

431
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,680
 I really love Mr. Wi because of his kindness.

432
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,360
 I'm just a country boy.

433
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,480
 Mr. Wi still loves and cares for me to this extent,

434
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,920
 so I try to repay him by

435
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,720
 love him a hundred times more.

436
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,119
 Dieu.

437
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,319
That's right.

438
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,359
The first word that comes to my mind is "treasure".

439
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,880
Obviously lying.

440
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,759
We are so old now,

441
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,320
Why don't we know who is telling the truth and who is lying?

442
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,479
Because she is like that

443
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,400
That's why my child is attached to her, sister.

444
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,239
This girl is not ordinary.

445
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,879
Look, I just met Wi not long ago

446
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,599
which made Wi change to this extent.

447
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,519
If Wi moves in together

448
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,720
then we don't know what kind of infection she will inject into Wi's head.

449
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:33,479
Em Na, we can't leave it like that.

450
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,240
We must do something.

451
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,959
- I'm Thong. - Mr. Wi, don't follow anymore.

452
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,680
Thong needs some time alone.

453
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,200
What does Thong need time for?

454
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,320
I don't see anything.

455
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,200
 Your mother looks like she doesn't like Thong.

456
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,838
If she doesn't like it then leave your mother alone.

457
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,160
As long as we don't have anything to do with your mother, it's okay.

458
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:00,041
But Thong had to move and find a new place to live.

459
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,680
 Thong will no longer be able to see Mr. Wi.

460
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,760
 Thong is not acceptable.

461
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,600
 Thong loves Wi very much.

462
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,280
Thong.

463
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,920
Thong doesn't need to worry.

464
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,240
This apartment is exactly what my mother bought.

465
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,120
But the owner's name is your name.

466
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,720
His mother wanted it to be his property.

467
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,080
That's why Thong just stay.

468
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
I allow it.

469
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,280
Thong apologizes for causing him and his mother to quarrel.

470
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,880
No, Thong.

471
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,920
I have to thank you Thong

472
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,360
for giving him the courage to stand up to his mother.

473
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,779
Wi.

474
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,480
Are you back?

475
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,440
Mom has something to say.

476
00:27:03,804 --> 00:27:05,404
But I have nothing more to say.

477
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,997
I've told you everything I wanted to hear.

478
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,560
Mom, from now on, I will go to the apartment to live with Thong.

479
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:19,549
I... I love her.

480
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:25,045
If you love me Thong

481
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,560
You should take her back to live in your house.

482
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
What?

483
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,520
That's right, let her come home to live.

484
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
But...

485
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,120
Come here, my good child.

486
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,280
Mom has been thinking too.

487
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,559
Who do you love?

488
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,160
Mothers should love too, right?

489
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,800
Mom shouldn't stop my love, right?

490
00:28:02,165 --> 00:28:05,685
My good child. It's just like you said

491
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,840
I'm grown up, just for a while.

492
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,879
Is your son an adult now?

493
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,400
A mother's son can choose a life partner

494
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,000
appropriate, then the mother will accept it.

495
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:25,589
So why do you want Thong to come into our house to live with you?

496
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,360
Just think about it,

497
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:32,139
a woman in a rented room

498
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,480
It's dangerous when there's no one around during the day.

499
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,159
Instead of mom having to worry

500
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,680
driving the car back and forth

501
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,479
It's better to let her live in our house

502
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,680
Is it better?

503
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Is it good?

504
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Good.

505
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,079
Mom, are you telling the truth?

506
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Honestly.

507
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,760
Thank you very much mom. Thank you mom.

508
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,959
So let me call and inform Thong first.

509
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
YES.

510
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,840
Hello, are you Thong?

511
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,920
I have good news to tell.

512
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,450
[Market]

513
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,760
Is this Mr. Wi's market?

514
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
It's 10 times bigger than Thong's market.

515
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,760
Next time I will take you for a walk. There's always a lot of food.

516
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,120
Where is Mr. Wi's house?

517
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,160
After this market, enter the alley and you'll be there.

518
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,600
I'm so nervous.

519
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:23,604
THE ROSE OF SIN
