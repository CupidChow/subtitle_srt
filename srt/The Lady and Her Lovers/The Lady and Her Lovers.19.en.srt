00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,400
[The film was created for entertainment purposes.]

00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,520
[Characters, actions, places and events in the film are hypothetical events.]

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,440
[No intention of sexual arousal,]

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,440
[leading or inciting inappropriate or morally corrupt behavior]

THE ROSE OF SIN

8
00:00:52,557 --> 00:00:54,495
THE ROSE OF SIN

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
Episode 19

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,040
Is there anything you need Thong's help with, Inspector?

11
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,620
Mr. Mit.

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,620
Do not have.

13
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,380
Can Thong eat medium-cooked steak like this?

14
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,820
I can eat it. What Mr. Mit feeds

15
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,540
I can eat everything.

16
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,540
But if there is something inedible

17
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,780
Thong will also learn to eat.

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,740
Living so easily, eating so easily like this, it's truly the cutest.

19
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,340
Please sit down.

20
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,340
- Mr. Mit. - Huh?

21
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,860
What happened earlier...

22
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,220
Just now,

23
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,820
I'm serious.

24
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,220
Is it okay for Thong to move to my house today?

25
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,660
What?

26
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,660
At your house?

27
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,260
Today too?

28
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,580
That's right.

29
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,860
But if Thong isn't ready, it's okay.

30
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,780
Ready.

31
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,060
The thing is that Thong is still haunted

32
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,740
with Thong being stuck in prison.

33
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:22,803
If there is someone

34
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:25,483
It would be better to stay next to the heat.

35
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:31,523
There was no one on duty to warm Thong

36
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:33,523
no better than you.

37
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:47,723
Drink for our good love.

38
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:51,843
Drink up.

39
00:02:57,883 --> 00:02:59,123
Oh, Inspector.

40
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:01,443
Is there a swimming pool too?

41
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:04,683
That's great, Thong only swims in the canal.

42
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:07,083
Inspector.

43
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,283
So inspector, let's swim with Thong.

44
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,563
I have to go take care of business first.

45
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:13,283
Is it okay for Thong to be alone?

46
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:14,763
Okay.

47
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:16,483
When you're done, quickly return to Thong.

48
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:17,483
YES.

49
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,483
Except.

50
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:53,563
- Why are you here? - You're right, why are you here?

51
00:03:53,563 --> 00:03:55,323
I've been here a long time.

52
00:03:55,323 --> 00:03:56,363
Lie.

53
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:58,163
How have you been here for so long?

54
00:03:58,163 --> 00:03:59,603
Here in what name?

55
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:02,843
I'm walking up and down the house wearing seductive clothes to this extent,

56
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,363
am I the only child?

57
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:06,803
Of course I'm his wife, but I still asked with a stupid face.

58
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:08,643
Buffalo means buffalo.

59
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:10,163
Are you his wife?

60
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,603
I'm his wife.

61
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:13,323
He just let me be his wife.

62
00:04:13,323 --> 00:04:15,323
But I've been married for a long time.

63
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,723
Do you think he will marry you alone?

64
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:20,243
When you kicked me out of the bar,

65
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,683
He drove me to come live here.

66
00:04:22,683 --> 00:04:25,363
You come later, be reasonable!

67
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:27,963
No, you lied.

68
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:29,803
Why do I lie?

69
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,443
What do I gain by lying?

70
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:34,243
I didn't get any money, why did I lie?

71
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:35,883
Then you want to win against me,

72
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:37,763
People like you always fail before me.

73
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:40,203
You lost to me so you got kicked out of the bar.

74
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:42,203
You want revenge on me.

75
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,283
The game hasn't ended yet, how can you call it a loss?

76
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:48,123
Let's fight again.

77
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:50,963
Yeah, okay, do you think I'm afraid of you?

78
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:52,683
Jump in, I'll deal with it!

79
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,203
Let me deal with you!

80
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:56,683
With Malee!

81
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:02,523
Lie to me!

82
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:04,523
Oh!

83
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:07,323
Except!

84
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:12,883
Except!

85
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:14,803
Get over here, Thong!

86
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:19,363
With Malee!

87
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:21,803
With Malee!

88
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:23,163
- Con Thong! - Oh!

89
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:26,243
Old friends meet again,

90
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:28,443
Looks like a fun joke!

91
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:29,963
Mit!

92
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:32,163
Why is this little girl here?

93
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:34,963
Hey Mit!

94
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:38,483
Why didn't you tell me there was this girl in the house too?

95
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:42,523
Malee was the one who gave me the information about Mr. Bun,

96
00:05:42,803 --> 00:05:44,523
so he kept it a secret.

97
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:46,923
I let Malee come here to stay,

98
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:49,963
he protected her as an informant.

99
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:53,963
If the project has ended

100
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:55,963
Then you can chase her away, right?

101
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:57,203
No way.

102
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:00,563
Because Malee still has a position

103
00:06:00,563 --> 00:06:01,563
is your person too.

104
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:04,123
What does that mean?

105
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:05,523
Your people?

106
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:07,163
Then...

107
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:09,523
Similar to my position now.

108
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:12,803
Mr. Mit.

109
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:15,083
Is that there? Come in now.

110
00:06:17,563 --> 00:06:18,603
What is this?

111
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:20,603
What are you doing here?

112
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,083
Then, when it's a good turn, I'll say it once.

113
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,923
Because Mr. Bun's bar was closed,

114
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:29,123
so I understand that people lost their jobs.

115
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,483
So he asked

116
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:33,483
Does anyone want to be your person?

117
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:36,483
The people who come here are willing people.

118
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,723
You're not forcing anyone, right?

119
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:40,723
- Yes! - Yes!

120
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:43,083
Okay, then

121
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:46,123
I want everyone to live together like sisters.

122
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:48,683
There is no hierarchy, who is greater than whom.

123
00:06:48,963 --> 00:06:51,043
Everyone is equally yours.

124
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:52,563
And also

125
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:54,843
Don't curse and fight.

126
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:56,843
I don't like it.

127
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:00,363
Is that okay, Thong?

128
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:03,003
Malee, I beg you!

129
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:04,203
Do it for me!

130
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:10,883
Oh, okay bro.

131
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:14,003
Malee is my good baby.

132
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:15,443
I will do everything.

133
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:18,043
So cute!

134
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:20,363
What about Thong?

135
00:07:22,803 --> 00:07:23,603
Hey Mit!

136
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:26,963
Can I talk to you in private?

137
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:30,723
If you have anything, just say it.

138
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,963
We have nothing to hide from anyone.

139
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:40,483
But you said you love me.

140
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:43,883
Then I love you.

141
00:07:46,643 --> 00:07:48,403
But he also loves people.

142
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:53,883
If you love me, it should be only you.

143
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:56,963
Why do you share your feelings with these people?

144
00:07:57,963 --> 00:07:59,283
Then your love

145
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,563
There's enough for everyone.

146
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:04,803
Thong, you don't need to feel sorry for yourself.

147
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:06,123
You don't need to be afraid.

148
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:08,123
Don't be afraid that I love you less than anyone else.

149
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:13,563
Come on, Malee, come here quickly.

150
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:15,963
Come here, come here.

151
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,123
Everyone, come here quickly, quickly.

152
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:20,123
Hug, hug!

153
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:22,683
So cute!

154
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:26,563
Okay, welcome to become members

155
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:27,923
of your house.

156
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:30,243
Great!

157
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:33,003
And all of us

158
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:35,963
I love you too, Mit.

159
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:39,603
Oh, so cute, so cute.

160
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,443
All of you are cute.

161
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:32,283
- Mr. Mit. - Huh?

162
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:40,483
Oh, Thong.

163
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:41,523
Where are you going?

164
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:45,003
Come here and play together, hurry up.

165
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,763
Mr. Mit.

166
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:49,843
Play together?

167
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:56,923
I want to continue playing.

168
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:00,483
It's not done yet, I want more.

169
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:55,323
Sorry.

170
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:01,963
Where is the restroom?

171
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:09,723
Thank you.

172
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:27,683
Clink glasses.

173
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,043
Oh, where is Thong?

174
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:36,163
Haven't seen it since.

175
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:39,923
She said she was sleepy so she went to bed first.

176
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:42,723
- Let's continue drinking together. - That's right.

177
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:46,723
- Clink glasses. - Clink glasses.

178
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:06,603
Take it, my handkerchief is clean.

179
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,963
Even though I just came out of the bathroom,

180
00:13:10,963 --> 00:13:12,243
But I've already washed my hands.

181
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:25,043
Wait. Older brother...

182
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:26,923
Take it back.

183
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:28,403
It's okay, just keep it.

184
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:29,963
I also don't use it often.

185
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:32,603
Normally I wipe everything with my sleeve.

186
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:22,163
Mom.

187
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:24,843
What's there to eat today?

188
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,283
Are you awake?

189
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:29,403
Today my mother bought noodles to cook minced meat noodles.

190
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:30,843
Go downstairs to eat.

191
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:31,963
Yes, let me go down.

192
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:33,963
Upstream.

193
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:36,283
Where is my handkerchief?

194
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,283
Mom looked to wash it but couldn't find it.

195
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:44,323
It's not lost, Mom.

196
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:46,643
I gave it to a girl to wipe her tears.

197
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:47,763
Huh?

198
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,603
Which girl? Are you hurting people again?

199
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:54,443
Mom already said it. If you have a girlfriend, why don't you tell your mother?

200
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:57,203
Mom, mom, calm down, speak slowly.

201
00:14:57,203 --> 00:15:00,483
Mom taught me to be calm, but she's always in such a hurry.

202
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:03,603
But love story

203
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,603
It's not a small thing, kid.

204
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:08,123
Tell mom who that person is.

205
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:10,123
Tell me quickly.

206
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,963
Mont goes to a guest's house to play music.

207
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:16,283
Everyone playing looked very happy.

208
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:19,363
But there was a girl sitting who seemed very lonely.

209
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,363
Then suddenly she cried.

210
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:23,683
So Mont gave her the handkerchief.

211
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:27,683
And this girl

212
00:15:27,683 --> 00:15:29,683
get to know the homeowner.

213
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,683
Are they friends or relatives?

214
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,683
Or descendants?

215
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:39,363
The landlord is Inspector Mit, Mom.

216
00:15:40,283 --> 00:15:42,843
Famous drug busting police.

217
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,083
His house

218
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,323
there are a lot of girls.

219
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:48,803
This person is also one of them.

220
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:53,323
But Mont didn't know what was wrong with her and sat alone crying.

221
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,923
What a pity.

222
00:15:58,363 --> 00:16:00,803
Women have to do jobs like this.

223
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:03,163
Probably creates a lot of karma.

224
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:06,163
Mont, don't interfere too much.

225
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:08,443
Mom, she's the inspector's person.

226
00:16:08,443 --> 00:16:11,003
If you interfere, you won't be able to leave that house.

227
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:13,723
Mont just saw that she was sad,

228
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,123
If you pass by, you will feel it

229
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:18,123
a bit cruel.

230
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:20,843
So I gave her a handkerchief to comfort her.

231
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:22,843
Let her know that this world

232
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:24,843
Not everything is so cruel.

233
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:27,203
Your child is so kind.

234
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,203
But it's good.

235
00:16:29,203 --> 00:16:32,403
Helping her a little is considered a blessing.

236
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:34,403
But it's a blessing

237
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:37,323
Okay then, don't interfere with her anymore.

238
00:16:39,003 --> 00:16:42,283
Go wash your face, brush your teeth,

239
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:44,283
Come down to eat.

240
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,723
Finally, are you eating rice or noodles today?

241
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:48,723
Mont.

242
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:51,323
Go, go quickly.

243
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:53,643
- Come down. - Yes.

244
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,923
Come in.

245
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:00,043
Thong.

246
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,523
Wasn't it fun last night?

247
00:18:07,443 --> 00:18:08,843
Seeing a sad face.

248
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,923
Maybe Thong will be happier

249
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:13,923
If it's just the two of us.

250
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:18,363
Mr. Mit, Thong doesn't want to live here anymore.

251
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:20,603
Thong wants to live in an apartment with Ms. Si.

252
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:27,843
Mit, did you hear what Thong said?

253
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:30,643
I heard it.

254
00:18:32,203 --> 00:18:33,643
But he didn't allow it.

255
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:37,163
Thong is your man.

256
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,803
Thong must always be like that.

257
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,963
The name Thongprakai was given by him.

258
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:44,163
I absolutely will not lose Thong.

259
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:46,163
Thong also don't forget

260
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:48,523
Thong volunteered to stay at his house.

261
00:18:49,643 --> 00:18:50,523
So at first,

262
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,963
I think you will only have me, love only me.

263
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:55,963
But not like that kind of sharing with others.

264
00:18:57,123 --> 00:19:00,003
Why don't you feel the same when you're with Bun?

265
00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:03,403
Why should there be a problem with that when you're with me?

266
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,403
So it's not the same.

267
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:07,403
I don't love you Bun.

268
00:19:07,403 --> 00:19:08,483
But I love you.

269
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,763
I don't want you to have someone else,

270
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:12,163
I want only you and only me.

271
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,003
Even though you have many people,

272
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:17,003
But I love you the most.

273
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,323
You are my only heroine.

274
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:22,763
Others are just reserves.

275
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,963
If so, then I want another man

276
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:28,963
Can I be a reserve?

277
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,083
See?

278
00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:38,003
I also don't want you to have someone else,

279
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:40,003
I want you to have only me.

280
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:42,883
Why don't you think about me?

281
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:45,123
Are our hearts different?

282
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:47,763
How can they be compared, Thong?

283
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:49,763
Come here.

284
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:54,323
Men's love

285
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:57,003
it is much larger than a woman's.

286
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:01,643
Please trust me.

287
00:20:02,043 --> 00:20:04,483
No one loves Thong more than you.

288
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:07,563
Don't leave me anywhere, okay?

289
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:10,123
Stay with me?

290
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:22,803
I'll go first.

291
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:05,563
Are you going to escape?

292
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:14,043
How does this door open?

293
00:21:14,043 --> 00:21:16,403
It can only be opened with Mit's phone.

294
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:19,923
Mean

295
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:21,923
will he lock us at home?

296
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:25,163
Oh, don't call it locked up, that sounds so perverted.

297
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:27,163
I don't feel that way.

298
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:28,323
I don't have a problem.

299
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:30,163
I'm happy being here.

300
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,323
But if you're not happy, my condolences, Thong.

301
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:35,323
You walked in here voluntarily.

302
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:38,003
It's probably too late to regret it now.

303
00:21:58,003 --> 00:22:00,323
Oh, do it, good man.

304
00:22:00,323 --> 00:22:02,923
If you want to go, go ahead.

305
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:04,923
Come here quickly, guys.

306
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:08,443
Look at Thong running away from home, hurry up, hurry up.

307
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:13,403
Try your best!

308
00:22:14,763 --> 00:22:16,963
Try your best, climb up.

309
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:36,723
Great!

310
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:39,603
Thong is gone.

311
00:22:39,603 --> 00:22:42,203
- Thong is gone. - Thong is gone.

312
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:43,563
It's good to go.

313
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:44,243
That's right.

314
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,243
But I'll tell you all

315
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:47,923
is no more than 10 minutes

316
00:22:47,923 --> 00:22:50,403
it will come back here.

317
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,443
Oh my God.

318
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:25,363
Thong.

319
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:30,163
Don't go out and do random things anymore.

320
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:31,643
I'm worried.

321
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:34,083
Let's go home.

322
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,643
That's not the house that Thong wants to live in.

323
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,883
Your wife lives like this in the house,

324
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,323
How can Thong live?

325
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:44,403
Thong to,

326
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,403
But he truly loves Thong.

327
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,403
I can't be without Thong.

328
00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:52,003
Don't be stubborn with me anymore.

329
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:54,403
Hey!

330
00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:58,403
Let's go home.

331
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,163
Five, six, seven, eight. Continue. One, two, three, four.

332
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:13,203
Five, six, seven, eight. One, two.

333
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,283
Hey you.

334
00:24:14,563 --> 00:24:16,723
Mit likes this look.

335
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:20,683
Hey everyone.

336
00:24:28,683 --> 00:24:29,683
At this house

337
00:24:30,763 --> 00:24:32,043
There are security cameras in every corner,

338
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,483
I saw it all on the phone.

339
00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:36,563
And just now I saw it

340
00:24:37,123 --> 00:24:39,443
that everyone encouraged Thong to leave home.

341
00:24:40,763 --> 00:24:41,963
What did you say?

342
00:24:43,763 --> 00:24:45,443
I said everyone should take care of each other.

343
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,483
Don't let something like that happen again.

344
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:50,323
So if she wants to go

345
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,683
So why stop it?

346
00:24:51,963 --> 00:24:53,243
It's good that she's gone.

347
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,763
Let her stay,

348
00:24:54,763 --> 00:24:57,003
everyone must see her sullen face,

349
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:58,243
I'm so disappointed.

350
00:24:58,243 --> 00:24:59,723
Malee, don't say that again.

351
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:02,963
Everyone is yours.

352
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:06,323
I won't lose anyone.

353
00:25:12,723 --> 00:25:13,443
Thong.

354
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:15,843
Does Thong love you?

355
00:25:19,203 --> 00:25:19,563
Yes.

356
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:25,763
If Thong loves you

357
00:25:27,203 --> 00:25:28,243
Then don't hide from me anymore.

358
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:29,923
Is that Okay?

359
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:35,803
Well done, good girl.

360
00:25:43,163 --> 00:25:45,163
Okay, so let's go to work.

361
00:25:45,563 --> 00:25:47,683
Hope everyone stays together in harmony.

362
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:49,323
Is it okay for you?

363
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,843
- Okay. - Okay.

364
00:25:52,443 --> 00:25:53,523
I love you all equally.

365
00:26:12,723 --> 00:26:14,403
You said to run away, Thong.

366
00:26:14,403 --> 00:26:15,643
Why come back here?

367
00:26:18,163 --> 00:26:19,323
I love him.

368
00:26:20,323 --> 00:26:21,443
If it weren't for you guys

369
00:26:21,603 --> 00:26:23,203
My love life is better now.

370
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:32,163
Oh my god, hey. He only loves you, right?

371
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:33,843
He loves everyone.

372
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,163
- That's right. - That's right.

373
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:38,563
So I ask you.

374
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:40,123
Mr. Mit

375
00:26:40,563 --> 00:26:42,123
Been like that for a long time?

376
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:46,523
Since I moved into this house

377
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:48,483
then I understand him better.

378
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:50,963
Mit's life doesn't have much at all.

379
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,563
he was just looking for a way to win against his brother.

380
00:26:53,803 --> 00:26:55,043
He has been unhappy since childhood.

381
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:56,483
Painting each other's toys,

382
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:58,243
Mit always loses to Bun.

383
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,763
And the new mission failed to capture Mr. Bun

384
00:27:00,763 --> 00:27:02,403
hurt him a lot,

385
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:04,003
so he vented his anger on all of us.

386
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:06,403
Can't catch Mr. Bun

387
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:08,083
What does that have to do with us?

388
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:12,203
The fact that he took all of us as his property

389
00:27:12,203 --> 00:27:14,363
It's like he successfully stole Mr. Bun's toy.

390
00:27:14,363 --> 00:27:15,403
This story

391
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:16,443
maybe the only thing

392
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:18,123
Mr. Mit thought he had won against Mr. Bun.

393
00:27:18,963 --> 00:27:20,563
That is also the reason

394
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:23,563
why he refuses to lose any of us.

395
00:27:24,683 --> 00:27:26,443
He only sees us as objects

396
00:27:26,723 --> 00:27:29,123
Then take over and think you won against Mr. Bun?

397
00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:31,763
Don't you guys feel disgusted with yourselves?

398
00:27:34,563 --> 00:27:36,803
Anyone else feel disgusted with themselves?

399
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:39,363
How are you? No.

400
00:27:39,883 --> 00:27:41,123
Neither do I.

401
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:43,843
Here you can eat delicious food and stay comfortably.

402
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:45,083
I like it.

403
00:27:45,683 --> 00:27:46,723
Neither do I.

404
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:48,003
Mit is also handsome.

405
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:49,083
I like it.

406
00:27:49,683 --> 00:27:50,723
- That's right. - That's right.

407
00:27:51,443 --> 00:27:53,763
Oh, Thong. Why do you think so much?

408
00:27:53,763 --> 00:27:55,683
Whatever he sees us as, let it be.

409
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:57,003
I don't see anything important.

410
00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:58,163
One thing is clear,

411
00:27:58,163 --> 00:27:59,883
that we live in a luxurious house,

412
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:01,123
have money to spend.

413
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:03,443
Every day there is no need to work.

414
00:28:03,443 --> 00:28:06,403
Sit around, sleep, then party.

415
00:28:06,403 --> 00:28:08,683
Life is better than living with the boss.

416
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,523
Why don't you live comfortably like this?

417
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:13,363
Just let him see what you are.

418
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:14,643
As a dog,

419
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:18,283
I don't care whether it's a cat, a table or a chair.

420
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,283
Let's go, everyone, let's go swimming.

421
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:22,483
Let's go.

422
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:25,043
Let's go, quickly.

423
00:28:25,243 --> 00:28:26,003
I just bought a new bikini.

424
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:26,883
Let me take a photo first.

425
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:30,403
When you're done, let's exchange it with each other.

426
00:28:35,483 --> 00:28:36,483
Hey, Malee.

427
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,683
You said that to Thong

428
00:28:39,003 --> 00:28:41,563
It's like you want it to continue to stay here.

429
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:42,483
That's right.

430
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:44,003
I want it to continue to stay here.

431
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:44,723
Oh.

432
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,683
I don't like it at all.

433
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,283
But I want it to stay here

434
00:28:48,283 --> 00:28:49,923
It's for revenge.

435
00:28:50,243 --> 00:28:52,483
Take revenge on him for what caused me to be beaten by the boss

436
00:28:52,483 --> 00:28:53,923
and was thrown out of the bar.

437
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:55,283
I still hold a lot of regret.

438
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:57,923
Leave it here unhappily

439
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,203
will make me very happy.

440
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,363
Yeah, good plan.

441
00:29:04,123 --> 00:29:05,643
Hey, Malee.

442
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:07,963
I have something to tell you.

443
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:10,483
If Mr. Mit knew about this

444
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:11,763
then Thong

445
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:14,283
will definitely be beaten to a pulp.

446
00:29:14,283 --> 00:29:15,323
What's going on? Tell me quickly.

447
00:29:15,683 --> 00:29:16,763
So the story is like this.

448
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,163
that day,

449
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:21,101
At the bar, I saw him with the boss...

450
00:29:53,094 --> 00:29:58,602
THE ROSE OF SIN
