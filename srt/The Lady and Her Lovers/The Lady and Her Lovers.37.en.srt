1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,347
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:39,435
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,400
Finally met each other

4
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,960
It was quite a while after you asked someone to contact me.

5
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,920
Then suddenly an elder contacted me,

6
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,520
Thong must think carefully.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,360
Thong is not someone who is easily comfortable with others.

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,840
This is called prudence, not price manipulation.

9
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,440
But after finding out information about him, it's clear

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,360
Only then will we know that he is someone who can be trusted.

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,880
What's important is that you're handsome.

12
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,680
How can he be as handsome as the young male leads?

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,480
If you really like handsome people

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,480
Then maybe I won't come find you.

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,160
He is not only beautiful on his face

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,400
but your status makes you handsome

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,000
Take all the male leads of the entertainment industry combined

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,480
Can't fight you either.

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,160
How old are you this year?

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,640
28 years old.

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,240
So what is the future direction like?

22
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,160
I don't know anymore.

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,600
Thong never thought about that.

24
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,560
Just thinking about what to do to live is tiring enough.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,920
Let's play chess with me a little. Do you know how to play?

26
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,000
Thong doesn't know how to play chess, he only knows how to pick up rubber bands.

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Come on, let me teach you. This chess game,

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,600
We will have 16 pieces on each side.

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,000
I can't go like this.

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,840
The way to play is to move the king up like this

31
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,480
and must lead with this piece first.

32
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,280
Thong will go like that. Thong's own style.

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,400
No, that's its law.

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,960
Otherwise, I have to move this piece forward like this

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,760
that's correct.

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,320
Ben, come in here first.

37
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,240
Ben!

38
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,000
Ben!

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,240
It's rude, that's the truth.

40
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,360
I apologize for my son.

41
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,880
Young people today are like that.

42
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,360
Just like to find things to oppose my father.

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,920
Thong understands, Thong was like that before.

44
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,360
Let it go, let's continue talking about earlier.

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,040
As you can see, with my acting ability,

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
I'm someone who doesn't often have any plans

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,120
for a long time, right?

48
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,960
Like to live in the present and face problems right then and there.

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,240
And the one who decides decisively

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,160
without hesitation, did you guess right?

51
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,400
That's probably right.

52
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,360
Then what? Is it good or not?

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,720
Deciding decisively without hesitation

54
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,440
also has a good side.

55
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,680
But doing something spontaneously without prior planning

56
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,720
it's quite risky.

57
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,560
And the error rate also increases.

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,360
Your opinion is also correct.

59
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,960
But Thong is that kind of person.

60
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,920
Life is what it is today thanks to those characteristics.

61
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,080
Don't know if it's good or not. But for sure

62
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,960
Thong is still alive to sit here and talk to you like today.

63
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm really honest.

64
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,160
Just keep it like that.

65
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Oh.

66
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,640
Uncle Ben!

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,880
Yes, uncle!

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,440
Are you hungry?

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,480
The chef has made a lamb dish, let me bring it to you.

70
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,120
Yes, thank you.

71
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
So wait a minute.

72
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,360
Wait a minute, uncle.

73
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,400
Why is there lamb today? What kind of celebration party are you holding?

74
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,600
There is no celebration.

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,400
The boss told me to make it to entertain guests.

76
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,040
Miss Thongprakai is a star, have you ever met Mr. Ben?

77
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,200
It looks beautiful on TV.

78
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
It's even more beautiful than on TV.

79
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,960
No wonder the face looks familiar.

80
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,800
So do you know what she came here for?

81
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,840
So there's no need to bring up the lamb,

82
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,040
Let me go down and eat myself.

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,040
Yes.

84
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
Is that lamb meat edible?

85
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,200
If you can't eat it, let me ask the chef to make another dish for you.

86
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,080
Thong doesn't have that many problems, Thong can eat anything.

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,120
But if Thong is not used to eating it, you will have to fertilize it.

88
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,280
So then?

89
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,720
Okay, come on.

90
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,280
Uncle Sai! Give me two more bowls.

91
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,360
Mine and mom's.

92
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Okay.

93
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,400
Ben, take mom somewhere else to eat.

94
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,880
Here is the dining room,

95
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,240
If you don't eat here, where do you want me to eat?

96
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,400
Besides, there's also delicious food today.

97
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,080
Don't you think you'll invite your wife and children to eat with you?

98
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
You also see that I have guests.

99
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,000
But just now dad called me

100
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,480
And I want you to get to know the guests, right?

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,200
So I brought my mother down with me, so everyone could get to know each other.

102
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,800
Your name is Thong, right?

103
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,600
Is that star involved in a lot of scandals?

104
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,240
I'm Ben, my father's son.

105
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,520
And this is my mother, my father's wife.

106
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,960
Hello sister.

107
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,920
So how do you know my father?

108
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,080
Are you two friends? Or what?

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,400
I am his guest.

110
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,200
The guest he invited came to dine with him.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,720
Ben,

112
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,760
From now on we must have meals with dad

113
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,400
It's always crowded like this.

114
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,320
So that your dad doesn't feel lonely

115
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,720
to the point of having to hire a girl to have meals with him.

116
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,920
Nong, if you talk to me like that

117
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,560
Then I think you should go out.

118
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,200
One sentence will chase you away, two sentences will also chase you away. I know

119
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,360
What do you and this actress have to each other?

120
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,680
What if you know?

121
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,840
What if Thong and I are each other?

122
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,240
Hey dad.

123
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,320
Ben, let's go.

124
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,120
Actually, mom doesn't want to sit at the same table either

125
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,520
Where are you with your father?

126
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,440
Mom just wanted to come see the stranger entering our house,

127
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,840
Look what his face looks like,

128
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,680
whether you are shy or not.

129
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,400
Let's go.

130
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,520
Yes, mother.

131
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,000
I apologize on behalf of her and her mother.

132
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,360
I don't pay attention to them.

133
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,720
Yes.

134
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,280
Sir, just now you mentioned the relationship between the two of us.

135
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,440
That's right.

136
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,560
Whatever relationship the two of us have is our business.

137
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,120
No need to care or fear anyone.

138
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,680
But your wife...

139
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,920
Actually, before Thong came here,

140
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,880
Thong tried to find information about his family online

141
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,440
but there is no information at all.

142
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,400
Most recently, 10 years ago there were rumors that

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,440
You and your wife are having trouble.

144
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,120
And then there was no more news.

145
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,280
Thong thought he was divorced.

146
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,080
Even though I'm not divorced yet, it's like being divorced.

147
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,920
Even though he and she live in the same house

148
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,120
But it doesn't feel like husband and wife.

149
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,640
Honestly,

150
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
he never loved her.

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,520
You and her are like

152
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,040
married in name only.

153
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,840
They had children together and lived together for decades

154
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
But have you never been in love?

155
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,240
Not even a little bit.

156
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,160
I haven't been with you for a few hours,

157
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,880
but he still has feelings for me

158
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,480
than living with her all my life.

159
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,560
So what about the lady?

160
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,720
She's probably just like you.

161
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,720
Let's not talk about this anymore.

162
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,560
It's better to eat it, otherwise it will all get cold now.

163
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,840
Yes.

164
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,080
So delicious.

165
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,080
Want to eat every day.

166
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,560
Can Thong bring the chef home?

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
Impossible.

168
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,480
If you want to eat, you have to come here to eat.

169
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,920
Mom, don't worry about her.

170
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,840
Dad just hired these actors to have fun.

171
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,040
Come a few times and you'll get bored.

172
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,200
But if she comes too much

173
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,080
then Ben will spray water to chase her away.

174
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,720
Sprayed her makeup off.

175
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,960
When I see her bare face, I won't like it anymore.

176
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,000
Is that okay, mom?

177
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,680
Things like this don't bother me at all.

178
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,560
I have met countless people.

179
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,440
Ben, don't worry about mom.

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,560
Yes.

181
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,480
This is the last one, you have to catch it.

182
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,040
That's enough, what should you do if you choke?

183
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,560
If you choke, Thong will help you get it out.

184
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,160
He opened his mouth and left.

185
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,400
Last fruit.

186
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,280
One, two, three.

187
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,800
So good.

188
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,400
It's time for Thong to go home, right?

189
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Actually, I still don't want to let you go.

190
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,040
But he has something to tell his son.

191
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,400
It's OK.

192
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,200
Talk to your child properly, don't scold him.

193
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,160
If your child is scolded

194
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,840
Then I'll blame Thong.

195
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,040
Hate Thong even more.

196
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,520
YES.

197
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,160
Thanks for today.

198
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,600
Thong also thanked him.

199
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,000
Hopefully Thong will have the opportunity to come back here to eat

200
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,160
Your chef's food.

201
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,320
The food here is very delicious.

202
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,680
The most delicious Thong has ever eaten.

203
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,840
Okay.

204
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
If the chef resigns

205
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,120
I won't give it to you, I'll keep it.

206
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,960
Stay behind to cook delicious food for me to eat alone.

207
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Thank you.

208
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,960
YES.

209
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,280
Mr. Lom.

210
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,400
Yes, Uncle Ben.

211
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,680
What is this woman? How much do you care about her?

212
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,200
I don't know either, he and Ms. Thong just met for the first time.

213
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,000
Mr. Ben, don't rush to think too far.

214
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,080
Maybe he just wanted to invite Ms. Thong to dinner.

215
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,600
So do you think dad is really serious about her?

216
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Actually I don't know.

217
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,680
Please answer, I know you can guess it.

218
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,360
Dad asked you to contact her, right?

219
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,200
How does dad look? How much does he care for her?

220
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,600
Compared to previous people,

221
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,400
Looks like he cares about Ms. Thong more than anyone else.

222
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,480
Yes, sir. Okay.

223
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,240
I beg your pardon.

224
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,560
Thank you.

225
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,560
If only I knew you were such a lovely person

226
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,000
I have agreed with Mr. Lom since that day.

227
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,240
It took several months, for unknown reasons.

228
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,520
It's true that I'm so angry at myself.

229
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,200
Human life is very short.

230
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,360
From now on, we shouldn't

231
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,680
Why waste time anymore?

232
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,400
Do you think so?

233
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,040
Yes. If later

234
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,920
What do you want or what do you want me to do for you?

235
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,400
then just say it!

236
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,760
I am willing to do anything for you.

237
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,080
Lom, take Thong back to the apartment.

238
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,120
Yes, sir.

239
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,200
I'll come back!

240
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,840
YES.

241
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,360
Please.

242
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
What's wrong, Miss Thong?

243
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,560
I asked.

244
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,080
What does he think about me?

245
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,880
He's so serious,

246
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,600
Or is it just a temporary passing game?

247
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,280
Why does everyone ask me that?

248
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,360
Just now, Uncle Ben asked me the same thing.

249
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,000
Well, you're someone close to him, so you'd know.

250
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
Why don't you ask him?

251
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Ask me, how can I answer for him?

252
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,720
What about you? What do you think about him?

253
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,680
Seriously, I'm really serious.

254
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,120
He is a cute, kind person.

255
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,800
Old people, nearby

256
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,960
feels very comfortable and warm.

257
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,320
Daddy is so damn sexy!

258
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,120
Actually, I'm also 30, almost 40.

259
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,320
From what you said, it seems like he likes you.

260
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,120
What's wrong? What are your next steps?

261
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,600
What can be done? Just have to wait for his response.

262
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,280
I also talked about him to his juniors,

263
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,840
that I really like him, want to be serious with him.

264
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,960
Let him tell him.

265
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,400
If only he knew her heart like that

266
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,000
It's easy to make a decision.

267
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,680
But the difficulty is that it's his wife and children.

268
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,320
Yes, I forgot that he still has a wife and children.

269
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,040
Have you met them yet?

270
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,720
See you.

271
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,600
Looks like they broke up.

272
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,400
The wife is sick, in a wheelchair, and can't do much.

273
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,560
At most, I can endure being scolded every day.

274
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,080
As for the child, it seems he has a lot of rights.

275
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,040
Ben, I have something to tell you.

276
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,440
I don't have time, I'm playing games.

277
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,000
I've been so cheeky lately.

278
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,160
Just now you were very rude to my guest.

279
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,840
Did you know?

280
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,280
Just an entertainer,

281
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,360
What is the need to be polite?

282
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,059
Thong is not an entertainer.

283
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,000
And no matter who it is with,

284
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,720
You must also respect your opponent.

285
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,080
You talk like you're a proper gentleman.

286
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,720
Every time Dad brings another woman home,

287
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,680
Have you ever respected your mother as your wife?

288
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,160
You also know that mom and dad are no longer related.

289
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,520
How can it not be related?

290
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Living in the same house, marriage certificate still exists.

291
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,280
But in reality, there is no longer any relationship.

292
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,440
Surely your mother has told you this story before?

293
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,600
That's why your father and mother have to get married to each other.

294
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,600
Just for political purposes.

295
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I don't care.

296
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,480
Now, aren't Mom and Dad still legally married?

297
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,680
My mother's condition now

298
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,720
But do you still want to be called wife?

299
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,920
Why are you looking at me like that?

300
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,600
Or am I saying something wrong?

301
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,040
Do you love me?

302
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,240
Did you ever love me?

303
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,120
Are not. You have no right to blame me at all.

304
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,640
And there's no right to be jealous.

305
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,000
She cannot fulfill her duties as a wife

306
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Then let someone else do it for you.

307
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,600
Dad.

308
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,960
Dad.

309
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,000
- Dad. - Ben, Ben. No need.

310
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Mom. Why would mom let dad talk to her like that?

311
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,800
Mom, aren't you going to object?

312
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,280
What does Ben think his mother should say to that kind of person?

313
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,280
Mom scolded him, she argued with him and it was tiring enough.

314
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,080
What else can mom do? Ben just ignore him.

315
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,000
Mom accepts it. But Ben did not accept.

316
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,640
Ben will definitely not let his father treat his mother like that.

317
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,960
Come in.

318
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,880
Please allow me.

319
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,680
I'm back.

320
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,280
- What did she say? - Miss Thong said she likes you.

321
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,480
If you are going to suggest anything to Ms. Thong, I don't think she will refuse.

322
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,880
So what kind of relationship do you plan to have with her?

323
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,960
Is it serious or temporary?

324
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,080
Check my schedule,

325
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,840
Let's see what I need to do tomorrow.

326
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,440
Tomorrow you have a parliamentary meeting,

327
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,080
but there is no problem regarding you.

328
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,240
And you don't have to go anywhere anymore.

329
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,160
If so then...

330
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,560
Call the pub I usually drink at and book it all for me.

331
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,440
And let's meet Thong.

332
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,160
Yes, sir.

333
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,200
Thank.

334
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,280
Hello sir.

335
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,280
Hello.

336
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,600
What do you want to drink?

337
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,640
Please choose Thong.

338
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,560
Which type do you think suits Thong best?

339
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,080
Take this glass.

340
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,000
Okay.

341
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,760
I miss you so much, not seeing each other for a whole day.

342
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,680
What about you? Do you remember Thong?

343
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,800
If you don't remember, will you ask me out to meet you?

344
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,680
I asked you out so we could talk more conveniently.

345
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,960
I have something important to tell you.

346
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,600
How important is it?

347
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,560
To the point where it's impossible for people at home to know,

348
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,120
must meet each other outside.

349
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,800
This is so important.

350
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,160
Marry me.

351
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,840
But we've only been talking for a day.

352
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,160
Today is only day two.

353
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,160
Isn't that too fast?

354
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,720
So our meeting

355
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,200
Is there anything you don't like about me?

356
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,120
Or do you have any problems?

357
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,840
No sir.

358
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,840
I don't have it either. So what are you waiting for?

359
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,560
Why wait for time to pass?

360
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,880
How soon should we get married?

361
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,080
That's how quickly you will find happiness.

362
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,240
He said Thong is someone who doesn't plan anything.

363
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,600
only decide the immediate problem, but why this matter?

364
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,280
Are you faster than Thong?

365
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,880
Who says you don't have a plan? It's more like you've thought it through carefully.

366
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,120
I know how happy I will be

367
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,840
when I live with you.

368
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,920
Believe me, if you live with me

369
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,640
This will be the last home of my life.

370
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,320
I don't need to pack up and move anywhere anymore.

371
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,840
If you give Thong this kind of trust

372
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,640
Thong agrees.

373
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,200
Thong will marry you.

374
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,880
But Thong doesn't want to be anyone's concubine.

375
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,200
Thong needs to be his only wife.

376
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,240
Thong, can I trouble you to handle the lady's matter properly first?

377
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,200
[Divorce application]

378
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,640
Please sign quickly.

379
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,520
By the time we get divorced today, I think it's several years too late.

380
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,360
You see me in this state

381
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,400
So you can easily tie my hands, right?

382
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,640
After filling out the paperwork, I put the pen in my hand.

383
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,040
Why don't you just sign for me and get it over with?

384
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,120
Actually, I can do that.

385
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,840
But I respect you so I let you sign it yourself.

386
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,800
Thank you for respecting me.

387
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,880
But I don't feel respected at all.

388
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,880
What if I don't sign?

389
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,680
Let me inform you about the law.

390
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,840
Civil Law, article 1516 (10):

391
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,240
If the husband or wife is physically incapacitated,

392
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,440
for husband or wife

393
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,360
forever unable to have intercourse

394
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,840
You can get a unilateral divorce.

395
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,680
For example, loss of sexual function,

396
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,640
The lower half of the body is paralyzed.

397
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,800
I think mom should sign it.

398
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,920
I think if mom divorces dad, her life will be better.

399
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:15,453
