1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,340
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:39,397
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
Ms. Dao.

4
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,400
Ms. Dao, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,760
Please, please listen to me.

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
To be...

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,320
This time it was really because I was too drunk.

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,880
So I accidentally did that.

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,360
Besides, Chris is like my younger brother.

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,880
He and I were just having fun like normal men.

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,720
Enough.

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,560
I won't hear anything from you again.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,320
And I have nothing more to say.

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,600
Except for the sentence "You and I here are enough".

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,600
Go away.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,480
- Ms. Dao. - I said go.

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
That's OK.

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,680
I hope that one day Ms. Dao will forgive me.

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,680
Wait.

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,000
House keys and car keys

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,160
leave it all here.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,880
Do you really have to go to this extent?

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,400
So...

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,760
Alright.

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,240
Not yet.

26
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,240
Not done yet.

27
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,760
The clothes you're wearing

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,200
You also have to take it off and pay it all.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,480
Oh, oh.

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,320
- Even the clothes? - Ms. Dao.

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,400
Are you joking?

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Does my expression look like I'm joking right now?

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,480
What is my money?

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
Then we have to leave it all here.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,840
Ms. Dao, stop behaving like a child.

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040
Can there be some reason?

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
I don't want to use excuses.

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,440
From now on, I will use emotions.

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Makes your heart feel satisfied.

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Take it all off.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,200
Take it off now.

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,240
Oh, I'm so happy.

43
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,320
It's over, it's over.

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,320
Take that off too.

45
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,080
Naked already.

46
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,360
Dead.

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,360
Briefs

48
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,640
I bought it myself.

49
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
So we end up here.

50
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,680
Don't let me see your face anymore.

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Variable.

52
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,320
What the hell are you barking at, Diamond?

53
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,320
Demon dog.

54
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,680
Dad gives me an order

55
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,000
don't cry.

56
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,040
Tell me about it,

57
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Did any rich guy come to flirt with you last night?

58
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,920
Have.

59
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,360
Who is that?

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,920
Handsome? Are you rich? How is his face?

61
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,440
Mr. Prajak.

62
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,840
Be the minister of something.

63
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,840
- Did you know? - Know.

64
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,080
Sir Prajak flirted with you?

65
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Funny, he has a wife and children.

66
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
Really?

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Luckily I didn't follow suit.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,400
He told his juniors to come and want to contact me

69
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,360
but I refused.

70
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,760
Okay, sometimes high-ranking people with big positions are scary.

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,600
Do you understand? If there is anything he is not satisfied

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Then you will turn to dust.

73
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,960
She looked at boss Bun.

74
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Shoot to kill.

75
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,360
And Mr. Prajak

76
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,680
ten times bigger than boss Bun.

77
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,920
Then think to yourself.

78
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,800
It's not that bad, sister.

79
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
He seems like a good person.

80
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,920
People have power in their hands

81
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,520
You can use it anytime you want.

82
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,880
If I could decide someone's life or death

83
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,920
the more fun it is.

84
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,480
I want to have power like other people.

85
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,520
Oh.

86
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,640
- Hey, sister. - Tell me.

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,640
- Party last night. - How?

88
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,240
Ms. Dao got mad.

89
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,680
Captured Dam

90
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,320
married with the name Chris.

91
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
- My Chris? - YES.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,480
Was Dam eaten?

93
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,640
That's right.

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,280
Whoever it is, it's shocking, sister.

95
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,520
It was like a drop of water for Ms. Dao.

96
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,160
Ms. Dao ordered Dam

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,840
Take off all the clothes that Ms. Dao bought for you.

98
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,640
And kicked out of the house like a beggar.

99
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,080
Only pair of briefs left.

100
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,480
- Are you always naked? - YES.

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,280
It's so great.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,720
Sir.

103
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
Information from Ms. Thongprakai

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,640
I sent it to you via email.

105
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,280
Yes, I got it.

106
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,680
Do you want me to contact Ms. Thong again?

107
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,480
I have never comforted anyone.

108
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,960
Please help me think about how to make her come find me on her own.

109
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,320
Yes.

110
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,560
Hello.

111
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,760
I'm Siwelay,

112
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,160
My new manager Thong,

113
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,640
Thongprakai.

114
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,160
Is there something you want to discuss?

115
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,800
Contact advertising?

116
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,920
Okay.

117
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,920
Salary 10 million baht? Oh, death.

118
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,320
A salary of 10 million baht is probably impossible to receive, the problem is now

119
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,400
Our Thong receives a salary of 20 million baht or more.

120
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
And sorry, the required contract is only a domestic contract.

121
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,160
If you use it abroad, you will have to pay for each country.

122
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,520
And importantly

123
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,600
You are not allowed to replay it. Absolutely no replay allowed.

124
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,360
Oh, I forgot, advertising, right?

125
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,800
Sorry, I got a little carried away. But let it go.

126
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,400
Stop it, I don't want to hear it.

127
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,760
20 million baht or more, that's it.

128
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,120
What do you see?

129
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,800
Manager's level

130
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,960
Number one actor in the country, is it approved?

131
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,720
That's a bit arrogant.

132
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,200
People scold me now.

133
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,960
Another thing is my salary

134
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,520
Not even 20 million baht.

135
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
25,000 baht is accepted.

136
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
You really have a lot of stories.

137
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,520
It's okay to practice again.

138
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,160
Thong.

139
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,160
Strange number.

140
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,640
There is definitely a job coming.

141
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
- Job comes. - Yes, pick up the phone.

142
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,000
Be decent. Don't act too much.

143
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,680
Hello.

144
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,800
I'm Siwelay,

145
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,240
is my new manager Thong,

146
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm Thongprakai.

147
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,280
Need any help?

148
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,880
Huh?

149
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,160
Ms. Jang?

150
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,440
Chicha, my mother?

151
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,120
Thong has already done merit for him.

152
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,400
But if you want, Thong will come to the cremation ceremony

153
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,400
Maybe Thong won't go anywhere.

154
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,400
It's OK.

155
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,040
He did that to me,

156
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
If it were you, you wouldn't go.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,720
But your arrival today

158
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,560
It's because I deliberately brought money to pay you.

159
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,120
What money is that?

160
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,400
Before he passed away,

161
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,400
he transferred all the money to Chicha's account,

162
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
amount of about 4 million baht.

163
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I know

164
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,920
That's my salary from acting and other jobs.

165
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,920
So I came to give it back to you.

166
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,720
I'll give you my account number here.

167
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I will pass it on to you.

168
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
No need.

169
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,240
You keep it.

170
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,240
Just consider it

171
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,840
Thong me Chicha.

172
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,960
Oh, Thong.

173
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,400
Why would you give such a few million baht to someone else?

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,760
But I feel sorry for her.

175
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,320
Looking at her face makes me think of myself.

176
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,520
She has lost her father.

177
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
That way she will have money to go to school.

178
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
If she gets a good education,

179
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,400
If you are raised well, you will not grow up to be someone like me.

180
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,640
Yes, Bodhisattva.

181
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,880
But it's good.

182
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,080
Do meritorious deeds, do good deeds,

183
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,800
This will result in a lot of work coming in.

184
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,080
Not sure anymore,

185
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,440
Probably more and better than before.

186
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,960
Mo Buddha.

187
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,400
If so indeed

188
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Then I will make merit three times a day, morning, noon, and afternoon.

189
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,920
What time is it?

190
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,040
Sod Oh Seet is on.

191
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,160
Take a look

192
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,400
Look what's going on with Yem again.

193
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,960
 Breaking news, dear viewers.

194
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,440
 Mr. Dam Damkoeng, famous director,

195
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,880
 was arrested in connection with an online gambling website.

196
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,720
 Previously, there were rumors saying that

197
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,960
 he broke up with Ms. Dao Dara,

198
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,480
 has been our talented female director for a while now.

199
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,920
 Maybe because she found out

200
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,120
 he is involved in dark business,

201
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,840
 but what's more shocking is

202
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,120
 has my name Thong, Thongprakai,

203
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,240
 she opened a playing account,

204
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,040
 is a famous player on this website.

205
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,040
What will happen next?

206
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,120
Yem will follow up with an in-depth investigation.

207
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,320
This. There are customers.

208
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,120
Hello dear customers.

209
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,640
- Hello. - Hello.

210
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,760
What did Thong come here for today?

211
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,360
Did the customer forget?

212
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,040
Today Thong came to film a commercial for Neko soap

213
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
that we had made an appointment before.

214
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Oh, haven't you read the email yet?

215
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,000
The company ordered an urgent change of representative.

216
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
We don't use Thong anymore.

217
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,480
Why? What happened?

218
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,840
We signed a three-year contract, right?

219
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
In the contract there is a clause:

220
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,640
If the representative has bad rumors, it will cause losses

221
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,640
then we have the right to fire at any time.

222
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,280
Wait, customer.

223
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,600
Just play online gambling.

224
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,920
I don't see any loss.

225
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Everyone plays.

226
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,440
Just like when we were children

227
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Play dice, dial numbers, that's all.

228
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,000
Has the customer ever played blackjack?

229
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,000
- Used to play. - See?

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,760
But I'm not an agent.

231
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,080
Please allow me.

232
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,440
Oh.

233
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,880
Why so strict?

234
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
It's just gambling.

235
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,360
Why can't we sell soap?

236
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,920
Well, it's okay, sister.

237
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,360
It's okay to wait for something else.

238
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,880
Let's go home.

239
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,160
But I wonder. Why?

240
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,080
Oh, oh.

241
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,120
Meeting this mother and daughter again.

242
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
How are you these days? How are you?

243
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,760
I'll be fine soon,

244
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,040
By the time I met you, I was completely fine.

245
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,680
What are you wandering about in this area, Malee?

246
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
I'm the one

247
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,240
I should ask what you two are doing here.

248
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,800
And me

249
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
then come to be a representative

250
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
replace the old person who was fired.

251
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,160
With Malee.

252
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,640
You're the one who spread my bad news, right?

253
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,680
Do you think I have that much power to sway netizens?

254
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,400
So who spread the news?

255
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,240
I don't know.

256
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
But let me go review the script first.

257
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,400
Speak more fluently

258
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,000
The more customers will love you for a long time

259
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
and don't get fired on television like you.

260
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,800
You bastard.

261
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,960
Why mango

262
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
not purple?

263
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,720
I do not know.

264
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,920
Every live stream I see eats mangoes,

265
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,320
Why don't you know?

266
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,040
Because people eat,

267
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,320
not the one who named it.

268
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,240
Ask anything.

269
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,240
I don't know how many people watch that.

270
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,240
What is it?

271
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,240
Eating mango causes diarrhea?

272
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
There were 120 viewers.

273
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,600
So today I would like to turn off the live stream first.

274
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,600
If you want, I can live regularly

275
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Then invite your friends to watch as much as possible.

276
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,560
Goodbye.

277
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,400
I know.

278
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,080
Darling, I know you're waiting for me.

279
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,920
I love you, okay?

280
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,080
Goodbye my love, kiss me.

281
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,920
David called to tell me

282
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,600
that next week he will come see me.

283
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,880
But you don't need to worry,

284
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,360
I will call a maid to clean the sofa for you.

285
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,960
Let her sleep comfortably.

286
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,560
No need, sister.

287
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,960
Let me rent another place to live.

288
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm afraid of your husband.

289
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,640
Oh, what are you afraid of?

290
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,760
I told David that I was your manager, you paid me a percentage.

291
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,280
So, it's a small matter that I share the sofa for her to sleep on.

292
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,640
But it's been 6 months already

293
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,120
but still nothing to do.

294
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,960
I'm starting to lose hope of finding a job in the entertainment industry.

295
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,880
I think I go to an English class

296
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,760
It's better to catch a Western husband like her.

297
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,360
Leave that for last, Thong.

298
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,760
Here it is, these days she keeps recording videos and posting on TikTok regularly.

299
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,560
Got it? And if within a few months

300
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,240
She really still doesn't have a job

301
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,440
then me

302
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,560
will be the one to teach you to speak English.

303
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,560
Thank you.

304
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,880
So can you teach me the first sentence?

305
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,880
The first sentence she should be able to say

306
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,200
that's the sentence

307
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,320
"Hello".

308
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

309
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,840
Hello.

310
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,920
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

311
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,320
I just came here to drink water.

312
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,840
Oh, very good!

313
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,080
- Really? - YES.

314
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,640
- Is that okay? - Okay.

315
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,600
Hello.

316
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,600
Welcome.

317
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,560
Who is that?

318
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,640
Hello, Si, listen.

319
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,880
That's right.

320
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,320
I'm Thong's manager, Thongprakai.

321
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,800
Join the program?

322
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,440
Oh, I'm free.

323
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,800
It's very free.

324
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,800
What program is that?

325
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,040
Sod Oh Seet?

326
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,640
Okay, please wait here for a moment.

327
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,000
- Yes, yes. - When is the time?

328
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,640
I will come in and call.

329
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,200
Thank you.

330
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,720
Sister Si! Let's go home.

331
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,240
Yem contacted me to interview for this type of program.

332
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,760
definitely not a good thing.

333
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,040
Stop, sit down.

334
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,040
Sit!

335
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,040
She told me.

336
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,520
That she wanted for her

337
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,600
came to talk about her life after the events.

338
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,840
Hey, don't be too suspicious.

339
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,160
There will probably be an audience

340
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,760
say this, say that,

341
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,040
But it's still better than leaving her alone

342
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,400
Just stay home and sleep, right?

343
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
We must use this opportunity to create benefits.

344
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,760
She was always on TV.

345
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,280
That's right, I have to do something outstanding

346
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
to be different from the previous Thong.

347
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,280
There is news to report

348
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,520
Better than no news at all, right?

349
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,000
That's right.

350
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,200
That's it, smart people must think like that.

351
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,160
Hello, special guest on Sod Oh Seet today,

352
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
Everyone probably still remembers her, right?

353
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,560
Please Thong, Thongprakai Jarasruedee.

354
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,200
Please sit down.

355
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,680
Oh, Thong!

356
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Thong, did you get anything fixed?

357
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,160
Why does it look more beautiful than before?

358
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,440
Neither.

359
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,320
Eat well and live well as before,

360
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,840
get something even more beautiful

361
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,840
when fully rested.

362
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,520
Looking at Ms. Yem's eyes,

363
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
If there's a problem... Oh.

364
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Like you said, it's due to karma.

365
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,040
Oh, long time no see,

366
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,880
there are no results to see,

367
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,480
So Yem can't remember Thong's old appearance.

368
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,160
Alright, let's get down to business.

369
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,880
Thong!

370
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,080
Since Mr. B, my old manager, died,

371
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Thong, do you follow the reactions of the online community?

372
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,320
A little bit too.

373
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,320
Thong Thank you very much everyone,

374
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,680
for motivating Thong.

375
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,880
So what happens is that someone asks a question

376
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,520
everything happens

377
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,480
It's because Thong made up everything

378
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,800
because I don't want to work with Mr. B anymore,

379
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,080
But things went too far,

380
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,480
to the point where unnecessary things happen,

381
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,160
Thong, what do you think about this?

382
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,040
Who would make up a story about being raped on television?

383
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,040
That's not a good thing for Thong.

384
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,200
Why did Thong have to do that?

385
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,840
I really pity the people who thought of this.

386
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,480
Do they use their brains to think?

387
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,880
Oh, they probably also followed Thong's past events.

388
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,440
It's about men, it's about betting,

389
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,840
Who knows?

390
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,480
Is there anything else that hasn't been revealed yet?

391
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,360
Wait!

392
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,600
Invite me to join the program,

393
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
said to come for life updates

394
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
but I don't see any related questions asked.

395
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,400
Just dredging up old stories to ask.

396
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,560
Calm down, Thong!

397
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,040
Otherwise, how can the program be attractive?

398
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,720
Okay, now,

399
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,360
Let's rest a bit.

400
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,720
I'll come back later to talk more with Thong

401
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,080
and special guest.

402
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,040
But who it is, everyone must continue to watch.

403
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,880
Son Yem! Who are you bringing to anger me again?

404
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,640
Soon you will know.

405
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
It will definitely be a surprise.

406
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,520
Okay, okay, okay, Thong.

407
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, that would attract more viewers.

408
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,120
Right?

409
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,920
Hey Thong, if Thong wants to do something

410
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,480
then just do it.

411
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,480
It's not about being polite with...

412
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,080
people with this kind of character.

413
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,440
The program they created was a surprise

414
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,440
then we create a surprise again.

415
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,920
You like surprises, right?

416
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,480
That's right.

417
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,600
I like it very much.

418
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,920
Do it now.

419
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Let's watch together.

420
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,640
The host of this show is good.

421
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,680
Asking questions that get straight to the point makes Thong angry.

422
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,680
She did what I told her to do.

423
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,280
Please wait to see the next part.

424
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,000
The next guest might give Ms. Thong an even bigger headache.

425
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,800
We still have a girl coming here tonight

426
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,600
to share his life story with us.

427
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,320
Everyone is welcome to meet

428
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,480
em Malee, Maleena Pridasuk. Xin invite.

429
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,040
Hello.

430
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,640
Thong, my dear.

431
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,240
Long time no see.

432
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,560
Thong, my dear.

433
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,760
Did you know? When the program contacted me,

434
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,040
When I said I would interview with her, I quickly accepted.

435
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,840
Really? But if the program says you will come

436
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,000
then I refused.

437
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,120
Oh, teasing each other is so fun.

438
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,760
Have you two been friends for a long time?

439
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,000
It's since filming the movie "Castle of Desire".

440
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,520
At that time we always performed together, right Thong?

441
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,880
And we are all new.

442
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,280
So it's easier to get closer.

443
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,440
It turns out that's it. At that time, Thong was the female lead.

444
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Malee is the main female friend.

445
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,520
But... Oh, I almost forgot.

446
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,000
Ms. Yem heard that

447
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Malee has something good to say, right?

448
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,640
That's right, Ms. Yem.

449
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,760
Next movie,

450
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,600
Malee will be the female lead.

451
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,080
Congratulations.

452
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,640
I'm Thong. How do you feel now?

453
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,320
when I see my best friend

454
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,720
to become the female lead?

455
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,880
Feel happy for her.

456
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,880
But I also feel sorry for myself because I used to be the female lead.

457
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,040
but now he falls into the mud, becoming a bad guy in society.

458
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,400
I have to answer like that to satisfy you, right?

459
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,040
Oh, Thong, my love. Don't say that.

460
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,000
Even though she doesn't have much work now,

461
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,520
But you can also be an idol of mistakes.

462
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,400
Because there are a lot of people

463
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
have a bad life and need encouragement,

464
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,440
they can go back and look at her life.

465
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,520
Because even though she went through so many bad things

466
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,000
she can still face society with her face up.

467
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,760
Everyone can do it too. Is that right, Ms. Yem?

468
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,200
That's right. If Thong can do it

469
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,800
- everyone can do it. - Everyone can do it.

470
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,880
But every time you look at me

471
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,880
It's more like you're looking in the mirror.

472
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,760
Being a prostitute in a bar, being a concubine for the police.

473
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,000
Trade yourself to enter the entertainment world.

474
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Do you want to trample me? Don't forget that

475
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,160
You also do the same vile things

476
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,240
I'm Thong.

477
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,520
You too, always pry into other people's affairs.

478
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,440
You want to make me crazy and cause chaos, right?

479
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,960
Remember when you rushed in and hit me in the hospital.

480
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,200
While my hand is still infused with water,

481
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,880
You still attack me like crazy.

482
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,280
Do you want me to tell it too?

483
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,280
Everybody. Let's take a short break.

484
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,000
Why take a break? Views are increasing.

485
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,160
What do you want to take a break for?

486
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,600
Everybody. These two

487
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,720
Previously, there was a disagreement with Thong.

488
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,120
Today I intentionally dragged Thong to trample him in front of the television.

489
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,360
Okay, Thong will drag these two along to be trampled on together.

490
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,800
- The story between these two... - Wait, wait.

491
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,000
Everybody. If people want to continue listening

492
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,200
how miserable these two are

493
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,800
Then follow Thong's TikTok.

494
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,640
We will tell you everything.

495
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,960
Why do we have to increase views for your show?

496
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,120
- Let's go home, Thong. - Let's go.

497
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,560
Go back to live streaming.

498
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,800
Thong's story is also quite dramatic.

499
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,960
As far as I can investigate

500
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,920
Ms. Thong's life was full of events.

501
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,160
That's why this personality was born.

502
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,000
Turn on the channel she said would be live.

503
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,960
I want to see.

504
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,920
Where will she broadcast it?

505
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,720
TikTok.

506
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,040
Here.

507
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,760
That's why they brought Thong in to humiliate Thong in the middle of the show.

508
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,280
They hate and don't want Thong to succeed.

509
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,560
If you want to know if the stories I tell are true or false

510
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,520
Then go ask those two people.

511
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,880
Just come here today.

512
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,840
Don't want to be long, I'll go live again tomorrow

513
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,280
If you're interested, goodbye.

514
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,280
Oh.

515
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,960
Thong, listen to me.

516
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,360
How to become an influencer

517
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,880
is to be diligent,

518
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,040
must go live every day

519
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,120
and on a regular schedule.

520
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,560
Do not appear and then disappear. If not

521
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,360
then the audience will leave us.

522
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,760
If you leave then leave.

523
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,120
I don't like doing anything that involves following viewers like this.

524
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,280
Have to make this video and that video every day.

525
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,440
And then I have to respond to stupid comments.

526
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,600
Girl, you want money, don't you?

527
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,680
If you want money, you must be current.

528
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,880
She must always be the center of attention to make money.

529
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,200
But today's program I participate in

530
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,920
It must have completely ruined my image.

531
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,520
My content will now have to be edgy and controversial.

532
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,520
And crazier every day.

533
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,960
I don't want to

534
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,400
work must follow trends like this.

535
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,240
I'm tired.

536
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,720
Many things.

537
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,040
You are so difficult to understand.

538
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,440
When there is a way to do business, throw it away.

539
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,680
If not make money this way

540
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,560
How to make money? How?

541
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,280
Do you remember?

542
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,440
Someone once contacted me and wanted me to have dinner with the minister.

543
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,600
Really?

544
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,200
I have nothing to lose, give it a try.

545
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,000
Mr. Lom, is the minister still hungry?

546
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,800
Thong is ready to have dinner with him.

547
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,880
Sir, Ms. Thong please contact me again.

548
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,560
She is ready to meet you.

549
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,520
Said I went to sleep.

550
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,520
Tomorrow morning will give the answer.

551
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,200
If...

552
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,280
If she contacts you again tomorrow, don't rush to answer.

553
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,560
Until she contacted me a third time.

554
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,720
Yes.

555
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,040
How's it going? Has he responded yet?

556
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,160
It's already past 9am and you still haven't woken up yet?

557
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,520
Or should I text and ask again?

558
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
Try it, maybe he forgot to ask his boss.

559
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,840
- Sir. - YES.

560
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,280
Ms. Thong has contacted me again.

561
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,160
I wonder when it's convenient for you to meet?

562
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,040
Say I'm busy in a meeting,

563
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,680
When the meeting is over, I will respond.

564
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,680
Yes, sir.

565
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,480
It's past noon and there's still no answer.

566
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,320
I don't know why there are so many meetings.

567
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,160
I think she was played by him.

568
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,920
What to play?

569
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,080
Then make that price.

570
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,960
That's because you bargained with him for months

571
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,920
So now there's retaliation.

572
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,120
Really?

573
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,680
YES.

574
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,840
So I don't text back anymore.

575
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,440
I should just quietly retaliate, right?

576
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,160
It's up to you. But try to think about it.

577
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,920
She was silent, he was silent. Everyone is silent,

578
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,200
In the end, both disappeared.

579
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,120
If you lose your chance, will you accept it?

580
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,160
Refuse.

581
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,040
Besides him, I have no other choice.

582
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,880
So that means you're under him now.

583
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,600
I can't stand it. I don't want to be a loser.

584
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,000
Being the underdog doesn't mean you have to lose.

585
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,280
Listen, you old snakes

586
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,000
being oppressed by his first wife all his life,

587
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
Do you know what they want?

588
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,760
Innocent, pure girls,

589
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,160
Let their hearts feel like spring.

590
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,000
What she needs to do is

591
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,320
she had to be a bunny

592
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,480
cuddle with them. Understand?

593
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,080
- Little bunny? - Little rabbit.

594
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,240
- Nagging? - YES.

595
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,520
Oh, that sounds creepy.

596
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,520
But if you can lure the old snake into the rabbit hole

597
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,760
then I accept.

598
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,600
Attack. Hey, look at me.

599
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,720
Look down my rabbit hole. Boom boom, but foreigners are addicted.

600
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,640
Sir,

601
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,480
Ms. Thong sent the sticker along with the recording.

602
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
Come on, show me.

603
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,960
Here.

604
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,560
Oh my god, why is he so cruel?

605
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,080
Waiting since last night until now, can't do anything.

606
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,080
I will be angry, please tell him

607
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,200
that Thong really wanted to meet him.

608
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,080
Please be kind to me.

609
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,640
This.

610
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,720
Yes.

611
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,560
Answer her that tomorrow afternoon I will invite you to dinner at my house.

612
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,760
Okay.

613
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,600
I will wear this dress to dine with him.

614
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,120
I don't find it impressive at all.

615
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,040
Hey, you'd better change into a sweet dress.

616
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,120
That way he will love you.

617
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,360
This dress is the first expensive item

618
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,400
which I want when I go to Bangkok.

619
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,640
At that time I thought if I could wear this dress

620
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,720
then I will become a rich and classy person.

621
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,680
This dress will be the dress that guides my destiny, sister.

622
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,040
Take me to be the minister's wife.

623
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,560
Thong! Are you praying for something?

624
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,120
Are you praying for the suit?

625
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,120
I begged someone to buy this outfit for me.

626
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,160
Let me get his attention.

627
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,800
When he saw me wearing this outfit

628
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,520
then you will have to love, you will have to be infatuated.

629
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,800
So who bought this outfit for you?

630
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,920
What does he have to ask for?

631
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,520
Mr. Wi is the one who bought it for me.

632
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,200
Very good.

633
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,840
Very good.

634
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,920
How is it? Let your ex-husband help you get a new husband.

635
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,600
Are you sure he will help you?

636
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,320
Please help, Mr. Wi loves me very much and always wants me to live well.

637
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,640
He will help me anyway.

638
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,840
Serious illness, so it's very serious.

639
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,440
Oh, still blowing.

640
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,600
Miss Thong, please sit and wait a moment.

641
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,840
He is coming down.

642
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,240
He's down.

643
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,400
Hello sir!

644
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,600
YES.

645
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:36,719
THE ROSE OF SIN
