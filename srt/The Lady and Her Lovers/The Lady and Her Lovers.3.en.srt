THE ROSE OF SIN

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,560
THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 03

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
 Let go.

4
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,480
 Is it okay?

5
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,560
 Don't know. Go quickly so others don't see you.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Let's go!

7
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,720
 Let's go, Pete!

8
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:15,893
 Let's go, let's go!

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,840
 I don't want you to become like this.

10
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,600
 Everything that has come to this point is because of my mother.

11
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,640
 Mom is the cause, she forced me.

12
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,799
Thong, let me take you to hide at a friend's house first.

13
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,840
His friend's house is in a garden, no one can see it.

14
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,160
Wait, take me to the temple first.

15
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Why go to the temple?

16
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
Let's go!

17
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Go!

18
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,920
Throw it, throw it!

19
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Catch it!

20
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:51,718
Why is it so heavy and only has coins?

21
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,880
Why keep these things?

22
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
What's up?

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,440
It's all coins!

24
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Pete!

25
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,640
Fake!

26
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
What the hell!

27
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,520
Pete, hey!

28
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Oh!

29
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,880
My childhood bracelet is still there.

30
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
This is so big!

31
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,400
Oh my god, gilded!

32
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,720
This is the real thing!

33
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,320
Hey, what about this!

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,760
Get up to 5 points!

35
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,680
Let's go quickly. His friend's house is quite far.

36
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Pete!

37
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,040
I don't want to hide at your friend's house.

38
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
What's up?

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,320
The police these days are so good that they'll die if they're still in Ang Thong

40
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,360
It's like waiting for the police to come and arrest you.

41
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,320
You pushed my mother down the stairs like that,

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,920
I think we're dead, Pete.

43
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,520
Do you know how serious that crime is?

44
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,960
Could be arrested and put in jail.

45
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,960
I don't want to get caught yet, Pete.

46
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,960
Still don't want to go to jail.

47
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Pete!

48
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,760
Hey, calm down.

49
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,480
Not afraid. With you by my side, I can escape no matter what.

50
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:30,246
We have to escape to Bangkok.

51
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,800
Why Bangkok?

52
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,200
There were people there with beautiful faces and well-dressed clothes.

53
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,320
It's all a beautiful scene.

54
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,920
Pete! I've been dreaming for a long time,

55
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,839
that one day I will escape from here

56
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,240
and go to Bangkok for good measure.

57
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,520
We have to go today. You'll come with me, right, Pete?

58
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,000
You'll be the one to help make my dream come true, right, Pete?

59
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,160
How will we live when we go to Bangkok?

60
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,160
We don't know anyone, Thong!

61
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,960
Let me take this gold to sell,

62
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,440
If we have money, we will find a way.

63
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,800
So will we stay there long? It's not that I don't like it,

64
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,919
But I'm worried about my dad,

65
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
I can't leave my dad here alone.

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,200
When this calms down,

67
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,040
We will go back to visit your father.

68
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Okay, Pete?

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,600
Come with me.

70
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,920
Life here is not good at all.

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,520
Let's go to Bangkok and start again, Pete?

72
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,200
Come with me. Okay?

73
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Older brother...

74
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,520
Okay, get in the car. Go to Bangkok together.

75
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Pete!

76
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Pete!

77
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,919
Thank you, Pete!

78
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,440
I'm sure you won't leave me.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,640
How can I leave you, you are my wife.

80
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,600
From now on you don't need to be afraid of anything, I will take care of you.

81
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,800
Thanks Pete.

82
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,279
 - Up for a little something. - Where are you going? Come pick up your stuff?

83
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,480
 No need, go there and buy a new one.

84
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
 Hurry up.

85
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,880
Is Pete still not asleep?

86
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,640
I'm installing Excel and an anti-virus program for dad.

87
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,719
Dad kept nagging that he wouldn't do it

88
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,919
Now I can do it for you, Dad.

89
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,080
You can do it tomorrow morning, now go to sleep.

90
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:33,167
I can't sleep, it's almost over.

91
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,999
How to use Excel

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,200
Look for it on YouTube, there are many people teaching it.

93
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,200
Dad, you know how to open YouTube, right?

94
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,160
Dad knows how to open YouTube but won't do it.

95
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,240
Whenever I have a question, I don't know who to ask.

96
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
When you have free time, you can teach me.

97
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,720
Dad went to sleep first.

98
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,339
Dad.

99
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,399
Oh.

100
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
What are you doing?

101
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,640
Seeing my dad's big, round belly, I wanted to touch it.

102
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,279
Star? Can't you hug me?

103
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,439
I'm changing more and more.

104
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,559
Go away.

105
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,920
Go to work and then go to sleep.

106
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,240
Dad, go to sleep.

107
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Good night dad.

108
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,760
Yes, good night.

109
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,360
I love you, dad.

110
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,200
 [Pawn Shop]

111
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,720
6 strands. Take it all, right?

112
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,240
5, take all of that.

113
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,160
Whose is it? Where do you get so much from?

114
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,480
My mother's. Mom told me to bring it and hold it.

115
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,120
I'm sick so I need money urgently.

116
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,240
Say it out loud, thief right?

117
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,000
If you don't hold it, that's it.

118
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,279
- No need to say much. - Wait, wait.

119
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,719
Even if it was stolen, I would still take it. I asked

120
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,599
is because I want to know what I should do with this gold.

121
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,359
If it is the owner's item

122
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,559
then I will keep it until I redeem it.

123
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,599
But if a thief brings it, I will melt it

124
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,800
That way the owner won't find out.

125
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,960
Pawn it for such a high price, you greedy guy.

126
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,759
If you sell it for real, you will definitely get 100,000 baht.

127
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,120
Here is half.

128
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,719
Come on. He took it and thought it was good. Items without origin like this,

129
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,520
No gold shop will buy it.

130
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,600
Where to go next?

131
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,840
Go to our apartment, our house.

132
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Much higher than what you see in the photo.

133
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,560
Wait a minute. Call the room owner first.

134
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,320
Honey, I'm at the apartment. Where are we waiting for you?

135
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Okay.

136
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,960
Yes. Hello.

137
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,960
He's almost there. Let's go inside.

138
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Come in first so I can buy food. Buy anything?

139
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,400
Buy anything. Take the same as me.

140
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
I'll go inside first.

141
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Sorry, sister.

142
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,720
 Is that Thong?

143
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,320
 Mr. Wirachay, is that right?

144
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
 That's right.

145
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,760
 Shall we go to our room now?

146
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,040
 Shall we go up and see the room?

147
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,560
 Not yet. I'll wait for you first.

148
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,960
 Okay.

149
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,360
 Please sit first.

150
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
 Yes.

151
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,160
 My guess is right,

152
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,920
 Wirachay in real life is exactly like what I thought.

153
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
How is that?

154
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,999
Then in the phone

155
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Mr. Wirachay's voice is so handsome.

156
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,720
When we actually met him, he was truly handsome.

157
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,880
Does Mr. Wirachay have a lover?

158
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
How are you?

159
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thong.

160
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,000
Please. Here, please come inside.

161
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Come in.

162
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,120
I'll take this room.

163
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,280
Take this room too?

164
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,720
If so, please sign here.

165
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
The monthly rent is 10,000 baht.

166
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,640
And will pay deposit for three months.

167
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,679
Mr. Wi. Can you give me a little discount?

168
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,399
I come from another province.

169
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,480
I don't have much money on me, so I have to spend it sparingly.

170
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,599
So please reduce it to 9,500 baht.

171
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
5.000 baht.

172
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,359
5,000 baht is too much. So much discount

173
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,800
then your mother will definitely scold you.

174
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,760
What is it, Mr. Wi?

175
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,839
As big as this, you have to make your own decisions.

176
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,480
Do you still have to listen to your mother?

177
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,680
Hey, Mr. Wi. Reduced to 5,000 baht.

178
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,679
If you charge a high price,

179
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,359
I'll probably only stay for a month.

180
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,680
We have to find another place cheaper than this to live.

181
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,760
Hey man.

182
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,920
That's OK. 5,000 baht is 5,000 baht.

183
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:36,799
But combined with a three-month deposit, the total is...

184
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,040
Is it okay to not deposit?

185
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,960
No deposit?

186
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,559
Thank you, Mr. Wi.

187
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,920
Very willing. This is the room card.

188
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,840
What's up?

189
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,680
We have the life of our dreams, Pete.

190
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,040
I've always wanted to be a Bangkokian.

191
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,120
Thank you for bringing me here!

192
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,360
Becoming a Bangkokian.

193
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,040
What's the point of making a loud mouth? I don't want to know, I want to sleep!

194
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,879
You scream in your room, I just sleep in your room.

195
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,120
If you can't stand it, cover your ears.

196
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,479
Country boy, this is not a rice field

197
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,679
Let you scream and herd buffaloes and cows.

198
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
Rooms are so close together

199
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:57,519
You have to know how to keep a low profile with others.

200
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,680
If you can't live with Bangkok people, then go back to your hometown.

201
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,319
Say I'm from the countryside, does your face look like a Bangkokian?

202
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,759
I must have just ridden a buffalo to dig for gold.

203
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,639
only dig for gold at night,

204
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,680
That's why I sleep during the day like that. You low-life!

205
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,200
What time I dig is my business.

206
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,519
Don't let me see you outside.

207
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,120
I'll knock your teeth out and that's it.

208
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,599
What? When I scream is my business.

209
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,680
Calm down, calm down!

210
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,959
What is up?

211
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,800
- What a rude person! Rude! - That's enough!

212
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Pete!

213
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,760
Are you awake, child?

214
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,160
It's late!

215
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:39,099
I told you not to sleep late but you didn't listen.

216
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,920
I can't wake up now.

217
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Pete.

218
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,760
Pete, why do they only give one spoon?

219
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,120
Can we eat with the same spoon? Use one together.

220
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Is it delicious?

221
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Very delicious.

222
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,800
Having someone feed it must be better than eating it yourself.

223
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,319
Pete. You know what?

224
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
You're the first person to feed me.

225
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
Really?

226
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,000
So when you were little, your mother didn't feed you?

227
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,640
Don't say spoon-feeding.

228
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,360
I can't even say a gentle word to you.

229
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,000
Every word that speaks to you,

230
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,720
If it's not wrong doing something, it's still scolding.

231
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,040
Never once patted your head or hugged you.

232
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,480
Only when he beat me did he touch me.

233
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,960
Never mind. Just consider that my fate is not good.

234
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,800
When you have such a mentally ill mother.

235
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
But I was able to escape from there.

236
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,720
Right? Now I'm by your side.

237
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,040
You just need to be cute in my eyes and that's enough.

238
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Pete.

239
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,200
 Dad has finished cooking.

240
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,200
 Get up and eat, quickly.

241
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,760
 They are all delicious dishes, by the afternoon there will be none left.

242
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,360
Where did Pete go?

243
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,000
 After eating, I feel sleepy. I'll sleep first.

244
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Dad called.

245
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,800
Don't answer the phone.

246
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,520
Thong, what are you doing?

247
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,560
Can't talk now, let's call dad another day.

248
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,000
So what if something urgent happens?

249
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,280
For example, did the police come to the house?

250
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,039
If so, you should not answer the phone.

251
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,839
The police will eavesdrop on you talking to your father,

252
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,240
then secretly picked up the phone signal and came here.

253
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,520
I've seen people do that on TV.

254
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,960
Miss Gim.

255
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,200
Is Ms. Gim home?

256
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,160
I came to find my son.

257
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,840
I don't know if Gim knows...

258
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
Ms. Gim.

259
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,200
What's wrong with Gim?

260
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Ms. Gim.

261
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,200
Sister Gim, Sister Gim.

262
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,519
Pete, I've only seen it in pictures,

263
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
There is really cool air conditioning in real life.

264
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,480
Do you smell the fragrance?

265
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,559
Pete, I've seen idols on the internet wearing like that.

266
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,240
Come on, let's go there and see.

267
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,640
There it is, there it is, Pete.

268
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,080
This set is so beautiful.

269
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,679
- Beautiful, isn't it? - YES.

270
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,959
Let's go inside and see.

271
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Let's go.

272
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
It's beautiful.

273
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,880
I'll take this set, do you see?

274
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,040
Yes, wearing Thong will be very beautiful and attractive.

275
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,520
Sorry to bother you, please don't touch.

276
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,560
Why can't you touch it?

277
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,800
If people want to buy, they must touch the fabric first, right?

278
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,840
This set has already been ordered.

279
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,400
Someone ordered it, why is it here? Why not put it away?

280
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,279
I want to get this style,

281
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,160
a size S and ready for me to try again.

282
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,359
Didn't you hear what my lover said?

283
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,760
Go get ready.

284
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,400
This set costs 58 thousand baht.

285
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,240
 This set is 58 thousand baht.

286
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,800
 How can that be? What do you mean by that?

287
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,520
 Do you look down on each other? What about 58 thousand baht?

288
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,759
 Yeah, what? Think there's no money to pay?

289
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,199
 I have money in my pocket but I won't buy from you anymore.

290
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,760
 The service is terrible, it's better to go somewhere else.

291
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,960
 Acts like he really wants to buy it.

292
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,800
 Thong, don't be upset. Okay?

293
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,400
 I promise that one day I will buy you something nice.

294
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,280
 Wait until I have money first.

295
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,039
 Buying more expensive items than the store just now.

296
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
 No need. Wanted to buy the store just now.

297
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,639
Just wait and see, when you have money,

298
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,919
I'll throw money at that employee's face

299
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,960
and wearing that outfit swaggered in front of it.

300
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,280
But Thong,

301
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,400
I look beautiful in any outfit. Do you know?

302
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,120
It's even more beautiful if you don't wear it.

303
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,320
Pete, look at this outfit.

304
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,040
Not as expensive as the store before.

305
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,560
Quickly buy it and replace it. I hate this stinky outfit.

306
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,720
That's cute too. What do you think?

307
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,120
Pretty.

308
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,119
Really?

309
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
That's beautiful.

310
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
Like a dog's coat.

311
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,240
Nowadays, people only wear short clothes.

312
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,920
Pete, do we look like real Bangkokians yet?

313
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
It's too perfect.

314
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,280
I think it's still not right.

315
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,600
Shop a little more here.

316
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,160
There's too much stuff.

317
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,160
Why are there so many items? This brand.

318
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,359
Ever seen it on TV. Beautiful, isn't it?

319
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,920
Yes, that's beautiful too.

320
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Em.

321
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,800
Buy whatever you want, just buy it.

322
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,480
I bought it for you.

323
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,920
Do you have money?

324
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:05,200
It's not always necessary to have money to buy things.

325
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,800
Take it, take it again.

326
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,479
Enough, this much.

327
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
Done?

328
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,400
I'll go outside and wait.

329
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,400
Are you planning on stealing?

330
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
This.

331
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
Whist.

332
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Go away.

333
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,240
Sorry.

334
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,680
Hello.

335
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,239
I just made a purchase a few days ago.

336
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,720
Yes.

337
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:53,320
My lover said I bought the wrong one.

338
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,599
So I brought it in to exchange,

339
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,400
or can I get a refund?

340
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,399
Refunds are not possible.

341
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,359
But if you exchange goods, it's okay.

342
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,840
Do you bring your receipt?

343
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,519
I didn't bring it with me, I forgot.

344
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,039
What to do? It's still very new.

345
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,440
I haven't opened it yet.

346
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,199
I'm sorry.

347
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,719
If you want to exchange goods, you must bring your invoice.

348
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,559
If there is no receipt, the store cannot exchange the product.

349
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,359
Really?

350
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:18,880
Yes.

351
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,839
No problem, can I have the bag please?

352
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,000
- Okay, wait for me. - I have to hug there.

353
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,759
Let me put it in.

354
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,080
It's okay, it's okay.

355
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,079
Alright.

356
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,480
Yes.

357
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,680
I can find an excuse to tell my lover.

358
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,919
I will come back.

359
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
- Goodbye. - Yes.

360
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Older brother.

361
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
How can you do that?

362
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,720
Peak?

363
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,160
You're smart, but that store is stupid.

364
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Hey.

365
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Wait a minute.

366
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,840
Go back and pay.

367
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,920
Honey, stop.

368
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,839
Stop.

369
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,200
Pete.

370
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,839
Stop.

371
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,280
Oh, why did you arrest me?

372
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,120
Honey, please let me take it back.

373
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,240
Let go.

374
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,000
I don't steal.

375
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,800
I bought a lot, don't you remember?

376
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,160
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

377
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:36,925
I really don't know.

378
00:26:36,926 --> 00:26:40,040
I was just a little excited so I challenged my lover to do that.

379
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:42,080
Actually, I have money.

380
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,960
Everything you buy is paid for.

381
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:48,280
If I were a thief, I would have stolen everything.

382
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,720
That's right, why did you come and steal from my store?

383
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,879
I don't steal.

384
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,879
I was going to say if my boyfriend took the things away

385
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,279
I will come back and pay.

386
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,759
Now I pay immediately.

387
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,040
It's too late, according to the law,

388
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,920
I have to call the police to take you away and call the guardian.

389
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,860
You can't.

390
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,800
Whatever you do, don't call the guardian, I beg you.

391
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,287
 So there is another way,

392
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,999
 you have to pay 50 times more

393
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,880
 the value of the product you stole.

394
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,520
 50 times is 23,000 baht.

395
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,160
 I can't pay that much.

396
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,119
 Please forgive me.

397
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,040
 This is the first time I made a mistake, I won't do it again.

398
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,439
 Please forgive me.

399
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,280
 Be a nice person.

400
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,920
 Then I have to re-educate you.

401
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,360
 Everyone else go out.

402
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,820
THE ROSE OF SIN
