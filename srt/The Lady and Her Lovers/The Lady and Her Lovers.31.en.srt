00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:01,353
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:39,922
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,320
Hello!

4
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,800
Hi Chris!

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,920
What do you use?

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,760
I have food today.

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,520
I want to eat this.

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,480
Is it here too?

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,880
Great, then give me two more packs.

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,800
Okay.

11
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
Ms. Juree!

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,120
- Yeah? - Eat with me?

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,040
This taste is delicious. Super awesome!

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,600
Yes, it looks so delicious, let me try a piece!

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,640
Okay, let me feed you.

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,600
Oh!

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,800
So great! Very delicious!

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,880
Mr. B, please go home!

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,240
I'm not a kindergartener on the first day of school.

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,520
There's no need for parents to watch over you like that.

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,560
Children are naughty

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,920
It's normal for parents to keep an eye on them.

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,880
Hey, phone yesterday, just added that!

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,920
That part of the dialogue with Linin's friend, do you remember it yet?

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Which voice? I haven't seen it yet.

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,280
I sent it to you via LINE last night. What are you doing?

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,320
Don't know the dialogue yet?

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,120
Oh.

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,720
Everyone!

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,120
This is a new actor.

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,760
Play as Linin's friend, named...

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,440
- Thong! - Malee!

33
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,120
Wait, do we know each other?

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,600
We are friends.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,360
Very close, right Thong?

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,680
Yes, I am a close friend, I love you very much.

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,240
I'm so happy, I didn't think I'd see you again.

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,920
So happy, so surprising!

39
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,520
Embrace it!

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,800
I didn't expect to see you here, I thought you were dead!

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,600
You're not dead yet, so how can I die?

42
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,480
I'm so happy to be able to act in a movie with my best friend.

43
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,520
It's so fun, I want to act right away.

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,440
Me too, honey!

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,920
Come here, hug me!

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,440
Why did you come here? You don't have any duties.

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,760
Thong is my chicken, it's normal for me to take care of him.

48
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,920
Really? I didn't see you the other day.

49
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,480
I wasn't free the other day.

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,880
I'm free today so I came. Do you have an opinion?

51
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Just asking.

52
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,760
Mr. B.

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,440
Ms. Dao, hello.

54
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,880
Are you coming to look after her today?

55
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,080
That's right.

56
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,960
From now on, I will be the one to take care of her, Ms. Dao.

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,400
Because I think she's still new in the entertainment industry.

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,000
Besides, what if she does?

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,560
If you are on the sidelines or going the wrong way, I will take care of it promptly.

60
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,520
No.

61
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,760
She is a cute child and works very hard.

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,800
Actually, Dao is looking for a new movie for her to play again.

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,360
This way work will not be interrupted.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,600
Ms. Dao, don't you stop by the filming set of Fai Varee?

65
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,600
It's been many days since I just stopped by here.

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,480
Over there, I let Jacki take care of it instead.

67
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,480
She came to this movie set

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,520
It's because a new character will enter the scene today, right?

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,720
That's right.

70
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,040
I want to know how well she acts

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,200
But I have to write a script just for her.

72
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,200
Were you raped by Jaem, Linin?

73
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,920
That's right, I will report it to the Ministry of Labor

74
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
let it become a precedent case. Just wait and see.

75
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,920
No way.

76
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,920
Instead of making enemies with Jaem

77
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,000
Then you must turn this opportunity into a benefit.

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,800
Sleep with ten executives

79
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,200
It's like sleeping with a president.

80
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,920
Cut.

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,000
Malee, please act a little softer than this.

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,360
In this scene, we're talking bad about the boss.

83
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,240
Be careful not to be heard, okay?

84
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,760
Yes, softly.

85
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,080
Okay. So do it again.

86
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,440
Five, four, three, two.

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,040
What?

88
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,840
Were you raped by Jaem, Linin?

89
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,120
Damn, I'm serious, how did she audition so successfully?

90
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,520
Hey, don't tell me

91
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,160
It's time to try having a 1:1 conversation with you. Can she do better than this?

92
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,520
Don't bother, okay?

93
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,560
I'm stressed too.

94
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,680
Cut, cut, cut.

95
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,320
Malee, wait for me in front of the studio, I'll give you instructions.

96
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,320
Oh.

97
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,040
Does Mr. B know Malee's name and background?

98
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,640
And why did Dam choose her to act?

99
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,840
Actually, I think her face looks very familiar.

100
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,480
If I remember correctly, it seems like she used to be a girl.

101
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,000
But I was also surprised

102
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,880
is why Dam chose her.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,360
But frankly speaking, it's probably the same as the old chickens.

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,920
Maybe she sacrificed herself to change roles.

105
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,920
Oh.

106
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,040
Sorry, I shouldn't say these things.

107
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,760
It's OK.

108
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,800
Dao knows clearly what kind of person Dam is.

109
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,360
So Mr. B came to watch over Thong like that

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,520
Also for this reason, right?

111
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,320
Actually, it's for this reason.

112
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,640
Thong is still very pure

113
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,640
and still new to the entertainment industry.

114
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,240
I'm afraid that

115
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,760
Even Thong will suffer loss before Dam.

116
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,240
Ms. Dao, can I bother Ms. Dao?

117
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,720
I want Ms. Dao to be my eyes and ears.

118
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,120
Don't let Dam get involved with Thong.

119
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,840
Okay.

120
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,440
Dao will definitely not let a good child like Thong

121
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,520
suffered loss because of Dam.

122
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Thong,

123
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,120
I found a lot of shoes, please take a look.

124
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,000
No need, Ms. Dao.

125
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,640
Just a pair of shoes makes Thong very shy.

126
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,760
Why bother?

127
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
I don't use these shoes anymore.

128
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,760
Juree, come help me a bit.

129
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,760
- Yes. - Take out your shoes for Thong to try on.

130
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,600
Okay.

131
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,480
Ms. Dao, I'm so happy.

132
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,400
So next time, if there are one or two pairs left over

133
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,000
Please share it with Malee.

134
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,920
Before I used good shoes

135
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,560
Can you please act better?

136
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,840
Shooting multiple times is a waste of other people's time.

137
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,960
I'm sorry, next scene

138
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Malee will be more focused and complete in just one shot.

139
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,160
Actually, I see your efforts.

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,920
But I tried the wrong way so my acting wasn't natural.

141
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,520
Then leave it for lunch break

142
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,120
Malee will ask Dam to help her practice.

143
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,200
No need.

144
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,240
Dam is a director, not an acting teacher.

145
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,560
Like this, I'll let you go to acting school.

146
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,240
If you want to be an actor, you must have acting skills.

147
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,000
not other skills.

148
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,400
Mr. Dam.

149
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,200
Honey, I'm going to the bathroom for a moment.

150
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,680
Honey, I need to pee, let's go to the bathroom.

151
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,360
Okay.

152
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,160
Hey bro.

153
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,680
Yeah.

154
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,240
This device can hear people's voices through the microphone, right?

155
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,440
Correct.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,320
Please allow me to try it a bit.

157
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,480
Brother, if you want to hear Thong's voice...

158
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,800
Thong, what should I do?

159
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,760
Mr. Dam, after filming is finished today, can Thong come to your house to meet you?

160
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,240
What's up? What is up?

161
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,880
The game that I showed Thong to play,

162
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,160
I don't understand why I always lose when I play.

163
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,280
It's nothing, I think it's because of it

164
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,360
Thong hasn't yet. Find a good strategy

165
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,360
But don't worry, I'll show you

166
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,920
If Ms. Dao doesn't invite you to go somewhere tonight.

167
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,680
Guaranteed this tip will work.

168
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,720
If she invites me to go, can't I refuse?

169
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,160
Thong is really in a hurry.

170
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,400
So let's talk after the shoot.

171
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,920
Yes.

172
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you very much.

173
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
- Who are you talking to? - Oh.

174
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,680
Can you stop acting like my dad?

175
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,040
Hey, after filming ends today, I have to go to therapy,

176
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,000
I made an appointment with the doctor.

177
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,240
If you don't go, I'll reschedule.

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,880
Thong, you can't do that.

179
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,680
I'm both an actress and a celebrity.

180
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,000
Don't act so easily and walk around with strangers like this anymore.

181
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,280
Learn how to protect your reputation.

182
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,120
If you treat me easily

183
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,720
can you see it?

184
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,240
Can you come down a little further?

185
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,280
See? I'm not worried about you at all.

186
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,840
I'm just worried about not being able to "eat".

187
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,360
That's why I don't want others.

188
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,040
Say for the last time,

189
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,000
Who you go with is your business.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
From now on, stay away from my private life.

191
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,840
Honestly.

192
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,440
Thong.

193
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,360
Lita, please share the cake with everyone.

194
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,880
Yes, thank you.

195
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,440
YES.

196
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,080
Ms. Dao, Malee overheard just now

197
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,200
Thong and Mr. Dam secretly talked to each other.

198
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,120
If they secretly talk, how can you hear?

199
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,280
Malee eavesdropped.

200
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,560
What does it have to do with me eavesdropping on people's conversations?

201
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,520
Leave it alone.

202
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
That's not the problem, the problem is

203
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,280
They secretly met after the filming.

204
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,800
It's nothing strange. They were probably talking about work.

205
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,680
But Thong said he would come to the house right away.

206
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
And it even said as if

207
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,600
If anyone wants to meet Mr. Dam, where should he go?

208
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,840
must refuse

209
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,800
Because Thong really wants to meet Mr. Dam.

210
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,600
So let Malee take more acting lessons.

211
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,800
Thank you very much.

212
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Are you hungry, Ms. Dao?

213
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,000
Because we have to film two or three more scenes before we can take a break.

214
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,080
Can I get some fruit and cake to eat first?

215
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,120
No problem.

216
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,440
I think I'll only eat fruit this afternoon.

217
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,320
Let's wait for filming to finish tonight and then let's go get something to eat.

218
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,840
How about tonight?

219
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,840
Or is Dam busy with something?

220
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,320
No, it's just that I think we're very compatible.

221
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,000
I also plan to invite Ms. Dao out to eat something.

222
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,640
So which restaurant do you want to eat at?

223
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,840
It's okay to eat at my house.

224
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,320
She just hired a new chef, his skills are very good.

225
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,640
At home, right?

226
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,920
That's good, because I haven't seen Diamond in a long time.

227
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,520
I'm missing it too.

228
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,160
Oh, what are you doing?

229
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,400
Are you crazy, Thong?

230
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,200
Where did you suddenly get so angry?

231
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,280
Oh.

232
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,360
Dead, Thong!

233
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
This pair costs tens of thousands.

234
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,640
Is it worth being angry? We met before,

235
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,200
When his wife invited him to dinner, he accepted as if nothing had happened.

236
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,520
It is normal for husband and wife to meet for dinner.

237
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,360
The one who is abnormal is you.

238
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,880
What are you doing suddenly going on a date with someone else's husband?

239
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,720
Hey, say it.

240
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,040
She arranged to meet him,

241
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,320
Do you want to secretly eat Ms. Dao's husband?

242
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,128
Not.

243
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:07,400
Is it just because of that that a man and a woman meet up?

244
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,960
So what's going on?

245
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,120
Say it, don't be angry with me.

246
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,720
Tell me.

247
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,600
No matter what, I'm angry with you

248
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,120
then my head exploded.

249
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,600
Mr. Dam invited me to play online games.

250
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,120
He said he would get money after playing.

251
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,560
Sister, when I first started playing, I actually won real money.

252
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
But if you play more, it will fade away.

253
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,320
I just want him to teach me how to play

254
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,120
to get more money, that's all.

255
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,360
God.

256
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,960
The game she is playing is called betting.

257
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,960
And there is no such thing as a betting game that only wins.

258
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,760
But Dam can do it.

259
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,800
I see him getting richer.

260
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,120
God.

261
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,680
He is so rich thanks to his wife.

262
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,080
Oh, why are you so stupid? Always looks smart.

263
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,200
Don't say that

264
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,920
Can you borrow money from me to play that game?

265
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,920
That's right.

266
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,960
Oh, this one!

267
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,640
I want to have money quickly.

268
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm tired of living a normal person's life.

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I want to buy expensive things like other people,

270
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,560
You don't have to wait to receive charity items,

271
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Used things like this.

272
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,040
Thong! Stop and listen.

273
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,720
No one who plays online betting can get rich.

274
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,600
The person who invented this game had to think about how to make themselves rich.

275
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,360
What did they let her get rich for?

276
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,800
Think.

277
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,560
Then clean up.

278
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,440
Clean up.

279
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Clean up.

280
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,840
Hey, Diamond!

281
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,160
Mam!

282
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,200
Very good!

283
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Eat a lot. To soon become a chubby dog.

284
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,400
Hello?

285
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,160
What's going on?

286
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,560
Mr. Dam, I'm Thong.

287
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,360
Yes, I'm having dinner at Ms. Dao's house.

288
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,920
If there's something wrong, just say it.

289
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,160
You said you dared to refuse Ms. Dao.

290
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Actually, you are also afraid of Ms. Dao, right?

291
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,160
Oh, really? I'm sorry,

292
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,880
I forgot we had an appointment.

293
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,800
Yes.

294
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,320
Is this okay? You can come to my house and wait.

295
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,840
I'm almost done eating, see you there.

296
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,480
Is that okay?

297
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,880
Really?

298
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,280
Are you telling the truth?

299
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,040
Yes, just like that.

300
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,480
Yes.

301
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,360
Sorry, I forgot

302
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,600
I have an appointment with my senior to come pick up my things at home.

303
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,280
Be? Can I please go first?

304
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,640
Wait, Dam, I haven't had dessert yet.

305
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,240
Next time, okay? Okay?

306
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,200
I'm really sorry, Ms. Dao.

307
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,840
Dad, please go first.

308
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,560
See you later.

309
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,640
Playing games and winning or losing is normal.

310
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Just keep playing and you'll gradually get better at it.

311
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,320
Please show me the trick.

312
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,480
Lost almost all the money in my account.

313
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,880
It's not uncomfortable.

314
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,440
If you want me to show you the trick, that's fine.

315
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,520
He also doesn't hide any tricks.

316
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,560
But he charges a fee for teaching.

317
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,680
If possible, Thong will pay.

318
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,960
If not, Thong will not pay.

319
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,000
How much do you want?

320
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,320
I don't need your money, I have plenty already.

321
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,040
What you need is love.

322
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,600
Are not.

323
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,400
Thong said that Thong did not do this.

324
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,880
But if there is money flowing into the account

325
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,600
hundreds, millions of baht

326
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,720
then why not do it?

327
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,880
So why is Dam so promiscuous and you don't break up with him?

328
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,520
Maybe because she wants to win.

329
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,520
She has never lost to anyone, her money wins everything.

330
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,280
But you can't buy loyalty from him.

331
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,920
Is that right?

332
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,360
Buy it or not

333
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,360
eight years of knowing each other

334
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,360
He also cheated many times

335
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,520
but never leave her.

336
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,720
Because he knows that without you,

337
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,520
he is just an ordinary man.

338
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,840
No matter what, he won't leave you.

339
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,600
But what if one day he leaves her?

340
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,360
What do you think could make him leave me?

341
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,400
There is someone else richer than you,

342
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,480
give him more than you?

343
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Never.

344
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,760
Ms. Dao.

345
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,720
Ms. Dao, Thong apologizes.

346
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,600
Thong, I'm sorry.

347
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,560
Thong really didn't mean it.

348
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,800
Thong just wanted to know something

349
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,720
between rich men and rich women like me.

350
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,040
Thong apologizes to Ms. Dao.

351
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,320
It's OK.

352
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,720
I'm fine.

353
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,600
Thong don't tell anyone...

354
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,520
Don't tell anyone that I'm crying because of men, okay?

355
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Can you promise?

356
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Thong promise.

357
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,920
Thong absolutely won't tell anyone.

358
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,360
Now you are the person I trust the most.

359
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,280
I ask you to be my eyes and ears,

360
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,480
Please keep an eye out to see if Dam is hanging out with anyone.

361
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,800
I really can't talk about this with anyone but you.

362
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,800
Ms. Dao, please rest assured.

363
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,440
Thong will stand by her side.

364
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,360
Do not.

365
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,040
Thong promised Dao.

366
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Go to Dam's house.

367
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,880
YES.

368
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,920
Do you remember the account you just registered?

369
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,000
Remember?

370
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,640
The account you mentioned is your new account, right?

371
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Yes, that's right.

372
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,960
Unlock her

373
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,960
and

374
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Let her play and win about 300,000 baht,

375
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,120
then retract it as before.

376
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,640
I will handle it.

377
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,760
Alright.

378
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,720
Brother, why did you do this to me?

379
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,320
I said don't.

380
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,680
Don't what?

381
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,360
Just now I saw you like to show off.

382
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,360
Moaning like that feels good.

383
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,600
No, I don't want to do it.

384
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,280
What did I give you to drink? It's better to say it out loud.

385
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,720
It's just normal wine.

386
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,760
Why get angry?

387
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,440
Anyway, we're done with each other.

388
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,680
Just think

389
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,080
Let's have a happy story between the two of us.

390
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,400
Give me your phone, I'll teach you the trick.

391
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,440
As promised.

392
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,040
Please focus on watching me play.

393
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,680
Choose this place first.

394
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
When the game starts

395
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,880
then press this place continuously.

396
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,640
See? This is fine.

397
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,480
This is true. Let me give it a try.

398
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,560
Choose this place first.

399
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,440
When the game starts, press continuously.

400
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,000
This is true.

401
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,000
Will it be like this forever?

402
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,480
So you have to try playing slowly and see how it goes.

403
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,040
See?

404
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,200
Hello, what's going on?

405
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,960
It's 10pm, why aren't you home yet?

406
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,320
Staying at your house, okay?

407
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Your father?

408
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,840
Whose voice is that?

409
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,840
Is that Dam's voice?

410
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,840
Can you not guess? I'm playing a game, okay?

411
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,360
What's that sound?

412
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,360
That's the sound of hitting the jackpot, winning 2,000 baht.

413
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,720
Dead, Ms. Dao came.

414
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,560
What to do?

415
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,800
Get dressed quickly.

416
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,840
Get dressed first, I'll take you out the back door.

417
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,160
Dam.

418
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,520
Dam.

419
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,920
Where is Dam?

420
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,560
Go upstairs and hide.

421
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,280
Dam.

422
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,880
Dam.

423
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,800
Ms. Dao.

424
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,160
When did Ms. Dao come?

425
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,360
You just arrived.

426
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,360
I brought you cake.

427
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,040
The cake is so delicious that I want you to try it.

428
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,760
I'm afraid if you leave it too long it will lose its taste.

429
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
You should come by and give it to me.

430
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,280
You're so adorable.

431
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,400
Thank you.

432
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,240
But Dao doesn't need to work so hard.

433
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,240
What are you doing?

434
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,520
I'm getting ready to take a shower

435
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,000
then go to sleep, have to shoot early tomorrow morning.

436
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,920
But...

437
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,240
Sister... Are you tired today, Ms. Dao?

438
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,480
Or should we go home and rest?

439
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,640
It's late now.

440
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,200
I'm planning on sleeping here.

441
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,200
Sleep here?

442
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
What's up? What's wrong?

443
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,320
It's nothing, sister. Just...

444
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,040
The bedroom is a bit messy.

445
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,840
I found the room dirty too.

446
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,840
It's been almost a month since the room was cleaned.

447
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,080
Or...

448
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,840
If I stay over, can Ms. Dao sleep in the guest room?

449
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,960
No need to worry.

450
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
I will sleep with you.

451
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,360
No, sleep in your room.

452
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
No matter how dirty it is, it's not so bad that you can't sleep.

453
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,400
Ms. Dao.

454
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Ms. Dao.

455
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,640
My room is really messy.

456
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,120
Do you really want to sleep in my room?

457
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
I'm not someone who gets dirty too much.

458
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,520
The room probably isn't very dirty.

459
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,800
It's really messy, Ms. Dao.

460
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,240
Ms. Dao.

461
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,920
What is Ms. Dao looking for?

462
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,000
Are not.

463
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,200
Just wanted to see

464
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Is the room really as messy as you say?

465
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,560
I don't see anything messy.

466
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,360
Yes.

467
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,160
What's wrong?

468
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,600
Are your clothes still here?

469
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,160
I remember leaving a lot of things here.

470
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,360
It's true that it's still here.

471
00:29:42,036 --> 00:29:46,196
THE ROSE OF SIN
