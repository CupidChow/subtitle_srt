1
00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:01,353
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,785
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,640
 In the movie,

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,640
Linin has many husbands, right?

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,680
What period of time has Thong experienced in his life?

6
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,520
but can play the role so well?

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,760
Thong has a lover,

8
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,200
a lot of people.

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,320
But...

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,840
Get to know each person at each stage.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,160
Didn't see anything strange at all.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,520
Ms. Yem is also a beautiful person.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,240
must have passed through the hands of men,

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,400
Have you ever experienced having many lovers?

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,840
Also met a few people.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,960
But probably not as much as Thong.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,200
Alright.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,680
First part

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,320
We have already started.

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,160
Wait to see the next part.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,840
Yem is sure there are many interesting stories.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,560
See you again.

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,800
Thong.

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,160
Why be so bold?

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,560
The movie was bold enough.

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,640
The audience will hate it.

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
You know.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,640
I represent many brands.

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,400
If exposed

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,080
It will cost a few million baht.

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,200
Next segment,

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,640
a little gentle.

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,360
Lest the audience hate it.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,360
Real people

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,520
Even more fake than in the movie.

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,520
Thai actress begins

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,640
Stop playing the cute role.

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,040
Start opening the "Thongprakai fandom".

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,240
I will register first.

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,240
What are you reading?

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,240
Twitter.

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,800
Do you know that the show's audience likes me as this person?

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
You should follow the trend.

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,800
Show me.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,800
Fight without caring what anyone thinks.

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,360
This is my idol.

47
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,080
I think just being yourself is best.

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,480
But if you act, one day you will be exposed.

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Whoever can accept it will accept it. If not, that's it.

50
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,120
Ms. Dao.

51
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,120
On Twitter it looks

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,680
People like Thong to answer boldly like that.

53
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
Should we change our plans?

54
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,840
No need.

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,200
I believe that the next segment,

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,320
What we have prepared will only reveal its corruption.

57
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm looking for a site that writes really well.

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,760
I got it.

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,240
Yem made sure to push it straight into the hole.

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,960
Okay,

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,720
Let's go back and chat with Thong, Thongprakai.

62
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,560
Now Yem has a special guest to surprise Thong.

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,480
Can Thong guess who it is?

64
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,040
I don't know anymore.

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,800
Can you reveal it too?

66
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,720
Lazy to guess.

67
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,600
Alright.

68
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,560
If so

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,680
then we will meet together

70
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,160
My special guest, Thong.

71
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,560
Please sit down.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,720
Hello Ms. Wana,

73
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,320
Hello Ms. Ruedee.

74
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,160
Please introduce yourself.

75
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,560
My name is Wana.

76
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,760
As Wirachay's mother,

77
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,160
Thong's ex-lover.

78
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,280
My name is Ruedee,

79
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,640
is Montra's mother,

80
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,120
Thong's ex-husband.

81
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,920
So today,

82
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,120
Is your son coming with you?

83
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,520
Don't come.

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
The son of the two of us

85
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,600
are all dead.

86
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,600
And no need to ask

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
is to die for nothing.

88
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,600
Die

89
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
because of this child.

90
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
Oh! Really? What's wrong?

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,240
First of all, the program side would like to express our condolences to the two girls.

92
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,360
Can you tell?

93
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,120
Please allow me from the program side.

94
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,680
Tell me what happened to your child.

95
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,960
It happened a long time ago.

96
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
Talking about it now doesn't make any sense.

97
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,680
Thong believes it is Mr. Wi

98
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,080
and Mont

99
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,040
I probably don't want you two to put this on the news.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,720
But I will say it.

101
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,840
And I will say it so it can be published.

102
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,600
And I'll say it out loud too, what's wrong?

103
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,040
My son, Wirachay,

104
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,040
is this child's husband.

105
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,520
And this one

106
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,720
solicit my son's money, capture my son

107
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,760
Go buy expensive items for it.

108
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,440
But what it paid off for my son was

109
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,840
it has...

110
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,880
Bo. How?

111
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,280
Surprised?

112
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,960
But it's not over yet.

113
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,560
She had a boyfriend, then she left her boyfriend

114
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,120
kill her husband too.

115
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,080
Oh, dead!

116
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,120
Incorrect.

117
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,560
Mom also knows well

118
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,000
that Thong was not the one who sent Yai to kill Mr. Wi.

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,720
You shut up!

120
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,040
I don't know

121
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
You give it or you don't give it,

122
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,200
What I know is that my son died because of you.

123
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,400
Ms. Wana calm down, sit down first.

124
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Miss Ruedee, please.

125
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,920
No need to invite anything.

126
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,440
I will tell everything.

127
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,680
Sit down.

128
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,960
I'll tell you.

129
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,760
At my son

130
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,760
in the hospital,

131
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,200
Do you know what this woman does?

132
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,160
She's going to be a concubine.

133
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,960
Come to boss Bun.

134
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,480
That's right, she became a concubine. Clap your hands, clap your hands.

135
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,360
Never returned to take care of my son until he died.

136
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,760
That's all I want to say.

137
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,760
If I said more I would feel it

138
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
very dirty mouth.

139
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,760
Yes. Miss Ruedee, please.

140
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,560
Thong used to be a member of the harem

141
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,040
by Inspector Mit.

142
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,640
And my son

143
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,800
helped her escape.

144
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,960
Thong lied at first

145
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,280
to stay

146
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,440
in my house.

147
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,080
Until I know the truth

148
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,080
I kicked Thong out of the house.

149
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,600
But my son doesn't agree.

150
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,680
He loves this woman very much.

151
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,240
And this woman

152
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,280
caused us two to quarrel.

153
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,560
Causes the family to fall apart.

154
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,720
Mom, stop talking.

155
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,480
Thong doesn't want to think about that anymore.

156
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,360
Let me tell you everything.

157
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
My son

158
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,560
and Ruedee's son

159
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Everyone died because of this one.

160
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,160
This woman,

161
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,680
Anyone who marries her will have bad luck.

162
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,560
If you get caught by it, your life will be full of bad luck.

163
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,240
You are a murderer, you killed our two sons,

164
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,360
child Thong.

165
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,360
Can you shut up?

166
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,280
I've been disgusted with your mouth for a long time, old woman.

167
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,760
Who are you calling an old woman?

168
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,920
I curse you.

169
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,960
Son Thong.

170
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,560
Are you cursing me?

171
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,880
I curse you.

172
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,600
Stop it.

173
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,560
- Thong, stop. - That's enough.

174
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,080
Thong, stop.

175
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,720
- Thong, stop. - Give me back my child.

176
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,600
Stop broadcasting the show.

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,760
- Let go. - You said that, right?

178
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,880
Is to behave properly.

179
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,520
What now?

180
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,080
- It's all a big deal. - So what do you want me to do?

181
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,760
She scolded and beat me like that.

182
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,440
Do you still want me to kneel and apologize to her?

183
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,240
Thong. Thong can do anything.

184
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Pretend to cry, or pretend to faint.

185
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,520
It's okay to pretend to be crazy.

186
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
But don't jump up and strangle someone like that.

187
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
There you go, I see it.

188
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,640
I'm Thong.

189
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,720
I'm Thong.

190
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,040
- Let's go quickly. - Why do you have to go?

191
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,120
- I didn't do anything wrong. - Let's do a little interview.

192
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,600
Don't be stubborn anymore.

193
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,360
- I'm Thong. - Hurry up.

194
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,240
- Let's do a little interview. - Let go.

195
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,880
- Miss Thong. - Hey, hurry up.

196
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,320
Dear Thong.

197
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,600
I told you not to come.

198
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
When it comes, something like this will happen.

199
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Older sister.

200
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,520
I said it already, right?

201
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,360
That if we have a chance to expose her, we must expose her.

202
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
So what do you think?

203
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,480
I want her to have good things,

204
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,120
Living such a smooth life?

205
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,120
But the exposure is over

206
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,720
Is there anything better?

207
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,800
Exposing a girl's dark story for the whole country to see.

208
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,520
Older sister,

209
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,520
The people who suffer the most are us.

210
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Miss.

211
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,920
Please prepare to participate in the program.

212
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,080
Yem will leave you two alone

213
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,520
tell long stories,

214
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,680
that from the beginning, how did your son know Thong?

215
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
What is it like when we go on a date?

216
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,960
and talked for a long time until her son died.

217
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,720
That's enough.

218
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,680
Older sister.

219
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,120
Very happy

220
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,400
when exposing other people's pain, right?

221
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,720
Miss.

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,160
Calm down first.

223
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,080
The story is that Dao wants to tell to share an example,

224
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,280
Let viewers be careful with a woman like Thong.

225
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
Her story

226
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
It will be useful to many people.

227
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,040
Older sister,

228
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,480
If you still want to tell your son's story

229
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,800
It's like digging up your son's body

230
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,320
to expose mid-show,

231
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,320
to become a joke in people's mouths.

232
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,960
If you want to do it

233
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,240
then invite you,

234
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760
I won't do it anymore.

235
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,400
Miss.

236
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,160
It's OK.

237
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,400
No need to chase.

238
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,000
So what about you?

239
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,880
Do you want to continue the interview?

240
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
This is the only chance

241
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,440
to make everyone know how bad Thong is.

242
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,480
Please forgive the audience.

243
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,760
There was a small incident

244
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,440
This caused a conversation between Thong and his two sisters

245
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,680
must be temporarily canceled in advance.

246
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,120
But it's okay,

247
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,400
Yem will definitely be watching anyway

248
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,160
and update news for everyone to know.

249
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,760
Okay, now,

250
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,880
Let's see some news about Chris,

251
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,160
Our super handsome male lead is better.

252
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,760
I'm Thong.

253
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,920
If Thong wants to say something

254
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,280
then please.

255
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,840
What is she doing?

256
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,640
She feels guilty.

257
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,920
Wanting to tell the truth to end everything.

258
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,400
I think so

259
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,400
She has nothing to lose anymore.

260
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,640
The story has already broken, let it break.

261
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
Thong has six husbands,

262
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,160
four people died.

263
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,800
Thong doesn't want them to die.

264
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,440
But maybe it's fate,

265
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,720
or something unknown.

266
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,520
Life passes

267
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,000
along with each husband

268
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,520
there is good and there is bad.

269
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,560
But most are bad.

270
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,680
There is also Thong's fault in there,

271
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,120
It's also their fault.

272
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,120
It comes back like that.

273
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,440
Thong believes that everyone has done wrong.

274
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,440
There's no need to be shy,

275
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,040
just accept it.

276
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,640
Because it's part of who we are.

277
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,280
If anyone has ever had a wound,

278
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,680
stains in life

279
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,640
then we are friends.

280
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,040
Ms. Dao.

281
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,040
- Sir... - Did my father call?

282
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,040
That's right.

283
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,040
He told me to come see him right now.

284
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,880
Dad.

285
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,880
I say,

286
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,280
Why do you do that?

287
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,880
Thong secretly went back and forth with Dam,

288
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,240
I want to destroy her, not give her a place to stand.

289
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,320
If you think you'll ruin all the girls

290
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,680
Back and forth with Dam

291
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,400
it is very time consuming.

292
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,840
Use that time to do something useful.

293
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,840
This is bullshit.

294
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,880
Dad, do you think my feelings are nonsense?

295
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,680
It stole my lover

296
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
while you treat him so well.

297
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
I cannot look at immoral people

298
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,920
betray your child

299
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,520
Then you can be the main female lead of the station like that, dad.

300
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,000
For me, this is a big deal.

301
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,440
Our company's profits are the big deal.

302
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
You know right?

303
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,920
Since this movie premiered,

304
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,240
sponsors

305
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,880
come to the long queue

306
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,280
That's on par with all three movies combined.

307
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,640
We are a public company,

308
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,120
People don't care who cheats with whom.

309
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,120
They just care

310
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,680
to the profit chart

311
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,880
Just on that board.

312
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,840
So what about me, dad?

313
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,840
Does anyone care about me?

314
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
So here's dad.

315
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,360
Listen.

316
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,840
Dad's looking for someone to take care of Thong's affairs for you.

317
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,840
The next movie that Thong stars in,

318
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,440
You and he won't have to see each other anymore.

319
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,760
See?

320
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,480
Trouble will not happen.

321
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,760
That's all the problem is gone.

322
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,080
It's not over, dad.

323
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,400
It will never end

324
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,080
while Dam is still alive.

325
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,400
It is the source of all problems.

326
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,760
Did you know? Every time I see it

327
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,280
I cry because of Dam,

328
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Dad is so bored.

329
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,280
I'm so bored.

330
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,046
Dao, people are not wrong even if they are stupid.

331
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,120
But don't be stupid for too long.

332
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,440
Practice being smart quickly.

333
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,200
Alright.

334
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,880
If you want to cry, just cry.

335
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,160
In Dad's room, just cry.

336
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,120
But get out

337
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,800
Don't cry so no one can see.

338
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,680
It's so embarrassing.

339
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,680
Dad, let me tell you,

340
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,320
This matter has been resolved.

341
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,920
Dad will talk to Ice.

342
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,680
Thong that I know

343
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,960
is a very cute person.

344
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,960
With what happened yesterday,

345
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
I find her to be a very courageous person

346
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,480
and very strong.

347
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,480
I want to invite my friends together to comfort Thong

348
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,800
with telling stories about yourself in the past

349
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,080
ever made a mistake.

350
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,200
And add hashtags

351
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,440
"Friend Thongprakai".

352
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,160
This!

353
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,520
Thong!

354
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,800
Have you seen Twitter yet?

355
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,000
Not yet.

356
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Don't want to see, don't want to know anything.

357
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,720
Let's give it a try.

358
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,560
I watched it yesterday, it was beyond my imagination.

359
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,120
Everyone supported and comforted me a lot.

360
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,440
- Really? - Really, look at it.

361
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,160
Let's see for a bit.

362
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,800
I thought

363
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,800
Maybe it's because of the video that Chris shot

364
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,120
That's why everyone comforted me so much.

365
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,440
And even make a project hashtag

366
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,600
"friend Thongprakai" too.

367
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,680
I think

368
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,000
this project

369
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,280
Used to advertise for the station.

370
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,920
[The truth is revealed, Thongprakai is not a bad person]

371
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,360
[Mr. Chris revealed that Thongprakai has a sweet personality]

372
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,160
This is true.

373
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,200
They all understand, right?

374
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,440
That I'm not such a bad person.

375
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,600
That's right.

376
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,040
Every human being has never made mistakes,

377
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,440
That's why everyone understands and sympathizes with me.

378
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,160
This.

379
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,720
But

380
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,280
after that

381
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,400
Don't be subjective.

382
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,400
Whatever you do, you have to be careful.

383
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,840
People all over the country are paying attention to her.

384
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,680
Hello?

385
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,160
Yes, okay.

386
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,280
I will come in quickly.

387
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,080
Thong!

388
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,080
Mr. Phaithun called to meet.

389
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,080
Besides,

390
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,080
Going with Dam and Ms. Dao.

391
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,320
Okay, we all need to talk about this

392
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,840
only then will it end.

393
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,240
I don't like leaving unfinished business unresolved like this.

394
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Whoever starts, let's start, but please speak quickly

395
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,240
because I don't have free time all day. Let's get started.

396
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,840
Thong started giving.

397
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,200
Ms. Dao.

398
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,400
Thong apologizes to you.

399
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,560
Thong had nothing to explain other than apologizing.

400
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,760
To solve the problem,

401
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,280
Thong will have nothing to do with Mr. Dam anymore.

402
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,880
For other movies, let another director come and make them.

403
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,160
Let everyone have peace of mind.

404
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,480
How are you, Dao? Is that Okay?

405
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,080
Dam.

406
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,560
It's your turn, if you want to say something, just say it.

407
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,200
Ms. Dao.

408
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,800
I'm really sorry.

409
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,840
Sorry Thong again.

410
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,840
I'm sorry, Mr. Phaithun.

411
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,200
Everything happens

412
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,280
It's my fault.

413
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,040
This will be an important lesson in my life.

414
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,240
I promise

415
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,640
I won't behave like this anymore.

416
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,120
Dao, do you have anything to say?

417
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,120
What else can Dao say?

418
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,840
Apart from being okay and forgiving.

419
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,640
Thong, even though you betrayed me,

420
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,520
In front of her, she appears to be a good sister,

421
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,560
but behind her back she secretly had an affair with her lover

422
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,000
It's okay, I forgive you.

423
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,160
Because he is a good boss, he takes work as the basis.

424
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,600
Dam.

425
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,480
Even though you lied to me countless times,

426
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,440
but you always forgive,

427
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,520
So why not forgive this time?

428
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,760
If there's a next time, it's okay.

429
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,960
I will continue to forgive.

430
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,280
That's it, right? Things people want to hear from Dao.

431
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm satisfied with everything.

432
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,040
Dao is that kind of person.

433
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,680
Give her some time and she'll be better.

434
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,240
But what's important,

435
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,040
You two listen carefully,

436
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,880
Don't let something like this happen again.

437
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,480
Remember, it won't be personal

438
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,080
But it will become a community issue.

439
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,640
Got it?

440
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,840
Yes.

441
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,440
Come in.

442
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,920
Mr. Prajak is waiting in conference room number two.

443
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,360
Dissolve.

444
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,840
Thong.

445
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,840
I think

446
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,720
Wait until things calm down.

447
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,800
Let's talk about anything later.

448
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,080
It's already this noisy and you still won't stop?

449
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,480
What kind of person are you?

450
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,480
Don't you feel guilty at all?

451
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,680
I didn't expect there to be such a miserable man like you in this world.

452
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,120
When someone like you loves someone, they truly love you.

453
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,600
If you love, you will be faithful and wholehearted.

454
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,560
Come on.

455
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,400
This.

456
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,600
If you have anything, please contact me later.

457
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,960
I feel really sorry for Ms. Dao.

458
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,120
I hope that one day, Ms. Dao will realize it

459
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,560
and get rid of shitty men like you.

460
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,840
My love, please come in.

461
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,160
Why are you standing here?

462
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,360
I'll stay with you.

463
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,440
Dam. If you did something wrong

464
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,400
or how Dam wants her to change

465
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,240
Damn, just tell me, I'm ready to change.

466
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,280
Ms. Dao doesn't have to

467
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,720
Adjust or change anything.

468
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,920
As long as you're still as good to me as you are now

469
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,240
is already very good.

470
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,200
I love the person Dao is now.

471
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,880
So when will you be nice to me?

472
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,240
so I can love you 100%?

473
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,600
Ms. Dao. I promised Dao.

474
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,240
This is the last time, I won't do it again.

475
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,280
Your promise is no longer valid, Dam.

476
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,440
It's been many times, and each time I promise it will be the last time.

477
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,960
You need something to reassure you

478
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,200
that this will not happen again.

479
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,480
Okay.

480
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,360
That means actions are more important than words, right?

481
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,680
So Ms. Dao just wait and see, someone like me

482
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,960
can really change.

483
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,840
Hey.

484
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,520
But just now I was planning to kiss Thong.

485
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,440
I saw it from the camera.

486
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,040
Yes.

487
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,200
It was just a final kiss goodbye.

488
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,280
I'm just doing it out of courtesy.

489
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,840
Ms. Dao.

490
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,960
I no longer have any thoughts about Thong anymore.

491
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,160
Hey.

492
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Don't think too much, Ms. Dao.

493
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,160
Okay.

494
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,080
So I'll wait and see.

495
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,920
If this happens again, maybe it will make me smarter.

496
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,120
There are some games that you can't win if you play forever

497
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,360
Then you should not continue playing.

498
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,880
Yes.

499
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,040
I just found out that there is an actress coming to live with you here.

500
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,000
If you hadn't said it, I probably wouldn't have known.

501
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,040
You said you had nothing to do with people in the company.

502
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,200
No, really he has nothing real.

503
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,800
Thong was not at home, so he let her stay here temporarily.

504
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,160
And don't sleep in the same room, Jang.

505
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,760
I trust you.

506
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,640
You now are the same as you were six years ago

507
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,280
are two different people.

508
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
You also see that I'm trying, right?

509
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,360
Try to let our family of three

510
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,280
return to live together like before.

511
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,920
Please believe me.

512
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,000
I... still need time to accept.

513
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,480
Chicha, be good.

514
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,320
Mom will come pick me up on Sunday.

515
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,160
Yes, mom, hello mom.

516
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,640
Let me see you off.

517
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,480
Oh.

518
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,160
Thong, this is Jang, Chicha's mother.

519
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,640
Jang, this is Thong.

520
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,920
Hello.

521
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
Hello.

522
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,280
I watched your interview program the other day.

523
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Thank you.

524
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,280
Either way...

525
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,720
Don't do such actions in front of Chicha.

526
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,400
I don't want her to absorb bad things.

527
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,240
Please rely on me.

528
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,880
Jang, let me see you off to the alley to catch a taxi.

529
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,280
Thong, please send it to Chicha.

530
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,520
You're so good, both mom and dad are worried.

531
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,880
Dolls are also a lot to play with.

532
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,720
When she was young,

533
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,880
If you want to play with toys, you have to go to your house.

534
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,600
If not, wait for someone to give it to you.

535
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,160
So, will Thong come here to play with me?

536
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,880
Please help me name this doll, it doesn't have a name yet.

537
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,640
Can I name it Thongdee?

538
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,920
Thongdee, the name sounds so funny.

539
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,560
Why is the name Thongdee?

540
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,440
Her old name is Thongdee,

541
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,560
then changed back to Thongprakai.

542
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,440
I think this doll is beautiful like you,

543
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,440
Should name it Thongdee, do you think it looks similar?

544
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,120
I don't see the resemblance, there is another doll

545
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,160
Much more similar to me, exactly the same.

546
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,800
Does the doll look exactly like you?

547
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,840
Where?

548
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,080
In the storage room, it's this high.

549
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,920
Where?

550
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,600
Where?

551
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,400
Here, the doll with Ms. Thong's face.

552
00:30:56,413 --> 00:31:00,526
THE ROSE OF SIN
