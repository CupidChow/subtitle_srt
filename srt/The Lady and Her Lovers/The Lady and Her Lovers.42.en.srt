THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,200
 Hello Thong.

4
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,000
He decided to film the video at this time

5
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,760
because when you get older than this it might not be appropriate to watch.

6
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,560
So he filmed while he still had some beauty.

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,840
Maybe the lawyer has already announced the will to you.

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,560
No need to be surprised because I left everything to you.

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,920
Because I want to repay the kindness you showed me.

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,320
The other day, when I opened the clip

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,520
an old man slipped in the bathroom to show you,

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,720
I also remind you that

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,280
Be careful of slipping.

14
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,840
After that, I went to buy anti-slip sheets to stick all over the bathroom,

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,840
He even asked a worker to come and install a railing for him to hold on to.

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,360
His wife and children have never done something like this for him.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,640
And yesterday, when Ben hit me,

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,920
Let me know who I should love.

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,040
Someday maybe I'll leave this world before you,

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,960
But I'm sure I'll still live a long time.

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
It's my money, use it to the fullest.

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,880
Born in one lifetime

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,160
then live your happiest life.

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,680
See you in the next life, Thong.

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,120
Hope we will meet again

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,000
and be each other's first.

27
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,920
Do you agree?

28
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,440
Miss Thong.

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,000
Daytime food and dinner have already been prepared in the refrigerator.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,640
Miss Thong, do you need anything else?

31
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,440
No need. Thank you.

32
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,440
The two of you should hurry up or you'll be late for the bus.

33
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,320
So happy Songkran day.

34
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,160
Yes.

35
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,000
Wait a minute, I almost forgot.

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,960
This is a teddy bear

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,520
and some money sent to the children at home.

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,040
Thank you Ms. Thong.

39
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,760
Thank you.

40
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,520
Please go.

41
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,640
Hello ma'am.

42
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,000
Ms. Thongprakai, the car is ready.

43
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,200
Stop here.

44

[Mrs. Gim's Restaurant]

45
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,120
What to buy?

46
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,920
- Mom. - Thong.

47
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,040
Mom isn't dead yet?

48
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,480
Are you disappointed?

49
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,520
I also want to die, why live?

50
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,920
Since the date

51
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,040
You pushed me down the stairs and ran away with a guy.

52
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
But I'm not dead.

53
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,400
Why did Pete's dad say mom was dead?

54
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,400
I told him to tell you that.

55
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,760
I don't want anything to do with you anymore.

56
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,040
If I had a bad child like you, it would be better if I didn't have one.

57
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,960
Go away, don't let me see your face again.

58
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,360
Mom.

59
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,800
You don't need to call me mom anymore.

60
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,360
Great blessing, now you are the boss.

61
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,360
I saw your news.

62
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,760
The minister's husband and his ex-wife are both dead.

63
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
So you get the entire inheritance.

64
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,240
Don't come back.

65
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,200
Don't claim to be related to me.

66
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,120
I don't want you to lose your reputation.

67
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,800
You go.

68
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
I don't want my miserable life to be entangled with you.

69
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,320
You go, go now.

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,560
It's been a long time.

71
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,240
Mom, don't be angry with me anymore.

72
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,320
Over the past few years, I've realized it

73
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,360
no matter how cruel a mother is to her child

74
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,280
The mother is also the one who raises the child.

75
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,840
Mother raised her children to adulthood.

76
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,160
Without mothers, there would be no children today.

77
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

78
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,040
Don't cry anymore.

79
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,880
Now that you realize it, it's too late.

80
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,120
Because I hate you to the core.

81
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,240
I still remember the day you left me lying dead like a homeless ghost.

82
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,120
Now that you realize it, you can't erase karma.

83
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,400
I don't want to erase karma.

84
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,320
I just want to do the right thing.

85
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,640
I know that I've done a lot of bad things to you lately.

86
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,840
At that time I was young, that's all I could think of.

87
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,640
You've been gone for the past 10 years

88
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,160
should enlighten you, right?

89
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,800
Since I left this house,

90
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,520
I don't know what happened to you.

91
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,800
If mom knew, maybe she would laugh at my misfortune.

92
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,720
Experiences of the past 10 years

93
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,280
make me realize

94
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,320
what I need in this life

95
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,840
is a peaceful life

96
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,400
and don't have to fight with anyone.

97
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,320
Mom.

98
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,680
My life has started to get a lot better.

99
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,520
Mom, come live with me.

100
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,680
So when your life happily flourishes,

101
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,720
Have you ever thought of me?

102
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Now you have no one left

103
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,720
then came back to find me.

104
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,720
Do you think I will come back to live with you?

105
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,800
I'm not going anywhere, Thong.

106
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Here is the medicine, the doctor said to take it as usual, and then there will be a follow-up appointment next month.

107
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,040
Yes, write it down and remember to come and take me there.

108
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,120
100 baht sold out today.

109
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,200
What? Is it 100 baht just to pick up medicine?

110
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,760
Last time it was 80 baht.

111
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,480
Because gas prices have increased, I have to get more.

112
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,640
Besides, I have to wake up at 5 am

113
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,680
to go to the hospital to get medicine for you.

114
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
Let me pay you.

115
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,800
I don't have any change.

116
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,640
Take it all.

117
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,640

118
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,600
Mom, please come live with me.

119
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,680
Mom, do you know? Now I have a very big house,

120
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,800
There's someone else there, Mom. Much more comfortable.

122

No, I won't come back to live with you.

to the point of my bones, to the point where I don't want to see your face again for the rest of my life.

I don't want to see your face.

142

The more I know that my mother is like this, it's because of me

143
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,040
Mother should come and stay with her child.

thicker than the sins you committed.

If I come to stay with you

162

That means I've erased all your bad karma.

00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,280
Request three maids

181
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,880
Come clean once a week.

182
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,880
Address as I sent the message.

183
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,960
In the house there was an old person who was disabled.

184
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,040
If anything unusual happens, please let me know quickly.

185
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,120
Yes, thank you.

186
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,520
Sir, please stop the car first.

187
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,080
Wait a minute.

188
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,960
Take it slow.

189
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,680
This.

190
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,120
What are you doing?

191
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,800
There is a woman with a similar face to the artist

192
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,200
Please bring your items and place them here.

193
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,520
Is it Mrs. Gim's house?

194
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,720
Yes, that's right.

195
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,720
So that's the right house.

196
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,680
Whose child is this?

197
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, so cute!

198
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,920
Why are you here?

199
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,960
The customer's child came to see Ms. Thong.

200
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,960
She's going to the bathroom, what a cute kid!

201
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Hello!

202
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,840
That's my child, Thong.

203
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,000
Sister Si!

204
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,160
Sister Si!

205
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,160
Sister Si!

206
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,560
Oh, why are you so happy, Thong?

207
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,880
That's the way things are, sister.

208
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,000
I got this house simply.

209
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,560
And many other assets.

210
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,080
So much that I don't even know how much.

211
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,440
That's good too.

212
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,080
So why do you have to sit and be so depressed?

213
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,800
You're really strange.

214
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,040
When you don't have it, complain about wanting it.

215
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
but when it does, it's dissatisfying.

216
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,280
What else do you want?

217
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
What else do you want?

218
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,240
I asked myself the same thing, sister.

219
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,240
But I also can't get an answer about what I want.

220
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,760
What do people want more than to eat well and sleep warmly?

221
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Even now, I try to do something,

222
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Try to keep yourself busy

223
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,240
I still feel lonely when I'm alone.

224
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,320
This is the situation, I think

225
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,120
You should find a new husband and let it go.

226
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,560
Sister, I don't want anymore.

227
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,040
Lately, I've used men as stepping stones

228
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,280
let yourself be happy.

229
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,320
But now, men no longer mean anything to me.

230
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,400
But I'm not sure, I'm not even 30 yet.

231
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,080
I also don't know what the future holds.

232
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,840
But whatever it is, it will come, I'm ready to face it.

233
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,800
That woman is lucky to have a good husband.

234
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,880
Had a happy ending since I was young.

235
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,840
Who said that?

236
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
I broke up with David.

237
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,640
Huh?

238
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,800
If so, do you raise your child alone?

239
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,440
That's right.

240
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,480
But I think

241
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,080
I can't support it anymore.

242
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,240
The thing is... three months ago,

243
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,360
I went to the doctor

244
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
and the doctor told me it was

245
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,400
I got cancer because of food.

246
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,560
And as it spreads,

247
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,320
David said goodbye to me and took me back to Thailand.

248
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,200
Damn Western name, that name...

249
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,920
There's no need to curse him.

250
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,840
He wants a wife because he wants happiness.

251
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,800
Who wants an extra burden, right?

252
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,640
I came to see you today

253
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,760
Because I understand clearly that I won't live much longer.

254
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,320
So I want to give my baby to you.

255
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,640
Sister Si, don't say that.

256
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,720
You have to get better, come stay with me.

257
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,800
I will pay all your hospital bills, okay?

258
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,040
No need, Thong.

259
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,560
The doctor said I didn't have much longer to live.

260
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,240
I'm just trying to cope with the situation so I can continue living.

261
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,200
No, I don't accept.

262
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,320
I will find the best doctor to treat you

263
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,600
until she is completely cured.

264
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,280
I refuse to let you go anywhere.

265
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,400
I have lost the person I love so much.

266
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,360
I can't lose any more of you.

267
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,240
Sister Si, please live with me. Don't leave me.

268
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,000
Thong, listen.

269
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,920
The two of us have been through a lot.

270
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,680
I love you.

271
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,040
I don't want to throw you and the baby away,

272
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,920
But whatever happens, will happen.

273
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,960
No need to hold back.

274
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,960
She is someone who loves children.

275
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,600
I know.

276
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,200
I know she will raise her children very well. Thong.

277
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,040
I will nurture the baby well

278
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,240
like my child.

279
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,360
You don't need to worry.

280
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,000
Human life has both luck and unluckiness.

281
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,400
And my past life

282
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,520
There are only more bad things than good things.

283
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,600
But I never gave up,

284
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,920
sometimes there is happiness, sometimes there is suffering but each time,

285
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,000
I also fight with my back against the wall

286
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,320
until today,

287
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,080
the day when a new chapter in my life begins

288
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,000
along with the word "mother".

289
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,960
You are my mother's child now.

290
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,720
I also don't know how to raise my child

291
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,120
because I've never been a mother either.

292
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,800
But I promise that you will have me by your side to help.

293
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,360
I won't let you get tired

294
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,800
fight alone like mother always has to do.

295
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,040
Because in the end no one knows the end of his life

296
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,880
What will it be like?

297
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:38,923
THE ROSE OF SIN

298
00:27:42,655 --> 00:27:46,595
THE ROSE OF SIN
