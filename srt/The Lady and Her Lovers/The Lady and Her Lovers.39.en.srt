1
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:01,373
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:39,744
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,400
Thongprakai Charity Foundation for children and youth

4
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,280
This is Thong's long-cherished plan.

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,840
Because if Thong has a chance

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,160
Thong wants to help children avoid violence.

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,560
Because childhood is a very fragile age.

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,320
Whether people grow up to become people with good qualities or not

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,800
is based on what they faced in their childhood.

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Thong wants all the children

11
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,040
I've had bad things happen in the past

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,520
Have a good future.

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,280
Ms. Thongprakai brought an 8 year old boy

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,480
filed a complaint against the boy's biological mother

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,720
for the crime of bringing her child into prostitution

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,840
for foreigners on Khao San Road.

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,640
Chairman of Thongprakai charity fund for children and youth

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,560
visited kindergarten students who were punished by their teachers

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,200
by banging his head on the board because he refused to eat vegetables

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,480
and refused to stand in the sun and salute the national flag.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,040
So coordinated with

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
Ministry of Social Development and Human Security

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,920
to continue resolving the case.

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,760
This charity fund is Thong's idea.

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,560
She said this is a project she has wanted to do for a long time.

26
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,400
I showed her some small ideas

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,760
and she wants to

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,880
If anything helps, please support her.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,160
I think that's good too. We humans

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,960
give each other a helping hand,

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
Whoever is good at something will help with that job.

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,160
Thus, society will become a place worth living.

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,120
Brother, you came at the right time.

34
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,640
Someone came to the website and asked if they wanted to donate to charity

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,240
And how to apply for a tax deduction receipt?

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,240
What is a tax deduction receipt?

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,600
It is like an invoice, used to reduce taxes.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,280
Actually, I don't need to do this.

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
I will ask Admin to handle it for you.

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,240
Just working in front of the media is tiring enough.

41
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,880
I don't want it. Thong wants to know everything.

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Anyone who asks anything can answer.

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,880
Here.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,640
Thank you.

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,200
So where did you get so many wraps?

46
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,320
I went to the area in Nong Khai,

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,880
The people there wrapped his waist around him.

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,080
Wrapped so much that it reached his chest.

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,640
Is this a good time? Where to go?

50
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,080
There are also people waiting for a warm welcome.

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,960
No need to hire people to clap like before.

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,160
Since I married you,

53
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,200
His popularity is getting better day by day.

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,680
What a pity,

55
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,920
I should have met you first Nong.

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,400
If I had met you before then, I would have been 8 years old,

57
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,680
I'm still helping my mother wash the dishes at the back of the house.

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,600
I should have been a little more stubborn,

59
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,200
to dare to refuse marriage

60
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,120
arranged by adults.

61
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,480
Then wait to see you.

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Thong also wanted him to be the first man

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,240
of Thong's life.

64
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,600
That way, Thong won't have to struggle

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,800
and made many mistakes.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,840
But we cannot turn back time.

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,560
At that time, I chose to do the best thing for my life.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,400
The best decision of his life

69
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,280
is to propose to Thong.

70
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,560
The best decision of Thong's life

71
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,040
is to accept his marriage proposal.

72
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,440
Can I have these towels please?

73
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,600
I want to make teddy bears for children.

74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,880
When bad things happen, children need friends by their side.

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,440
Okay, in a little while you'll receive a lot more.

76
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,040
But you also have to rest, don't work too much.

77
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,200
Don't get stressed and get sick.

78
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,040
Yes, dear.

79
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
You want to provoke me, right?

80
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,160
What did the lady say? What does Thong do?

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,960
I told you before

82
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,440
In this house, you have to dress properly.

83
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
It's not that wearing revealing clothes is so offensive.

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,080
If that's not called provocation, then what is?

85
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,280
Here is the swimming pool, Thong wants to swim.

86
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,960
Wearing something like that is appropriate for the venue, isn't it?

87
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,720
Only crazy people would do that in wearing traditional clothes to the swimming pool.

88
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,720
Lady, stop making trouble with Thong.

89
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,680
I'm not looking for trouble.

90
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,120
But she is not alone here.

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,240
Pay attention to other people's feelings.

92
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,560
Behaving so tactlessly, what if outsiders see?

93
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,080
Thong is at his own house, why should he care about anyone?

94
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,680
Then the person the lady said she saw was there

95
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,080
Who are you? Are you a lady?

96
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,680
If Thong's body

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,200
dirty the lady's eyes

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't look, ma'am.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,040
Or just sit and look at your wheelchair, that's it.

100
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,800
Ben.

101
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
This morning, please allow me to go into your room to clean up.

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,880
Yes, please go to work.

103
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,800
Hey lady.

104
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,640
My car's battery is about to run out, please help push me inside.

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,600
Let Thong go and ask Mr. Sai to replace the battery.

106
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Just push it, right now.

107
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,160
It's very hot outside at this hour.

108
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,560
Help!

109
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,440
- Mom! - Help!

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,040
- Mom! - Help!

111
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Lady!

112
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,440
- Help! - Mom!

113
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,760
- Mom! - Madam!

114
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,080
- Oh... - Mom.

115
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
- Oh. - Madam.

116
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,080
What to do?

117
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,120
What are you doing to my mother?

118
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,840
Thong did nothing.

119
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,440
Thong why do you do that?

120
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,760
What do you mean I intentionally harmed myself like that?

121
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,400
She was not happy when I reminded her about her dress.

122
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,480
That's the reason.

123
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,400
Thong doesn't think so

124
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,760
even Lady Jarai Wuthipawa

125
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,440
must also find a way to slander me like that.

126
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,080
If you're not satisfied with anything, just say it directly, it's all grown up.

127
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,440
Her acting ability is really smooth.

128
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,480
But it's a pity that the acting profession is not qualified.

129
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,360
Jack! If one day

130
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,600
I lay dead in a corner of the house

131
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,760
There's no need to hire an investigator to waste time.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,960
Because it was he who killed me.

133
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,160
Mom, there's no need to be afraid.

134
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,400
If anyone intends to kill you, I will kill them first.

135
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,080
Jake! You sleep with a murderer every night.

136
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,040
Aren't you scared at all?

137
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,960
Kick him out of the house immediately.

138
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,840
Enough, I think things have gone too far.

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,640
Her car may have problems.

140
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,080
Because of the short circuit, it caused her car to slide on its own like that.

141
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,440
That's all.

142
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,880
Thong is not that cruel.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,040
I'm the victim, here, see? This red wound is here.

144
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
You still don't believe me?

145
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,080
But you don't have any proof that I can believe it.

146
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,160
And with what I know about you and Thong,

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,520
I choose to trust Thong.

148
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,240
Go!

149
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,040
He chose to believe his child

150
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,400
We've only known each other for a few months longer than I have,

151
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,680
The person who slept with you for 20 years, Jak?

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,680
How!

153
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,560
Mom! Calm down.

154
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,280
Ben!

155
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,920
Ben saw it, right? That's Thong

156
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,400
She's a fake girl who only knows how to seduce men every day.

157
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,160
From the old father who is still sober

158
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,760
become blind and deaf.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,560
Ben has to stay away from that girl, you know?

160
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,200
Absolutely do not fall for it.

161
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,280
Yes, mom.

162
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,280
But just now Ben went to check the car,

163
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,840
The battery is not dead yet.

164
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,680
Open it and see.

165
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,560
[Marriage certificate]

166
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,320
This is the marriage certificate of me and Prajak.

167
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,760
Still valid by law until now.

168
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,200
But Mr. Jak has already divorced his wife, isn't that right?

169
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,920
And now he has registered his marriage with Thong.

170
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,040
How can this registration paper have all the legal effects?

171
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,520
What are you doing so crazy, Nong?

172
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,040
I'm not crazy.

173
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,600
Because I'm still completely awake

174
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,760
so I didn't sign.

175
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,520
What's wrong with you? Why don't you sign?

176
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,600
If I divorce you

177
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,200
The property that should belong to me and my children

178
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,240
will fall into the hands of her and her children.

179
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,680
Whatever you think, in the end it's about worrying about property.

180
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,320
How could it fall into someone else's hands?

181
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,360
If we divorce, the property will be divided in half according to the law.

182
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,480
As for Ben

183
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
shall enjoy the right of inheritance as an heir.

184
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,040
What else are you worried about?

185
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,400
Who knows?

186
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
When we divorced, it was me and Ben

187
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,720
could be kicked out of this house and become strangers.

188
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,720
And his new wife

189
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,760
will talk sweetly to you every day

190
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,720
until he gives her all his assets.

191
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,280
Why do you think that girl married you?

192
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,160
Because of love?

193
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,600
Surely you're not that naive, right?

194
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,520
I think you should drink some ginkgo to improve your brain function.

195
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,400
Now she is so paranoid that she has lost her mind.

196
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,640
I won't argue with you about this anymore.

197
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,120
If you refuse to divorce, I will sue.

198
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,800
Either way, she will lose.

199
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,880
If you successfully file for divorce

200
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,360
Then I don't need to care about you anymore, right?

201
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,680
What will you do?

202
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
For ten years I refused to appear in front of the media

203
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,200
I finally appeared.

204
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,160
I will be told what I have never said.

205
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,920
How bad our married life is.

206
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,480
I must be in a situation like this

207
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,840
there do i have?

208
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,440
Jak. He cares about his image more than anything else.

209
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,680
Because I threatened like that

210
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
so he didn't make me sign the divorce papers anymore.

211
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,160
Me and him

212
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,720
are still husband and wife

213
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,120
until today according to the law.

214
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,920
But Mr. Jak told Thong that he had divorced his wife.

215
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,720
Then he also asked Thong to register the marriage.

216
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,560
He said that this house is half Thong's.

217
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,080
Thong can stay in this house until he dies.

218
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,520
What did he mean by what he said?

219
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
That means he cheated on you.

220
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,560
The marriage certificate she signed

221
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,560
just a blank sheet of paper,

222
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Only valid for cleaning dog poop.

223
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,920
As for her position in this house

224
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,920
are just residents.

225
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,240
No rights to any property.

226
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,600
Not even a grain of soil is hers.

227
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,960
Incorrect.

228
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,680
Why did Jak do that? What's the point of tricking Thong?

229
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,160
Young girls want to eat old guys,

230
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,400
but could not keep up with his ruse.

231
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,040
Jak doesn't love you.

232
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,800
He just wants to take advantage of her popularity

233
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Just to increase my popularity.

234
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,880
In his eyes, she is just that

235
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,320
a beautiful but stupid girl who was taken advantage of.

236
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,600
I feel sorry for her.

237
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,280
So I told her the truth to open her eyes.

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,640
Thong, I'll bring you another towel.

239
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,680
Thong!

240
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,800
Thong?

241
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,240
Hey Sai.

242
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,720
Yes?

243
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,560
Have you seen Thong?

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,800
I don't know, you should try asking the lady.

245
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,240
Where did Nong and Thong go?

246
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,680
You go.

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,760
Try looking at some sports clubs,

248
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,760
or try some luxury pubs,

249
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,680
Maybe she's hanging out there.

250
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,840
Can you say it clearly?

251
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,680
What did Thong do there?

252
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,640
I told her we are not divorced yet.

253
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,800
And she also has no right to any of your property.

254
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,720
Upon hearing that,

255
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,640
She ran away from home immediately.

256
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,880
What do you say?

257
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,640
I'm not sure.

258
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,760
She's probably looking for new prey now.

259
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,200
Maybe some of your political friends,

260
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Or you should do business.

261
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Take turns using things,

262
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,040
You men probably don't care, right?

263
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,920
Shut up.

264
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,160
This doesn't end here, I'll come back to deal with you later.

265
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,240
I cannot contact Ms. Thong.

266
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
I think Ms. Thong blocked my number.

267
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,120
If so, then split up and find it.

268
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,560
When you find it, let me know immediately.

269
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,720
Yes.

270
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,440
I moved abroad with my husband.

271
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,080
His wife is dead. Please stay with your husband well.

272
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,440
Finally we are both lucky to have husbands.

273
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,240
Good luck, sister. Whenever you have free time, come visit me.

274
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,720
How are you? How are you?

275
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,640
I'm very healthy.

276
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,640
I have something good to tell you.

277
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,280
I have been pregnant for 5 months.

278
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,120
Huh? Really? Congratulations sister.

279
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,360
So what about you? When will I have a child with him?

280
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,400
Children will help keep your husband's heart.

281
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,840
He's busy with work and doesn't have much time.

282
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,280
But my relationship with him is still very good, you don't need to worry.

283
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,640
Then good.

284
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,120
I'll go first. Husband called me to dinner.

285
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes.

286
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,960
Hey you,

287
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,600
Is that some star? Looks like the name is Thong or something.

288
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,040
What star would sit on the side of the road like that?

289
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,200
It looks more like her husband left her.

290
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,280
Yes?

291
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Thong.

292
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,200
Let's go home. Mr. Prajak is looking for you everywhere.

293
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,200
Please go back and tell him that Thong will not return.

294
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,720
It's not Thong's house anymore,

295
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,240
Thong and he are nothing to each other.

296
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,760
Miss Thong.

297
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,840
But it's not good for Ms. Thong to sit here.

298
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,120
Can you go back to the hotel and rest first?

299
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,440
If there's something wrong, say it slowly.

300
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,720
He's very worried about you.

301
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,880
Worried about Thong

302
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,880
Or worried about votes?

303
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,840
Thong knew

304
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,000
that he was not sincere with Thong.

305
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,760
You knew it clearly yourself but still helped him deceive Thong?

306
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,680
I took my head out to make sure.

307
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,440
I followed him for a long time,

308
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,840
I dare to confirm that

309
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,240
He loves Ms. Thong the most.

310
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,240
I haven't seen him serious yet

311
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,320
and be honest with any woman like you.

312
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,640
Please believe me.

313
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,680
Let him explain to you himself.

314
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,760
Sometimes the words the lady said

315
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,160
it's not the truth.

316
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,000
Thong.

317
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,360
Why are you hiding from me like that?

318
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,000
If there's something wrong, why don't you tell me?

319
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,720
What about you? Will you tell me if there's something wrong?

320
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,960
You haven't divorced your wife yet, right?

321
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,600
Our marriage certificate also has no value, right?

322
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,800
That's not the case.

323
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,960
He is determined to divorce Nong.

324
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,720
But she still hasn't signed,

325
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,640
So I had to register my marriage with you first.

326
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,920
To make Nong sign the divorce papers

327
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,240
Then you will have to talk, which will take a long time

328
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,680
Only then can I marry you.

329
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,200
So why don't you tell Thong directly?

330
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,040
Why did you lie to Thong?

331
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,440
Because I love you so much.

332
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,240
I'm afraid

333
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,320
If you tell me frankly

334
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,640
then I won't marry you

335
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,920
so he had to lie.

336
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,880
You lied

337
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,480
But it's a lie with good intentions.

338
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,920
Thong, let's go back to our house.

339
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,720
I've been looking for you all day, I'm so tired.

340
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,880
That house is not Thong's house.

341
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,040
Thong has no status in that house at all.

342
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,920
The lady who owned that house also did not welcome Thong.

343
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,560
Thong doesn't have the courage to go back there.

344
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,000
But I welcome you, what are you afraid of?

345
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,560
I came to beg you like that, are you still angry with me?

346
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,520
What do you want me to do to stop being angry at you?

347
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,200
He must finalize the divorce with his wife

348
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,200
Only then will Thong believe

349
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,680
that he is sincere with Thong.

350
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,920
Okay, if you want it that way,

351
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,640
I will solve it quickly.

352
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,360
So I'll just stay here now.

353
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,720
Thank you for taking care of her.

354
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,240
Yes, sir.

355
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,200
Thong.

356
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,920
I really love you.

357
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,200
And never thought I would lie to you.

358
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,400
You don't need to worry about anything.

359
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,200
When will you divorce your wife?

360
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,080
then Thong believes,

361
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,120
Then Thong will return.

362
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,600
If you find a way to deceive Thong again

363
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,240
then Thong will leave him.

364
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,920
Mom, are you crying?

365
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,120
YES,

366
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,920
This afternoon, my mother argued with my father about Thong.

367
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,480
What's wrong, mom? What happened?

368
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,800
Mom only told Thong the truth

369
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,560
It's his father who registered a fake marriage with him.

370
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,240
When it learns it can't get anything from us

371
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,440
then he left home.

372
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,440
Then my father found out and came to scold my mother.

373
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,200
Ben, I want to know where I went wrong.

374
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,480
So did dad do anything to mom?

375
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,000
Do nothing.

376
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,960
Just say it out loud.

377
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,920
So why does mom suddenly use a scarf?

378
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,160
It's not cold, Mom.

379
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I feel a little cold,

380
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,680
I'm afraid I'll catch a cold so I protect myself in advance.

381
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,800
Don't, Ben.

382
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,880
Mom.

383
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,200
This is a sign of strangulation. Who did that?

384
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,720
It's nothing, don't worry.

385
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,800
I will go deal with him.

386
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,960
Ben, stop.

387
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,800
No matter how much Ben hated him

388
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,160
then he is also Ben's father.

389
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,520
Ben absolutely cannot do anything to your father.

390
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,920
As for the argument between mom and dad,

391
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,760
Ben just needs to know, but don't interfere.

392
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,400
But he did this to his mother.

393
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,400
How can you make me leave you alone?

394
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,920
If Ben still loves his mother, he must do it.

395
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,200
Promise mom.

396
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,240
Ben, I'm begging you.

397
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,000
- Sai, where is Nong? - Yes.

398
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,760
She's in her room.

399
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,840
Is Ben back yet?

400
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm back, still in my room.

401
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,520
Sign the divorce papers, don't make any more excuses.

402
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
I agree to sign as well.

403
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,680
But you have to promise me

404
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,120
that he did not bring Thong back to live in this house.

405
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,760
Can you do it?

406
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,760
If you hate her that much

407
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,880
So why don't you move out yourself?

408
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,320
When we finish dividing assets,

409
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,920
She went looking for a new place to live,

410
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,240
go live in a place where mother and child are comfortable.

411
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,400
This house is my home.

412
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,400
I won't move anywhere.

413
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,080
Next will be Ben's house.

414
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,120
I will not let this house fall into someone else's hands.

415
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,160
Especially that vile woman.

416
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,400
I'm really asking, what did Thong do to you?

417
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,320
Or are you jealous?

418
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,960
If you look like this, why be jealous anymore?

419
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,880
I'm not jealous.

420
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,440
So what is the reason why we cannot live in the same house?

421
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,680
Because I don't want anything disgusting to happen in this house.

422
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,000
Young stepmother and stepchild.

423
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,200
That's like fire and gasoline.

424
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
If we stay close together, things will happen.

425
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,720
Have you never thought about this?

426
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,720
What do you mean? What did Ben do?

427
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,640
She said immediately, what happened?

428
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,360
Now nothing has happened yet.

429
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,000
But if you still let Thong continue to live in our house

430
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,040
it's not certain.

431
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,840
So I stopped it before it happened.

432
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,920
How.

433
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,000
Ben.

434
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,480
What did you do Thong?

435
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,520
Doing what? Did nothing?

436
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,680
Don't lie.

437
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,960
Answer me, what did you do Thong?

438
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,720
It's okay to say it.

439
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,440
Your wife is so provocative,

440
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,120
Who can stand it?

441
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,480
What have you done to my wife?

442
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,640
What are you doing to my wife?

443
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,320
I haven't done anything yet.

444
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,240
I just looked at her, let me go.

445
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,440
Dad hit me, I didn't say anything.

446
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,640
But Dad strangled Mom, how could he do that?

447
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,480
Is your father so in love with his concubine that he dares to beat his wife and children?

448
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,680
Or is dad so crazy about girls that he's lost his mind?

449
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,680
Ben.

450
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,400
Oh.

451
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,520
- Stop. - Did you punch me?

452
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,440
Stop, stop.

453
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,960
Don't hit me anymore.

454
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,200
- Don't hit me anymore. - Did you hit me?

455
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,480
Sir, sir.

456
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,200
Ben.

457
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,480
Let me out.

458
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,040
- Let my baby go, it's hurting my baby. - Let me go.

459
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,320
Let go, I said let go.

460
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,960
Nong.

461
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,960
You raised your child to hate me, right?

462
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,600
What you want is like this, right?

463
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,920
Okay, from now on,

464
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,600
I won't consider you my wife anymore

465
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,920
And Ben, you're not my child anymore either.

466
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,560
Let me go, you damn thing.

467
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,320
Is Ben in a lot of pain?

468
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,480
Ben.

469
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,840
A bottle of white wine costs less than 100 baht,

470
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,640
A bottle of wine costs tens of thousands of baht.

471
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,400
After drinking, you are equally drunk,

472
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,080
but anyway

473
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,600
I also get drunk on expensive things

474
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,600
rather than cheap stuff.

475
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,800
Am I wrong?

476
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,120
It's not wrong.

477
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,600
Humans are like that,

478
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,200
Always choose what's better for yourself.

479
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,000
Want money, want a house,

480
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,440
want to be happy,

481
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,520
But my life was born from dirty water.

482
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,440
vile,

483
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,640
Always have to cling to men to keep yourself above the water.

484
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,360
Compared to Ms. Dao,

485
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,400
daughter of the owner of the television station,

486
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,840
she doesn't need to try anything.

487
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,320
Since birth, I have lived in paradise.

488
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,480
This world is truly so unfair.

489
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,800
I think it's like playing cards.

490
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,840
When the cards are dealt, we cannot choose the cards.

491
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,920
but we just need to play the cards in our hand as best we can.

492
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,600
You may be unlucky with bad cards,

493
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,000
But she also had to take the opportunity

494
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,720
and draw another card to help yourself.

495
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,160
Yet the number is unlucky over and over again.

496
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,480
Cards can be drawn

497
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,920
Think of it as lagoon leaves, old leaves, and black leaves

498
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,320
I've been fooled every time and never learned anything.

499
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Hey, but I...

500
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,800
once picked a good card.

501
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,320
He is a very good man.

502
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,440
We love each other very much,

503
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,240
but the dealer flipped the table, he crashed his car and died.

504
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,600
So unlucky. Car overturned.

505
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,320
I once asked myself

506
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,720
that what I was born for,

507
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,880
What is good about my life?

508
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,440
And get the answer

509
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,240
that life is born with only bad things

510
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,560
also good.

511
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,480
Life is bland and boring

512
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,680
Maybe it's not called life.

513
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,800
That's how shitty life is.

514
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,240
Very pleased.

515
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,560
But she has held a card since birth.

516
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,400
That is beauty.

517
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,840
And all men

518
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,440
Everyone wants to draw her card.

519
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,800
So today

520
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,200
Consider me lucky.
