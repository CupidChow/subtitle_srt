1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,400
[The film was created for entertainment purposes.]

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,520
[Characters, actions, places and events in the film are hypothetical events.]

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,440
[No intention of sexual arousal,]

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,440
[leading or inciting inappropriate or morally corrupt behavior]

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,000
[And there is no intention to cause damage to any profession]

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[or have a negative attitude toward any organization or group of people.]

7
00:00:15,658 --> 00:00:16,990
THE ROSE OF SIN

8
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,495
THE ROSE OF SIN

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
Episode 17

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,200
This case

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,800
They ordered a ton of it.

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,480
Such large orders do not come often.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,520
You dare to guarantee me

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,760
that he won't play tricks on me?

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,480
I checked his resume in detail.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,320
He is a new tycoon, wanting to capture this business.

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,960
There's definitely money to be made.

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,960
It's not that streetside gangsters have no face.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,400
You told him that

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,040
if he is willing to pay 80% advance

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,560
I agree, but what if he refuses?

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,720
Then please send him away to play far away from me.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,240
Tell him.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,280
Inspect.

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,280
Inspector, what's going on? Are you okay?

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,640
80% advance payment,

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
80 million baht.

28
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,080
He offered such a high price

29
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
it's clear he doesn't want this order to happen.

30
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,240
So is it okay for Thong to persuade him to reduce it?

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,360
Is about 50% okay?

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,200
No way, Thong.

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,200
Then he will suspect Thong.

34
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,520
Thong has nothing to do with it,

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,360
Naturally, I asked to reduce the advance payment.

36
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,600
So the amount is 80 million baht

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,080
Where did the inspector get it from?

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,080
He must definitely find it.

39
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,720
Either way, this action had to happen

40
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,720
and must be successful.

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,880
So what if Mr. Bun and the landlady say something?

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,160
Thong will quickly notify the inspector.

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,920
Thong will help this mission succeed.

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,920
Thank you.

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,600
Inspect

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,600
Don't forget the share for Thong.

47
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
YES.

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,800
Thong go first.

49
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,840
You also lose to me,

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,520
Lose to me every time.

51
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,560
But I liked the look on your face at that time,

52
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,280
because your face shows that you refuse to lose.

53
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,880
While you also know

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,440
that you have lost.

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
This

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,160
then you must lose to me,

57
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,080
Mr. Bun!

58
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,800
Open up!

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,440
Yes, boss!

60
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,520
Hey, open it all up!

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,880
How much does this cost?

62
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,920
One already contains 10 million baht.

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,200
Eight is 80 million baht.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,520
So Mit is telling the truth.

65
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,200
Have real customers,

66
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
real money.

67
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,320
Hey, bring all these bags

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,400
Store it in a secret base.

69
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,920
Tell the factory to ramp up production.

70
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,120
I will send the goods this week.

71
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,600
- Go! - Yes, boss!

72
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,960
What's wrong, ma'am?

73
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,320
Talisman to avoid police scrutiny.

74
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Stick to the car's windshield

75
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,880
The police will not check.

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,280
Are we blatantly declaring bribery like this?

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,240
If so, people will know where to drive.

78
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,640
Because I wanted to let them know.

79
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,480
So just pasted.

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
Let them know

81
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,480
we have a wide relationship,

82
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,760
don't touch it.

83
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,760
But now it's unpredictable.

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,320
The police are divided into many factions,

85
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,480
fight each other.

86
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,920
There may be crazy people

87
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,200
Catch us too.

88
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,480
I think we should have a backup plan.

89
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,480
I thought about it.

90
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Let's send two cars away.

91
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,120
The first car has nothing.

92
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Consider it a reconnaissance to see if there are any checkpoints.

93
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,440
The second vehicle is the delivery vehicle.

94
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,320
If the head is checked

95
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,760
then the second one will escape to another route.

96
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,360
That means we have to let the first car go.

97
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,720
As if we saw a symbol on the car

98
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,040
should let it go.

99
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,520
When they were sure that I had accepted a bribe

100
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,760
and will not catch them again

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
then we will take the second bus.

102
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,880
Yes, the second car would be carrying a ton of meth.

103
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,240
Besides this plan, is there anything else?

104
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,560
There's nothing left.

105
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,320
But if there is, I will notify you immediately.

106
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,080
Thank you, Thong.

107
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,840
Inspector.

108
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,040
I'm hungry, can we get something to eat?

109
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,400
I also want to get something to eat with you.

110
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,640
But you must quickly give information

111
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,040
about discussing with the team.

112
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,480
Then prepare an arrest plan.

113
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,480
Leave it later.

114
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,200
Yes, we will see each other often anyway.

115
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,040
I'll invite you out here.

116
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,560
It's so fresh.

117
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,440
Normally I'm in my room and at the bar, feeling so depressed I want to die.

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,400
But actually,

119
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,360
I'm also afraid that Bun will find out.

120
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,360
Next time,

121
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,520
I can meet you at your house.

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,840
I invite you to this garden

123
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,840
Because this place is open space,

124
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,360
It's not crowded either.

125
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,400
Bad guys will not be able to hide or blend in.

126
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,760
But if it's your house

127
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,840
I'm afraid Mr. Bun sent someone to constantly monitor my movements.

128
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,840
He is someone who trusts no one.

129
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,840
I think it's good to meet you here.

130
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,200
Yes, we can meet here as before.

131
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,400
That's good too.

132
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,000
But if we catch him, Bun and his sister-in-law will be in jail

133
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,760
Then we won't have to meet secretly anymore.

134
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
Until that day,

135
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,680
I will invite Thong home,

136
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,320
order delicious food to eat together,

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,040
Arrange flowers and light candles beautifully.

138
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,400
I will invite to thank Thong

139
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,880
for helping his mission succeed.

140
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,120
Is that Okay?

141
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

142
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,680
I want to get there quickly.

143
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,600
Hello sir.

144
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,200
Mr. Bun.

145
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Take good care of him.

146
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,240
Yes, bro.

147
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,000
- Just let me. - Give it your all.

148
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
Mr. Kiang.

149
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,720
Going to Lalisa today,

150
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,600
You have to play your best.

151
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,920
When it's over

152
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,200
Just tell them to give me the energy booster.

153
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,600
Guaranteed to be 100% high.

154
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,440
- Tam. - Yes, Mr. Bun.

155
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,680
Get me a glass of absinthe, strong.

156
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,720
Yes, sir.

157
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,000
Take two glasses.

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,080
Yes, madam.

159
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,760
Please sit down.

160
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,080
- Bun. - Huh?

161
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,080
I have decided

162
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,520
will let Thong

163
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
to support our business completely.

164
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,440
From now on, if there is a meeting or discussing any work

165
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Just let her listen along.

166
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,440
What's wrong with you?

167
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,080
Do you trust Thong that much?

168
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
But how could she know?

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Is she not two-faced?

170
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,040
"Indoor dining"

171
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,320
"then flew out and wandered behind the sidewalk."

172
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,320
I told you before,

173
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,920
She used to secretly go back and forth with Mit.

174
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,480
I think that's even better.

175
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,040
If I get her on my side completely,

176
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,640
instead she was a spy for the police

177
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,160
will turn out to be a spy for us.

178
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,040
Besides we know what happened to the police

179
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
then we still give it to her

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,960
Forgive the fake news and tell the police again.

181
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,000
Sounds good too.

182
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,520
But if it's the opposite,

183
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,400
she chose to take the other side,

184
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
betray us?

185
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,160
She wanted to tame her,

186
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,160
How do you do it?

187
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,160
I know

188
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,440
is someone like Thong

189
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,840
tend to lean towards evil.

190
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,000
It's not difficult to bribe someone like Thong.

191
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,680
Want to raise a dog that is loyal to you

192
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,480
then just give it food,

193
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
be honest with it.

194
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,360
If the dog is hungry

195
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,080
then it will crawl to our feet, right?

196
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,600
Thong.

197
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,240
Please help me with this.

198
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,800
Yes, ma'am, what do you want me to do?

199
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm hot today,

200
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,160
Please bathe me.

201
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,760
What?

202
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,280
Take a bath?

203
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,600
That's right, bathing nude.

204
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,080
Is that too embarrassing, boss?

205
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,240
Thong has never bathed anyone like that.

206
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
The boss asked me to do something else.

207
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,120
Let Thong prepare warm water mixed with liquid soap

208
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,120
And beat it until it's foamy, okay?

209
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,360
Thong.

210
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
You said you wanted to be my junior, right?

211
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,760
And then take care of me and do everything for me.

212
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,440
You can't even bathe me but you can't do it

213
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,120
then bigger things

214
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,440
How can you do it for me?

215
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,320
Take off my shirt.

216
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,760
Yes.

217
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,920
There you go.

218
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,840
What?

219
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,840
I take off

220
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,840
Then you have to take it off too.

221
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,360
Well...

222
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:45,966
How dare you disobey my orders?

223
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,800
Is this because of the boss?

224
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,680
Yes. But...

225
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,320
it was just a misunderstanding.

226
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,600
That's bad. Why don't you talk properly?

227
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,480
Such beautiful skin

228
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,400
but has such an ugly scar.

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,360
I definitely won't do this to you

230
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,720
no matter how wrong or how bad she did something.

231
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,440
Please take a bath with me.

232
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,240
Just relax.

233
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Think of it as taking a bath with your sister.

234
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,560
It's just the two of us here.

235
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,080
If you have anything, feel free to say it.

236
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,080
I'm ready to listen to you,

237
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,080
ready to trust

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,720
and also ready to forgive her everything.

239
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,440
Thong has nothing to say.

240
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,240
Because Thong has never hidden anything from the boss and boss.

241
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,280
Like when Inspector Mit came to flirt with Thong,

242
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,880
Thong also told the boss himself.

243
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,120
Good.

244
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,960
I want to find someone smart

245
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,600
and can be trusted like you have been for a long time.

246
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,720
Thong.

247
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,880
I'll give this bar to the manager.

248
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,800
All revenue is derived from this business

249
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
will be sent to the account in your name.

250
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
From now on,

251
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,400
She is the owner of this bar.

252
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,400
What?

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,720
Does the owner want to give this bar to Thong?

254
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,360
That's right.

255
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,680
I know you want it

256
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
and you will manage this place well.

257
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,800
Why... Why?

258
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Why suddenly let Thong manage?

259
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,040
Because now you are part of our group.

260
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,960
She should also manage a business of some sort.

261
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,560
She will feel it

262
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,280
is sitting in the same boat as us.

263
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,040
You, me and Bun.

264
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,160
Thong doesn't know anymore.

265
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,160
Thong is not sure

266
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,040
Can Thong manage this bar well?

267
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,000
Already...

268
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,000
What else do you think?

269
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,560
Try to think of yourself wearing beautiful clothes,

270
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,640
Sit cross-legged in the middle of the bar to welcome guests.

271
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,320
Until the bar closes

272
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,840
then returned to his room to drink wine,

273
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
sit and count the amount of 10 million, 100 million baht.

274
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,920
So what else?

275
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
make you hesitate again?

276
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,240
When we caught Mr. Bun and the landlady, they went to jail

277
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,200
Then we won't have to meet secretly anymore.

278
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
When that day comes, he will invite Thong to his house.

279
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,600
Order delicious food and eat together.

280
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,920
Prepare a beautiful bouquet of flowers, including candles.

281
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,440
To thank Thong.

282
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,040
For helping my mission complete.

283
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,560
I don't want to just work in exchange for money.

284
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,720
I want someone to take care of me,

285
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,320
Be by my side when I'm weak.

286
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,320
That's her.

287
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,200
No one takes care of you as well as you take care of yourself.

288
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,120
Why do you keep living on men?

289
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,480
Men come and go.

290
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,880
Finally, here it is.

291
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
We must help ourselves.

292
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,960
Thinking about how to save the world, huh?

293
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,280
Does she like to set traps?

294
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,120
Older sister!

295
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,120
Can you explain it to me again?

296
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,120
That's a man thing.

297
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,680
I...

298
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,680
There's nothing more to explain.

299
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,860
If you want to become a detective's wife, go ahead.

300
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,860
People often say

301
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,700
Officials' wives count banknotes, policemen's wives count coins.

302
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,860
I also want to know

303
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,580
How much salary does the state give the police?

304
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,580
And even more so, an honest police officer

305
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,940
Then he probably won't take taxpayer money to support her.

306
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,060
But oh,

307
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,020
People like you probably don't dream of being rich, right?

308
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,820
Right? Surely you will be happy with waking up early every morning,

309
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,300
ironing clothes for her husband,

310
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,660
Put a star on your husband's chest. So what?

311
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,660
What a proud thing.

312
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,620
Well, after a while when I woke up, I cooked rice, made breakfast and then sent my husband off to work.

313
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,980
Once finished, just stay home and make cakes in the kitchen.

314
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,500
Then one day

315
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,220
had to run and beat the concubines.

316
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,660
Girls like men who have owners.

317
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,020
Or one day you will receive bad news.

318
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,100
Her husband

319
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,540
was shot in the head by a criminal and died.

320
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,540
And we will...

321
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,540
Waiting to receive compensation

322
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,540
from those in positions of authority as consolation gifts.

323
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,340
Oh, what a good life you can choose.

324
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,100
No need to think anymore.

325
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,140
Do it.

326
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,020
We will set a trap before leaving Bangkok and entering Pathum.

327
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,500
Right on Road 307.

328
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,900
The first car is expected to arrive at the meeting point at 7:25 a.m.

329
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,660
Let's just ignore this one.

330
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,380
There's the second one

331
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,540
is our target car.

332
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,940
Will arrive at location at 7:32 a.m.

333
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,220
This one is it

334
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,540
vehicle that we will stop for inspection.

335
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,540
Inspector for sure

336
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,540
that our plan will proceed as predicted?

337
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,420
I'm sure from my perspective,

338
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,820
that the information we are given is true.

339
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,060
Because this person is a close person

340
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,660
with Mr. Bun the most.

341
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,940
I mean

342
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,300
that person will not betray us,

343
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,820
Or is there something hidden from us?

344
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,580
For example, if plans change,

345
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,580
but that person doesn't tell us, for example.

346
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,180
Or get caught by the boss,

347
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,500
then were forced to provide us with false information.

348
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,380
After that day, that person also remained silent,

349
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,740
No calls to update any information.

350
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
Okay, then I'll...

351
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
Make an appointment to meet that person again first.

352
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
To check if that person is still on our side or not.

353
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,140
Check carefully, Inspector.

354
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,660
If that person betrays the boss

355
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,660
then that person can also betray the inspector.

356
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,700
Hello, Thong!

357
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,860
Convenient to talk?

358
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,500
Can you talk a little?

359
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,500
Is there something wrong, Inspector?

360
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,820
I want to make an appointment with Thong to meet him.

361
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,460
Is Thong free?

362
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,380
That's okay too.

363
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,340
When is that?

364
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,820
Thong!

365
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,860
- Are you here? - Thong will call you back later.

366
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,900
Yes, madam, yes.

367
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,020
What are you doing?

368
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,020
Ah, don't do anything.

369
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,060
Is there anything wrong?

370
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,740
Isn't it beautiful?

371
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,740
It's beautiful.

372
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,140
Looks very expensive.

373
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,500
I don't know how many hundreds of thousands more, I don't remember.

374
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,740
Only worn once.

375
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:32,337
Do you like it?

376
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:34,643
I like it.

377
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:37,243
The hostess asked like that

378
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:38,603
What does that mean?

379
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:42,483
I give it to you.

380
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:45,603
The time has come

381
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,563
You did your duty for me.

382
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:51,763
Mistress!

383
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,083
So comfortable.

384
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:12,763
I don't know where else to get a massage. Too many people. 4, 5 people all the time.

385
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:15,123
Unlike everyone else, there are only two or three people.

386
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,763
Everyone, listen clearly.

387
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,763
From now on,

388
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:24,563
Thong is the owner of this bar.

389
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,363
I have transferred all my business to Thong.

390
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:30,603
Everyone must respect Thong

391
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,923
like respecting me.

392
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:34,563
Understand?

393
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:39,843
Thong.

394
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:42,363
I'll leave it to you.

395
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:44,363
Yes, ma'am.

396
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:46,643
Thong will manage this place peacefully

397
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:48,243
like the lady did.

398
00:20:58,003 --> 00:20:59,603
You guys see clearly, right?

399
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:01,483
That's me

400
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:03,483
No longer the lowly thing you think.

401
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:07,283
Who ever did something bad to me?

402
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:09,563
Give me a chance to come out here and apologize.

403
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:12,003
Then I'll act like nothing happened.

404
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,323
Today I bow my head before you

405
00:21:14,843 --> 00:21:16,323
it's not too late yet.

406
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,523
I'm Thong.

407
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:25,963
Well, it's my sister

408
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:28,243
I've never done anything to Thong.

409
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:30,483
When they fight,

410
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:31,963
I just stood there watching.

411
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:34,803
Sometimes she even came to stop me.

412
00:21:35,443 --> 00:21:37,563
As if

413
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:40,483
If you ever do anything that makes Thong unhappy

414
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:42,883
then please forgive me.

415
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:47,683
That's right, that's right, Thong.

416
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:49,443
You must too

417
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:52,843
Sorry Thong.

418
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:54,563
Actually

419
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:56,843
I don't want to do it either.

420
00:21:57,203 --> 00:21:59,283
But this Jan

421
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:00,963
it makes you do it.

422
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:02,643
Right, right, right.

423
00:22:02,643 --> 00:22:04,883
Jan also forced her.

424
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:08,723
I'm really sorry.

425
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:12,083
- Let's make peace. - Let's make peace.

426
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:17,283
What about you?

427
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:21,443
Yes, it's you, Jan.

428
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:24,283
When will you come and apologize to my brother?

429
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,003
Because you are human

430
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:29,523
tortured my brother the most.

431
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:31,963
Go, crawl over.

432
00:22:32,963 --> 00:22:34,283
I'm not sorry.

433
00:22:35,283 --> 00:22:38,963
And I will never bow down and flatter someone like Thong.

434
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:41,203
You remember carefully.

435
00:22:41,523 --> 00:22:42,843
People like me

436
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:45,163
If you hate someone, you will hate them for life.

437
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:48,363
I won't do anything as vile as these guys.

438
00:22:57,563 --> 00:22:59,483
The first day I stepped foot here,

439
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,763
What have you done to me?

440
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:03,483
Well, today I'll do the same for you.

441
00:23:04,043 --> 00:23:05,483
Consider it even.

442
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,123
And if you don't respect me

443
00:23:08,563 --> 00:23:10,123
I don't blame you either.

444
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:12,843
But you won't be able to stay here peacefully.

445
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:14,723
You wait and see.

446
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:22,563
- I'm Thong, I'm Thong. - I'm Thong, I'm Thong.

447
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:30,683
Do you smell anything?

448
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:32,283
- Yes. - Yes.

449
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:38,963
It smells like rotten old dog.

450
00:23:39,643 --> 00:23:42,043
It's also a dog with curly fur, so smelly.

451
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:44,803
Let's go guys, it stinks.

452
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,163
Jan, pour me more wine.

453
00:24:00,763 --> 00:24:03,243
Pour it yourself, you're playing a game.

454
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:07,923
I paid money to hire you to sit here.

455
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:09,163
Not for you to sit and play games.

456
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:10,963
Get some work done.

457
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:13,083
Not in a good mood today.

458
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,363
Pour it yourself, I won't pour you any wine today.

459
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:16,043
What?

460
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:18,043
Pouring wine is easy.

461
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:21,043
- Try it, do it yourself. - This.

462
00:24:21,483 --> 00:24:24,283
I want you to do it, pour me some wine right now.

463
00:24:24,683 --> 00:24:27,523
I don't pour. Are you handicapped, old man?

464
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:30,443
This.

465
00:24:30,923 --> 00:24:32,323
You called Thong here.

466
00:24:32,323 --> 00:24:33,323
Yes, sir.

467
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:38,483
I'm Thong. Come here for a moment.

468
00:24:38,883 --> 00:24:40,483
Come deal with this one.

469
00:24:46,203 --> 00:24:47,083
I'm here.

470
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:50,283
What's the matter?

471
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:51,803
It's Jan.

472
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:54,243
Just sitting and playing games, not doing anything.

473
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,003
Don't even sing, don't even pour wine.

474
00:24:57,323 --> 00:24:59,003
It's been like this since entering the room.

475
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:01,003
Calm down, okay?

476
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:03,083
Today, Jan is "due",

477
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,523
So my mood is a bit erratic.

478
00:25:04,523 --> 00:25:06,523
Let Thong bring his new sister over.

479
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:07,923
Wait a minute, bro.

480
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:09,923
Jan,

481
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:13,003
Please come outside.

482
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,923
In short, what's wrong with you?

483
00:25:30,603 --> 00:25:31,923
Come on, you say it.

484
00:25:32,483 --> 00:25:35,043
Nothing, I'm still normal.

485
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:37,523
If you're in the mood then do it, if you're not in the mood then don't do it.

486
00:25:38,123 --> 00:25:40,203
The more I see dogs becoming bigger

487
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:42,203
the more I feel like I'm not in the mood.

488
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:44,523
But if you are not satisfied

489
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:45,923
then fire me.

490
00:25:47,483 --> 00:25:49,883
So you're looking for trouble to get fired?

491
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,883
The more you want to go,

492
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:53,603
I won't let you go.

493
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:55,603
I won't let you achieve that goal.

494
00:25:57,003 --> 00:25:57,963
Thong.

495
00:25:58,443 --> 00:26:00,283
You hate me, I hate you.

496
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:01,843
Why are you keeping me?

497
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:03,843
Send me away like Malee.

498
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:06,683
Then I'll keep you here so you can watch me slowly get promoted.

499
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:08,923
And you're still an old whore,

500
00:26:08,923 --> 00:26:11,243
Dried, dead oysters stuck in the corner of the bar as before.

501
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:13,683
I have gloating

502
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:16,203
without even trying to hit you.

503
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:17,123
How good.

504
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,403
You're happy when you don't need to fight,

505
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:22,923
But I must beat you to your heart's content.

506
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:26,803
Thong,

507
00:26:26,803 --> 00:26:29,603
I will fight until you fire me.

508
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:33,243
I won't let you go anywhere.

509
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:34,363
I will let you stay

510
00:26:34,363 --> 00:26:36,003
Join me as a karma duo here.

511
00:26:36,483 --> 00:26:37,683
Thong.

512
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:39,963
Let me go.

513
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:46,283
Stop, stop.

514
00:26:47,363 --> 00:26:48,563
Enough.

515
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:50,803
Be careful if your face is injured, you won't be able to eat.

516
00:26:58,203 --> 00:27:01,363
Jan, Jan trying to make trouble with guests to get kicked out?

517
00:27:01,763 --> 00:27:03,643
Does Jan think this is a good way?

518
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:06,443
Does Jan not think of you at all? Your shop

519
00:27:06,443 --> 00:27:08,443
How much loss will it be?

520
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:11,403
Jan apologized to Mr. Bun.

521
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:13,323
The thing is...

522
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:16,843
If Jan resigns herself, Mr. Bun will not let her quit.

523
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,723
So Jan found a way to get kicked out like little Malee.

524
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:23,643
But Bun, don't hit Jan like she does.

525
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,963
Let Jan go peacefully, Mr. Bun.

526
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:27,963
You treated me so badly,

527
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:29,963
So how dare you think about leaving peacefully?

528
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:31,363
Don't dream.

529
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:33,683
You must stay here with me until you die.

530
00:27:34,683 --> 00:27:36,243
Don't agree with her, Mr. Bun.

531
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:41,083
Let her go.

532
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,843
Even if we keep her here, we will still curse each other every day.

533
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:45,843
My brain feels like it's about to explode. Just think

534
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:47,843
release frogs and frogs

535
00:27:47,843 --> 00:27:49,683
Go down to the cesspool.

536
00:27:49,683 --> 00:27:51,243
That's also considered merit, Thong.

537
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:52,243
Ms. Si.

538
00:27:52,243 --> 00:27:54,603
Why did she become such a kind nun?

539
00:27:54,603 --> 00:27:56,603
Think of the times she treated us badly.

540
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:58,003
That way you won't be nice to her.

541
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,003
Hey lady.

542
00:28:02,243 --> 00:28:03,363
What do you think?

543
00:28:05,363 --> 00:28:07,123
I think what Si said is right.

544
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:09,523
If you keep arguing every day

545
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,523
then the work will not be done.

546
00:28:13,163 --> 00:28:14,203
Jan,

547
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:16,923
I will let you go.

548
00:28:17,683 --> 00:28:18,923
Mistress.

549
00:28:18,923 --> 00:28:20,923
Whatever I say is the same.

550
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:23,283
Jan,

551
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:26,723
She has worked here for many years.

552
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:29,083
She just became a dancer for Mr. Bun,

553
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:32,163
just worked as a madam to take care of other girls.

554
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:35,643
Before you go, I will give you a reward.

555
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:37,923
Go get my bag for me.

556
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:43,923
Yes.

557
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:06,443
Actually, the owner doesn't need to give Jan any reward.

558
00:29:06,923 --> 00:29:08,443
Jan is very shy.

559
00:29:21,523 --> 00:29:22,403
 Mistress!

560
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:27,458
 [This is inappropriate behavior and should not be imitated]

561
00:29:43,483 --> 00:29:44,843
She wants to go,

562
00:29:45,123 --> 00:29:46,523
I also give it away.

563
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:50,683
Go in peace, Jan.

564
00:29:57,043 --> 00:29:58,603
Why did you strangle it?

565
00:29:58,603 --> 00:30:01,763
Effortless. One shot and it's dead.

566
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:04,563
There are so many guests,

567
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:06,963
If there were gunshots, people would be suspicious.

568
00:30:10,323 --> 00:30:11,843
A few things

569
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,243
It's good to end quickly.

570
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:16,763
There's no use keeping it.

571
00:30:17,203 --> 00:30:21,083
Maybe it will come back and stab us in the back.

572
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:23,963
Just solve it completely.

573
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:25,963
Much more comfortable.

574
00:31:09,383 --> 00:31:14,125
THE ROSE OF SIN
