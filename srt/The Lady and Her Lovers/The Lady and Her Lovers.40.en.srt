1
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:01,373
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:39,758
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:44,800
 Please think carefully. If you do so

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,360
It will greatly affect your vote.

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,080
Can we try to find another way?

6
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,360
If we cannot divorce peacefully,

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,920
Then we have to use this method.

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,640
But he has been married to Ms. Thong for less than a year.

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,040
If the lady suddenly passes away

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,000
Then everyone will be suspicious.

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,320
So keep the news as private as possible.

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,680
And let's destroy a gang of scam calls.

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,960
People will turn their attention to that news.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,440
Find a new, small gang.

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,680
Don't mess with big gangs.

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,320
Yes.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,600
So what about your son?

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,520
Have you woken up? I've already made you coffee.

19
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,920
How dare you do such terrible things to me?

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,280
What do you think I am? What do you want to do with me?

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,840
I'm also human, I also have a heart.

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,560
Why must she be angry?

23
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,000
She herself has had many husbands.

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
There's nothing wrong with adding one person.

25
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,720
She should be happy.

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,400
My goods are of excellent quality.

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,080
Better than all the people who passed through her hands.

28
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,280
Bastard, you are no better than an animal.

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,320
Hey Lom, I'll beat you to death, you bastard!

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,000
[Sir Prajak]

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,640
Let me go!

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,240
Stop it.

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,280
He called.

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,680
Very good, I will tell him, let me go!

35
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,920
Let me go!

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,680
Let me go!

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,160
Let me go!

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,080
[Sir Prajak]

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,440
Yes, sir!

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,960
Why are you taking so long to answer the phone?

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,160
I just prepared warm water for Ms. Thong.

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,800
So I didn't hear it.

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,200
So where is Thong now?

44
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,520
Haven't woken up yet. Last night she drank too much.

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,480
She'll probably wake up later.

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,080
Let's go talk somewhere else.

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,600
Is there anything I need to do?

48
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,840
Is there still contact information for Dr. Ohm?

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,120
People selling injection drugs let people rest in peace

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,960
without letting anyone know, right?

51
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,000
Makes people think they died of a heart attack.

52
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Still there.

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,480
Order a set.

54
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,920
Then ask how to do it in detail.

55
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,720
Who do you want to use it for?

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,000
What.

57
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,160
How are you, wife?

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,960
Yes, that's the end of it.

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Thong will become my wife,

60
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,880
No more problems with her.

61
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,440
Yes, let me contact you.

62
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,880
Yesterday you said...

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,400
want money, a house,

64
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,760
has everything. It's about to come true.

65
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,640
As long as you keep your mouth shut, you'll have everything

66
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,320
without having to lift a finger.

67
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,600
I know she is a smart person.

68
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,360
Just pretend you didn't hear what just happened.

69
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,000
I believe she can do it.

70
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,240
What about last night?

71
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,120
Just consider it as my salary

72
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,240
for helping her have everything she needs.

73
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,200
Sir.

74
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,200
What you need is already there.

75
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,680
How dare you do that to me?

76
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,280
- Huh? - What did I do?

77
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,280
- Are you still acting like you don't know anything? - Sir.

78
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,120
Let's go to the office and talk.

79
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,400
Follow me.

80
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,400
Wait a minute.

81
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,400
What's going on?

82
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
You hear it from his mouth.

83
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,480
Sir.

84
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,000
What did I do wrong?

85
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,560
Instead of you confessing yourself

86
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,560
then you dare to ask me?

87
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,760
Because I don't know what it is.

88
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,520
Thong told me everything.

89
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,520
What did you do to her last night?

90
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,520
Sir.

91
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,200
I... I'm really sorry, sir.

92
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
I was so drunk last night,

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,800
Ms. Thong was also drunk.

94
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,280
So I accidentally went over the limit.

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,480
At that time I couldn't control myself.

96
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,280
But... but sir, I really don't force Miss Thong.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,160
- Sir. - Don't do that.

98
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,160
I told you to go take care of her.

99
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,160
You took advantage of the opportunity again.

100
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,960
- You really... - Sir, calm down.

101
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,960
We still have work to do.

102
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,320
Let's get that over with.

103
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,840
Show me your stuff.

104
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,440
Please go and handle this properly.

105
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,360
This is in exchange for your life.

106
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,920
I will do everything perfectly.

107
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,920
Surely nothing will go wrong.

108
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,360
Yesterday she said that

109
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,520
she wants money,

110
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,880
want a house,

111
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,880
want everything.

112
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,240
The truth is that those things are coming soon.

113
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,880
Just keep your mouth shut

114
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
then she will have everything

115
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
without having to expend any effort.

116
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,400
I think she is a smart person.

117
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,520
But she had to pretend she couldn't hear

118
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,960
what I told Mr. Prajak earlier.

119
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,480
You can do it, right?

120
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,360
Older brother.

121
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,880
How's it going? Is it better yet?

122
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,680
Not yet.

123
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,800
People who are raped do not forget easily.

124
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,440
How did you handle him?

125
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,440
I've beaten him a lot.

126
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,120
And he ordered that

127
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,760
Do not approach Thong within a distance of 10 meters.

128
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,400
I think he won't dare do anything anymore.

129
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,920
Why so? You haven't kicked him out yet?

130
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,440
Why did you keep the person who did such a thing to your wife?

131
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,720
Calm down already.

132
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,800
Because you have something important to do

133
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
want him to finish it.

134
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,760
When he finished what he assigned,

135
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
I will fire him.

136
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,520
It's important

137
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,800
What's going on?

138
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,920
Having said that, I don't understand either.

139
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,240
I think now

140
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Please let yourself be comfortable.

141
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Rest here

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,720
and don't think too much.

143
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,720
I will try

144
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Divorce Nong as quickly as possible

145
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,200
and will come back here

146
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
Please take me home.

147
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,360
Older brother...

148
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,040
Don't do anything drastic.

149
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,720
If there's something wrong, please say it slowly.

150
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,720
No need to worry.

151
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,720
What can you do to Nong?

152
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,240
At best, we can only convince her to quickly sign the divorce papers.

153
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,400
You can't force her to sign the form either.

154
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,400
Thong doesn't need to worry about this.

155
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
Let's go downstairs to eat something.

156
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,760
He hasn't eaten anything since afternoon and feels so hungry. Let's go.

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
Why did Dad enter the room without knocking first?

158
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,040
I'm ready to go.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Next month I have to go to Texas.

160
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,360
Dad has prepared a place to live

161
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
and school for me.

162
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,840
Are you crazy? Suddenly came into the room and said he didn't understand anything.

163
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,840
Don't pretend to be stupid with me.

164
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,160
I said that but you don't understand?

165
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,160
next month,

166
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,880
I have to go to America, do you understand?

167
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Got it.

168
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,320
But I don't go.

169
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,760
Dad, don't eliminate me this way.

170
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,760
I won't let you mom

171
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,760
Where to live with someone like dad?

172
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
What about someone like dad?

173
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,520
What about someone like dad?

174
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
- Let go! - Don't do anything to my child!

175
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,360
I also will not agree to let you take your child abroad.

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,200
The person you should take away is Thong.

177
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
Not a child.

178
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,960
We are living very well.

179
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Why move?

180
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,840
The one with the problem is Thong.

181
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
He chased it away.

182
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
I'm not here to argue.

183
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,720
I have prepared everything.

184
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,440
Either way, Ben has to go.

185
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,880
If you refuse to go peacefully

186
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,520
then I will tie it up,

187
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,960
box for export.

188
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,560
Sir,

189
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,480
Let me go buy you coffee.

190
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,760
YES.

191
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,760
Hello Ms. Thong,

192
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,640
Is there anything I need to do? Or

193
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Want me to serve you like last night?

194
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,000
Still speechless?

195
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,920
Tell me, why hasn't Jak kicked me out?

196
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,240
Who can do the work for me?

197
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,480
I've been with him for a long time, I'm someone who understands him,

198
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,680
work neatly.

199
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,680
And most importantly,

200
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
I know many of his secrets.

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,960
How could he fire me?

202
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,560
Lady story

203
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,080
Are you also the handler?

204
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,480
Sure.

205
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,800
If I don't do it, who does it?

206
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
In short

207
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,280
will he kill the lady?

208
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,280
Don't say that.

209
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
I should say let the lady rest in peace!

210
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,600
When will you take action?

211
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,760
Next month.

212
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
He wanted to wait for Uncle Ben to go abroad first.

213
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,560
He didn't want Uncle Ben to know about it.

214
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,240
Then it was ripped open, revealing everything in front of her chest...

215
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,880
Torn to pieces...

216
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,160
- until... - Madam.

217
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,600
What are you doing back? It's okay to stay at a hotel.

218
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,800
The right place for a woman like her is a hotel, not a home.

219
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,720
I have something to say.

220
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,760
It's very important.

221
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,120
What's important? How important is it?

222
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Come to ask for property?

223
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,040
A matter of life and death.

224
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
Say whatever you want.

225
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,760
The story is good.

226
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,160
I'll go listen again.

227
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,400
I know the lady doesn't like me.

228
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,120
I also admit that I don't like the lady.

229
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Even though we are not on the same path,

230
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
But it's not a deep hatred either.

231
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,360
If I knew that the lady was in danger

232
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,520
I don't want to see anything happen to my lady.

233
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,320
What are you saying? I do not understand.

234
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,320
Ladies, listen carefully to what I say.

235
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,960
And trust me.

236
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,280
Because what I said is the truth.

237
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,640
Say whatever you say.

238
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,160
I will know for myself whether I should believe it or not.

239
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,960
But hear her say,

240
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
the way she said it

241
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,720
it seems trustworthy.

242
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,360
Say it.

243
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,960
I overheard Mr. Jak talking to Lom.

244
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,320
They planned to kill that lady.

245
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,160
It's true, my lady, run away quickly.

246
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,800
Come with Uncle Ben.

247
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,480
It's okay to transfer all valuable assets.

248
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,960
I didn't make up a story about tricking the lady

249
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,720
Let the lady leave and take everything.

250
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,680
Thong is just...

251
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,320
Thong just doesn't want to see anyone die because of Thong anymore.

252
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,320
Trust Thong.

253
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,640
When will Ben go abroad?

254
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,680
They will take action against the lady immediately.

255
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,840
Do you know?

256
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,760
Is my appearance like that because of anyone?

257
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,760
The first 10 years after I married Jak,

258
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,160
I argue with him every day.

259
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,160
One day,

260
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,360
I broke a blood vessel in my brain, then fell to the floor.

261
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,600
Instead of calling an ambulance,

262
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,280
He stood there cursing me again.

263
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,160
I trusted her from the beginning

264
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,000
when you said he wanted to plan to kill me.

265
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
If so, the lady must quickly flee.

266
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,400
- Thong go help me pack up. - No need.

267
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,080
People like me have never run away.

268
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,040
But

269
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,240
I also have to thank you very much.

270
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,240
Besides,

271
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,000
I also have to apologize to you.

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Because I misread her.

273
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,240
I don't think the person I hate

274
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
and worried about my life.

275
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,360
You go back to your place.

276
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,760
When will this end,

277
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,760
I will repay you.

278
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,880
So what will you do next, ma'am?

279
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,600
I still don't know.

280
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,000
But people like me

281
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,640
I won't die easily.

282
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,920
Thong!

283
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,920
Sometimes women's lives are like ours

284
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It doesn't have to be a man.

285
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,480
We can live on our own.

286
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,520
Miss Wanthong burst into tears, her breath disappeared,

287
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,600
hugged Prai Ngam Noi and whispered:

288
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,760
Oh, my dear, I just wanted to say

289
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,920
The path into the forest is full of dangers, no one has ever...

290
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,280
Mom!

291
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,640
I stopped by to buy Thai cakes

292
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,640
of this famous restaurant for mothers.

293
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,280
Uncle Sai, let's eat together, okay?

294
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Yes, let me put it on a plate for you.

295
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,960
Ben!

296
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,200
I think so

297
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,760
Dad wants me to go to America to continue studying

298
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,760
That's good too.

299
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,760
What's wrong, mom?

300
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,560
Why did mom suddenly change her mind?

301
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,200
After I leave, who will stay with me?

302
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,560
Mom can stay.

303
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,480
Just an exchange student, going to school for one more year and then returning.

304
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,480
No way.

305
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,080
I know our house is having problems lately.

306
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,560
So I want you to go away

307
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
so you don't know, right?

308
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,280
But I'm grown, mom.

309
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,600
You also have rights

310
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
know everything in the house.

311
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,640
But this time I'm asking you.

312
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,800
I want you to be in a safe place.

313
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,600
I don't want you to know what's about to happen.

314
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,400
Mom promised.

315
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,720
When you return, everything will be fine.

316
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,240
We will live happily together.

317
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,560
Believe me, baby?

318
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,280
Hey darling. How has the divorce with your wife been resolved?

319
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,040
She agreed to divorce him.

320
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,160
I'm ready to move to our house.

321
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,320
That house will be ours.

322
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,760
Not afraid

323
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
Is there anyone coming to chase me?

324
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,560
So how did you get your wife to agree to the divorce?

325
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,800
If divorced, where will the wife live? Is there someone to take care of me?

326
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,920
I don't need to know the details about that issue.

327
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,920
She also has her own path.

328
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,320
So what about Ben?

329
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Is he coming to stay with us?

330
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,720
Depends on the kid.

331
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,840
The baby is also grown up.

332
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,520
Well, next week I will organize a party to send Ben off to study abroad.

333
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,520
Thong, will you come?

334
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,080
Yes.

335
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,840
At this meal, I want everyone to talk to each other properly.

336
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,920
Because Ben has to go soon.

337
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,400
Ben!

338
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,240
Before you go, do you want to say something?

339
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,560
If you want me to speak properly

340
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,560
then there's nothing to say.

341
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,560
Also good.

342
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,560
I also know how to keep my mouth shut and stay quiet.

343
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,880
Looks like you've grown up too.

344
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,320
Abroad, contact with new society

345
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
then you have to be careful.

346
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,120
You don't need to worry.

347
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,840
Our children can take care of themselves.

348
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,840
The kid is much better than you think.

349
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,000
Don't remember?

350
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,320
As a child,

351
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,880
The boy even helped me.

352
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,120
What's the story? Can you tell Thong?

353
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,360
At that time,

354
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,680
Ben is only 6 years old.

355
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,240
We went mountain climbing in Hokkaido.

356
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,000
We climbed high mountains,

357
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,000
then suddenly

358
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,840
Jak's heart disease returns.

359
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,320
There was no one there except the three of us.

360
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,600
I had to stay and give Jak artificial respiration.

361
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,600
And Ben

362
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,960
Had to climb two or three kilometers

363
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
to find someone to help.

364
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,160
So can you find someone to help?

365
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,920
Okay, if that doesn't work then how do you see him still sitting here?

366
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,360
Come on, better eat.

367
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,320
Thank you for telling me that story again.

368
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,800
I had forgotten that

369
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,200
Our family also had such beautiful memories.

370
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,440
But I have never forgotten.

371
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,160
I know

372
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,000
that our love

373
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It...

374
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,080
Our married life does not start with love.

375
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,000
But I tried to build it.

376
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,640
In every moment,

377
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,040
I always try

378
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,280
to make the atmosphere really good.

379
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,880
Have activities to do together

380
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,160
with hope

381
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,840
it will make us fall in love.

382
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,280
But today it was...

383
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,560
it proved that everything was in vain.

384
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,120
He doesn't love me even a little bit.

385
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,040
I also know, but I don't know

386
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,040
that she tried to be nice to me.

387
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,200
But

388
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,840
Maybe we really can't love each other.

389
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,960
At this age,

390
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
I don't have hope for love anymore.

391
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,840
I just hope we don't hate each other and that's enough.

392
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,160
Can you do it?

393
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,720
I've tried thinking about it.

394
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,440
I know she tried to be nice to me.

395
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,560
I'm the one

396
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,040
Treat her poorly.

397
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,680
And the fact that I used to hate you.

398
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,400
I shouldn't think like that.

399
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,600
I'm sorry, Nong.

400
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,040
Should I drink a glass of wine to help me sleep?

401
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,160
Brother, Thong, can I talk to you for a moment?

402
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
If there's something wrong, just say it.

403
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,040
Here you go.

404
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,760
What's up?

405
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,320
HAS...

406
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,440
Let's get divorced.

407
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,840
What are you bothering me about again?

408
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,160
What about Nong?

409
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,520
Don't be upset.

410
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,440
But today Thong sees the cuteness of his family,

411
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,000
Thong just realized

412
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,640
Thong is the troublemaker,

413
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,160
causing his family to fall apart.

414
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,400
Thong doesn't want to destroy anyone's happiness.

415
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,080
So Thong asked permission to be the one to leave.

416
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,600
Why do you think like that?

417
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,480
I told you Nong agreed to this.

418
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,120
And she also let me live in the house.

419
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,240
I don't think there's anything to think about too much.

420
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,240
No.

421
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,400
Even though the lady said so on her lips,

422
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,160
But anyway, deep down inside, the lady also hates Thong.

423
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
And Thong himself

424
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,480
will live in that house and not be happy.

425
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,960
You don't need to worry about this.

426
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Come here with me.

427
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,240
Stay with me,

428
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,800
everything will go well.

429
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,520
Older brother.

430
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,680
Thong has thought carefully.

431
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,320
If Thong is the one to leave

432
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
then that will be good for everyone.

433
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,720
If you want that

434
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
I don't know how to hold on.

435
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,280
But I hope to take care of your life.

436
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,400
I will give you a house,

437
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,080
I have a salary for you.

438
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,320
What about charity funds?

439
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,080
Then I'll just keep doing it, do you agree?

440
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,080
Yes.

441
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,760
Thong is the one who asked to leave

442
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,360
It's because Thong loves him.

443
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,400
I hope you'll come back and talk to the lady

444
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
and decent Ben

445
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,520
and be happy with your family.

446
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,880
Thank you for loving me.

447
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,840
If there is a chance

448
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,760
I hope you can repay me.

449
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,760
Yes,

450
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,000
Mr. Jak.

451
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,360
Just relax, just consider it your home.

452
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,400
I gave it to you.

453
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,720
Actually, I also want to send you off to give you instructions

454
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,160
that what is where.

455
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,080
But today I'm really busy in meetings.

456
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,600
When I'm free, I'll come see you.

457
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,600
It's better not to.

458
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,960
Don't forget that we are no longer together.

459
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,960
Besides being colleagues.

460
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,120
Thong,

461
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,160
If anything changes in the future

462
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,880
Then we will still go back to being husband and wife like before.

463
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,800
Has anything changed?

464
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,800
What do you mean?

465
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,840
Nothing.

466
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,840
I just said that.

467
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,680
Because I'm still very sorry about you.

468
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,520
Hurry up, I'm also in a hurry to go to the meeting.

469
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,160
Thank you for everything.

470
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,733
THE ROSE OF SIN
