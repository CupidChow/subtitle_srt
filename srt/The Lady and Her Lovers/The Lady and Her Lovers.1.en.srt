00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,399
[The film was created for entertainment purposes.]

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,519
[Characters, actions, places and events in the film are hypothetical events.]

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,440
[No intention of sexual arousal,]

4
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:06,439
[leading or inciting inappropriate, morally corrupt behavior.]

00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,999
[And there is no intention to cause damage to any profession]

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,400
[or have a negative attitude toward any organization or group of people.]

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,160
 How many husbands can a woman have in her life?

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,560
 For me, until I find someone who truly loves me.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,880
 And is love so important?

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
 If anyone doesn't have a life like mine

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,400
 is probably incomprehensible

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,520
 that why women like me

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,280
 needs love so much.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,440
 [Year 1997, Angthong]

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,520
 Sister, this is an easy child to raise.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,840
 Try raising it, if you throw it away it will survive on its own.

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,359
 Are you crazy? I haven't raised a dog or cat yet.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,359
 You don't have a husband or children, right?

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,319
 Then you raise it to help you work.

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,240
You don't need to pay salary.

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,120
When you get old,

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,800
it will take care of you.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,600
I raised her for five years, ten years.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,799
When are you bored?

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,920
Then you resell it, and brothels fight to buy it.

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,119
What is it?

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,200
Sister, my husband called, in short, please accept it.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,319
I have to go, my husband called.

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,080
If you give it away, it's forbidden to take it back.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,920
Once given, it is always given without taking it back. I'm going.

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,000
Forgot, my mother bought it for me.

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,160
I would like to get it back so I can start a business.

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Go away.

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,040
Leaving here, raising a baby also requires money.

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,240
Sister, the bracelet isn't much money, I'm asking for it to start a business.

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,039
Hey, to give or not to give?

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,159
If you refuse, throw the baby into the river.

38
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,120
Take it away, take it away.

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,840
You stingy thing. I know that so I can take it off when I'm home.

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,320
Wait.

41
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,559
Still haven't said what the baby's name is?

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Just call me a snail, I haven't named it yet.

43
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,080
Are you crying for your mother?

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,280
Your mother abandoned you.

45
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,199
You look closely at my face.

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,000
And remember that this face is your mother.

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,080
What should we name it?

48
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,920
What's a good name?

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,040
Thongdee.

50
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,760
Where is Thongdee? Come here.

51
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,520
Where are you? Are you here yet?

52
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,120
Here we come.

53
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,120
When you get there, hurry up.

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,960
It's been so long.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,199
Look, do you see?

56
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,240
See? That egg.

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,399
I told you this morning, right?

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Are you waiting for your mother to come to work?

59
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,720
Hurry up.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,520
You're always lazy when I'm not paying attention.

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,040
Buy cake.

62
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,600
I buy cake.

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,840
Don't you see people buying? Let's sell first.

64
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,320
Hey, can you have a happy expression?

65
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,120
Standing there being lazy, hurry up.

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,080
Don't break it like last time, or I'll break your back.

67
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,520
Son Thongdee.

68
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,200
You make me angry, right? You little brat.

69
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,480
You lazy bastard, your mother said you were easy to raise.

70
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,040
Thongdee, the more I curse you, the angrier I get, right?

71
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,880
Uneducated person.

72
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,240
Does someone with this much think you're so majestic?

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,879
You want to fight me, right?

74
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,439
Let me tell you, who dies first?

75
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,120
Who dies first?

76
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,400
What are you doing standing there stupid? Go get a towel and wipe it off.

77
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,080
Thongdee, you little brat, give me some water to drink.

78
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,320
Cursing you makes my throat hurt.

79
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,520
I can tell you a little bit but I'm stuck.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,800
[Year 2014]

81
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,560
Hey, it's you, Thong!

82
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,199
Do everything slowly. Look at your face,

83
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,040
Frowning faces range from small to large.

84
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,159
Whenever I'm told something, it's like I have to bow to you.

85
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,039
Must bow! I told you 20 years ago,

86
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,920
I've never bowed before, it's all wrong wrong wrong!

87
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,560
This one! I said that to you.

88
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,040
You are so right!

89
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,079
Ice water costs 50, ma'am.

90
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,480
Look, pay it back.

91
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,719
Here you go, 50.

92
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
YES.

93
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,360
Thong! Count the money.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,320
 2 plates 60.

95
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,200
 Don't you dare touch me.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
 Here you go, 60.

97
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
 Yes.

98
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,999
Hey, Thong! Haven't done anything yet,

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,840
I'm lazy again. Bring rice to the guests.

100
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,760
Con Thong! Don't you hear? I said bring rice to the guests.

101
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,120
It's okay, sister.

102
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,600
Let the children rest for a bit.

103
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,440
From the moment I arrived, I saw him working non-stop.

104
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,720
Here, let me get it myself.

105
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,959
Has the situation changed? Customers serve themselves.

106
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,400
As for Thong, lying just like the owner.

107
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
Don't lie down anymore.

108
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,200
Come here, bring the rice to the market and deliver it.

109
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
 Here, the three-box Pong shop.

110
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,200
Before you go, change your pants.

111
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,000
Wearing revealing clothes like that, who wouldn't know?

112
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,960
asked me what I sold at that shop.

113
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,560
Hey, mom still doesn't know?

114
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,360
Do you think guests come to eat because you cook well?

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,999
They just came to see me.

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,880
 If you dressed conservatively, this restaurant would have gone bankrupt a long time ago.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,160
 Oh, Thong! You! This one!

118
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,040
Is your mouth unbearable?

119
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,440
The damn thing. Damn it!

120
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:23,080
THE ROSE OF SIN

121
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,440
THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 01

122
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
This.

123
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,160
Let me ask for directions, I'm not from here.

124
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,760
Where do you want to go?

125
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,760
So where are you going?

126
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Market.

127
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,280
I'm also going to the market, want to buy some things.

128
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,000
Please let me follow.

129
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,480
My name is Pete. What's your name?

130
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Ask for what?

131
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,520
Just want to know. Can't ask?

132
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,359
Didn't you say you wanted to go shopping?

133
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,480
Go buy it.

134
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,639
Thong, are you here? I've been waiting for you for a long time.

135
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
100 baht.

136
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,760
One box is 30 baht, three boxes is 90 baht, isn't that right?

137
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,160
Or let me teach you how to calculate?

138
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,959
This is the price of Thongdee, 100 baht.

139
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,240
If you want to pay 90 baht, next time I will let my mother deliver the goods.

140
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,840
In short, how much do you want to pay?

141
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,360
100 baht is 100 baht.

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,520
So do you want me to use my hands or my chest to receive money?

143
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,200
If using breasts, add 20 baht.

144
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,320
Okay.

145
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,039
This. Just coming to deliver food, what are you talking about?

146
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,239
After delivering the meal, leave.

147
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,960
You should be a little shy with other people's wives.

148
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,720
Mom, give me money to buy cake.

149
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,559
What cake should I buy? Mom bought rice here.

150
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,280
Today's sales aren't good, don't eat any more snacks.

151
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
 Let's go buy some cake.

152
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,680
 Thank you.

153
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,160
 Mom, she's so kind.

154
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,160
I heard you flirted with Berm the other day?

155
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Are not.

156
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,999
I see you like a lot of his posts.

157
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,480
What do you mean by that?

158
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,240
He clicked like on me first, then I clicked back, that's all.

159
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,399
Show me your phone.

160
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,480
Oh, what's the point of watching?

161
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,680
I just want to know if you talked to him or not.

162
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,120
Wild boar with garlic, that is, fried with garlic?

163
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,960
I have to go back and help my mother.

164
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,360
Let's close the shop at the end of the day and deal with each other, shall we play?

165
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,400
Okay.

166
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,360
If you go and call someone to help, just call, call more and more.

167
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,520
I have never been afraid of industry girls.

168
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,360
So let's meet at 6pm.

169
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,040
Suthin, Susat, you two are ready, right?

170
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,640
Yes, sister!

171
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Are you back?

172
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,999
Let's go eat cake together?

173
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,440
No, I'm in a hurry.

174
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,320
Slowly already.

175
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,040
I said my name, you still haven't said yours.

176
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,000
Do you want to get to know me that much?

177
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,560
That's right, otherwise I wouldn't have taken the long route here.

178
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Can I ask for Line?

179
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
What is it?

180
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,839
The guy also asked, even asked for Line,

181
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,960
Normally I don't tell anyone that easily.

182
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,640
So what do I have to do to get you to accept it?

183
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,080
I can meet all those requirements.

184
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Older sister.

185
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,920
Big guts, huh? Dare to come alone?

186
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
How many people did you see me coming here?

187
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,480
This little girl!

188
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Im.

189
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,120
Thong, I don't want to cause trouble either.

190
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,560
Lest people say Kay here is bullying children.

191
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,400
You talk to me properly,

192
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
Have you and Berm slept together yet?

193
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,320
Who could do that to him?

194
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,360
With that face, you don't need to be jealous.

195
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,039
It's so disgusting, it shows that you

196
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,839
I can't find anyone delicious to eat.

197
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,519
Even the rotten type gets crazy jealous.

198
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,759
Like a guardian angel.

199
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,080
This little one.

200
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,920
What's wrong with each other?

201
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,600
 Oh.

202
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
 Hey.

203
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,080
 What's going on with each other?

204
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,800
 Small Thong.

205
00:15:55,114 --> 00:15:57,034
 Did you call someone to gang rape me?

206
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,480
 Oh.

207
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,400
 Not gang rape.

208
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
 It's a collective fight.

209
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Oh, oh.

210
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,200
Do not.

211
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,640
Oh.

212
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,920
Sister, tell them to stop.

213
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,520
Oh, don't.

214
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,720
Listen clearly.

215
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,280
Don't make trouble with Thong anymore.

216
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,760
If you three

217
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,400
even came to talk to Thong

218
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
then you will know

219
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,240
- my knife... - Oh.

220
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,640
It will definitely be sharper than your nails.

221
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
My personality

222
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,160
Not as beautiful as my face.

223
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Oh.

224
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
Don't shout.

225
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,560
Thank you very much.

226
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Nothing.

227
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,520
See you again.

228
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
See you soon.

229
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Is your name Thong?

230
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
What a cool name.

231
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
What's your real name?

232
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
If you say it, don't laugh.

233
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Don't laugh.

234
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Thongdee.

235
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
HAS.

236
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Okay.

237
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Hey, I'm not laughing.

238
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,720
That's how I handled it,

239
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Are you satisfied?

240
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
YES.

241
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
Satisfied.

242
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,480
But without you

243
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,799
I don't know if they will come and talk to me again.

244
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,280
Oh, then

245
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,000
Maybe you have to hire me as your personal bodyguard.

246
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Is that okay?

247
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Okay.

248
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Do you have a lover?

249
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Not yet.

250
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,480
Me too.

251
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,520
I also don't have a lover.

252
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
It's strange to believe you.

253
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
It's real.

254
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
So I can

255
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Can I flirt with you?

256
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
It's up to you.

257
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,520
What kind of guy do you like?

258
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,960
I like to rely on personality.

259
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
That's the personality of rich people.

260
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Are you rich?

261
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Are you rich?

262
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
You're so rich.

263
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Want to try?

264
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,879
Do you want to go drinking tonight?

265
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,080
It's at Ku Chill.

266
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,840
Hey, have you been drinking? Or a good child?

267
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,240
Are there any?

268
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,520
If so, you will know

269
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,920
whether the child is good or not.

270
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,200
Okay.

271
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
I'll come pick you up later.

272
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Hey, let me send you the location.

273
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,800
Dad! I'm hungry! Is there anything to eat?

274
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,600
Definitely curry.

275
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,240
There,

276
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,000
Another fried egg please.

277
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,000
Giving instructions like a boss?

278
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,080
If you want to eat fried eggs

279
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,200
Then take the eggs out and fry them.

280
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,559
Dad misses curry

281
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,600
Fried eggs are my favorite dish.

282
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,320
I'll go see my friends tonight, dad.

283
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,520
Came back a little late.

284
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
YES.

285
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,080
But before I go,

286
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,000
Download Excel for dad. Leave it there for a few days.

287
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,600
And remember to teach dad how to use it

288
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,720
Don't forget anti-virus software, too.

289
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
And also...

290
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Pete!

291
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Okay dad, I'll do it for you tomorrow.

292
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
Oh!

293
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,200
Where has the money from daily sales gone?

294
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Let's go!

295
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,600
Hey, if your mother catches you, will anything happen to you?

296
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Getting slapped, nothing more.

297
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,040
My mother doesn't like me going out.

298
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,360
One night, going out for a barbecue with friends,

299
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,840
always go to sleep when you come back.

300
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,520
When I wake up in the morning,

301
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,960
Mom knew I was going to have a barbecue,

302
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,680
Give me a severe slap.

303
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,360
Oh, my mother is also fierce.

304
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,320
It's a pity if someone is as beautiful as you

305
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,440
kept at home like that.

306
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,320
 No wonder I've never seen you at any shop.

307
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,880
 You must have gone to all the shops in An Thong to find prey, right?

308
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
 What are you talking about?

309
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,400
 That's an exaggeration.

310
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,160
 No one does that.

311
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
 Admit it.

312
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,920
 I won't say anything.

313
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,640
 Because if I can go

314
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
 then I'll go too.

315
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,480
 Can you take me there?

316
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
 Go!

317
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
 Wait a minute!

318
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,880
Let's go!

319
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,480
Hug tight!

320
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Sao?

321
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,679
I have something better to show you.

322
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,960
What? Really?

323
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Come on!

324
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,800
My goodness!

325
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,480
Oh, Pete!

326
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,560
Have you slept with her yet?

327
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,520
What are you talking about?

328
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,000
I just met you today!

329
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,960
Don't worry.

330
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
No more than 2 or 3 days.

331
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
I ate it!

332
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Absolutely!

333
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,200
When are you done?

334
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,560
it's my turn.

335
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,960
Why do you say that?

336
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,440
Brothers and sisters, of course.

337
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm done, then it's you.

338
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Sure!

339
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,039
Remember to film it.

340
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,440
Absolutely.

341
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,999
Let me handle it.

342
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,040
Okay, okay!

343
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,880
Next, next.

344
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,200
We wait.

345
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,560
Older sister!

346
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,720
Thongdee!

347
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,840
Here?

348
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Uncle Gim!

349
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,280
Is Uncle Gim sleeping yet?

350
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,520
Who is that?

351
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,520
Kay here.

352
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,560
Is something wrong?

353
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,680
Where?

354
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
It's there, Uncle Gim.

355
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Oh!

356
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,239
- This. - What?

357
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
This way!

358
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,480
Stay away!

359
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,160
Let's see!

360
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,840
Avoid watching!

361
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
Thong!

362
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,160
You!

363
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
What are you doing?

364
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,360
What are you doing here, Thong?

365
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,440
Are you crazy?

366
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,520
I can't imagine

367
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,560
You act so lowly again!

368
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,640
Are you coming down?

369
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,800
Not coming down, right?

370
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,720
Get down for me, get down here.

371
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,680
- Uncle! - Star?

372
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,280
Stop it, go somewhere else and fight.

373
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,960
My son is here.

374
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,640
How can I go somewhere else?

375
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,880
Pull it down so I can hit it.

376
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,280
Don't be nosy!

377
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Thong!

378
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,840
Where are you hiding? You can't escape!

379
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,680
Today I will make your head bleed.

380
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,160
Kay, go after it.

381
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,440
Let's go!

382
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,760
Hurry up!

383
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,840
Stop it!

384
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Why not follow it?

385
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,480
These idiots!

386
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,200
Go!

387
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,080
Okay?

388
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,120
Hey, sister!

389
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,760
Car won't start, won't start!

390
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,040
Kay!

391
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,960
Look at your motorbike, learn how to change spark plugs.

392
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,120
Does it hurt?

393
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,400
No pain. I'm used to it.

394
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,520
Sorry. I shouldn't have asked her out.

395
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,880
No need to apologize.

396
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,680
It's what I wanted to come. I don't want to stay home.

397
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,120
Hate my house, hate my mother.

398
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,999
One day, I will escape to Bangkok to live.

399
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,760
And will not set foot here again.

400
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,160
Don't go back to see her again.

401
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,560
Hey, Thong, calm down.

402
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,200
After all, she is a mother.

403
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,840
That old woman is not my mother.

404
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,319
My biological mother abandoned me for her to raise.

405
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
She raised me like a pig and a dog, using it to give orders.

406
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,080
 I don't need to be grateful to her at all.

407
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,559
 She's the one who should be grateful to me.

408
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,240
 Mistreated me for more than 10 years.

409
00:28:07,712 --> 00:28:11,701
THE ROSE OF SIN
