Hey, Thong, calm down.

10
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,960
After all, she is a mother.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,600
That old woman is not my mother.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,079
My biological mother abandoned me for her to raise.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,080
She raised me like a pig and a dog to command.

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,840
 I don't need to be grateful to her at all.

15

 Can you watch over me for a bit?

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,080
Lots of mosquitoes. I think it's better if we go home and sleep.

Refuse.

That guy is very famous, but famous in a bad way.

What's up? Did it cause something?

42
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,320
It's been dragging my daughter to the Pub since last night.

43
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,880
They both went all night and still haven't returned, so now I have to come here to look for them.

How is Pete really doing? Are you sure?

45
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,440
What kind of father is he who doesn't know his son's personality?

She said that last night I took her daughter away.

182
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,000
Yes, but I turned the music on to drown out the sound. Mom can't hear you.

183
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Sit down.

184
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
Was she beaten more when she returned home?

185
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,440
There are more stains than yesterday.

186
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,600
Rub my wound a little. Just take it easy!

187
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
How does it feel?

188
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,880
When my mother beat me,

189
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,360
it will be painful and sharp for many days.

190
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,680
 I like having someone rub me.

191
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,280
 Rub gently, moving your hands back and forth.

192
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,520
 It feels like I'm in heaven.

193
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,640
 It's soft, makes me forget the pain.

194
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,920
 One more time, please?

195
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,520
- First time? - YES.

196
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
How do you know?

197
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,600
First-timers versus experienced people

198
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,600
is different. I know.

199
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,760
Do you have experience?

200
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,440
So why did you let me do it?

201
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,640
What's wrong with you, Thong?

202
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,680
 What's wrong with you, Thong?

203
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
 What is Thong doing?

204
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,160
 You want to make me mad?

205
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,320
 Yes, okay.

206
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,840
 You know my hand.

207
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,560
What is Thong doing?

208
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,960
 You challenge me?

209
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,840
 What are you guys doing?

210
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,919
 After seeing that, why do you still ask?

211
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,199
 Or do you want me to sit up and bounce so you can see with your own eyes?

212
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,279
 just knew what he was doing?

213
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,840
 Pete, lie down and dance again for your mother to see.

214
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
 You come here, come here.

215
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,399
 I really shouldn't have named you Thongdee.

216
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,479
 It would be more appropriate to name you Thong Yot.

217
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,040
 Why are you so flirtatious?

218
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,079
I predict that you will end up like the girls in this alley.

219
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,119
Pregnant while the breasts still have no milk,

220
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,520
The baby was born without a mother's nipple to suckle.

221
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,999
This is called a condom, used to prevent pregnancy.

222
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,520
Mom should know.

223
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,880
This slut, you really are...

224
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,919
Why are you so disgusting?

225
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
- Star? - Uncle, calm down.

226
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,279
Let go, don't interfere. You get out of my house.

227
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,920
Or do you want me to call your father to drag you home?

228
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,160
Hurry up, go away now.

229
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,319
Ill-mannered, spoiled, uneducated things.

230
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,000
Pete, let's go do round two somewhere else.

231
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,719
No, you stay here.

232
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,959
You stay here so I can punish you.

233
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,200
Before cursing others, you should curse yourself first.

234
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,959
Let's go.

235
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,560
Thong.

236
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:48,439
- Pete, go. - Thong, you can't go.

237
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,840
Thong, I said you can't go.

238
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,039
Son Thong. Ah, I remember now.

239
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,000
This nature of yours is exactly like your mother's.

240
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,799
When your mother brought you and dumped you for me,

241
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,760
He's about the same age as you are now.

242
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,879
Your mother's flirtatious gene is really strong.

243
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,319
Why do I teach good things?

244
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,880
It doesn't penetrate your brain?

245
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,079
Yes, your mother's flirtatious gene is strong.

246
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,120
I am also very proud of this gene of my mother.

247
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,039
Therefore, mothers do not need to educate their children.

248
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,399
This is your life, your body.

249
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,680
Who you sleep with is your business, not yours.

250
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,759
From now on, stop meddling in each other's personal matters.

251
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,480
Because I won't listen to you anymore.

252
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,640
Who says your life is yours?

253
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,319
I saved your life since then

254
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,120
Your evil mother brought you and dumped you for me.

255
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,879
I raised you from childhood to adulthood.

256
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Up until now, I've had enough

257
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,039
You stand here and argue with me like that

258
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,840
thanks to my rice and water.

259
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,039
You should know that your life is not yours,

260
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,359
Your life is mine, remember that well.

261
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,720
Okay, so how much do you want? Say it.

262
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,199
How much does it cost to eat, drink, and support children from childhood to adulthood?

263
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
- I will return everything. - I laughed in your face.

264
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,559
How can you afford to pay?

265
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
How much?

266
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,840
I calculated it cheaply, 10 million baht.

267
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,479
Okay, 10 million baht, right?

268
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,039
I will find it and return it to you.

269
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,960
And from now on we cut off, no longer have anything to do with each other.

270
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,439
If so, I would like to leave this damn house today.

271
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,480
Son Thong.

272
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,960
Are you very good?

273
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:32,525
I also want to know how many days you will be gone?

274
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,880
Give me back my shake.

275
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Shake what?

276
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,199
That's my anklet.

277
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,800
Please return my things here.

278
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,599
Give me back my mother's bracelet, where did she put it?

279
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,319
- What shake? - Go get the bracelet and give it back to me.

280
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,439
- I don't know anything about shaking. - Give me back my shake.

281
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,040
- Why are there any shakes? - Where did you put it?

282
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,479
Won't you return my mother's bracelet? Pete held her back.

283
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,839
Are you crazy?

284
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,159
Hold her back.

285
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,999
Don't, don't touch me.

286
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,160
Take her upstairs.

287
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,759
- I told you to let go. - Bring her up here.

288
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,600
- What do you want to do? - Bring her up here.

289
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,000
What are you doing?

290
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,360
I told you to let me go.

291
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,719
You dare do that to me?

292
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,759
I told you to let go.

293
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,959
Where is my shake?

294
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,840
What shake?

295
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,679
That's my anklet.

296
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,920
Oh, it's long gone, you idiot.

297
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,080
How much does that shake cost me that I have to keep?

298
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,680
 You're being rude, I'm your mother.

299
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,200
 Don't you think about my gratitude?

300
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,799
 I took the trouble to adopt you from your mother.

301
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,959
 Otherwise, you would have rotted in the river a long time ago.

302
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,560
 Then why don't you let me die like that?

303
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,720
 I didn't ask you to take care of me?

304
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,960
 Living with my grandmother is worse than dying, I'd rather die.

305
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,400
 I've had enough of putting up with you, I'm determined to leave today.

306
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,440
 But before I leave, I ask for compensation

307
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:05,760
 for wasting my life.

308
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
 Hey.

309
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,079
 What are you doing?

310
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,280
 Are you planning to steal my money?

311
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,240
 Let me go.

312
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,360
 I will call the police to arrest you.

313
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,799
Where is the key?

314
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,160
 Even if you beat me to death, you won't say anything.

315
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,160
 You dare steal my things to eat, Thong.

316
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,920
 A slut like you deserves to be beaten.

317
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,200
 You slut.

318
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,919
 I'll beat you to death.

319
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,280
 Thong, whatever you do, do it quickly.

320
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,640
 Since I was little, she forced me to work like a slave.

321
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,880
 From the moment I opened my eyes until I went to sleep, she made me do everything.

322
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,920
 She raised me like a dog.

323
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,960
 Never gave me any money, not even any money for snacks.

324
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,240
 I will definitely go today but I will take my wages.

325
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,400
 Let me go.

326
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:23,440
 Pete. Get your stuff.

327
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,119
 Let me go, don't take my things.

328
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,400
 Let me go.

329
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,600
 Get it quickly.

330
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,240
Don't chase after her.

331
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,040
Wait, Pete, I'll go get some things.

332
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,240
- Let go. - Give it back.

333
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,279
Go, go quickly.

334
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,760
Pete, go away.

335
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,040
Return it here.

336
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,520
Let go.

337
00:28:47,403 --> 00:28:50,859
THE ROSE OF SIN
