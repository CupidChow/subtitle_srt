THE ROSE OF SIN

00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 08

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,880
Is this Mr. Wi's market?

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
It's 10 times bigger than Thong's market.

11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,880
Next time I will take you for a walk. There's always a lot of food.

12
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:10,235
Where is Mr. Wi's house?

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,280
After this market, enter the alley and you'll be there.

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,720
I'm so nervous.

15
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,520
I'm here, Thong.

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,240
Let's go, let's go home together.

17
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:47,241
[Market Office]

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
 Come here Thong, come here and bow to your father first.

19
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,200
 Dad, today I'm taking Thong,

20
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:25,517
The woman you love comes to our house.

21
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,160
She will be a new member of our family.

22
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,560
I hope dad will love her like I do.

23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,320
And I hope dad protects Thong

24
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,480
Let her live in this house peacefully and happily.

25
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,480
Thong... I would like to rely on you, dad. That's all.

26
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,680
I have to say it again and again, what a pity.

27
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:05,704
I also want my father to meet Thong.

28
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,680
It will probably be fun to talk about.

29
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,679
Dad, if you want to talk to Thong

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,359
Dad can also enter Thong's dream.

31
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,320
Come to dream about a special number

32
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,840
so Thong can win on the 1st.

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,000
Thong, don't joke like that.

34
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:27,272
Better go find your mother.

35
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Sit here first.

36
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,839
Oh, are you here?

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,439
The food has just finished, the table is full, come on, hurry up.

38
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,520
Leave it here!

39
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,199
Eat rice, Ms. Ieng.

40
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,040
Yes.

41
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,399
Hello mom.

42
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,680
Hello child.

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,400
Wait a minute, wait a minute for your rice.

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,240
It's here, the rice is here.

45
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:04,559
This is Uncle Ieng, who has worked in my mother's house for a long time.

46
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,599
If anything happens

47
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,120
Then you can call Mr. Ieng.

48
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,999
Hello, uncle.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,080
Hello!

50
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,600
Come on, let's eat.

51
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,959
Wait, this, mom cooked for Thong

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,080
Those 3, 4 hours. Mom cooks very fragrant soup.

53
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,880
Try it, kid.

54
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Thank you.

55
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,199
Do you eat?

56
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,880
Yes.

57
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,209
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute.

58
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,600
Wait a minute.

59
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,160
This is mine.

60
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,800
Yes.

61
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,360
Thong, what happened this morning,

62
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,519
what my mother said so harshly,

63
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,519
If you forget something, forget it.

64
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,879
Don't remember what to do.

65
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
Because I just want to get to know you

66
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,599
more, just better.

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,999
We live in the same house,

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,320
No matter big or small, let's ignore each other.

69
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,759
Yes, okay.

70
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,239
Anyway, I respect my mother very much.

71
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,479
Mom is so good to me.

72
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,279
Let Mr. Wi know you,

73
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
Then I accepted you as my daughter-in-law.

74
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,399
If you have something to teach, just teach it.

75
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
YES.

76
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:25,039
Eat, eat, be careful not to get cold.

77
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,120
Eat rice.

78
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,440
Eat your vegetables.

79
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,119
Every dish is delicious, I can open a restaurant now.

80
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,879
Really, child?

81
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,319
Mom is also thinking that

82
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,919
Mom will leave the cooking to you.

83
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,360
Mom will teach you how to cook, is that okay?

84
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
Yes, okay.

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,280
Clear the table!

86
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Yes.

87
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,960
Let me help you.

88
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,319
Wi.

89
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,160
Yes?

90
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:23,399
Don't forget the tablecloth, kids.

91
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Yes, mom.

92
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Wait!

93
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Wash it already.

94
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
What?

95
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,320
Wash this bowl, wash it too.

96
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,040
Our family doesn't like to throw dishes in the sink.

97
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,760
Lots of insects and dirty.

98
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,200
Oh, thank you too, wash the sink too.

99
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Okay.

100
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,520
You're the one doing it and you dare to go against me?

101
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:04,197
It's better to pretend to be dirty, so you don't make mistakes again.

102
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Come in, baby.

103
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,760
What do you see? Can I stay?

104
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,280
Can you stay?

105
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,879
My house in the out of town is about this size.

106
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,680
Small, but warm.

107
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,480
So that's good.

108
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:46,658
Thong! Then...

109
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,120
Thank you very much.

110
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,450
For stepping forward to add color to my life.

111
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,520
Before, my life was just living day by day,

112
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:02,406
In the morning, I do bookkeeping, and in the evening, I read comics.

113
00:08:02,964 --> 00:08:05,284
Look, the cupboard is full.

114
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,120
But since I met you,

115
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,679
You are my motivation

116
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,840
wake up every day. Did you know?

117
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:18,909
Since I met you? When will we meet?

118
00:08:21,262 --> 00:08:24,222
That first time, when I rented an apartment.

119
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,920
From that day on he had been counting to see when

120
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,640
You will be allowed to collect room fees again.

121
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,720
 You're too cunning. Obviously I had a lover at that time.

122
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:38,605
 But I never thought I would flirt with you.

123
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:43,419
 Well... if only I could see your face,

124
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,800
 I feel happy already.

125
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:51,071
I won't go anywhere else. I will stay with you Wi forever.

126
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:54,325
 I will love you with all my heart.

127
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,940
 Mr. Wi, let's try again.

128
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,560
Let me teach you.

129
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,560
Teach... what?

130
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Then teach dancing.

131
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Thong!

132
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Pete.

133
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,720
 What are you doing here?

134
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,070
 We're done with each other, right?

135
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,720
 I'm like this

136
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
 have you forgotten me?

137
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:09,239
 I don't forget.

138
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,817
 I found someone to take care of me after you.

139
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:16,119
 You're not angry with me, right?

140
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:18,549
 Not angry.

141
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:21,618
 I congratulate you.

142
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:25,058
 I live with him

143
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:27,058
 then behave properly.

144
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:28,818
 Okay.

145
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:30,457
 I will act like a good wife.

146
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,538
 Be a good daughter-in-law.

147
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,618
 I know I am very lucky to have met Mr. Wi.

148
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,851
 Furthermore, his mother doesn't hate me anymore.

149
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:39,938
 Pete,

150
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:41,978
 I'm in a happy place.

151
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,738
 You don't need to worry about me anymore.

152
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,418
Follow your path.

153
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:48,658
Good luck, Thong.

154
00:10:49,218 --> 00:10:50,298
Goodbye.

155
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:51,658
Pete.

156
00:10:57,098 --> 00:10:59,577
Goodbye, Pete.

157
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:01,578
Pete.

158
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:03,578
Pete.

159
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:06,858
Pete.

160
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,297
I'm Thong.

161
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,298
Wake up, Thong.

162
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:16,578
I'm Thong.

163
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,418
What's wrong with Thong?

164
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:21,898
Why call him by name?

165
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:23,975
Who's name?

166
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,818
That's the name of Thong's ex-lover.

167
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:28,458
Are you missing him?

168
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:31,258
No sir.

169
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:33,818
Thong... It's probably just a dream.

170
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:39,585
What dream?

171
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:42,858
Dreaming of him coming to say goodbye.

172
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:44,937
It's nothing.

173
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:45,938
Don't think too much.

174
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:48,858
Don't let me hear it anymore, I won't like it.

175
00:11:50,138 --> 00:11:52,338
You are my wife, sleeping next to me.

176
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:54,218
How can you remember someone else?

177
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:55,978
Understand?

178
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:57,138
I understand.

179
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:58,578
That won't happen again.

180
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:01,592
You can rest assured now.

181
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:05,858
I don't know what time it is anymore.

182
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,458
What is this?

183
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:17,378
Why are there still pictures of him?

184
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:20,017
Probably because Thong forgot to delete it.

185
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:21,298
I will delete it now.

186
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:24,058
Does this phone still have photos of him?

187
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:26,538
Just a little bit.

188
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,493
Just delete it a bit and it's gone. Mr. Wi.

189
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:42,658
I will buy a new one for you.

190
00:12:55,378 --> 00:12:56,698
Don't dream about him anymore.

191
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:23,258
I'm Thong.

192
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:29,138
Where is Thong?

193
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,458
Hey Wi.

194
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:36,617
Mom took Thong for a walk to see the event at the market.

195
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:37,738
Go early in the morning.

196
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:41,338
Why didn't you wake me up so I could go with you?

197
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:43,657
Why do you follow?

198
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:45,297
They go to instruct each other.

199
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:47,617
If Wi intervenes

200
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,298
then you won't be able to teach.

201
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:52,658
I don't think we should stand here and talk anymore.

202
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:55,097
Go take a shower and change clothes

203
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:57,259
Then go down to eat porridge, I've finished cooking.

204
00:13:57,658 --> 00:13:58,920
Ah, yes…

205
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:00,297
Go, kid.

206
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,537
Come on, let me take you there.

207
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:06,538
- When you're done, come down to eat? - Yes.

208
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:18,658
 Hard-working person

209
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:20,897
 people have to wake up early in the morning.

210
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:24,258
 Don't you normally wake up early?

211
00:14:25,938 --> 00:14:27,498
 I want to wake up early

212
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,737
 but last night Mr. Wi kept bothering me all night.

213
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,098
 So I have to sleep late.

214
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,138
 Hey,

215
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:35,817
 is a girl

216
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:38,258
 when talking, keep your mouth shut for a bit.

217
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:41,537
 From now on no matter what happens

218
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:45,058
 you also have to wake up at 5 am, because the market opens at 5 am.

219
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:48,457
 Don't arrive later than the sales people, you know?

220
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,058
 I know.

221
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:53,337
- Hello, sister. - Hello.

222
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:55,697
What's going on, have you got your capital back today?

223
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:58,417
- I got my capital back. - Yes, good luck.

224
00:14:58,418 --> 00:15:00,337
- Hello, sister. - Hello.

225
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:02,777
- What's up? - You can also sell it again, sister.

226
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,218
Yes, that's good.

227
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:06,618
Mom.

228
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:09,018
Is it difficult to be the owner of a market?

229
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:10,538
Is it difficult?

230
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:12,938
First stage,

231
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:14,989
when it's not stable

232
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,298
it's really difficult.

233
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,498
But once it's stable, it's easy.

234
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:20,498
Idle is what my mother said

235
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:22,497
Sit around and not collect money?

236
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:24,018
That's right, sitting there without collecting money.

237
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,618
What are you asking for?

238
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,617
I want to know.

239
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:29,377
Who knows, maybe one day

240
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:31,382
What if Thong will manage the market after his mother?

241
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:36,857
Don't think too far ahead.

242
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:38,338
Like that,

243
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:41,577
before I took over the market

244
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:43,978
I still have a lot to learn.

245
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,978
Okay, mom.

246
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:47,298
Thong is ready.

247
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,658
Mom besides managing the market

248
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:04,098
There's also another pork stall here.

249
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:06,818
It was my mother's first job.

250
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,817
Such a big stall,

251
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:10,537
It must be a lot of profit, right?

252
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:11,978
That's right, there's a lot of profit.

253
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:13,617
I said, isn't that right?

254
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:15,777
That I want to continue my mother's work.

255
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:17,617
If so, then just come here to practice.

256
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:18,898
This will be the first.

257
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:21,138
Children.

258
00:16:21,378 --> 00:16:23,218
From today onwards

259
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:28,698
We have someone who comes to help every day, and that's Thong.

260
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:30,337
Mom.

261
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:31,338
Sao?

262
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:34,458
Don't want to continue anymore?

263
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:37,018
I want it.

264
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:39,257
Want it right? If you want, go.

265
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:40,258
Go.

266
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:44,618
Bring a knife and give it to him.

267
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:50,658
The first thing you need to practice is

268
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:53,218
cut the pig's head.

269
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
[Insurance]

270
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,017
First of all,

271
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:14,377
get a knife

272
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:16,698
slit from mouth to throat

273
00:17:16,898 --> 00:17:20,098
really deep inside.

274
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:22,497
I can't do it, mom.

275
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:24,138
Pick up the pig's ear.

276
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:26,738
Hurry up.

277
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:28,257
Thong!

278
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:29,697
Em Thong!

279
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:31,137
What? Go get your sniffer.

280
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:33,417
Hold it, hold it.

281
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:34,697
Come get the meat, sister.

282
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:36,257
Yai, Yai, Yai come here.

283
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:37,457
Needs some strength.

284
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,537
Please give me some strength.

285
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:40,058
Help someone who faints.

286
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:43,337
Now, leave the chair here.

287
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,778
Sit, sit, sit. Where is the sniffer?

288
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:47,778
The first day I fainted.

289
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:56,138
Who is it, sister?

290
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:04,886
Why is he such a difficult person to teach?

291
00:18:05,658 --> 00:18:06,938
What's wrong, mom?

292
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,470
Mom, I don't say bad things.

293
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:15,937
But it's an easy job that mom told me to do

294
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:18,577
Just cutting pork can't cut it.

295
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:23,458
So if you think like this, what business can you do? What do you do to earn a living?

296
00:18:24,778 --> 00:18:25,778
Mom!

297
00:18:26,378 --> 00:18:28,138
It's only the first day, mom.

298
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:29,459
Please calm down a bit.

299
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:33,378
I think cutting meat and that, you have to practice slowly to get used to it.

300
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:38,298
Oh, what else is this?

301
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:40,937
Forks.

302
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:44,658
Wanted to show Thong's dishwashing skills.

303
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:53,587
 Why is it so viscous?

304
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:57,057
 Yesterday, I left Thong

305
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:59,178
 help wash the dishes.

306
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,538
 Looking at her attitude, she didn't seem very satisfied, seeing her grumbling.

307
00:19:02,818 --> 00:19:05,058
 Probably intentionally dirty like that.

308
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:07,298
 Washing dishes is not clean.

309
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:09,298
 Is this also teasing mom?

310
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:12,538
 Mom, Uncle Ieng! I think don't rush to think deeply.

311
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:14,737
 Em Thong could be

312
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,577
 is not familiar with or not suitable for these jobs.

313
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:17,418
 But if we

314
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:19,417
 speaks slowly, teaches gently

315
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:20,658
 she can do it.

316
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:23,417
I think we should not rush to be prejudiced against each other.

317
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:24,697
I beg you.

318
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:25,698
Okay?

319
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:28,821
- Ieng! - Yes!

320
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,034
We

321
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:32,857
- must use more patience than that. - Yes.

322
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:34,057
You know what?

323
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:36,057
If you are taught and willing to listen, it is good.

324
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:37,417
But if you keep trying,

325
00:19:37,418 --> 00:19:39,658
No matter how much you teach, there will be no results.

326
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:44,618
If so, please allow me to go see her for a bit.

327
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:21,298
 Yai. What are you doing?

328
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:23,858
 What to do? Do something?

329
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:27,577
 What is that? I did not do anything.

330
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:29,377
 I'm just helping her feel less tired.

331
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:32,298
You don't need to say anything, I know what you're thinking. You bastard.

332
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:35,698
 Wherever you go, go, go.

333
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:39,657
 I'll tell mom to fire you.

334
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:42,177
 Mr. Wi. Why did you punch him?

335
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:43,778
 He didn't do anything to Thong.

336
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:45,858
 Haven't done anything yet?

337
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:48,337
 I don't like just sitting so close to each other.

338
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:51,618
 You know Yai's personality well. Don't you know what he thinks?

339
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,778
 Do you think it wants to help you feel less tired?

340
00:20:55,258 --> 00:20:57,298
 It's about wanting your body, understand?

341
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,857
 Next time, don't let me see him sitting so close to you again.

342
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:03,378
 Otherwise, I won't leave Thong alone. Got it?

343
00:21:03,498 --> 00:21:04,578
 Thong will be careful.

344
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:19,538
Thong, please sit down.

345
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:24,978
I'm Thong.

346
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,178
Sorry for making you scared.

347
00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:35,698
It's just because I'm worried about you. Don't be angry with me.

348
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:40,218
I think you should go home and rest now.

349
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:42,538
Let me tell Uncle Ieng to cook rice for you to eat.

350
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,818
But Mr. Wi, Thong wants to eat at the restaurant.

351
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:52,938
The weather is so hot today, Thong wants to sit in the air conditioner.

352
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:55,978
Mr. Wi, let's take Thong to the shopping center.

353
00:21:57,378 --> 00:22:00,738
That's OK. But let me collect the room rent first.

354
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,658
Who is that?

355
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:13,658
Oh, I know, I'm going to open the door.

356
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:16,818
Oh...

357
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:22,217
Oh, keep typing? That's the door.

358
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:24,418
Not your mother's coffin lid.

359
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:28,497
Thong.

360
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:29,502
And.

361
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:30,978
What did you come for?

362
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,017
Then come collect the room rent,

363
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,178
where you are sleeping.

364
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,498
You crazy.

365
00:22:37,978 --> 00:22:40,498
I think you should go get treatment.

366
00:22:40,698 --> 00:22:42,897
If the doctor can't cure you

367
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:44,578
Then you go find a magician to cure it.

368
00:22:46,818 --> 00:22:47,978
I'm not crazy.

369
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,177
Before, I was just a tenant.

370
00:22:50,178 --> 00:22:52,338
But now I'm the boss.

371
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:54,858
And you're still the same tenant.

372
00:22:55,218 --> 00:22:58,178
So, pay the rent.

373
00:23:00,658 --> 00:23:01,898
Fraudster.

374
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:04,578
Do you want to be the boss?

375
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:06,378
Are you Wi's wife?

376
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:09,857
That's right.

377
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:12,338
I will update my life for you.

378
00:23:12,818 --> 00:23:15,618
My husband is no longer the young brat he was before,

379
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:17,137
The person you hired to scratch your itch

380
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:18,778
Instead of using durian peel to scratch.

381
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,578
And now it's Mr. Wirachay,

382
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:24,418
owner of Sod market and this apartment building.

383
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:26,498
I hope this is my husband

384
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:28,778
I won't have you sneaking around to eat me anymore.

385
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,018
Oh, you illusion.

386
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:34,657
Hey, I've been courting Wi for almost a year

387
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:36,417
but I can't even do it.

388
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:39,258
You've only been here for a few months and you say you have her?

389
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:41,458
That's the difference in skills.

390
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:45,378
And your skills can only lure roadside dogs.

391
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:48,298
Oh, I don't believe it.

392
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:51,538
I think I'm as beautiful as you.

393
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:53,098
You liar.

394
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:55,178
You liar.

395
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,378
You liar, you'll see.

396
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:09,218
Wi, I have something to ask.

397
00:24:09,742 --> 00:24:12,822
I Wi to Thong

398
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:15,018
Come to collect the room rent on my behalf?

399
00:24:16,258 --> 00:24:19,018
So what are you two to each other?

400
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:23,858
YES.

401
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:26,138
That's it.

402
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:28,738
What did you say?

403
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:34,098
Knowing that, are you going to stay or leave?

404
00:24:34,578 --> 00:24:35,778
Why do I have to go?

405
00:24:36,178 --> 00:24:38,738
I have money and can pay.

406
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:40,372
20 thousand baht.

407
00:24:41,018 --> 00:24:43,218
The rent has increased, just increased!

408
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:45,377
Can you afford to pay?

409
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:47,618
If not, pack it up!

410
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:49,338
Who increased?

411
00:24:49,818 --> 00:24:52,697
Did you increase it yourself or did Wi increase it?

412
00:24:52,698 --> 00:24:53,738
Mr. Wi gave it to the monk.

413
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:56,818
Are you sure?

414
00:24:57,578 --> 00:25:01,178
Okay, let me call Wi!

415
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:08,138
 The same 10,000 baht is fine, I pity you.

416
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,298
 Since you're at this age, you probably won't be able to sell well.

417
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:17,778
 Don't step into my room again.

418
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:20,978
 I'm lazy when it comes to using holy water to purify myself.

419
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:25,497
 Dear Wi,

420
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:28,817
 From now on I will be in charge of collecting rent for you.

421
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,698
 I will share some of the work with you.

422
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:37,578
That's OK.

423
00:25:38,178 --> 00:25:40,098
Thank you, let's go!

424
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:49,098
Thong, do you want to visit this shop?

425
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:53,698
No, I've been to see things at this store before.

426
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:55,738
But the staff did not welcome me.

427
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:58,577
They look down on me because I can't afford it.

428
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:00,978
And then chase me away like a pig and a dog!

429
00:26:04,138 --> 00:26:05,218
Let's go, Mr. Wi!

430
00:26:05,618 --> 00:26:08,178
Thong, which set do you want?

431
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:10,858
I bought it for you, come take a look!

432
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:13,698
Really, Mr. Wi?

433
00:26:14,258 --> 00:26:16,338
But this store's items are very expensive.

434
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:20,817
Man, how expensive is that?

435
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:23,977
For me, there is no word expensive.

436
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:24,979
Come on, come take a look.

437
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:31,658
Mr. Wi, if so, can I go in alone?

438
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:45,858
Don't, don't touch it.

439
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:51,698
I told you not to touch it.

440
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:05,938
So please try this outfit.

441
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,417
Why does he have to eat outside?

442
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:19,177
Wasting money in vain, not understanding.

443
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:21,817
When it comes to pampering your husband, this girl is good at it.

444
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:24,457
Oh, Wi hasn't grown up yet,

445
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,378
Anyway, I'm addicted to it.

446
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,538
I'm back.

447
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:32,657
Who's throwing a party?

448
00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:34,777
That's why I bought so many things.

449
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,058
Oh, mom, it's all the necessary things.

450
00:27:37,218 --> 00:27:38,457
Necessary items?

451
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:41,458
Mr. Wi bought a new phone, the old one just broke.

452
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:44,218
How much?

453
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:45,498
30 thousand.

454
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:47,378
30 thousand?

455
00:27:47,538 --> 00:27:49,258
This outfit is 50 thousand 8 hundred.

456
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:53,018
- What? - This item is about 100 thousand.

457
00:27:53,818 --> 00:27:56,138
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you!

458
00:27:56,418 --> 00:28:00,177
All this place is more than 100 thousand.

459
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,417
Do you think you have a husband?

460
00:28:03,418 --> 00:28:05,058
Is it shameless to be a freeloader?

461
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:07,617
Mom! Don't be so quick to complain.

462
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:10,417
It's not just Thong's things, there's mine too.

463
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:11,817
That's right, Mr. Wi brought it out.

464
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:12,538
Okay.

465
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:15,337
Here, mom, this shirt Thong chose for me.

466
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:16,338
Isn't it beautiful, mom?

467
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:17,818
I like it very much.

468
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:21,617
This color, this pattern?

469
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,618
Yes.

470
00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:24,457
I don't think you should wear it.

471
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,577
It doesn't suit my style.

472
00:28:26,578 --> 00:28:28,978
I'm afraid you'll wear it,

473
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:31,218
The dog will chase and bite that child.

474
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:35,017
Oh, mom, it looks beautiful on me.

475
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:36,538
Can I go see it for mom?

476
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:38,498
Right? Go!

477
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,098
Go!

478
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:42,898
Mr. Wi! I feel so sorry for those shoes.

479
00:28:43,418 --> 00:28:46,417
Discounted up to 6 thousand, but no size.

480
00:28:46,418 --> 00:28:47,938
Doesn't fit my feet.

481
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:50,058
YES.

482
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:01,018
Sir!

483
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:04,777
I'm really sorry

484
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:07,978
Because I have to do this, please forgive me.

485
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:10,377
If our child

486
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:12,378
Marry this girl

487
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:15,298
then life will definitely be fishy.

488
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,978
Don't be angry with me.

489
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:36,657
 Hey, Thong! Wipe carefully, wipe clean.

490
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:39,617
 Every corner must be free of dust. Understand?

491
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:42,257
 Yes, mother, I will clean the altar thoroughly.

492
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,618
 Make dad feel really refreshed.

493
00:29:45,698 --> 00:29:48,537
 Pick up the jars, lift them up and clean the bottom.

494
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:50,297
 For convenient cleaning.

495
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:53,578
 Yes, Mom. Please allow me, Dad.

496
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:35,056
THE ROSE OF SIN
