1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,360
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:39,885
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Ms. Dao, take a look.

4
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,960
Every step of the performance,

5
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,840
eyes and posture, everything,

6
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,360
I think that acting like that, no one can replace Thong.

7
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,840
So the fact that you added the scene where Linin is raped,

8
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:00,815
I asked the scriptwriter for his opinion

9
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,440
lest it affect other scenes?

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes? I forgot.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,018
That's right.

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,840
If so, then there's no need to add the rape scene.

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,040
You see.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,080
Her acting charisma is very sharp.

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,280
Looks very qualified.

16
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:28,240
Hello Dam. Hello everyone.

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,480
You didn't tell me the shooting date, I texted you and didn't reply.

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,480
So I came all the way here.

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,200
In short, yesterday's audition,

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,680
What role can I play?

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
That...

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,520
Oh!

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
This.

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,840
Why do you do that?

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,120
What do you want?

26
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
You say it.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,760
Why are you angry?

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,633
I just came to ask about the results of the audition.

29
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,040
Because I see you're silent all the time.

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,040
He was silent

31
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,040
That means I wasn't selected, is it difficult to understand something?

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,320
Why can't you choose?

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,320
You slept with me.

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,680
I slept with you,

35
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,280
No matter what, I have to get this role.

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,640
I don't know, no matter what, I have to act in this movie.

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,880
No, I come and beg every day

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,000
only until it is received.

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,320
The female lead role has already been played.

40
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,720
And the other roles have already been played.

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,160
He also ran out of options.

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,760
So please add more roles.

43
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
If not for the female lead role

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,240
then the role of the female lead's friend is fine.

45
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,560
Hey, Mr. Dam, please help me a little.

46
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,440
Last time I was "favored" by him,

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,440
I like it very much.

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,440
You make me fascinated,

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,800
I want to be "favored" by you more.

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,000
Do you like it that much?

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,000
Actually, you can only promote one side.

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,480
Just one side is enough to make my whole body vibrate.

53
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,560
Alright. Alright.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,080
For what, I'll tell the screenwriter team,

55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,760
Let them add a role for you. Is that Okay?

56
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,280
When there's a turn, I'll tell my assistant to contact you.

57
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,800
Thank you very much.

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,960
This is my first role, I will try my best.

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,440
But who is the female lead?

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,800
New actor.

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,400
I probably don't know.

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
We'll see each other when we film.

63
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,320
I'll go home first today.

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,000
Probably including that

65
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,920
Then you also did very bad, right?

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
Want to try it?

67
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,040
Let go.

68
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,720
Does the boss dare to harass employees?

69
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:26,720
Okay, let's meet at the labor court.

70
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,040
Cut.

71
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,520
Via.

72
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,880
Stop.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
Sorry. Are you in pain?

74
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
It's OK.

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,080
Just a light hit, it doesn't hurt.

76
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,320
Thong, I'll go home first. There will be a filming session later.

77
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,800
See you later.

78
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,000
- Chris. Today's performance was very good. - Ms. Dao.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thank you, Ms. Dao.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,560
So please excuse me, I have a filming session later.

81
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,560
- Yes, go. - Hello, sister.

82
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,240
Thong, how are you? Are you tired today?

83
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,560
No, it's fun.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,160
How is Thong performing?

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,080
It's great.

86
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,960
If you don't say it, no one will know

87
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,160
I just filmed it for the first time.

88
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,400
Really?

89
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,320
Thong still doesn't know much.

90
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,760
If Ms. Dao has any suggestions, please tell Thong.

91
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,240
So will you come to my house for dinner tomorrow?

92
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,680
That will make it easier to talk.

93
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,200
Okay, just in time Thong is also free.

94
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,240
So tomorrow morning, I'll send someone to pick you up at your apartment.

95
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,800
Yes, Ms. Dao.

96
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,800
Don't call me Miss Dao anymore.

97
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,160
Can I call you Ms. Dao?

98
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:35,880
Yes, Ms. Dao.

99
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,640
Oh, whose fake bag is that?

100
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,400
Katun! Yours, right?

101
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
Bring it out immediately.

102
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,680
Goosebumps.

103
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
I'm not that poor.

104
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,680
Is it Tan's to forget?

105
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,560
That's my bag.

106
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,200
What's wrong with it?

107
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,720
Oh, is it yours Thong?

108
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,400
It's okay.

109
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,400
But let me remind you first.

110
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm the main female character.

111
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,720
Using fake products like that doesn't look good.

112
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,200
If reporters can see it

113
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,560
then everyone will talk about it.

114
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,040
I think you should change it.

115
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
Yes. Thong will be changed quickly.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,960
Goodbye!

117
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,640
Thong!

118
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,600
About what kind?

119
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,120
Mr. B will come pick you up later.

120
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,880
There's probably no need to wait any longer, let me take you home.

121
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,880
No need,

122
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
It's better for me to go back to Mr. B.

123
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,200
How could it be better?

124
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,200
What car does Mr. B drive?

125
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,200
And what do you drive?

126
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,640
No need to show off.

127
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,680
In a few years I will save enough money to buy it.

128
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,880
A few more years I said

129
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,880
How many years is that?

130
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,280
Let me tell you this, stars

131
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,720
have a stable salary and be truly rich

132
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,000
The money mostly comes from going to events and advertising.

133
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,000
But

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,560
Now I'm playing the role of a bad woman.

135
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,560
Customers probably do too

136
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,840
Don't hire people to play bad sales roles.

137
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,600
Really?

138
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,640
Really.

139
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,640
I've been in this world for a long time.

140
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,000
I know it all.

141
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,160
But it's okay.

142
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
Actually, I also have another path for you.

143
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,920
That's enough, I absolutely will not sell my body.

144
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
- Don't mention this again. - Oh, wait.

145
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
Listen.

146
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,680
I didn't mean to invite you to do those things.

147
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,080
He specified

148
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Just invite me to play a game.

149
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,160
Play easily and win real money.

150
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,920
It's real.

151
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,360
Right now I have free time so I'm playing games like that.

152
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,280
Get money regularly.

153
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,280
Interested?

154
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
This is it.

155
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,920
Let me send you the link.

156
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,280
If you want pocket money, just try playing.

157
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,720
Is that Okay?

158
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm leaving.

159
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,960
Thong! What did you say to Dam?

160
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,680
Just talking nonsense, like always.

161
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,320
Mr. B!

162
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,960
After acting so much, when will I get paid?

163
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,960
Oh.

164
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,040
Then wait for the movie to show and then people will pay.

165
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,360
It's still a long time, how can I spend this time?

166
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,320
Are you a star and have to wear fake bags like that?

167
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,080
The phone is still old.

168
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,640
You can always bring it to the museum.

169
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,160
Thong, wait.

170
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,720
This profession is like that.

171
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Movies must be shown before people pay.

172
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
When paying, people pay a deposit, you know that.

173
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,600
Hey, if you want quick money

174
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Let me find another job for you, okay?

175
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
Two to three things,

176
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,800
But as I said before, I'm tired.

177
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,240
But use what you have available,

178
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,840
No need to try to act anymore, okay?

179
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,640
Yes, tell me, what can you do to get money quickly?

180
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
Let me see.

181
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,600
Hello. Invite Ms. Thong. Ms. Dao waits inside.

182
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,560
This side.

183
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,200
Miss Dao, Miss Thong is here.

184
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,200
Thong.

185
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,880
- Ms. Dao, hello. - Hello.

186
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,280
Here, let's get to know little Diamond a little bit.

187
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,720
Dear Diamond,

188
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,040
This is Thong, my mother's new friend.

189
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,280
It's so cute.

190
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,440
The fur is so beautiful. Very soft too.

191
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,600
It takes a lot of care to get it like this.

192
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,320
Please let me brush your baby's hair again.

193
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,960
And...

194
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,400
This afternoon, take your baby for a jog and eat some vitamins.

195
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,400
- Don't forget that. - Yes, Ms. Dao.

196
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Ms. Dao.

197
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,440
Ms. Dao's house

198
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,053
That's really big.

199
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,640
How many people are there?

200
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,400
Actually, there are three people living here.

201
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
There are parents and sister.

202
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,080
The two younger brothers live in the apartment and don't come home often.

203
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,040
Oh my god, the house is so vast

204
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,360
but only three people lived.

205
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,920
Isn't that lonely?

206
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,040
Not lonely either.

207
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,520
Who are the maids, gardeners, drivers,

208
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Combined there are nearly 20 people.

209
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,520
Then there's baby Diamond.

210
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,480
She was born in this house

211
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
so it doesn't feel that big.

212
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,880
Ms. Dao, if Thong becomes an actor,

213
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,880
acted in many movies,

214
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,280
receive advertising, attend many events

215
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,040
How many years will it take?

216
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,040
Thong just got a house like this?

217
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,440
A house this size will cost money to build

218
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,800
not even 100 million baht,

219
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,320
It's expensive because of the cost of land.

220
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,520
If Thong doesn't think much

221
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,080
Then look to buy land in the suburbs.

222
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,680
Work approx

223
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,680
10 years, it will probably work.

224
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,880
So what if Thong wants to build a house next to Ms. Dao's house?

225
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
How much money do you need?

226
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,440
You're joking, right?

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,160
Thong is telling the truth.

228
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,600
Thong has dreamed since childhood that he would have a house in Bangkok.

229
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,480
Thong wants to live in the city center, a prosperous place.

230
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,840
I don't want to live in the suburbs.

231
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,840
This land belongs to Ms. Dao

232
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,360
How much does it cost?

233
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,480
Don't ask,

234
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,000
Anyway, I can't find land to buy around here.

235
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,640
Even if I work all my life, it still won't work.

236
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,120
Ms. Dao, please try to tell me the price first.

237
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,120
Maybe Thong will be able to earn it.

238
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,240
Roughly,

239
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,120
The land here is currently priced at approx

240
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
one million baht per square meter.

241
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,440
Sister's house,

242
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,440
10 Rai equals

243
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
4,000 square meters

244
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
about 4 billion baht.

245
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,920
4 billion baht.

246
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
4 billion baht?

247
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,200
4 billion...

248
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,520
- Oh. - Oh, I'm dead.

249
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,520
No need to be startled, Thong.

250
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,040
This is my husband.

251
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,920
- Oh, I thought it was dad too. - This little girl.

252
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,320
David, nothing, nothing. She is my friend. The name is Thong.

253
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,520
- Hello, Ms. Thong. - Hello.

254
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,760
What's wrong?

255
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,200
- Hello, I'm... - No need to say anything, that's enough.

256
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,000
Okay, David, you go to sleep.

257
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,680
- I'll go talk to my friends. - Alright.

258
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,120
Yes, go to sleep, go to sleep.

259
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,200
Let's go!

260
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,640
Sorry.

261
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,880
The thing is that he came but didn't tell me first.

262
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,160
This time I will probably stay for about a month.

263
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,480
Can you just sleep on the sofa first?

264
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
No need, I'm shy.

265
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,480
Let me find another place to stay.

266
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,720
You already have money.

267
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,680
If so

268
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,920
Then you should just find a room in this building to rent.

269
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,160
To stay close to me.

270
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,040
Right? I think...

271
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,880
Not more than 20, 30 thousand a month.

272
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,200
I don't have any money.

273
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,200
I've acted in a lot of movies.

274
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,440
Haven't seen any money yet.

275
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,280
If you don't have money, where are you going?

276
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,120
Pleased to serve.

277
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,840
Thong wants a large house because...

278
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,520
Thong has never had a house of his own.

279
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,840
When Thong was with his mother...

280
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,360
stay with me,

281
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,640
It's like staying at her house.

282
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,360
It's better that Thong doesn't tell his story anymore.

283
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,000
My life, it's sad.

284
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,320
Talking about it made Ms. Dao lose interest.

285
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,600
It's okay, just tell it.

286
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,200
Everyone has sad stories.

287
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,240
It's normal.

288
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,600
But Ms. Dao is so rich,

289
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,080
born into such a good family,

290
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,880
Surely there's nothing that makes you sad, right?

291
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
Yes.

292
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,360
Even though there was only one thing, it was still a very big thing for her.

293
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,600
What could make you suffer so much?

294
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,600
Then...

295
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
That's what we talk about.

296
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Dam's story.

297
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,560
One more thing,

298
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,040
When my baby Diamond was often sick.

299
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,440
Diamond, my child!

300
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,440
I'm still sick often.

301
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,800
Every time it gives me a heart attack.

302
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,840
You know what?

303
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,480
Being a rich person really likes it,

304
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,320
the most painful thing

305
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
there are only matters of men and dogs.

306
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,680
As for me,

307
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
There is no place to eat or sleep anymore.

308
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,960
Hey, Thong!

309
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,680
Now,

310
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
She has a good job to do.

311
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,400
Just try to do your best.

312
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,680
I believe one day

313
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,960
Her time will come.

314
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,200
That day will definitely come, wait and see.

315
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,400
I never wait.

316
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,800
This sister,

317
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,800
Is there a branded bag I can borrow?

318
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,280
I cleaned up the toilet.

319
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,720
I'm sure I'll be able to stay there.

320
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,040
It must not be possible.

321
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,760
I don't have enough money to rent a good apartment.

322
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,160
Please quickly find a job for me.

323
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
There is work,

324
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
but the salary is low, will you work?

325
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,200
I told you, do whatever you want.

326
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,740
Do whatever is small or big.

327
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,600
Okay.

328
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,840
Tomorrow I'll send your photos for review.

329
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,640
Take a shower, change clothes, then rest.

330
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,080
Yes.

331
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
What's wrong with you?

332
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,400
Nothing. Just

333
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,960
You see it's big.

334
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,640
Big handbag can hold a lot of things, right?

335
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,920
There's nothing left, right?

336
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,680
One, two, three. Dance.

337
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,400
Let's make a cool expression. Any.

338
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,000
One, two, three. Dance.

339
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,920
One, two, three.

340
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,760
Confident expression and...

341
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,480
Let's do the polishing action.

342
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,600
How dare you chase me away?

343
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,800
I will tell everyone what you did to me.

344
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,560
- How dare you chase me away? - Calm. Stop it.

345
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,240
I don't stop.

346
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,640
- Let go. - This.

347
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Acting.

348
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,760
How many clothes are there?

349
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,040
It can also be washed with...

350
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,160
Let's do it again. Acting.

351
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,120
No matter how many clothes you have, they will be washed with...

352
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,840
I do everything just because I want a better life.

353
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,200
I won't let you ruin it. Do you hear?

354
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,400
Do you hear?

355
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,880
- Huh? - Cut.

356
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,200
That's good, Thong.

357
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,840
Come back again.

358
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
Hey, Thong.

359
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,440
Go take a shower and wash your hair.

360
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,080
Don't sleep like that, you'll get pimples.

361
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,080
Give me a day off.

362
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,720
I don't have the strength to do anything anymore.

363
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,160
Another day is okay, but not today.

364
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,160
Tomorrow we have a schedule to film a cosmetics commercial.

365
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,346
What if you sleep like that and get acne? Get up and take a quick shower.

366
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,360
So please refuse to turn away.

367
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,800
These days I don't have a day off.

368
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,800
Thong. Do you remember?

369
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,920
What did you say to me?

370
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,160
You said you wanted to make money,

371
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,600
I do everything.

372
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,880
Now I'm just so lazy

373
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
When will I be able to buy the brand I want?

374
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,920
I've done a lot of work, but haven't received any money yet.

375
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
You said filming commercials would get you money quickly, right?

376
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,400
I told you. The customer said it would take six months to pay.

377
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,400
I also want money.

378
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,000
Now I don't have enough money to spend anymore.

379
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,160
When the customer pays, I will send it to you immediately.

380
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,200
Trust me, I won't steal your money.

381
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,160
Go take a shower.

382
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,920
Put the cream down

383
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,960
Then go away, you can apply it yourself.

384
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,480
Do you apply it on your back?

385
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,440
Probably coming.

386
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,320
If you don't come, call me.

387
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,800
He waited in front of the room.

388
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,520
Okay, no more applying.

389
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,880
Hello Ms. Dao.

390
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,640
- Hi everybody. - Hello Ms. Dao.

391
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,080
Thong, I brought you shoes to wear in this scene.

392
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,280
Now Linin has an adoptive father.

393
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,680
Must wear branded goods.

394
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,000
Try it on, see if it fits.

395
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,520
Fits well, very beautiful.

396
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,840
It must be very expensive, right?

397
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,840
Not much.

398
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,760
Once you bring it into the scene, you can take it home.

399
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,520
She gave it to me.

400
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,800
This brand, a pair costs up to tens of millions, Ms. Dao.

401
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,280
If it's that expensive, Thong won't accept it.

402
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,360
Thong is very shy.

403
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,640
Just take it, I won't bring it anymore.

404
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,200
As an actor, you have to wear nice clothes.

405
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,120
You know wearing casual shoes is not worthy of your status, right?

406
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,040
If you don't ask the maid to clean out the shoe cabinet

407
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
I also forgot I had these shoes.

408
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,040
Just take it and use it.

409
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,560
The next day she took more.

410
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Thank you.

411
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,760
Chris, how are you?

412
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,080
Have you read the script yet?

413
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,960
Today must be sure.

414
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,240
Mr. Dam, now Thong is standing in front of your house.

415
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,440
What's going on? Why did you bother coming to see me?

416
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,760
Normally, even if you invite me, you won't come.

417
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,880
Or...

418
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,880
Are you soft-hearted this time?

419
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,360
Well, I didn't come to give myself away.

420
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,480
I came to ask you to teach me how to play the game you once invited me to play.

421
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,400
What do you think it is?

422
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,480
Do you want money to spend?

423
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,920
Come here, I show you, come here.

424
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,800
The first step is to register an account, like this.

425
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,440
Hey, who brought you home?

426
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,640
Mr. Dam.

427
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,720
What about Dam? Why did you go with Dam?

428
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,600
I went to his house so he took me home.

429
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Come to his house at such a late hour?

430
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,080
What are you going to do with it?

431
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,560
All he could think about was this in his head, so that was all he could think of.

432
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,480
I came to talk about work.

433
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,520
What job?

434
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,880
Can you not ask too much?

435
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,680
It's okay to know that nothing has been done to me.

436
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,280
If you ask too much, go somewhere else to live. I'm tired of hearing you complain.

437
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,320
Hello?

438
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,560
Hello, Si, are you sleeping yet?

439
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,560
Sleeping, what's wrong?

440
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,560
Sorry, I need money urgently.

441
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,800
Please send me 5,000 baht, then I will return it.

442
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,560
What?

443
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Hey, what do you need money for in the middle of the night?

444
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,440
It's urgent, please send it to me.

445
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
It's a long story, I'll tell it, you can pass it on to me.

446
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Yes, let me move now.

447
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,840
Thank you, please move it!

448
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,680
YES!

449
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
Are you fooling me?

450
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,400
Thong!

451
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,400
Thong, aren't you awake yet?

452
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,320
Thong!

453
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,400
What time is it?

454
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,120
It's 6 o'clock Thong!

455
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,120
It's okay to wake up.

456
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,720
Thong!

457
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,960
Up so late?

458
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,440
Older brother!

459
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,320
Please give me an advance of 5,000 baht.

460
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,400
I'll deduct it from your advertising money.

461
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,400
Why get 5,000 baht?

462
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,440
Buy things online, but my account is out of money.

463
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,800
Hey, Thong, what did you buy?

464
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,880
Last week I transferred you 20,000 baht.

465
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,480
Use it sparingly!

466
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,680
Don't talk too much, it's your money.

467
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,400
I just ask for an advance payment.

468
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,960
Move! 10,000 baht.

469
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,400
YES.

470
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Let me move, get ready.

471
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,520
Thong!

472
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,200
What did you do to get such black eyes?

473
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,040
Pass it to me!

474
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,560
Mr. Dam!

475
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,840
Mr. Dam!

476
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,400
This.

477
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,640
Don't do that, otherwise people will see.

478
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,120
I'm just happy to meet you.

479
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,400
I texted but got no reply.

480
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,080
I'm busy these days.

481
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,360
Remember, while on set,

482
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,960
don't bother me.

483
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,640
I'm professional.

484
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,800
I know what to do, what not to do.

485
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,960
But I already know the dialogue by heart.

486
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,440
So as not to lose the reputation of your beloved chicken.

487
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,920
No one is your pet chicken.

488
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,720
I'm just like many other actors.

489
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,240
Remember!

490
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,120
Yes, Mr. Director...

491
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,120
big!

492
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,960
Everyone!

493
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,520
This is a new actor.

494
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,040
She plays Linin's friend, named...

495
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,920
- Malee! - Thong!

496
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:46,419
THE ROSE OF SIN
