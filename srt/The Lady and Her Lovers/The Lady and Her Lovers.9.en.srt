THE ROSE OF SIN

00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,940
THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 09

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,140
Please allow me, Dad.

10
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:05,178
 What are you doing?

11
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:06,757
 What are you doing?

12
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:09,157
 I didn't mean to, it was because the chair slipped.

13
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:11,437
 - Why did it suddenly slip? - What's going on?

14
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,698
 - Look. - Dad!

15
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:15,637
 Who did that?

16
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:18,778
 So this one, no one else, this one did it.

17
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:22,597
 Just tell him to clean the altar,

18
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:25,157
 hope the altar will be clean.

19
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:28,517
 But it was intentional

20
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:31,258
 throw your father's ashes down like this.

21
00:01:32,998 --> 00:01:34,818
 Grandpa!

22
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,178
 I'm sorry.

23
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:41,378
 Em Thong!

24
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:48,778
If you do it wrong the first time,

25
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,778
I won't say anything.

26
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,778
But how many times has this been?

27
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:56,138
I've missed it so many times.

28
00:01:56,238 --> 00:01:58,898
Whatever your mother asks you to do, something always happens, right?

29
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:02,797
Every day my mother says I did it on purpose, I pretended.

30
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:04,098
I don't believe it either.

31
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:06,738
After all, did I do it on purpose?

32
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:09,458
I asked if you did it on purpose?

33
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:16,538
How can you do that? Tell me.

34
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:18,738
What you did, did you do it on purpose?

35
00:02:19,998 --> 00:02:21,778
Yes? Thong!

36
00:02:22,998 --> 00:02:24,538
How can you do that?

37
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:27,698
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,218
I have something to confess.

39
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,098
Actually

40
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:36,738
I don't do anything soulful.

41
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,898
When I'm at home,

42
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,218
I'm also clumsy like that.

43
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:43,637
Until here,

44
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:47,178
My mother and uncle often give me errands.

45
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:49,258
I don't dare refuse.

46
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:52,178
I'm afraid people will say I'm lazy

47
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:54,197
so I just try.

48
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:57,818
But I didn't think the consequences would be this bad.

49
00:02:58,118 --> 00:02:59,038
Actually just now,

50
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,258
Mom told me to clean the altar, Mr. Wi.

51
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:04,898
But because of you,

52
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:08,938
I just realized that Mr. Wi loves his father very much.

53
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:11,957
So Thong cleaned the urn for his father.

54
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,077
Probably Thong

55
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:18,658
I accidentally wiped it too hard and it fell and broke like that.

56
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,538
I said it all the time

57
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,237
is not true.

58
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:30,778
I saw with my own eyes that she broke it.

59
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:33,917
What is Thong doing like that, Mr. Wi,

60
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:36,557
while the cleaner is also Thong.

61
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:39,698
Thong really didn't mean it.

62
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,298
Thong was not intentional.

63
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:55,900
Mom.

64
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:58,640
Mr. Wi.

65
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:04,698
I sincerely apologize from the bottom of my heart.

66
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:12,357
Thong only has good intentions.

67
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:14,658
 But Thong is useless.

68
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,978
 Everyone can punish Thong.

69
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:22,157
Mom, please punish Thong.

70
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:25,077
- Mom, please punish Thong. - Thong, that's enough Thong.

71
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:27,437
Thong is wrong, Mr. Wi.

72
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:29,877
I know Thong has good intentions, so I'm happy.

73
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,418
Don't cry anymore.

74
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:37,818
Next time please be more careful.

75
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:55,458
The lady sold me half a kilo of pork.

76
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:57,189
[Fresh pork. Wholesale price]

77
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:02,298
35 baht.

78
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:15,258
The lady gave me a bottle of pig's blood.

79
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:17,397
With Yes.

80
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:19,338
Yes, you bastard.

81
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:20,858
What did you come here for?

82
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:22,978
I came to buy things, what do I do?

83
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:24,677
But today I'm lucky

84
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:26,738
met the market owner's wife.

85
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:29,437
I see you act very nice,

86
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:31,957
I thought I could lie down and not be the boss,

87
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,437
Who knows, she becomes a pork seller.

88
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:38,157
I sell pork better than you sell "oysters".

89
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:40,157
You go away, get out of my shop.

90
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:42,357
I don't sell people like you.

91
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:45,397
- Are you chasing away customers? - Yes.

92
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:47,197
Okay.

93
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:49,797
If Wi knew about this

94
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:51,578
You wait and see what he will do.

95
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:55,477
Someone please come sell this old bitch.

96
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:56,778
I'm going to rest.

97
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,557
God, you act like you hate me.

98
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:02,258
You also use the "oyster" to make profit.

99
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,717
What do you get?

100
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:08,037
Get me a bottle of pig's blood.

101
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:10,357
- What to get? - I'll take this from you.

102
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:12,157
- This and this. - YES.

103
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:13,357
Take a lot, bro.

104
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:15,898
- Okay, okay. - I'm hungry and upset.

105
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,458
Wait.

106
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,458
What do you get?

107
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:27,018
Cool water for hot-tempered people.

108
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:28,717
Stay away from me, Yai.

109
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:30,578
Otherwise you'll both get punched now.

110
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,218
No need to be afraid.

111
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:35,418
I saw Mr. Wi driving out on business.

112
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,338
It's done.

113
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:42,677
So why don't you go transport pigs today?

114
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:44,978
Why are you free to come sit here?

115
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:46,197
Today is your day off.

116
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,578
People who work should have days off.

117
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:51,717
 If you work every day without a day off, you will die.

118
00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:53,418
 Do you have a day off?

119
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:55,117
 Why don't you have it?

120
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:57,117
 When I wake up in the morning, I go to sell pork.

121
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:59,117
 Come home in the afternoon and continue doing housework.

122
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,277
 There is also no salary.

123
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:01,738
 Being wronged is like a child.

124
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,258
 But there's one thing

125
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:05,597
 I really like going to bars

126
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:07,898
 wants to go dancing or get drunk one day.

127
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:09,877
 But Mr. Wi falls asleep at 9pm,

128
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,157
 I wonder why I'm so sleepy so early.

129
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:13,018
 The monk at the temple sleeps even later than this.

130
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:15,877
 So do you want to go with me?

131
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:17,117
 Are you crazy?

132
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:18,317
 Do you want to die?

133
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:19,997
 If you dare to do that, you won't just get punched,

134
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:22,197
 and both of them will have their necks broken and die.

135
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:23,277
This.

136
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:26,418
Thong just sneak out and don't let Wi know.

137
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:28,397
How could he not know?

138
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:30,538
They both sleep in the same room.

139
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,498
Oh. It's late, but I didn't hurry up to get my makeup done and my hair done.

140
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,698
Wait.

141
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:54,378
There's still powder on your nose. Just applied powder, right?

142
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:55,757
I said it already, right?

143
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:58,058
Before leaving home, check carefully.

144
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:00,298
Go get salt water to wash your nose.

145
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,717
Then hurry up and get ready, the guests are here.

146
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:04,058
Yes, mother.

147
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:10,738
Oh you.

148
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:11,997
Clink glasses.

149
00:08:11,998 --> 00:08:13,738
You're also really funny.

150
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:16,957
Your business is really thriving these days.

151
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,258
Yes.

152
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:23,955
This guy.

153
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:25,755
I once made fun of the police.

154
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,075
I paid a sergeant 200,000 baht for the crossing fee.

155
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:30,075
Let it be divided among the people on its team.

156
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,075
Then I went and told the people in his team

157
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,795
I paid 200 thousand baht for it separately.

158
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,795
That's when things became very funny.

159
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:37,376
The whole group argued loudly.

160
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:44,035
So those people didn't let anyone come and ask you?

161
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:46,035
For example, ask how much you ended up paying.

162
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:48,835
Oh, I'm not stupid enough to wait for them to ask.

163
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:50,835
I have run away far away.

164
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:52,916
These people who like to steal money, I understand very well.

165
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:56,976
No one has ever been able to play on my head.

166
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:03,315
So you called me here

167
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:06,056
I hope you don't want to play with me, right?

168
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:10,496
Jan.

169
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,776
Take the children out first.

170
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:15,715
And ordered everyone not to bother.

171
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:17,216
He is talking about work.

172
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:19,696
Power, Māte.

173
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:30,536
You came here to sell me things.

174
00:09:31,516 --> 00:09:33,536
I want to go out and discuss things properly.

175
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:35,416
Or do you want something to happen?

176
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:39,456
Business types like ours,

177
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:41,936
It also depends on whose ability is greater.

178
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,296
You're not going, right?

179
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,896
Because my side is bigger than yours.

180
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:57,585
Jan.

181
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,216
Except.

182
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:06,275
You guys remember this carefully.

183
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:07,675
I don't interfere in anyone's business.

184
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:09,976
Then don't let other people interfere in my business.

185
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:11,275
With Jan.

186
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,475
You are the mother of this group,

187
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:14,915
then that's your problem.

188
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:19,376
But don't expect me to bow to you.

189
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:22,376
Today I just splashed pig's blood.

190
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:25,976
But next time you guys will bully me again,

191
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:27,376
It's not pig blood anymore

192
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:29,976
it's the blood in your heads.

193
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:33,875
Stop. Go get cleaned up.

194
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:35,595
Lest outsiders see it

195
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:37,395
I'll think it's on your face

196
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:39,376
I have menstrual bleeding.

197
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,776
And.

198
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:45,955
You think this Jan

199
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:48,395
Will I let you scold me and let it go easily?

200
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:49,896
Guys. Catch it again.

201
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:54,115
- Let me go. - Don't let go.

202
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:55,275
This.

203
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,896
Are you going to behave like a stray dog?

204
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:59,856
Yes, and also a dog that can attack and bite people.

205
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:02,395
Except.

206
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:03,356
Yes, mom.

207
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:05,195
I'm on the right, you're on the left.

208
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,496
Okay.

209
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:16,176
I'll reward you with this.

210
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,915
Let me go.

211
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,176
I said let go.

212
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:23,195
What game are you playing?

213
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:25,296
Noisy outside.

214
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:28,595
We're just playing a movie game for fun.

215
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:31,395
Hurry up and prepare properly, the shop is about to open.

216
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:33,696
Okay, man.

217
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:38,555
You know that right?

218
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:41,715
that now I am Mr. Bun's favorite person.

219
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:43,715
If Mr. Bun knew what you did to me

220
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:46,016
then your skull definitely has a hole.

221
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:48,555
But I won't tell Bun,

222
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:50,755
I still want you to be alive

223
00:11:50,756 --> 00:11:52,656
fight with us for a long time.

224
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:55,096
And.

225
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:57,795
Here you are alone, alone

226
00:11:57,796 --> 00:12:00,096
Don't bother with us.

227
00:12:00,196 --> 00:12:01,915
But if you want to turn around and make peace,

228
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,715
loyal to us,

229
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:06,856
Just a plate of Som Tam is enough for us to agree.

230
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,555
Go, Malee.

231
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:11,296
Go wash your face and take a shower.

232
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:18,816
You bastard.

233
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,016
 I've already called someone to handle it and put the body on a rubber chair, Mr. Bun.

234
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:27,715
 And his car

235
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:30,023
 let someone disassemble each part and sell it.

236
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,976
 So the image is on CCTV

237
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:35,075
 What happens when they come in?

238
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:37,376
 I've had someone delete everything, Mr. Bun.

239
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:39,595
Who is that?

240
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,656
 Si.

241
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,216
 Come in.

242
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:55,675
 Hello Mr. Bun.

243
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,395
 Came here today

244
00:12:57,396 --> 00:12:58,715
 is something wrong?

245
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:00,016
Come here, come here.

246
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,856
Sit close to me.

247
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:03,856
Si came to resign.

248
00:13:04,236 --> 00:13:06,256
Si also knows his rules well.

249
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,016
When working with you

250
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,016
then there is only entry

251
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:14,075
no out. But if you want out

252
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:16,736
must come out with a body without a soul.

253
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:18,256
The thing is

254
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:20,195
Mr. Bun can trust Si.

255
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:23,216
Si will definitely not bring the inside out to the outside.

256
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:26,616
But Si really can't continue to endure it, Mr. Bun.

257
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:28,976
Arguing again?

258
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,216
Why do Si think so much?

259
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:33,035
Si, people have quarrels,

260
00:13:33,036 --> 00:13:35,035
New life has color.

261
00:13:35,036 --> 00:13:36,195
Initial,

262
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:38,136
Si can also endure

263
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,635
but later,

264
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:43,515
Jan brought Malee to give to Bun

265
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:46,456
and Mr. Bun made her the top dancer.

266
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:49,315
Then those two

267
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:51,995
follow Si lagoon every day.

268
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:53,616
Especially Jan.

269
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:55,936
But as far as you know

270
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:00,016
then Si is not inferior to anyone.

271
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:02,835
And Si also quarrels with Jan.

272
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:04,835
Jan is an adult.

273
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:06,035
And...

274
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:07,635
It's okay to put up with her a little.

275
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:09,296
It will all end.

276
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:13,496
There are only two people here that Si accepts to endure,

277
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:15,976
It's Mr. Bun and So.

278
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:19,856
In addition, Si does not accept bowing to anyone.

279
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:26,016
Good.

280
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:28,216
I like people like that.

281
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:36,736
And.

282
00:14:37,756 --> 00:14:39,096
This is it.

283
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:43,696
I'll go find a nice guy for you.

284
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,696
Bring it to me as a gift.

285
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:47,696
If you are satisfied

286
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,116
I'll make her the top dancer instead of Malee.

287
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:53,336
And Si

288
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,616
will become madam instead of Jan.

289
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:03,948
Here's warm milk, Mr. Wee.

290
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:05,475
to sleep well.

291
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:07,336
Oh, Thong,

292
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:10,195
No need, I've already brushed my teeth.

293
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:11,496
Thong, please drink.

294
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:15,195
I do it for you.

295
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:17,056
I feel so sorry for myself.

296
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,755
Come on, give it to me.

297
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:20,296
Give me.

298
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,096
Lest Thong feel sorry for himself.

299
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:26,696
Mr. Wi, please drink it all.

300
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:34,176
So good.

301
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,256
Today

302
00:15:37,716 --> 00:15:39,355
How are you doing selling pork?

303
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:40,703
Are you more familiar with it yet?

304
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:42,395
It's better now.

305
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:44,675
But when chopping bones

306
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,955
It's so difficult. Thong has no strength.

307
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:49,696
Today, it was so tight that my arm was about to break.

308
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:52,816
I love you so much, let me massage you.

309
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:55,916
What about Yai?

310
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:58,216
Will he come hug me again?

311
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:01,155
He doesn't dare anymore.

312
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:04,542
Being scolded by Mr. Wi that time must have scared me for the rest of my life.

313
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:09,016
Thong, don't get too close to him.

314
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:10,715
That Yai guy can't be trusted.

315
00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:12,296
He is very promiscuous.

316
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:15,816
He likes it

317
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:19,856
flirt with women everywhere.

318
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:23,475
Mr. Wi.

319
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:24,776
Mr. Wi.

320
00:16:27,516 --> 00:16:29,075
Mr. Wi, sleep well.

321
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:30,376
See you tomorrow.

322
00:17:30,436 --> 00:17:31,515
Flirting with girls at that table?

323
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,155
- Impossible. - What else?

324
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:35,456
I have to stay and be a dog guard for you.

325
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:37,016
Don't want to be criticized by anyone.

326
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:38,835
Mr. Wi is very jealous.

327
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:41,136
You know, I don't want to get into trouble.

328
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:43,555
It takes a long time to come.

329
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:46,056
Don't let me tease girls, it's so sad.

330
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:49,936
So here goes.

331
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:51,936
You can flirt with me too.

332
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,275
Just have fun, don't take it seriously.

333
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:55,795
Only sweet when at the shop.

334
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:57,315
When you leave the shop, it's all over.

335
00:17:57,316 --> 00:17:58,395
Is that Okay?

336
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:00,376
You know Mr. Wi already.

337
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:06,096
 Hello.

338
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:07,395
 You're so cute.

339
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:08,816
 Can you flirt?

340
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,035
 Okay.

341
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:11,462
 My lover is dead.

342
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:13,296
 Sleep like the dead.

343
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:15,176
 Drink up.

344
00:18:23,676 --> 00:18:24,976
 Seven. [Market]

345
00:18:25,676 --> 00:18:27,056
 - Eight. - Eight.

346
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:29,376
 - Nine. - Ripe.

347
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,436
 Ten.

348
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:32,776
 - That's enough. - That's enough.

349
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:34,256
 Go away.

350
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,195
Why are you bothering me anymore, Si?

351
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:50,136
Today, Si came with good intentions.

352
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:52,195
People like you have good intentions.

353
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:54,475
You hug Luk Nimit and come here to tell me I don't believe it either.

354
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:55,816
Say whatever you want.

355
00:18:56,476 --> 00:18:59,475
Sister Si just wants to be friends with Thong.

356
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:00,755
This is it.

357
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:02,195
Let's Line each other up.

358
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:04,496
Let's talk about something.

359
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:07,395
Someone like you wants to talk to me?

360
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,995
Talking or cursing here.

361
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:10,995
I won't fall into your trap.

362
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:14,136
The more kindly you speak, the more unreliable you are.

363
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:16,736
Go wherever you want, so I can still sell things.

364
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:18,435
Thong to!

365
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:20,435
You see,

366
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:23,715
I'm not happy here at all.

367
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:25,835
Have to get up early to sell meat.

368
00:19:25,836 --> 00:19:26,955
Oh my.

369
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:29,256
My face is all oily.

370
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,995
If Thong changes his mind,

371
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:35,216
I want to work comfortably, wake up late and get a high salary

372
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:38,075
Then just think of her.

373
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,376
You bastard!

374
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:40,955
I'm selling pork, right?

375
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:42,696
Why did you invite me to sell clams?

376
00:19:43,396 --> 00:19:44,696
You...

377
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:47,075
Everyone, come and look at this.

378
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:48,835
This brazen old thing,

379
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:51,115
is tricking other people's children into selling their bodies.

380
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:53,955
Hey, still standing here in that dog skin suit.

381
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:56,256
Everyone, come see.

382
00:19:57,076 --> 00:19:58,376
HAS!

383
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:00,936
I think I should go home today.

384
00:20:00,996 --> 00:20:02,635
The next day she came again.

385
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:05,216
When will Thong change his mind?

386
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,835
That kid is gone, everyone! [Fresh pork]

387
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:12,976
Whoever has a daughter at the counter should be careful not to be seduced by her.

388
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,056
Hey bro!

389
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:26,016
Is it okay if I don't accept customers today?

390
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:28,016
Let me stay in the bedroom.

391
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:30,435
You did too many rounds today.

392
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:33,056
I have pain all over my body.

393
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,736
Alright.

394
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,515
You must know how to preserve the goods for me.

395
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:40,075
If it's broken

396
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:42,376
it won't be possible to fix it anymore.

397
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:45,256
You will also use it for a long time.

398
00:20:46,156 --> 00:20:49,856
Malee, both beautiful and cute!

399
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,182
It's really hard to find.

400
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:55,275
It's really difficult.

401
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:58,715
More beautiful than me, everyone is already a celebrity.

402
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,795
But I'm lazy, I don't like it.

403
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:03,515
Don't want to show your face to the media.

404
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:05,515
I like something, it's bad, it's bad,

405
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:07,816
That's why I became your junior.

406
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:15,835
Si wants to meet you.

407
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:18,376
- Yes, come in. - Come in!

408
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:29,456
So I can come another day.

409
00:21:29,716 --> 00:21:31,915
Looking at his appearance, it seems he is busy.

410
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,216
No need.

411
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:35,416
If you have something, say it quickly.

412
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:36,875
Don't hesitate anymore.

413
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:38,176
I don't like.

414
00:21:40,556 --> 00:21:42,656
Then yesterday,

415
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:50,835
yesterday when you said you wanted to

416
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:53,936
I will find the goods for you.

417
00:21:55,476 --> 00:21:56,816
Like this.

418
00:21:57,476 --> 00:21:59,216
Do you like it?

419
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:20,016
Prefer.

420
00:22:21,276 --> 00:22:22,616
I want to marry this person.

421
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:40,355
What's up, Mr. Wi?

422
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:42,275
Drink hot milk before bed

423
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:43,555
to sleep well.

424
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:45,435
Oh, I slept so well.

425
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:47,995
Last night, I don't know when I slept.

426
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:50,296
- So continue drinking today. - Okay.

427
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:54,115
Thong, I want to eat cookies.

428
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:56,115
Eat it with milk, can Thong go get it for me?

429
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:58,656
Okay, Mr. Wi, please wait for me.

430
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:14,896
The cookies are here...

431
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:17,016
Oh hey...

432
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:19,896
Don't you wait until you eat Thong's cookies?

433
00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:26,828
 Mr. Wi, if so

434
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:29,609
 Thong, can I go out for a bit?

435
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:33,275
 Okay Thong, feel free to go.

436
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:34,595
 I love Thong,

437
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:37,016
 I won't stop Thong.

438
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,955
 Thank you, Wi. If so,

439
00:23:39,956 --> 00:23:41,496
 Let's go out first, okay?

440
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:43,136
 See you again.

441
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,256
Mr. Wi.

442
00:24:26,796 --> 00:24:28,096
 Mr. Wi!

443
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,715
 Why did you do this to me?

444
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:50,656
 Mr. Wi, listen to me first.

445
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:55,035
 How could you do this to me?

446
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,635
 I'm sorry, Mr. Wi.

447
00:24:56,636 --> 00:24:58,435
 I didn't mean it.

448
00:24:58,436 --> 00:24:59,736
 Wasn't it intentional?

449
00:25:00,236 --> 00:25:01,696
 Wasn't it intentional?

450
00:25:02,276 --> 00:25:03,156
 Mr. Wi!

451
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:05,656
 Did you say you didn't do it on purpose when you gave me sleeping pills?

452
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:07,795
 If it was intentional, pesticides would have been used.

453
00:25:07,796 --> 00:25:09,475
 I'm sorry, Mr. Wi.

454
00:25:09,476 --> 00:25:11,016
 I'm sorry.

455
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:13,616
 You treat me so well,

456
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:16,176
 I'll give you anything you want.

457
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:18,896
You treat me so well,

458
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,115
I only ask you one thing,

459
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:22,075
Can't do just one thing?

460
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:24,056
Don't go out to play.

461
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:29,856
Who are you going with?

462
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:33,056
Go alone.

463
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:36,496
Going alone?

464
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:42,056
Go with?

465
00:25:44,196 --> 00:25:46,216
I'm really going alone.

466
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:50,376
 Going alone?

467
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:54,736
 Tell the truth, who are you going with?

468
00:25:56,676 --> 00:25:57,976
 Who to go with?

469
00:25:58,036 --> 00:25:59,595
 I'll go with Yai.

470
00:25:59,596 --> 00:26:01,275
 But there's nothing between us.

471
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:04,176
 We didn't do anything too extreme, Mr. Wi.

472
00:26:05,956 --> 00:26:07,536
 Going with Yai?

473
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:09,756
 Mr. Wi!

474
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:11,995
 Like being with Yai?

475
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:15,056
 Do you like it?

476
00:26:19,156 --> 00:26:21,715
 How? If you don't go out, will you die?

477
00:26:21,716 --> 00:26:24,096
 Will you die?

478
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:26,336
 You really want to go out, don't you?

479
00:26:26,436 --> 00:26:29,056
 How? How?

480
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,635
 Mr. Wi! I'm sorry!

481
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:33,016
 I'm sorry!

482
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:36,536
 I'm sorry, Mr. Wi, I'm sorry.

483
00:26:37,236 --> 00:26:38,595
I was wrong.

484
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:41,395
I... I... it's because I'm evil.

485
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:43,955
It's because I'm evil because I don't know how to restrain myself.

486
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:47,155
I... I won't do that again, Mr. Wi.

487
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:49,256
I won't do that anymore.

488
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:54,456
How can you believe me?

489
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:56,755
I told you not to, right?

490
00:26:56,756 --> 00:27:00,256
Still dare to disobey orders, what do you think of me?

491
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:02,675
What do you consider me?

492
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:04,435
You think I'm very stupid, right?

493
00:27:04,436 --> 00:27:06,576
Say it out loud, you think I'm really stupid, right?

494
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:11,176
I love you very much.

495
00:27:11,236 --> 00:27:13,176
I don't want to do that to you.

496
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:16,435
But Thong left me with no choice.

497
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:17,736
Remember.

498
00:27:24,116 --> 00:27:26,115
Mr. Wi! What are you planning to do, Mr. Wi?

499
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:27,416
Stay there.

500
00:27:33,516 --> 00:27:35,216
Do you like going out?

501
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:38,416
What?

502
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:41,696
Can't stay at home?

503
00:27:43,236 --> 00:27:46,576
Don't go anywhere until I give permission.

504
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:50,955
Mr. Wi! Mr. Wi!

505
00:27:50,956 --> 00:27:52,475
I'm sorry.

506
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:53,955
I won't do that anymore.

507
00:27:53,956 --> 00:27:55,475
Mr. Wi let me go.

508
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:56,955
Just let me go.

509
00:27:56,956 --> 00:27:58,576
Don't hold.

510
00:28:03,276 --> 00:28:04,816
Mr. Wi!

511
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:08,056
Mr. Wi let me go.

512
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,976
Shut up and go to sleep.

513
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:18,336
I'm sorry.

514
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:22,176
I was wrong, Mr. Wi let me go.

515
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:30,536
Thong apologizes.

516
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,696
Are you awake?

517
00:28:54,196 --> 00:28:55,496
Are you hungry?

518
00:28:56,396 --> 00:28:57,715
Let's have breakfast.

519
00:28:57,716 --> 00:29:00,016
It's still hot, I'll cook it.

520
00:29:03,716 --> 00:29:07,296
Eat quickly, it's still hot.

521
00:29:14,716 --> 00:29:16,536
Don't be afraid of me anymore.

522
00:29:16,676 --> 00:29:18,136
I don't do that anymore.

523
00:29:18,476 --> 00:29:20,496
I'm sorry about last night.

524
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,433
THE ROSE OF SIN
