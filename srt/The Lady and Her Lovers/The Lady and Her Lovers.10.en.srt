THE ROSE OF SIN

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 10

9
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,080
Are you awake?

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Are you hungry?

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,399
Let's have breakfast.

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
It's still hot, I'll cook it.

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,680
Eat quickly, it's still hot.

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,920
Don't be afraid of me anymore.

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,520
I don't do that anymore.

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,880
I'm sorry about last night.

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,160
Has Mr. Wi stopped being angry at Thong?

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,320
I'm no longer angry.

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,320
He is a person who easily gets angry and quickly forgets.

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,680
Last night I lay in regret all night,

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,399
I feel like I shouldn't do that to Thong.

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,720
You're too violent.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,720
He lay down thinking.

24
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,200
Thong is still small,

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,439
so I still want to go out,

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,040
It's normal to want to go out.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,400
Is this okay?

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,000
When I'm free, I'll sleep late

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,360
Can I go to the bar to play with Thong?

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Really?

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,200
Thank you, Mr. Wi.

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,720
If so, can Mr. Wi release Thong?

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
 No way.

34
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,560
 Because even though I'm no longer angry with Thong

35
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:37,346
 but the punishment is still there.

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
 When will you release Thong?

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,440
 then I will say it.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,360
 But Thong wants to go to the bathroom, Mr. Wi.

39
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,680
 I've already figured that out.

40
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,440
Here, Thong.

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,480
Please feel free to settle here.

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,600
When it's done, I'll take it away and dump it for you.

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,200
So how do you bathe and brush your teeth?

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,880
It's not necessary, Thong.

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,599
People don't brush their teeth or bathe

46
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,640
not dead either, right?

47
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,880
Let me go to the market to settle matters.

48
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:40,273
I hope Thong doesn't open it.

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,920
Because that will make you

50
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,680
very angry.

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,280
Understand?

52
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,040
I did it because I love you Thong.

53
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
Con.

54
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,559
As husband and wife, do not use violence.

55
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,000
Whatever can be forgiven, forgive each other, mom takes care of that.

56
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,519
Mom, I know now

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,920
What are you doing?

58
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,920
Mom, stop.

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,600
What? What do you do?

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,120
Mom is encouraging me and Thong to break up.

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,160
Do you think I don't know?

62
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,280
I didn't say it's not because I don't know.

63
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,800
I know everything.

64
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,320
But I just don't want to make a big deal out of it.

65
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,200
Anyway, it was said today, right?

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,200
You say it.

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,840
What do you not like me about?

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,919
Can you say it?

69
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Okay.

70
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,480
Since the day she entered the house,

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,880
What did her mother make her do?

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,159
Doing housework, washing clothes, cooking.

73
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,760
Start selling pork. Is that work?

74
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,320
Mom made her unable to bear it and left me, right?

75
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,239
I married a woman

76
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,439
Then you should check on her

77
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,359
Does she know how to do housework?

78
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,439
And how her mother taught her to sell pork

79
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,080
So where did you go wrong? She only graduated from 12th grade.

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,159
Grade 12 graduates

81
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,839
Can I be an accountant? Think about it.

82
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,879
Or do you want a wife and children?

83
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:40,926
Climb on the roof to repair the roof at the market?

84
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,120
Mom doesn't need to show that she has good intentions.

85
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,880
The way my mother tells Thong's bad stories to her child every day

86
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,080
I can see that the intention is not good.

87
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,080
That's right, Mom admitted.

88
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,999
Mom admitted that she would

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,079
Pull her nature out for you to see

90
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
What is her true nature?

91
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,760
What I can't accept is that she quit smoking,

92
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,959
This is murder.

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,519
Do you want to marry a woman like this?

94
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,080
Old woman, go and die.

95
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,160
It sounds like I want to slap you.

96
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,040
This woman

97
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,800
Where to live, with whom?

98
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,440
It only brings bad luck.

99
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,999
Whoever has her will suffer,

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,800
encounter all suffering, understand?

101
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,600
I want you to have good things happen.

102
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
Mom loves you, what's wrong with me?

103
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,840
Mom, what's wrong?

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,200
Mom has to stop.

105
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,359
Don't expect good things from your child anymore.

106
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,279
All my life, I have always wished the best for you.

107
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,080
Now nothing is good, I don't know how to think anymore.

108
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,800
Now I don't know anymore

109
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,520
that this is my life or my life.

110
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,200
Mom, listen.

111
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,919
If Thong brings you bad luck

112
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,559
then just let it be unlucky.

113
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,079
YES. Then it will be bad luck.

114
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
YES.

115
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
Don't touch me anymore.

116
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,360
 Otherwise

117
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,080
 I will take Thong and move him to another place to live.

118
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,080
 Move to another place?

119
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,240
 Do you dare say that to me?

120
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
 Wait.

121
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,200
 Stop and talk to your mother first.

122
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,480
 Calm down.

123
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,480
 Wi is just coming of age.

124
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,920
 When he calms down, he will come back and apologize.

125
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,920
 I think

126
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,320
 let's go solve the origin of the story.

127
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,520
 Oh, Mom!

128
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,519
 Why didn't you knock on the door first?

129
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,999
 Why should I knock?

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,279
 This is my home, I have the right to go wherever I want.

131
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
 Who else do I need to ask permission from?

132
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,599
 It's me.

133
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,679
 Because I am Mr. Wi's wife.

134
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,999
 If suddenly one day my mother dies

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,759
 then this house will fall into your hands.

136
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,079
 Please respect the future homeowner.

137
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,439
 That will never happen.

138
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,959
 Because everyone knows how rotten your nature is.

139
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,479
 You only love the things that Wi gives you,

140
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,239
 does not truly love Wi.

141
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,400
 I love you, Wi.

142
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,239
 Mr. Wi is so devoted to his children,

143
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,639
 how can you not love him?

144
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,639
 Even if what he gives you is things, money,

145
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,439
 but emotions arise from the child

146
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,799
 is true love.

147
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,839
Not.

148
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,999
You love the things Wi gives you.

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,559
And I love the giver too.

150
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,519
Let me ask you something, mom.

151
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,839
If someone comes and takes care of giving mom a comfortable place to eat and sleep

152
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,719
wouldn't mom love them at all?

153
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,519
Is it too cruel?

154
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,160
Hey, don't talk to adults.

155
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,959
No wonder, such a character

156
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
so no one wants to let them stay at their house.

157
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,000
Hey, let me tell you something.

158
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,719
Clean up all the furniture,

159
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,239
Get the hell out of my house.

160
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,399
I will give you some money.

161
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,920
Consider it

162
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,960
remuneration.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,639
Do you think I really want to stay?

164
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,639
This old building.

165
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
I really want to go.

166
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,639
But if you go

167
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
I won't bring your money with me.

168
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,959
Because I will take Mr. Wi with me.

169
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,159
Oh, you thick face!

170
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,479
Oh, it's dead.

171
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,479
The closer you are to Wi

172
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,959
then it will know your nature even more clearly.

173
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,359
And will hate you more and more.

174
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,240
Remember.

175
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,799
We still have hundreds of thousands of ways

176
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,999
to take off your evil mask.

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Just prepare yourself.

178
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,479
How are you?

179
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
- The old woman likes to set traps. - YES.

180
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,840
You do it.

181
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:51,519
No matter how many plans you have, do them all.

182
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,519
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

183
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,159
Is it fun?

184
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,919
He tied you up like a dog, are you happy?

185
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,959
Let me tell you in advance,

186
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,479
If one day you make Wi angry

187
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,399
It will tie your hands and then kill you.

188
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,519
I don't know anything.

189
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,399
Unrelated, don't know anything.

190
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,480
Tell me in advance.

191
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,680
Do you think you can make Mr. Wi angry with me alone?

192
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,160
What if I make Mr. Wi angry with you?

193
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Thong!

194
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,119
You... are you going to incite me to kill my mother? This one...

195
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,280
Well, I don't know.

196
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,679
What kind of mother raised Mr. Wi?

197
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,120
He is also the product of his mother.

198
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,399
Oh, oh, oh!

199
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,639
Make such a face,

200
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,640
Surely you're also afraid that your son will kill you, right?

201
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,039
If my mother dies at Mr. Wi's hands, then...

202
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,039
Mom please know that

203
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,079
That happens because of the mother's own nature.

204
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
This one!

205
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,480
Old woman!

206
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:54,239
Dare to go down.

207
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,080
Is it just that much slap power?

208
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,520
Hey, hey!

209
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,719
What does it do?

210
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,400
What are you laughing at? This crazy thing!

211
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,999
Just found out?

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,959
I have a nickname

213
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,280
is crazy.

214
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,600
What is it?

215
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,479
What are you going to do? Don't!

216
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,200
Don't do that!

217
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,880
You, this old woman!

218
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,280
Damn it!

219
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,839
Hey, don't!

220
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,000
Go!

221
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,439
Ieng, hurry up!

222
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,320
Hurry up! Let's go! So dirty!

223
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,919
Save me!

224
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,839
- Careful! - Thong!

225
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,559
Come back here.

226
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Thong!

227
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:08,600
Na, I don't think you should follow.

228
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,559
Why is that, sister?

229
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,199
If others see it, we will lose face.

230
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,279
If we chase it, we'll look even worse.

231
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,039
It's better to leave the crazy thing alone.

232
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,279
And if anyone asks us, we just say we don't know.

233
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,720
It's crazy.

234
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,559
Save me! Mrs. Na and Uncle Ieng hurt me.

235
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,999
Save me!

236
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,239
Mrs. Na and Uncle Ieng hurt me.

237
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Everybody!

238
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:33,960
Mrs. Na and Uncle Ieng hurt me. Save me!

239
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,599
Thong! Thong! Thong!

240
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,480
What are you doing?

241
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:38,999
- Mr. Wi! - Who did what to you?

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,880
Please help me.

243
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,560
Why do people smell like this?

244
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,159
My mother and Uncle Ieng slapped me.

245
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,559
Also, they poured urine on my head.

246
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,879
Mr. Wi, I'm so scared.

247
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,239
- I'm afraid. - Speak slowly, if you have anything, go home and say it.

248
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,839
Mr. Wi, I don't want to go home.

249
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,319
I'm afraid your mother and uncle will hurt me again.

250
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,120
I don't want to go anywhere. I'm scared, Mr. Wi.

251
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,040
It's okay now.

252
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,680
- I'm afraid. - It's okay, if you don't come back, you won't come back.

253
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,280
Don't be afraid anymore.

254
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,479
Wi, Thong!

255
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,839
Come quickly and eat french fries, they are very delicious here.

256
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,840
It's just the right amount of sweet.

257
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,600
 Go pack your things. I wait.

258
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,680
 Wi, where are you going?

259
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,839
 I told mom.

260
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,320
 Don't meddle in your child's affairs anymore.

261
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,641
 If not, I'll take her out to live. I told you.

262
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,800
 She had a bleeding mouth today,

263
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
 had urine poured on his head, who did that?

264
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,600
 Who did that, mom?

265
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,719
 How did you know?

266
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,519
Mom went to the market with Uncle Ieng.

267
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,759
Go buy new things.

268
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,200
So how is Thong now?

269
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,560
Don't act anymore, Mom.

270
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
I know mom hates her.

271
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,560
What are you worried about?

272
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,000
As for Mr. Ieng, he didn't stop him.

273
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Go!

274
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,400
Once done, let's go.

275
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,519
Wi, I beg you.

276
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,879
You stay here with mom.

277
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,199
Don't leave me, child.

278
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,999
Don't go with that evil woman.

279
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,639
I beg you.

280
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,039
Mom, listen here.

281
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,159
Anyway, I have to go.

282
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,959
Arguing to the point where we can't stay together.

283
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,039
- Mom, trust me. - Wi!

284
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,960
- Wi. - Mom,

285
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,399
In the morning I will come to work as usual.

286
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,599
In the evening, I will go back to the apartment to sleep with her.

287
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,159
That's the best way, believe me. Let's go!

288
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,640
Go, go!

289
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Let's go, Thong.

290
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,039
Thong, you take my child away,

291
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,199
- I will kill you, I will kill you. - Mom!

292
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,839
Mom, let go!

293
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,960
Mom, let go. What are you doing?

294
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,480
Go!

295
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:21,720
Thong, Thong!

296
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,680
Thong, you say it!

297
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,839
Tell me, how much money do you want?

298
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,279
Say it.

299
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,879
Thong, how much money do you need?

300
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,759
How much money do you need? Say, don't take my child away.

301
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,199
Say, don't take my child away!

302
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,160
Wi, please don't go.

303
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,080
Wi, don't go, baby!

304
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,400
Wi!

305
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:01,473
 I'm not afraid of it.

306
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,519
 Even though Si is looking for a new girl

307
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,600
 is more beautiful and tender than her daughter.

308
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,679
 But about bed matters

309
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,840
 cannot be better than my daughter.

310
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,239
 Women can tie the heart of their boss

311
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,440
 is not only beautiful,

312
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,320
 but in bed you have to be good and excited.

313
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,439
 That's right, Mom. Because of you

314
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,839
 posed invitingly, shaking her body back and forth,

315
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,559
 Sit with your chest out and legs apart

316
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,799
 shake your hips like this.

317
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,440
 I think no one can be better than me, mom.

318
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,480
 That's right. Unless Si

319
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,520
 he went looking for an acrobat to serve his boss.

320
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,720
 It jumped up and down and ploppppp...

321
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,320
 So your lifespan is still very long, my dear.

322
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,800
Hey Si, I heard it was you

323
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,079
Go find a new girl to serve your boss in hopes of getting promoted.

324
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,520
Are you sure you want to do that?

325
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,240
Sure or not sure

326
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
The boss also allows accepting girls that I introduced.

327
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,880
I don't have a problem.

328
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,840
But the girl you bring is the problem.

329
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,319
Hey, so you told your girl

330
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,679
Is the owner of this cave very ferocious?

331
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,479
If not strong

332
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,560
it will not exist.

333
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Nosy.

334
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
You don't need to worry about others.

335
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,959
You should worry about yourself, because you don't know when you'll be left out.

336
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,759
I know it's here

337
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,640
only ferocious tigers, lions, red cows, rhinoceroses...

338
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,079
That's why I brought you the new girl,

339
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,399
I have to aim to be able to play with you guys again.

340
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,960
If not, I won't bring it anywhere.

341
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,159
I really want to see the new girl's face

342
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,959
This is yours.

343
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,919
I really want to know if he can fight Malee,

344
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,719
How is my acrobat?

345
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,199
So when does it come?

346
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,239
I have itchy hands and feet

347
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,640
I really want to welcome it.

348
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,720
When it comes, you will see it.

349
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,199
Come here, everyone, let's practice singing again

350
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,320
to welcome new members.

351
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,120
3, 4.

352
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,199
Oysters are Jiri oysters,

353
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,279
Jiri oysters only have one cap.

354
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,119
Oysters with two caps are even better.

355
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,399
Two caps makes it even better.

356
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,320
One-cap oysters are Jiri oysters,

357
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,999
is Jiri oyster.

358
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,920
Thong, did you bring this set too?

359
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,680
You said to only bring necessary items.

360
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Because this series is important to Thong.

361
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,600
This is what tells Thong that his dream will come true.

362
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,760
The person who made Thong's dream come true was him.

363
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
Thong wants to keep it to remind himself.

364
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,600
Thong, please sit down here.

365
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Thong.

366
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,280
Thong knows that you love Thong a lot, right?

367
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm someone who doesn't have many friends.

368
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,520
Since my father passed away,

369
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,680
He is no longer close to anyone

370
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,840
until I met Thong.

371
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:49,006
Thong,

372
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,360
marry me?

373
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,999
Marry?

374
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,720
That's right, marriage.

375
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,160
You made your choice.

376
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,520
Thong is the person I want to live with for the rest of my life.

377
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,280
But I know I still have flaws.

378
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,440
I used to be violent towards you Thong.

379
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,080
So I'm not sure

380
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,080
Thong, do you want to stay with me?

381
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,800
Do you want it?

382
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,480
Mr. Wi was the first

383
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,560
Treat Thong this well.

384
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,200
He gave Thong everything.

385
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,800
Thong will never find another man as good as you.

386
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,880
Mr. Wi, Thong wants to marry Mr. Wi.

387
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,160
Really?

388
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,840
Thank you, Thong.

389
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,160
As for my mother, don't worry, Thong.

390
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,280
I will definitely not let my mother interfere in our affairs anymore, I promise.

391
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,760
I love you, Thong.

392
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,880
Thong loves you too.

393
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,120
Thong brought a knife with her?

394
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,599
 Thong's friend brought him when Thong was preparing to go to Bangkok.

395
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,360
 Gave it to Thong to protect himself.

396
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,360
 Em Thong.

397
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,400
 With me, Thong won't need to use it.

398
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,080
 No one will do anything to Thong.

399
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,840
 I will always protect you Thong.

400
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,280
Let me give you this so Thong can eat.

401
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,760
When I'm done, I'll quickly come find you.

402
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,040
Thank you.

403
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,560
Please come quickly, Thong is very lonely alone.

404
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,439
Okay, not much work today.

405
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,879
Probably not much to do.

406
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,799
About 4-5 hours to finish the job

407
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,400
Then I will find you right away.

408
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,080
Please go first.

409
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
I'm Thong.

410
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,960
I'm Thong.

411
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,120
I'm Thong.

412
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,240
Moved back here to live?

413
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,080
What happened? Why don't you continue living with Wi?

414
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,440
Probably had a fight with her mother-in-law.

415
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,840
Were you kicked out or did you escape on your own?

416
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,679
You said it already.

417
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,440
It's okay to stay, but it's very difficult to be satisfied.

418
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,639
Or is this okay?

419
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,879
Go work with me. High income.

420
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,600
Being able to support yourself without relying on a man.

421
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,240
Oh what is this?

422
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,640
People only give 500 baht a day?

423
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Oh stop dead.

424
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,639
Face, what's wrong with you?

425
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,079
This place, this place.

426
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
When?

427
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,880
You're going to curse when she stops talking, right?

428
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,880
When will I stop prying?

429
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,239
I will tell you one last time

430
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,479
I absolutely will not sell my body like you.

431
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,360
No need to preach anything to me.

432
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,640
And stop calling me, old woman.

433
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,720
Old your head.

434
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,920
You know Si will be looking for a new girl, right?

435
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:36,767
Don't be stubborn.

436
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
I know.

437
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,040
Aren't you in a hurry or afraid?

438
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Are not.

439
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,720
Because I know I'm rare.

440
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,680
No one can replace it.

441
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,360
Is that right?

442
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,440
Mom, did the new store report any problems that need to be repaired today?

443
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
No, child.

444
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,519
So after you finish accounting for pig slaughter

445
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,800
I will go back to the apartment.

446
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,959
Go quickly, go as soon as possible,

447
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,440
Otherwise, you won't have time to see it.

448
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,320
Can't see anything in time?

449
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,920
If mom says it again

450
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,840
Then I told my mother to find something again.

451
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,880
It's better if I don't say anything and let you see for yourself.

452
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,600
Mom, if there's something you want to say, just say it quickly.

453
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,240
What do you want me to see?

454
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,919
Mom just heard

455
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,479
Yai talked on the phone with Thong

456
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,760
Let's meet at the apartment when you're not there.

457
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,320
I'm bored, mom. I speak frankly,

458
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,879
If you don't stop using this method

459
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,720
Then I don't need to talk to you anymore.

460
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,559
I will call to ask if she is real or not?

461
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,480
Don't, child.

462
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,880
If you call, she will find out in time.

463
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,480
If you don't believe me

464
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,359
then go with mom,

465
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,640
Go see it with your own eyes.

466
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
Who is that?

467
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,600
It's Mr. Yai.

468
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Yai?

469
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,320
How did you get here?

470
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,639
Accidentally drove to deliver pigs nearby

471
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,080
Should I stop by to see how Thong is doing?

472
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Go inside first.

473
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,640
Do you know what's going on? Who told you that?

474
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,360
I heard people in the market talking to each other since yesterday.

475
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,040
They said Thong was beaten by Ms. Na and Mr. Ieng.

476
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,120
Mr. Wi immediately led Thong to escape to this apartment.

477
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,840
Does the whole market know?

478
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,040
It's even further than that.

479
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,159
The maid who came to buy things even told rumors

480
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,120
to the point that Ms. Na did not dare to go to the market anymore.

481
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,359
So happy. She deserves her life.

482
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,840
Just wait and see this story will be rumored until the day she dies.

483
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,880
Thong intentionally teased Ms. Na, right?

484
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,640
And is it worth the beating?

485
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,759
How are you, are you in pain? Take a look.

486
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,280
Oh no need to touch, it's painful.

487
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,719
Well deserved, that old woman deserved retaliation

488
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,280
when harming others from one side.

489
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,640
Come here, I'll show you around.

490
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,560
 Mom. No need to bring your child up there.

491
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,720
 Mom, wait here, I'll go up alone.

492
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,080
 If so, I'll wait here.

493
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
 Yes.

494
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,640
 Then I'll go first, I have to go deliver the pigs next.

495
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,040
 Thank you for coming.

496
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,320
 No need next time, I'm fine.

497
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,320
 Are you afraid that Mr. Wi will find you?

498
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,040
 I know that he works from home every day.

499
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,160
 He works in and out on time.

500
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
 Let's go first.

501
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,840
 Do your best, little sister.

502
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,639
Mr. Wi.

503
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,480
- Thongdee. - Mr. Wi.

504
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:24,439
Listen to Thong, listen to Thong first, Mr. Wi.

505
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,000
Having an affair?

506
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,720
I forgive you but you dare to commit adultery again?

507
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,480
Damn you.

508
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,560
I treat you so well and yet you still have an affair?

509
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,600
Don't, I just came to visit Thong and have nothing to do with each other.

510
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,160
You don't need to interfere. Then it will be your turn, you bastard.

511
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,160
Win my wife?

512
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,000
Thongdee, come here.

513
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,880
Stand there.

514
00:29:34,493 --> 00:29:39,000
THE ROSE OF SIN
