1
00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:01,320
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:41,563
 THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,320
Oh.

4
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,240
Miss Thongprakai!

5
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,600
I told you not to hide out anymore.

6
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,880
Why don't we trust each other?

7
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,880
Here!

8
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,800
Please pay this hospital fee in advance.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,520
130 thousand?

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,080
Yes.

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,400
If you still haven't paid, you won't be able to leave the hospital.

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,160
I will definitely pay, I won't hide.

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,040
But can you help me call the person who brought me here?

14
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,560
Hey bro!

15
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,960
My name is Thongprakai,

16
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,960
person having an accident

17
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,960
In Chonburi, I took you to the hospital.

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
Do you have my watch?

19
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,600
Why can't you have it?

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,600
I put it in my clothes bag.

21
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,080
Older brother! Hello? Hello?

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,320
Don't hang up the phone yet.

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,160
Hey, you thief.

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,520
I pray you get hit by a car

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,320
to the point where your mother doesn't even recognize you,

26
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,000
bastard!

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,960
Don't raise your voice, this is the hospital.

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,800
So what's the point?

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,040
Is there money to pay?

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,640
Do not have.

31
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,720
You take it back.

32
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,040
Take it all back.

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Take it away.

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,840
I don't have money to pay you guys.

35
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,920
You take it back.

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Take these leg braces back.

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,880
Take it back, take it back.

38
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,720
You can take my life too.

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
I don't want to live anymore,

40
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:33,883
This damn life, you take it away.

41
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:35,228
Take it away.

42
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,720
You come and get it.

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,680
Thong!

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,120
Sister Si!

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,280
No problem.

46
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,960
It's really bad karma.

47
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,720
Got a good husband,

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,560
having to deal with things like this.

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,560
When is this?

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,680
When is her life

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,840
Just got out of this bad luck?

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,760
Now,

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,000
I deliberately closed my heart, I don't love anyone anymore.

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,200
What you said is correct.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,800
Women like us

56
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Just need money to spend freely,

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,160
no need for a husband.

58
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,960
Older sister,

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,960
she looks rich,

60
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,960
I have money to pay my hospital bills.

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,360
What did you do to get that?

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,440
I am married.

63
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,680
You say you can't have it with others, but you have it like that?

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
Oh.

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,200
When the opportunity comes,

66
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,200
How can I let it slip away?

67
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Hello.

68
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,640
- Hello. - Hi, I'm David.

69
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,280
My name is Si.

70
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,080
- Clink glasses. Nice to know you. - Clink glasses.

71
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,120
But saying that he is always a husband is not correct.

72
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,520
Must be called

73
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,560
financial sponsor is more correct.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
He is a foreigner.

75
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,800
He has a wife and children abroad.

76
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,240
Him

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,480
is the manager of some company.

78
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,760
Then every once in a while

79
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,080
He had to go to Thailand to check his work, right?

80
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,960
So he wants to have another wife in Thailand.

81
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,640
So I got the position

82
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,320
Thai branch wife.

83
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,320
How did he give you money?

84
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
Is it given in batches?

85
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,720
So beautiful.

86
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,120
You like this place, right?

87
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,520
I like it very much.

88
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,880
Give by month.

89
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,720
60 thousand baht per month.

90
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,920
There are apartments to live in,

91
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,240
Have a car to travel.

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,640
Do you want a husband like that?

93
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,640
I'll take you hunting.

94
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,200
There are many in the lobby of luxury hotels.

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,320
No, sister.

96
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,320
I don't want to create karma anymore.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,320
I just want to be alone.

98
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,080
Yes, I understand.

99
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,080
Husband just passed away.

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,800
Thinking about these things is not right.

101
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,520
Thong.

102
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,280
If she gets better

103
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,280
and discharged from the hospital

104
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,280
Then you come and stay with me.

105
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
I'm alone, lonely.

106
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,240
Come stay together.

107
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,880
This.

108
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,320
This is my new home.

109
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,960
How? Luxurious, classy

110
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,800
Much better than the old room before, right?

111
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,360
And importantly

112
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,640
David

113
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,920
bought this house.

114
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,480
No need to rent anymore.

115
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,960
Here is everything.

116
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,800
There is a swimming pool,

117
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,080
There is a gym

118
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,000
and there's also a sauna.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you want to try bathing in the sauna?

120
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,720
No, I'm very tired, I just want to rest.

121
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,440
That's OK.

122
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,160
But when you want it, just tell me and I'll take it.

123
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,120
Let's go see the bedroom, quickly.

124
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,560
This is my bedroom.

125
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,880
How?

126
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,320
Sit, sit, sit down.

127
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,320
Please feel free. You can watch TV, eat snacks or do whatever you want.

128
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,920
But I have to go for a while and then come back.

129
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,360
Because now it's time to go to cooking school.

130
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,080
Today's dish is

131
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,040
Roast duck breast stuffed with foie gras.

132
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,840
I'll bring it home for you to try when I finish it this afternoon.

133
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,800
Goodbye.

134
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,080
Today's menu is

135
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,080
French-style grilled tenderloin.

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,560
Try it!

137
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,960
It tastes like Sua Rong Hay restaurant.

138
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,280
You leave it there, then I eat.

139
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh, this baby!

140
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,360
Stop it, Thong!

141
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,840
You've been lying limp like a ghost for a week now.

142
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,840
I know you're sad.

143
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,400
But think about it.

144
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Between her lying down crying and standing up to find a new husband,

145
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,120
Which one is happier?

146
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,520
Wake up, wake up!

147
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,520
Wake up!

148
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,920
Then go to your makeup,

149
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,560
Then go out and let the world remember your face.

150
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,280
I'll go change too. This outfit makes my chest look pointy.

151
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,560
Otherwise, men will be startled.

152
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,960
Not okay.

153
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,760
Thong, I invited you here to play,

154
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,680
I didn't invite her over for a drinking contest.

155
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,080
Hey, I invited you to hook up with a guy.

156
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
I don't see any names worth fishing for.

157
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,360
Older sister!

158
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,800
If you've met Mont

159
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,400
Then you won't want any man anymore.

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,440
Oh, this girl, she's so terrible!

161
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,400
There are as many men as monkeys,

162
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,920
You have to catch someone.

163
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,080
I told you to just play along, I didn't ask you to get married.

164
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh.

165
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,040
Thong,

166
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,520
My room is not empty tonight.

167
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,760
I think you

168
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,200
You should find a man and spend the night out.

169
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,760
The prey looked at me without blinking.

170
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,880
I'll go first.

171
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,120
Sorry.

172
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,600
Drink for me.

173
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,600
He couldn't finish drinking alone.

174
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,640
His name is BT.

175
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,120
You can call me B.

176
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,520
B-Bear.

177
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,680
Bear means bear, warm.

178
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,200
Cute, really want to hug.

179
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,200
This is my lover.

180
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,200
Want to flirt with you

181
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,480
then look.

182
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,480
Do you have anything better than him?

183
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,520
Em.

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,520
I think you're misunderstanding.

185
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,720
Ordinary person like you

186
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
I don't dare flirt with someone as beautiful as you.

187
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,720
I know that no matter how much I flirt, it won't fall.

188
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,200
I just want to get to know you.

189
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,480
Not believe.

190
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,880
No man has ever approached me

191
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
I just want to get to know you.

192
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,880
I just want to sleep with you.

193
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,800
I'm so honest.

194
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,160
Get to work.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,840
It's like this.

196
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,840
He is a model manager.

197
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,840
Do you know how to manage models?

198
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,720
People are looking for actors to act in movies.

199
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,960
I've been secretly looking at you for a long time.

200
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Just found out you're looking for a main actor.

201
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,200
I care about it

202
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,000
- to be an actor? - Not interested.

203
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,000
Em.

204
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,000
Did I say it wrong?

205
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,560
I'll tell you again.

206
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,240
Please listen carefully.

207
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,760
Do you want to be an actor?

208
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,520
Don't want to, don't know how to act.

209
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,720
Don't know how to pretend.

210
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,680
Baby, I tell you.

211
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,360
Acting is sincerity.

212
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Just now you secretly looked at me,

213
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,320
I saw the moment you sat sad and drank alone.

214
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,320
When you enter the scene

215
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,320
You need to be in a sad mood.

216
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,640
I just need to think about this time.

217
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,280
I think it would be great.

218
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,000
What are you saying?

219
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,480
Don't understand anything.

220
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,480
Wherever you go, go.

221
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,040
If you leave the wine behind

222
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,480
then thank you very much.

223
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,720
Okay.

224
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,360
If you change your mind

225
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,960
Then text me directly.

226
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,520
His Instagram is BTprettygirl.

227
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,000
Thank you.

228
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,320
No need to wait.

229
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,760
No texting.

230
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,720
Even if you don't text me, I'll still wait.

231
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,080
[Alcohol is harmful to health and reduces consciousness]

232
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,960
[Alcohol is harmful to health and reduces consciousness]

233
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,000
Hey.

234
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:00,502
Are you still awake?

235
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,541
Let me take you home, okay?

236
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,760
I don't have a home to return to.

237
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,960
Who doesn't have a home?

238
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,720
Where is the friend who came to you earlier?

239
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,240
You brought your boyfriend home to sleep.

240
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,560
I don't have a place to sleep.

241
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,680
So...

242
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,680
Will you sleep when you go home tonight?

243
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,640
This.

244
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,440
Hello, Ms. Si.

245
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,440
Where are you?

246
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,760
I don't know, maybe someone's house?

247
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,440
Funny, isn't it, Thong?

248
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,640
How drunk were you last night that you couldn't remember who you were with?

249
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,960
Think properly.

250
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,320
I can't remember.

251
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,040
Last night I didn't go with anyone.

252
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
I don't know why I'm here anymore.

253
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,200
Here you go, look around and see what you see,

254
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,520
Or is there anyone nearby?

255
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,200
It's just a normal house.

256
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,920
There's no one.

257
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,440
And...

258
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,680
There are pornographic photos all over the house, Ms. Si.

259
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,200
Dead, Thong.

260
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,240
I think

261
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
You're definitely at a pervert's house.

262
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,080
So quickly go out and don't turn off the phone.

263
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Okay, okay, I'll go now.

264
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,040
Wait.

265
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,040
Please check yourself again.

266
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,720
Check to see if your clothes are still complete.

267
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,200
Is anything lost?

268
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,160
I looked and nothing was lost.

269
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
I will leave the house now, sister.

270
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,840
Good. So go out,

271
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,640
before the perverted landlord saw her.

272
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,520
Oh, honey, are you awake?

273
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,600
Oh.

274
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,440
Thong!

275
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,360
What's going on? Thong. Hello?

276
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,640
You, did you kidnap me here?

277
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,120
Kidnapping what?

278
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
Yesterday I was drunk and slept at the Pub.

279
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,760
I don't know what to ask, where do you want me to take you?

280
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
So last night he took me to sleep at his house.

281
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,480
Next time don't get involved with me.

282
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,120
Hey, you, you, you.

283
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,680
This little one.

284
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,200
Likes to hang out with men she doesn't know.

285
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,680
You, what's your name?

286
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,000
Hello?

287
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,840
Who is he anyway?

288
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,840
Just a man with a disheveled face.

289
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,520
He said he saw me sleeping at the Pub so he took me home.

290
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,200
No need to worry, I'm calling a car home.

291
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,400
Wait.

292
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
So last night

293
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,520
Did he do anything to you?

294
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,640
- Hey bro. - YES.

295
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,760
What are you doing?

296
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,360
Just checking to see if I dropped anything.

297
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,800
That way you can return it promptly.

298
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,440
Did you do anything to me last night?

299
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,440
Don't do anything.

300
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
You were drunk so I carried you here to sleep

301
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,600
but don't touch me.

302
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,320
Really?

303
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,640
Really.

304
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,120
Your face looks disheveled like this,

305
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,360
But he is a moral person.

306
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,680
Where is the restroom?

307
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,800
Across.

308
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,200
If I go check my stuff

309
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
and know he touched me

310
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,680
I will definitely not leave you in peace.

311
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,840
No pain, no burning.

312
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Nothing unusual.

313
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Maybe you really didn't do anything to me.

314
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,160
If not, it is

315
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,920
His belongings are so small that they leave no trace.

316
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,680
Hey, hey, you. This.

317
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Let's talk about each other with some respect.

318
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,120
Even though he is not the legendary worker

319
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,120
But yours is not small.

320
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,000
Do you want to check it out?

321
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,280
Are not.

322
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Thank you for taking the trouble to provide a place to sleep.

323
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,320
But next time if you want to take someone home to sleep

324
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
Then please ask if people are willing or not.

325
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,240
Why is it so cruel?

326
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,560
Are you crazy?

327
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,760
He invited me to be an actor,

328
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Why refuse?

329
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,200
Think about it.

330
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,480
If one day she becomes famous

331
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,960
then life changes forever.

332
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,160
Don't want.

333
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,720
I'm not in the mood.

334
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,640
Then what? She planned to eat and lie down

335
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,520
Let life pass so boringly?

336
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
You listen to me.

337
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,920
I asked David for money to study cooking.

338
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
I said that I...

339
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,800
I will learn to cook many dishes for him.

340
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,400
But really

341
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,240
I've been thinking, if one day we break up

342
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,120
then I will have a job to support myself.

343
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,600
It's not like there's a shortage of men and then sitting like this.

344
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Thong.

345
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,800
Life must continue to move forward.

346
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,680
I don't have the strength to go anymore.

347
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,960
Don't know where to go.

348
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Every road is full of pitfalls.

349
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,560
It's best to stand still.

350
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,000
No sadness, no pain.

351
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,320
Thong, think about it.

352
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,320
If today

353
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,360
Mont is here

354
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,560
and seeing her like this because of him

355
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,560
How will he feel?

356
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,920
The best way to compensate

357
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,280
for a lost lover

358
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,680
is to live a valuable life.

359
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,880
If Mont sees it

360
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,360
that Thong can move on without him by her side

361
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,640
then he will stop worrying and go to heaven.

362
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,440
Nin.

363
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,680
Don't cry.

364
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Eat quickly before the rice gets cold.

365
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,400
Nin.

366
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:54,552
Rub.

367
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,560
Like dreaming.

368
00:22:56,912 --> 00:22:58,552
Thong came to see me.

369
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,960
Actually

370
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,400
I wanted to have you for a long time.

371
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,920
I mean

372
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,920
want you on my team.

373
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,040
Okay, now let's take some photos, shall we?

374
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,440
I'll stand right at the X mark.

375
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Alright.

376
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,000
Smile a little, Thong.

377
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,320
Alright.

378
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,640
Please allow me.

379
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
I think

380
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
em

381
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,160
You can transfer your weight to this hip.

382
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,200
Okay, beautiful legs.

383
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,160
Like this, okay.

384
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,440
Let's get started.

385
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,280
Oh! This corner is very beautiful.

386
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,440
It's this corner.

387
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,800
Very beautiful, Thong.

388
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,960
Keep still.

389
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
It's beautiful.

390
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,640
Thong, I'm sorry

391
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Can you take off your shirt?

392
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Alright.

393
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,240
Let's continue.

394
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,240
Very beautiful, keep posing.

395
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,360
Pretty.

396
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,360
It's great, it's great, let's laugh a little.

397
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,480
Okay, it's beautiful.

398
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,480
That's so beautiful.

399
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,440
I thought

400
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,960
Let me fix your hair for you.

401
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,320
Please allow me!

402
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
Alright.

403
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
Alright.

404
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,840
Alright.

405
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,880
Very beautiful, wonderful.

406
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,560
Come on, it's beautiful, okay.

407
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,360
So beautiful. Okay, now I...

408
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,840
Can you bend down and help me a bit?

409
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Alright.

410
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,600
Bend down a bit. So beautiful.

411
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,000
Now, bend down a little more.

412
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,880
Okay, come down a bit.

413
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,520
So beautiful.

414
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,480
Can you bend down a little more? A little more,

415
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,320
a little more.

416
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,680
- A little more, a little more. - Oh!

417
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,160
As the female lead, why would she pose like that?

418
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Just like an adult movie actor.

419
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Thong!

420
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,760
It's like this.

421
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,760
This role is a bit sexy.

422
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,840
Newbies, no one dares to accept this role.

423
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,160
I'm the new heroine,

424
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,880
Must take pictures like this.

425
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,240
I sent it to the director to see if you dare to play this role.

426
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,520
So when I meet the director,

427
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
I'd better show him myself.

428
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,960
Alright.

429
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,520
But

430
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,880
Don't rush to think that

431
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
He thought of something with Thong beyond work.

432
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,800
Don't think too far ahead?

433
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,800
So what is that?

434
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,760
Oh.

435
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,400
Ah, it's nothing.

436
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,560
It's just your lens.

437
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Please wait a moment, let me check the lens first.

438
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,040
Sorry.

439
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,760
What do you think, director?

440
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Can I express it?

441
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,760
Still not achieved.

442
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,120
He said first that he played the role of Linin in "The Castle of Desire"

443
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,000
This is a role that requires a lot of physical contact.

444
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,560
Let me see first

445
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,560
How intensely do you act?

446
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,040
I'm very pleased.

447
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,600
Please speak frankly.

448
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,240
He had never met anyone before

449
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,800
Acting with such passion and intensity.

450
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,360
I'm just acting according to the summary.

451
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
In it, the main female character

452
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,720
is a strong and determined person.

453
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,720
So do you like it?

454
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,120
Like it.

455
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,440
If you don't like it

456
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,440
So why did you try twice?

457
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,720
So that means I'm the female lead, right?

458
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,200
Not yet.

459
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,800
You don't have the right to decide on your own.

460
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,160
But you don't need to worry.

461
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,160
Because no matter what

462
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,680
Then I will also prioritize you first, okay?

463
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,200
If you prioritize me

464
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,840
then I promise

465
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,160
I will repay you

466
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,000
10 times.

467
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,120
Daddy!

468
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,840
Thank you for coming here today.

469
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,520
Whatever the result is, I will contact you later.

470
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,920
What’s that?

471
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,280
I can go home now.

472
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,080
Hello, brother,

473
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,520
let it in.

474
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:41,765
I'm free.

475
00:29:46,223 --> 00:29:49,701
THE ROSE OF SIN
