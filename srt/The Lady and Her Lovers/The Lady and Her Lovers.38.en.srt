1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,360
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:39,428
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,960
The bride and groom are the perfect combination.

4
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,400
Mr. Prajak is very handsome and serious.

5
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,920
And Ms. Thong is like a fairy.

6
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,560
Do you agree?

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,720
If you agree, please clap loudly

8
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,720
for our bride and groom.

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,840
What a beautiful girl

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,440
but too greedy.

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,800
Yes, he is too.

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,000
At this age, I still have high desires.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,880
I just feel sorry for Mrs. Anong,

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,720
Do you see that?

15
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,440
Do you bet with me? I bet it won't take more than a year to break up.

16
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,880
I think it won't be more than six months, how much do you bet?

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,600
And so, the official ceremonies ended.

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,760
I would like to let the bride and groom rest a bit.

19
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,040
Then both of you

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,440
will go to each table to say thank you.

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,400
Meanwhile, I asked for a screening

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,680
Beautiful wedding photos to enhance the sweet atmosphere

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,040
for today's party, please look forward to it.

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,440
[More than 20 years]

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,200
Sir.

26
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,280
What is this? Not this.

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,440
I think something is wrong.

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,280
I'll go tell the staff to turn it off.

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,680
YES.

30
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,400
No need.

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,520
If we do that, the guests will know we are being treated badly.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,640
We will lose.

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,240
So just leave it open?

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,960
Let Thong handle it for you.

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,520
This guy Ben.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,000
Sir, don't, calm down.

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,480
Let Thong handle it for you.

38
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,040
These are truly beautiful photos of the couple.

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,320
Please continue to enjoy our cuisine.

40
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,400
Ladies and gentlemen, Thong would like to thank Lady Anong

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,920
provided these images to be shown at the party.

42
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,960
A round of applause for Lady Anong

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,600
sitting on the other side.

44
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,600
The images that people see help remind us that

45
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,360
that two people can come together

46
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,760
then love is the most important thing.

47
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,160
And the lady's job

48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,680
personally came here to congratulate

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,080
showed affection

50
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,360
that the lady has for us.

51
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,280
Thong was really emotional

52
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,600
when ma'am

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,080
personally came to deliver Mr. Prajak to Thong.

54
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,240
Thong would like to thank you for your generosity.

55
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,880
Thong promised that Thong would take good care of him

56
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,200
Just like the lady used to take care of me.

57
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,960
Thong sincerely thanks you, ma'am.

58
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,240
Please clap for Thong.

59
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,800
My feet are so tired, I wonder if I can walk barefoot?

60
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,360
I'll just try to endure it a little longer.

61
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,080
Take photos with guests and you're done.

62
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,720
Sir,

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,400
If you have to take a picture with the lady and Ben

64
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,560
Then you must calm down. Thong doesn't want anything to happen.

65
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,960
I will try.

66
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
What are you looking at?

67
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,520
I never thought

68
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,840
I'm also a girl with such good thoughts.

69
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,640
At first I saw you screaming on TV,

70
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,200
I thought you would be very stubborn,

71
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,240
will definitely quarrel with Nong and Ben.

72
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,880
But when I heard you speak on stage just now,

73
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,080
I feel much more secure now.

74
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,640
Thong's life has been full of fighting and fighting.

75
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
And also know those ways

76
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,920
It certainly won't have a good ending.

77
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,440
Thong into your house,

78
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,000
Thong also wants to get along with everyone.

79
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,800
Lady and Ben arrived first,

80
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,120
When Thong comes later, Thong must know things.

81
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Above all, Thong doesn't want to create a headache for you.

82
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,960
Thank you for being my good girl.

83
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,040
I also want you to know that

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,480
I am also the owner of this house,

85
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,120
also has a title, that is his wife.

86
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,720
Thank you.

87
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,320
We are married, we are husband and wife.

88
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,040
Can I call you brother?

89
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,320
Don't call me sir anymore, it sounds strange.

90
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
Okay.

91
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,360
Or do you want me to call you honey?

92
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,200
Do you want to call me that? Are you shy?

93
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,040
I don't mind.

94
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,040
I love you, I love you, I love you.

95
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,560
It's so beautiful.

96
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,600
Look at the camera, smile.

97
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,320
Thank you, please come this way.

98
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,200
Give me a small bottle of beer.

99
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,960
Thank you very much

100
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,960
for taking the trouble to come and bless me.

101
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,920
I'm not here to give you any blessings.

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,160
I just wanted to come see the two of you.

103
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,000
I hope you two will break up soon.

104
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,480
Let me get the video to open on your next wedding day.

105
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,440
Look at the camera, smile.

106
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,360
Thong, just take a shower, okay?

107
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,200
I think I'll just go to sleep here.

108
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,920
I can't stand it anymore today, I'm so tired and sleepy.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,560
How can I sleep all the time?

110
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,880
This is our first night.

111
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,880
What should we do to make it more memorable?

112
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,000
What is this?

113
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,080
It is a waist belt.

114
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,040
It does the job for our muscles.

115
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,640
Helps maintain body balance.

116
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,360
When bending over, your back will not hurt.

117
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,000
Why didn't you tell Thong when you had an accident?

118
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,800
Oh no, I've been wearing it for many years.

119
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,920
It helps you avoid back pain.

120
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,880
Oh.

121
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,680
This too.

122
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,320
Every day I have to travel a lot, I have to wear it.

123
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,040
To protect your knees, otherwise when you walk a lot, your knees will hurt.

124
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,040
As for these supplements, they were also prescribed by doctors.

125
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
I don't know what's so much there.

126
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,240
It also has some types that help you sleep.

127
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,040
I think I'll sleep right here.

128
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,720
If you want to do something, please be gentle.

129
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,880
If you wake up, it will be difficult to go back to sleep, okay?

130
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,360
Mom! Are you sleeping yet?

131
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,360
Not yet.

132
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,480
I guess mom won't be able to sleep tonight.

133
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,480
So I will sleep with mom.

134
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,960
Mom, you don't need to think too much.

135
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Even if that woman comes to stay in our house

136
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,280
there's nothing we can do.

137
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,440
This is our house, if she plans to do anything to you

138
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,840
Then I will deal with her.

139
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,480
Thank you very much, go to sleep.

140
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,680
Be good at home today, I'll be right back when I'm done.

141
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,400
And do as I say.

142
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,440
Everyone should do their own thing, then nothing will happen.

143
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes. Please rest assured, don't worry about anything.

144
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,880
Please go.

145
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,160
Give me my bag.

146
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,240
Here's the porridge.

147
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,400
Thank.

148
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,840
Uncle Sai.

149
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,320
Please give my mother porridge and black coffee.

150
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,400
Okay. So what does Ben want to eat?

151
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,880
I don't eat today. Because I have to go to school too.

152
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,120
After studying, you will have a good job to do, no need to rely on others.

153
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,600
Yes.

154
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,640
Mom, let's go to school.

155
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,400
If there's any problem, tell Mr. Sai to call you.

156
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,040
Hello mom.

157
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,320
Where are you going?

158
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,040
Go find another place to eat.

159
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,440
Did you do something wrong or why do you have to avoid me?

160
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,040
Don't do anything wrong and don't avoid anyone.

161
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,120
Thong just thought that the lady did not want Thong to sit and eat here.

162
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,800
So Thong will find another place to eat.

163
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,400
Really well said.

164
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,480
So what if I don't want you in this house?

165
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,000
Would you move to another place?

166
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,840
This house is half owned by Mr. Prajak.

167
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,880
He allowed Thong to live here.

168
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,440
Thong does not need to move to another place.

169
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,800
Here's the porridge.

170
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,200
Sir, this is the media's view

171
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,360
regarding his marriage.

172
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,760
From the moment you started declaring information

173
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,200
to midnight yesterday.

174
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,200
Briefly tell me.

175
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,800
In short, what does it include?

176
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,960
Mostly negative.

177
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,280
As we expected.

178
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,240
Can't escape the title

179
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,680
"The lecherous old man and the gold digger girl" right?

180
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,600
Yes, mostly Thai

181
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,360
have bad views about marriage

182
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,400
between couples with an age gap

183
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,480
and social status.

184
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,280
This has an impact on your approval rating.

185
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,720
These people really don't have any sense at all.

186
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Let public and private matters mix together.

187
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,280
What plans do we have?

188
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,560
For long term planning,

189
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,200
You need to stay with Ms. Thongprakai for as long as possible.

190
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,040
The longer it lasts, the more it proves true love.

191
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,200
There is a short-term plan

192
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,560
then you need to achieve something great.

193
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,120
Thus, those who do not like him

194
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,440
will turn around to like you.

195
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,720
Is there anything that can be woven into an achievement?

196
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,040
Trending now

197
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
There are many foreign investors opening illegal casinos.

198
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,560
He also manages many casinos,

199
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,720
If we're willing to sacrifice a few casinos

200
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,200
In exchange for more votes, I think it's worth it.

201
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,440
Then deal with it quickly.

202
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,360
Don't let the damage be severe, just enough to make news.

203
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,400
Yes.

204
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,280
And if Ms. Thong does a project for the community,

205
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,920
Just need a few projects,

206
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,960
will help promote his good image.

207
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,400
Do you know whose place that is? That's my place.

208
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,560
Speak kindly and I'll stay away.

209
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,240
Ben.

210
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,320
Are you back?

211
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,760
Yes, mom. I just came back.

212
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,760
Hey, miss!

213
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,080
This family member doesn't dress like that.

214
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,920
Next time, dress appropriately for the place.

215
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,240
I'm at home all day.

216
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,520
Where is it inappropriate to dress like that?

217
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,120
Don't go make offerings to Buddha at the temple.

218
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,680
Such clothes

219
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,000
It's something given to lowly women to wear.

220
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,600
If you want to wear it

221
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,560
Wear it somewhere else, don't wear it here.

222
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,680
I tried to understand,

223
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,840
that we as humans grow up to be different.

224
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,080
This time I don't mind her.

225
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,360
But don't leave it until next time.

226
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
Go, go change.

227
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,720
If the clothes Thong wears make her an eyesore

228
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,760
Then Thong can go instead.

229
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,160
Ben.

230
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,560
Ben must be very careful.

231
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,680
Women of this type like to seduce their prey.

232
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,560
If you're not careful, Ben will become another of her prey.

233
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,440
Oh, Mom, Ben's taste is much better than Dad's.

234
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,200
Ben is not attracted to her, you can rest assured.

235
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,640
What is that? Do you have to work on Sunday too?

236
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,920
Today I have to go destroy the casino.

237
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,160
He has to go to work on Sunday

238
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,160
Because if it becomes news, many people will see it.

239
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,760
And if people see us working on Sunday

240
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,000
then we will get more popular votes.

241
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,400
So when will Thong have a child for me like this?

242
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,640
On a normal day, you say you're tired.

243
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,640
Day off is never free.

244
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,520
We've been married for a month now,

245
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,680
but still haven't done any proper spousal duties.

246
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,040
The only thing missing is this.

247
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,800
Just this much makes me love you to death.

248
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,440
There's no need for that.

249
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,280
But if you want, I'll find some free time for you.

250
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,800
Okay then?

251
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,840
Okay, let's go to work first.

252
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,520
Hey bro.

253
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,440
Thong, can I follow you?

254
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
I'm going to work, why do you follow me?

255
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,240
Actually, Thong also thought about it for a long time.

256
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,560
Don't want to make you anxious.

257
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,920
I've been thinking for a long time about whether I should say it or not.

258
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,520
If there's anything wrong, just tell me. I'm very happy to hear you speak.

259
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,840
The thing is... when I'm not at home,

260
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,600
Thong must stay with his wife and nephew Ben.

261
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,520
Thong is very uncomfortable.

262
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,840
Thong feels that those two people really don't like Thong's face.

263
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,360
Thong tried to stay still,

264
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,480
But I still come here to talk about big and small things, Thong doesn't like it.

265
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,120
But

267
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,320
Maybe Thong can't go to work with him.

268
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,640
How about this, I'll go remind those two.

269
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,600
Don't.

270
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,480
If you remind them, they will hate Thong even more.

271
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,080
I'll think you're going to tell me.

272
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,120
If so, Thong quickly changed clothes

273
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,520
and go with me.

274
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,800
Today is strange,

275
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,280
Every time dad's chickens come down to eat before us, right?

276
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Today, Ms. Thong followed Mr. Prajak out.

277
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,640
Huh? Follow out? Why follow?

278
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,560
Ms. Thong said that from now on she would follow him out every day

279
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,160
and will stay at a hotel,

280
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,040
In the afternoon, I will go home with him.

281
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,000
What is it?

282
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,680
If you have a house, you don't stay there, you go to a hotel to stay.

283
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,720
What's wrong, Ben?

284
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,440
Wouldn't it be better if she wasn't here to make us uncomfortable?

285
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,920
That's good too.

286
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,640
I'm just wondering, because I think she often has strange thoughts.

287
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,080
Let's eat, mom.

288
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,320
Please.

289
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,120
This is the room that Mr. Prajak has booked long-term with the hotel.

290
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,480
I am the room card holder.

291
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,200
When Ms. Thong wants to come, just let me know.

292
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,560
Thank you.

293
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,320
Thong will be here today.

294
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,120
You go home. When he's done, he'll come pick up Thong.

295
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,120
He ordered me to stay here so that Ms. Thong could do the wrong thing.

296
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,840
With me here, Ms. Thong will not be lonely.

297
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,120
If Miss Thong wants me to do something special

298
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,680
then I will do it for you.

299
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,760
Do you often do this?

300
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,240
Do what?

301
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,360
Then secretly steal your boss's things.

302
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,080
If I tell Ms. Thong, will Ms. Thong tell him?

303
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,520
So that's usually done.

304
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,560
There is also a little bit.

305
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,000
It's good that he answered frankly.

306
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,240
Then Thong also told him.

307
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,400
Don't expect anything from Thong.

308
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Because Thong will be loyal to him and not betray him.

309
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,640
Don't tempt Thong to have an affair anymore.

310
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,520
You won't succeed. Besides,

311
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,280
Thong doesn't like this.

312
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,440
Okay. I am an understanding person.

313
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,680
If Ms. Thong gave me such an order, I would follow it.

314
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,920
I will only follow Prajak sir's orders.

315
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,960
That's taking care of Ms. Thong while she's here, that's all.

316
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,480
Then good.

317
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,920
Then take Thong shopping to relieve boredom.

318
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,720
But stand a little further away.

319
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,320
Thong doesn't want anyone to talk behind her back as the Minister's wife

320
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,720
having an affair with his subordinates.

321
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,240
Okay.

322
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,960
No thanks, no need.

323
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,520
Drink some water, you've been walking for a long time.

324
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,120
I'm afraid you'll be thirsty.

325
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,880
I told you it wasn't necessary. Besides, stand a little further away from me.

326
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,520
If you don't drink then I won't go, this is my duty.

327
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,880
Stand up.

328
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,080
Stand up and go home to your mother immediately.

329
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,560
- Stand up and go home with your mother. - Are not!

330
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,240
- Are not. - Stand up!

331
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,480
- Go home to your mother now. - Hey, sister.

332
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,080
You let her go first.

333
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,520
Let's talk properly if there's anything,

334
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,320
Don't hit her.

335
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,400
Why are you interfering? This is my child,

336
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,760
I will raise it my way.

337
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,280
- Sister! - Stand up.

338
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,400
Sister, don't pull her.

339
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,120
Hey, what's this? I am mother,

340
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,880
No matter how much I beat you, this is still my child, stay away!

341
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,240
Don't touch her.

342
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,680
Even if you are a mother, you have no right to hit a child like that.

343
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,240
Before becoming a mother, have you studied the law protecting children's rights?

344
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,720
It's okay, no one will fight anymore.

345
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,560
YES.

346
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,120
If you don't hit me, don't hit me. Just give me back my child.

347
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,800
I took my child home.

348
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,400
Thank you.

349
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
That's my duty.

350
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,760
Let's go quickly, before anyone notices.

351
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,840
 But today, Mr. Prajak Sianibunya

352
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,400
 along with the police force

353
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,560
 caught a big gambling den

354
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,120
 in Nakhon Pathom province.

355
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,040
 Mr. Prajak said that

356
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,760
 we have a social responsibility

357
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,280
 to help people have a peaceful life.

358
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,360
 That is considered a great achievement this year.

359
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,920
 And this afternoon,

360
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,640
 has a video posted on social media,

361
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,600
 is an image of a woman helping a child

362
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,720
 is being abused by her mother.

363
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,240
Many people see familiar faces,

364
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,440
Is that Ms. Thongprakai Jarasruedee,

365
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,040
famous former heroine

366
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,480
recently got married to Mr. Prajak?

367
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,320
And netizens also gave her a lot of compliments.

368
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,320
Is that you?

369
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,800
Yes, it's Thong.

370
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,240
Thong apologizes for making this news.

371
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,400
But Thong couldn't stand looking at this scene.

372
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,480
When he was young, Thong also suffered from this many times.

373
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,080
So when I grow up, I don't want anyone to encounter this situation again.

374
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,720
Hey darling!

375
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,400
Does this news have any effect on you?

376
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,920
Yes.

377
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,680
But in a good way.

378
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,840
I think I have something for you to do.

379
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,560
I plan to open a charity fund for you.

380
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,640
What charity fund? Thong can't do it, please don't.

381
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,840
Not difficult, not complicated at all.

382
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,040
Doing work to help children like you did today.

383
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,280
If you do something for society

384
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,800
It will help erase bad news fabricated about us.

385
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,000
And he also has more support.

386
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,160
Really?

387
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,280
If Thong can help me, Thong agrees.

388
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,880
The cutest ever.

389
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,440
I'm tired of working,

390
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,360
Let Thong help you relax, okay?

391
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,720
Okay, then massage my feet.

392
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,280
Today I walked all day so my legs were tired.

393
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,160
Okay.

394
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,160
Squeeze your feet,

395
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,600
Do you want Thong to help massage between your legs?

396
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,800
No need.

397
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,440
What's wrong? Since we got married,

398
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,040
- Thong has never... - It's okay.

399
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,520
When I need your help, I will tell you.

400
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,000
Yes.

401
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,406
THE ROSE OF SIN
