THE ROSE OF SIN

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 12

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
Real.

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,440
Is there any problem?

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,560
So where did Mr. Bun leave you?

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,959
I am wholeheartedly devoted to you.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,080
Mr. Bun abandoned me

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,040
And let this crazy girl replace you?

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,519
So I sleep with you every second of every day,

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,480
Morning, noon, and night don't mean anything?

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,720
Except,

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,479
I'm really too noisy.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm still at my place.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,560
Who abandoned you?

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,240
You are still my top dancer.

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,920
 So what do you mean?

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,480
 Mr. Bun just gave this title to Thong, right?

24
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
 That's right.

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
 Because now

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,120
 you have two top dancers.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,760
 Malee is the top dancer on the right.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,840
 And Thong

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,360
 is the top dancer on the left.

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,720
 Understand it like that.

31
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:19,133
What? Top one position means there is only one.

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,520
But why does this side have to have two people?

33
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,959
There is a left side and a right side.

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,559
What about later? Must have

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,640
front and back too?

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,760
So why didn't you tell me clearly from the beginning?

37
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,399
Just so I know I'm not the only one being noticed

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,560
to kick that Malee away.

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,960
Who knows?

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
I think the boss is definitely playing tricks.

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,360
Let me tell you,

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,280
Sometimes the boss himself cannot be trusted.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,520
Promised so many things, I don't know if it's true or not.

44
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,999
But if we can't change the boss

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
then we have to go back and eliminate the Malee.

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,159
I had to become the only top dancer there.

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,640
I won't share it with anyone.

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,919
Good! I also want to deal with Jan.

49
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Let it stop getting in my way, I've endured it for a long time.

50
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,640
Do that? Let's work together.

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,840
Do it, do it once and for all.

52
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,320
Sit and wait here, because everyone has to go through this place.

53
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,759
And when the guests left,

54
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,640
I will invite them to come and get to know you.

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,840
No way,

56
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,519
We have to hold them back first.

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,600
It won't do anything to affect me later.

58
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Here we come.

59
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,120
Shocked by his handsomeness,

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,240
to the point where the soul leaves the body?

61
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Hey, Thong! Don't dream too far,

62
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,680
because she can't eat him anyway.

63
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,799
Why? Because of all the people here

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,159
all try

65
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,440
But no one came close to him.

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,600
Who is he?

67
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,160
Don't you know him?

68
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,800
He is a famous idol.

69
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:36,913
He's Inspector Mit,

70
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,280
The younger brother of the boss of this place.

71
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,120
Hey, hey!

72
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,640
Look at this news. I opened it to see.

73
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,960
Here, here. This!

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,799
Received the excellent police award for many years.

75
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,839
Arrested both casinos and drug rings.

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,040
Caught transnational thieves too.

77
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,320
I'm an elite police officer,

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,040
But are you a drug tycoon?

79
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,440
What did he come for?

80
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,680
He came to look for his brother, nothing more.

81
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,280
He only comes once in a while.

82
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,920
But no one knows what they say to each other.

83
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,279
Because when they talk,

84
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,280
No one is allowed in the room.

85
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,240
But I think it's nothing.

86
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,080
Maybe it's just a brotherly thing.

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,320
It's okay, I won't drink today.

88
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,320
You and I are brothers.

89
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,440
Are you still afraid of me?

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,279
You drink it.

91
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,960
I won't kill my brother.

92
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,960
But you killed my friend, right?

93
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,240
I really ask, why did you arrest him?

94
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,880
And you!

95
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
Why are you so nosy and let him sneak in and sell things to me?

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm serious, what are you thinking, Mit?

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,919
Or do you want to bother me?

98
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,159
So let's share and make a living, the market is so big.

99
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,760
How can you eat it all?

100
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,880
This is nothing but killing each other.

101
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,200
I'll be honest,

102
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,680
I'm not angry about business.

103
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,639
But I find it annoying

104
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,959
because it claims to have the backing of a big man.

105
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,239
So I just caught it.

106
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,480
But it's my friend.

107
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,480
Whatever you do, ask me first!

108
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,560
Oh my god, I know you're not mad about your friend dying.

109
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,080
You're angry because you didn't receive compensation from him.

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Right?

111
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,360
Tell me, how much does it pay you?

112
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,080
Five million baht a year. You have to pay for it.

113
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,400
In exchange for him being free to do business.

114
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,280
Five million? Here it is,

115
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,040
I'll give you one million.

116
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,000
If you take it, you keep the money, if you don't take it, you lose it.

117
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Okay.

118
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,880
Now drink.

119
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,159
Guys, look there are two bags of trash

120
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,120
I'm sitting in my seat.

121
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,280
 It smells so bad, like

122
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
 old people's wet stools.

123
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,480
 Old trash, new trash!

124
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,200
 Why are you gathered here?

125
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,159
 This is not the place to throw trash.

126
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,839
 Go somewhere else quickly!

127
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,760
 If we sit down, our butts will get dirty.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,080
 I know

129
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,920
 this is not the place to throw trash

130
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,920
but the toilet,

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,360
The excrement flows into the same hole.

132
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,079
Don't be afraid to get dirty,

133
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,640
for all of you

134
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,719
already dirty.

135
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,320
Dirty from the body, speech to the heart.

136
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,680
Actually, me and my brother

137
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,680
come sit here,

138
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,040
You guys came to find trouble again.

139
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,119
Do you dare swear your breasts will sag, you bastard?

140
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,440
Say come and sit properly

141
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,160
Didn't you come sit here to annoy us?

142
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,759
The chair you're sitting on has an "oyster" in it

143
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
is my place.

144
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,119
The place you said is your place,

145
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,799
Let me see the red book.

146
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,679
You bought this place

147
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,840
Or was it inherited from your parents?

148
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,999
Son Thong, I am your senior,

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
You have to respect me a little.

150
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,840
I don't need to respect someone who spits on me.

151
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:45,640
I tell all of you

152
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,000
in case anyone is old. I'm here

153
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,800
as Mr. Bun's concubine.

154
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,159
Even though I just arrived

155
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,400
but I still have honor,

156
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,080
not inferior to anyone.

157
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,400
If you don't like it, stay away.

158
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,840
But if you come looking for trouble, then...

159
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
then just try it.

160
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,373
I want to know what you will do.

161
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,360
So let me ask you something.

162
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,079
You dare hit my brother? Children,

163
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,240
Go ahead and fight it.

164
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,399
How dare you?

165
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,080
Hold it, hit it.

166
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,720
This bastard, it's me.

167
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,640
Stop, stop.

168
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,120
Did the inspector come to find Mr. Bun?

169
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,640
I just finished discussing business.

170
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,959
They're just rehearsing a play.

171
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,279
Normally we practice like that.

172
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,719
Right, kids?

173
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
- Yes. - Yes.

174
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,359
 Oh!

175
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560
 Who kicked it?

176
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,040
 Who touched my sister?

177
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
 Is it okay?

178
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,439
 Oh, it hurts!

179
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,000
 Looks like my leg is swollen.

180
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,880
 Oh!

181
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,559
 Inspector, I think

182
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,519
 she must be in a lot of pain.

183
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,560
 Anyway

184
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,879
 please take care of her.

185
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,679
 Take it to the VIP room.

186
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,679
 Let me bring the medicine in later.

187
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,400
 - Thank you. - Yes.

188
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
 Slowly.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,960
 - Then let me bring ice and apply it. - No need!

190
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,239
 Let me do it myself.

191
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,000
 Anyway, thanks

192
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,239
 asked the inspector

193
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,799
 take care of Thong.

194
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,160
 I love her so much, I love her so much!

195
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,879
 - Thank you. - Yes.

196
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,040
 Oh, it hurts, it hurts!

197
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Just go slowly.

198
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,640
Shocked, shocked to the roof, shocked to the ceiling!

199
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,760
Shock fluttering!

200
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,800
Delicious but inedible!

201
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't hit me, don't hit me!

202
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,760
Mom!

203
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,760
The Thong is deeper than we thought.

204
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Does this hurt?

205
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
It hurts.

206
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,480
So what about this?

207
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,440
It hurts.

208
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,239
You sit down and rest.

209
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Don't touch it too hard.

210
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,399
Wait for the ice to come and apply it.

211
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
No swelling, it's okay.

212
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,120
Thank you, Inspector.

213
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,799
Do you know me?

214
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Know who you are?

215
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,359
Sister Si, tell me.

216
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,640
I'm a police officer, my name is Mit,

217
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,720
is Bun's younger brother.

218
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,920
So what about you, what's your name?

219
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,879
You just arrived?

220
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,520
I've never seen you before.

221
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,519
My name is Thong.

222
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I've only been here to work for a few days.

223
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,760
Then it was the sisters

224
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,000
As the inspector saw.

225
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,399
If you can't help in time,

226
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,000
I got slapped in the face.

227
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,080
Why do they bully me?

228
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,320
Did I do anything to them?

229
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,960
Probably makes them jealous.

230
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,439
I became Bun's pet chicken.

231
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,559
Anyway, the old person is there,

232
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,440
How many people can't?

233
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,720
So they get upset with me.

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,280
HAS!

235
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,200
But I have something to ask.

237
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,599
You look young,

238
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,560
Why are you in a place like this?

239
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,280
Then...

240
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,520
Thong!

241
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:03,800
The boss is calling!

242
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,079
So Thong, please allow me to go first.

243
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,279
So let's talk later, Inspector.

244
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Yes.

245
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,520
Go fast.

246
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,320
Oh.

247
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,880
Bun's new chicken?

248
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,240
I miss Bun so much.

249
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,239
Then Mr. Bun called me

250
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,960
We are truly compatible.

251
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,680
Just then he heard arguing.

252
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,680
What's the matter?

253
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,080
Stealing your organs?

254
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,879
That's right.

255
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,040
Well, it's because yours is so delicious.

256
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,799
But fighting doesn't even have time to sweat

257
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
it has stopped.

258
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,560
Come here.

259
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,880
How many times were you beaten?

260
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,160
And how many times can you beat her?

261
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,079
When fighting

262
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,599
The number of hits doesn't matter, Mr. Bun.

263
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,399
But it lies in the end result

264
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,240
that who wins or who loses.

265
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,999
Looks like we have to fight each other for a long time

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
just know the results.

267
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,899
So confident, huh?

268
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,000
Maybe you lose today or tomorrow.

269
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,879
Don't end the game so quickly, Malee.

270
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,280
I still want to see you two

271
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,280
fight for a long time.

272
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,080
Have a little mercy on Thong.

273
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,799
No need to hold back.

274
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,919
How many

275
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,240
Then please do your best.

276
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,960
Because Thong

277
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,160
I won't hold back either.

278
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,679
 Your chicken should be like that

279
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,800
 You two, please prepare well.

280
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,920
 I will take you both to the event.

281
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,759
 Normal

282
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,599
 when Bun goes to events

283
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,159
 will only take away one woman,

284
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,439
 but this time

285
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,080
 brought two people with him.

286
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,839
 I think

287
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,119
 Bun wants to see Malee

288
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,359
 tingled with victory over her.

289
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,359
 And probably wants to see you

290
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,600
 struggled to fight with Malee.

291
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,599
 So why did he do that?

292
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,280
 Is that crazy? When it's peaceful and natural, why fight?

293
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,280
Have you ever seen,

294
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:58,279
Men like it

295
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,080
fish fighting cock fighting. Something like that.

296
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Inspect!

297
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,079
Ah, I just finished work.

298
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,440
Then I happened to drive by here.

299
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,040
Is this your colleague?

300
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,480
Where is home? Do you need me to take you home?

301
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,479
Oh, thank you, Inspector.

302
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,160
Thong and Ms. Si were about to go to the front to wait for a taxi.

303
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,159
Thank you, let's go Si.

304
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,440
- Please. - Thong!

305
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,879
You go with the inspector first.

306
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,239
Si just happened to think of it

307
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,680
there is something that needs to be resolved.

308
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,637
- Okay, then let's meet at home, Sis. - YES.

309
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,920
Go!

310
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,880
I'll go first.

311
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,199
Thank you, Inspector.

312
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
- Yes. - Yes.

313
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,240
 [Invite to the room but don't rush to have sex]

314
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,520
Thank you, Inspector.

315
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,160
Inspector, do you want to come to my room for coffee first?

316
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,359
It's okay.

317
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,879
It's almost morning.

318
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,720
After drinking coffee, I couldn't sleep.

319
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
But

320
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,400
Could you please let me go to Thong's room?

321
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,559
I don't mean anything.

322
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,920
I just

323
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,920
Just want to talk for a bit.

324
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,560
Inspector wants to talk to you?

325
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,400
Thank you.

326
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,279
Thong just means,

327
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,600
a daughter,

328
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,800
The inspector is a senior police officer.

329
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,320
What will be said to Thong?

330
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Then

331
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,320
Continue what you were talking about earlier.

332
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,800
He wanted to know why Thong

333
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,800
come to work at this bar?

334
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,800
You still look young.

335
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,239
It's... our life,

336
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,160
There aren't many choices either.

337
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,520
If given a choice, no one would want to do this job.

338
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,000
But I have to do this

339
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,080
because of forced circumstances.

340
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
The thing is

341
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,080
my house

342
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:46,790
very poor.

343
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,599
I have to earn money to support myself.

344
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,799
What job can you do to make a lot of money?

345
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,400
I did it all.

346
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,120
I have to send money home too.

347
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,040
And when sister Si saw me and

348
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,520
Her face looked good, so she invited me to work.

349
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
So what if

350
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,440
he has another choice for Thong

351
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,040
Does Thong want to choose?

352
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,320
I have money for you too.

353
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,840
Other options?

354
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,680
What choice is that?

355
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,800
Does Thong have any questions?

356
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,479
when you're a police officer and come looking for me

357
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
Is your brother a seller of illegal drugs?

358
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,600
I have a secret to tell you.

359
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,680
But Thong absolutely must not tell anyone.

360
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Yes,

361
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,280
Thong won't tell anyone.

362
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,280
The thing is

363
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,640
he pretended to be in the same boat as the illegal drug sellers.

364
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,160
Both accepting disadvantages and creating conditions

365
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,160
Let them fall into the subjective trap.

366
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,160
Then after that

367
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,880
I will catch them all.

368
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:03,865
Even though Bun is my brother, he won't forgive me.

369
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,600
Inspector, why are you talking about this with Thong?

370
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,360
Aren't you afraid that Thong will go talk to Mr. Bun again?

371
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,440
I want Thong

372
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
cooperate with you

373
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,800
 and spy for you.

374
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,280
 Collect Mr. Bun's information for you.

375
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,999
 But if one day Thong thinks wrongly

376
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,800
 or think about betraying him

377
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,960
 then Thong will be killed by you before planning.

378
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,840
 If you can't do it

379
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,520
 then you wouldn't exist today.

380
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,759
 Thong can't do it.

381
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,040
 Inspector, please ask someone else to do it.

382
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,160
 I choose Thong

383
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,520
 is because Thong is new.

384
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,839
 Probably haven't been hit by him yet

385
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,200
 doesn't control too much.

386
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,680
I think you will still stand for goodness.

387
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,080
And he believes

388
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,080
is from deep within

389
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,080
Thong is a good person.

390
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Trust me.

391
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,160
Stand with the police

392
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,360
Either way, it's better than siding with the bad guys.

393
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,200
 Thong, how are you and the inspector?

394
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
 You're welcome.

395
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:35,280
 He just stopped by for a drink.

396
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
 What country?

397
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,759
 Look at her face

398
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,480
 is definitely not filtered water.

399
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,599
 I told you not to give it away.

400
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,279
 Give something and it will disappear forever.

401
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
 Why not prolong it?

402
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,079
 Sister.

403
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,320
 Trust me.

404
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,440
 Actually, I don't have anything with him yet.

405
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,360
 I'm not so excited that I can't control myself.

406
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,119
 Furthermore,

407
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,320
 he is a gentleman,

408
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
 didn't even touch me.

409
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,080
 If so then

410
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,399
 Why does your face look tense?

411
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,399
 your face is so gloomy?

412
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,600
 Like I'm worried that I'm about to get pregnant.

413
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,760
 What help does the Inspector want from Thong?

414
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,039
Per month,

415
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,046
District Chief Oun will hold a party.

416
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,879
It will bring together all business networks

417
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:23,046
drug trafficking together.

418
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,400
I think this month's party

419
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,720
Mr. Bun will take Thong with him.

420
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
That's right.

421
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,639
I heard that Mr. Bun will take Thong to some party or something, I don't know.

422
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,960
That's right, it's this party.

423
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,960
I want Thong

424
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,960
secretly set up a wiretapping machine.

425
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,640
He wanted to know what district chief Oun and Mr. Bun talked about.

426
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,999
If Mr. Bun catches it

427
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
then Thong will be shot to death there?

428
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
I believe Thong is smart enough.

429
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,960
Thong will find a way to avoid being caught.

430
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,560
I believe Thong can do it.

431
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,480
This mission

432
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,120
no matter how talented the police are

433
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,720
No one can do it except Thong.

434
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,720
If Thong completes the mission successfully

435
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,440
This will be a significant contribution to the government.

436
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
I agree.

437
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,440
Thong will help the inspector succeed in this task.

438
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
Thank you.

439
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Don't forget.

440
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,400
This matter is a state secret.

441
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,400
Only the two of us know.

442
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,040
Don't tell anyone.

443
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,040
Nothing.

444
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,839
I'm just thinking what I should do to make him like me.

445
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,640
That's all.

446
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:45,919
No more talking, I'm going to sleep.

447
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,760
This.

448
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:47,879
Don't sleep yet.

449
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,199
Thong, sit up.

450
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,199
Tell me what we talked about.

451
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,079
I try to create opportunities for both of you

452
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,879
be together.

453
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,319
Sit up now, quickly.

454
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
This.

455
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Oh.

456
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,759
Hello Oun district chief.

457
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,480
Hello, Mr. Bun.

458
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,319
- How many drinks have you had? - Just have a few drinks.

459
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,599
Waiting for Mr. Bun here.

460
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,399
This night is still very long.

461
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
- Come sit down. - Yes.

462
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,000
- Is the district chief okay? - I'm fine.

463
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,719
- Sit down. - Hello.

464
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,880
Just be natural.

465
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,320
Pour me some wine.

466
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,679
Did you double it today?

467
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,360
Please give me one, please.

468
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Impossible.

469
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:39,000
These two are my treasures.

470
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,799
Thong, Malee.

471
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,000
Say hello to the district chief.

472
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,760
- Hello. - Hello.

473
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,279
I've met Malee before.

474
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,520
As for Thong, I just met her.

475
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,439
Your eyes are really good, where did you get them from?

476
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,600
Beautiful like an angel.

477
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,199
This district chief.

478
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,439
Last time,

479
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,799
The district chief also praised her as beautiful as an angel.

480
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,879
So today the district chief will make a decision, who is more beautiful?

481
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,879
It's okay for the district chief to make Malee more beautiful.

482
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,879
Thong doesn't care about these things.

483
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,400
For people with low self-esteem

484
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,600
then compliments can be very important to them.

485
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,039
Thong go to the bathroom for a bit.

486
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
YES.

487
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
District Chief.

488
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,919
- Is that Okay? - Very cool.

489
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
That's okay, man.

490
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,360
Em Thong,

491
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
where?

492
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,079
Thong is at the event venue.

493
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
At this time, Thong has prepared all the equipment.

494
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Okay, good.

495
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,440
So, Thong, hide the device under the table.

496
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,000
Or hide it as close to Mr. Bun as possible.

497
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,999
Hide it carefully.

498
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,679
Don't let it be discovered.

499
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
That's it.

500
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,319
But there are a lot of people sitting at the table.

501
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,320
Malee is also always watching Thong.

502
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,319
Can I keep thongs in my bag?

503
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,360
Impossible.

504
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,679
Because when they talk about something important,

505
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,240
They won't let Thong sit at the table.

506
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,519
And one more thing, if Thong

507
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,519
was caught and the items were still on him

508
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,720
then you will have bad luck.

509
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,720
Yes, Inspector.

510
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,760
You can do it, Thong.

511
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,600
Please take care of me guys.

512
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Thong, come here and sit.

513
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,600
Thong, the food has arrived.

514
00:26:58,601 --> 00:26:59,680
Eat something.

515
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,240
- Yes, Mr. Bun. - You.

516
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Bring the wine here.

517
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Thong.

518
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,319
 Don't drink too much.

519
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,039
 Finished eating

520
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,319
 then you'll have a game

521
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,640
 leave me and Malee

522
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,440
 fight each other.

523
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,799
 What game is that?

524
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,600
 Do you guys use musical chairs to pop balls, bro?

525
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,759
 Those games are so childish.

526
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,559
 People like you two

527
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,319
 must demonstrate youthfulness, beauty,

528
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,319
 but you still haven't said what game it is.

529
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,640
 You'll know it yourself.

530
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,199
 But Thong and Malee

531
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,119
 will have to fight in front of everyone here.

532
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,200
Do you agree?

533
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,759
Agree, Mr. Bun. Just say whatever game it is.

534
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,359
Malee was originally a warrior,

535
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,639
but Malee just wants to know

536
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,239
What does the winner get?

537
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,320
And what punishment does the loser get?

538
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,480
I haven't thought about this yet.

539
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,120
So what do you want?

540
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,919
So let the winner

541
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,640
command one thing to the loser, anything is fine.

542
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,879
Malee intended for the loser

543
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,279
take off your clothes, crawl between your legs,

544
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,880
Is that okay, Mr. Bun?

545
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Thong,

546
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,520
Do you agree?

547
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,640
I agree.

548
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,879
But what's the point of Thong giving orders to the loser?

549
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,559
Well let me see how it goes.

550
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,799
I still haven't thought of it.

551
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,200
YES.

552
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,839
What to think?

553
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,639
Either way, there's no way she can win.

554
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,359
Take time to think

555
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,279
which hand to use,

556
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,120
Is it better to cover the back or the front?

557
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,919
Want to see it or not? Want to see it or not?
