1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:01,328
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:41,805
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:46,189
Today is the big Buddha festival, Mont will go to the temple with mom, okay?

4
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:48,189
Go do some good deeds,

5
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,949
to avoid bad karma.

6
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:54,589
Okay.

7
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,589
Thong, will you come with me?

8
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:58,869
Impossible.

9
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,269
Mom wants to give Thong a job to do.

10
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:05,429
Thong, please clean the Buddha worship room today.

11
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:07,509
Clean out all the nooks and crannies.

12
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:10,029
You're the one who wants to be clean, aren't you?

13
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,869
You go with your mother, I can go another day too.

14
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:20,709
That's OK.

15
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,189
So let me help you fold the lotus flowers.

16
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:34,269
You must take advantage of the time to go to the temple and do a lot of merit there.

17
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:37,709
Because my job is all about going to bars and floors.

18
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:40,869
Do good deeds to neutralize bad karma.

19
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,669
Yes, mother.

20
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:45,469
Let's go quickly.

21
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,469
Miss.

22
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,189
I greet you.

23
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,709
Yem, you came at the right time.

24
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,989
Let's go, bring the offerings and make offerings together.

25
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:58,389
Wait, mom.

26
00:01:58,949 --> 00:02:00,429
Mom asked Yem to come?

27
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:03,589
That's right, didn't your mother tell you?

28
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:05,469
Are not.

29
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:08,109
Mom just invited me to do a favor.

30
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:11,869
It doesn't matter if you say it or not.

31
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:13,869
That's just the way it is.

32
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:15,869
Let's go, quickly bring the offerings to the monks.

33
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:16,909
he's waiting.

34
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:17,909
Go.

35
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,549
(Reciting scripture)

36
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,109
We, to become husband and wife together

37
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:54,549
then we must have fate with each other,

38
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:56,989
must have done good deeds in the same life,

39
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:59,149
In the past, we made offerings and offerings together.

40
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:02,069
They must have been born together before.

41
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,509
Through many lifetimes.

42
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:07,389
In this life we ​​have the opportunity to meet again,

43
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,029
considered rare.

44
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,389
Master, the two of us

45
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,149
- It's not... - It's nothing, monk.

46
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:15,869
Please continue teaching, sir.

47
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:21,709
That's why, when we meet our other half

48
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,869
then hold it tight.

49
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,349
Really comfortable, right Yem?

50
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:33,629
Yes, ma'am.

51
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:40,269
Mom, what is the purpose of calling me here?

52
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,549
Don't look at the world in such a negative way.

53
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:47,309
Mom just wants two children

54
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:49,229
to listen to sermons,

55
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,749
just to make life better.

56
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:56,749
Yem, let's go for a walk with Mont.

57
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,149
I'll go meet my friends at the retreat first.

58
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:00,349
Yes, ma'am.

59
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,269
You don't need to say that you want to go to the temple to listen to Buddhist scriptures.

60
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:12,229
I will definitely fall to hell.

61
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:13,669
When we met each other,

62
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:15,509
When I pass by the Royal Temple, I don't even bow.

63
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,509
Why do you suddenly want to go to temple?

64
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:21,629
That's because I'm not a thinking person.

65
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:25,629
It was my mother who thought of it and asked us to come here to meet each other.

66
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,069
Why meet? Meet for what?

67
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,429
Let us get back together?

68
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:37,549
Let's be frank, Mont.

69
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:41,349
I still have feelings for you.

70
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,029
I still want you in my life.

71
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:48,869
When we broke up, I always thought of you.

72
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,029
I know, but now I have a new lover.

73
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,309
What else did you come to get from me?

74
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:59,989
Wait, don't be so quick to misunderstand, Mont.

75
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:03,389
I don't intend to stop or take Mont away from Thong.

76
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,949
I only came to see Mont in the name of my ex-lover,

77
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:08,109
Just in the name of being your mother's friend.

78
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,469
Or in the name of being an acquaintance or whatever.

79
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:14,669
When Mont came to ask me to help with Thong's matter,

80
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:16,549
You even called me.

81
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,829
Because I also feel that we met

82
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:20,389
It's not something wrong, is it?

83
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:22,429
Yes, that's right.

84
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:27,709
If we meet as friends and don't think too much, then we agree.

85
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,029
But if you want to harm the relationship between me and Thong

86
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:33,429
Please tell me first, don't.

87
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,629
because it will never happen.

88
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:39,869
Now I love Thong, very much.

89
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:43,149
I love you more than when I dated you.

90
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:50,509
Mont used to be Yem's lover,

91
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:54,389
compatible with each other in everything but when parting ways,

92
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:57,589
Mont knows a woman with a messy personal life like Thong

93
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,109
take your place, don't you feel anything?

94
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:03,909
That Mont finds Thong better than me?

95
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:16,229
Mont, come here for a moment.

96
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,549
I will introduce you to my friends.

97
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:22,069
It's better not to bother, it will distract them unnecessarily.

98
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:24,109
Don't lose focus, just a little.

99
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,309
Sister, sister Na.

100
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,109
Ruedee's baby is big and tall, right?

101
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:42,349
Seen it

102
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,229
Thinking about my child again.

103
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,429
If the boy is still alive

104
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,429
then maybe

105
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,669
will grow equally,

106
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,669
They have similar physiques, so they can probably be friends with each other.

107
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,949
Mom once told Mont about it

108
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,069
Ms. Na's son was unlucky

109
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:02,349
when you marry a bad woman as your wife.

110
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:06,909
Please give me my condolences.

111
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,109
It's OK.

112
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:14,389
Just consider taking your son's story as a lesson.

113
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:17,589
The fact that you have a lover,

114
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:20,509
I think we should consider it.

115
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,789
Look at that woman

116
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,669
What is your background like?

117
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:26,949
Is there someone to train or teach?

118
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,589
Must check background carefully.

119
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,549
See who her parents are and where they come from.

120
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,629
Otherwise

121
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:36,229
bring women for nothing

122
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,589
Get married and live in your own house

123
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,829
will bring bad things

124
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:45,269
for our families and children. Remember that, kid.

125
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:50,189
Yes, I will remember.

126
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:53,909
If you have free time, bring your lover

127
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:55,789
Come let me see.

128
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:58,309
I see many people,

129
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,949
I just need to look a little to know

130
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,589
what kind of person she is.

131
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,269
Women can't hide it well.

132
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,229
We see through our eyes.

133
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:12,429
Whatever their eyes look like is their nature.

134
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:15,509
Okay.

135
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,829
Next time I will bring it to you to see.

136
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,549
But my child's lover

137
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:23,149
doesn't work at all.

138
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:27,229
Just helping with housework to get through the day.

139
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:28,349
Really?

140
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,029
So let's start with the first question.

141
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:40,749
Before she joined Inspector Mit's harem,

142
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:42,669
What job did you do?

143
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,549
I work at a bar owned by boss Bun, the inspector's brother.

144
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:50,749
I heard that bar also has prostitution.

145
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:52,749
Do you do that job?

146
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:53,909
Wait, Yem.

147
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:55,789
I want to learn about Inspector Mit, right?

148
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,589
Is it necessary to ask again from such depth?

149
00:08:57,749 --> 00:08:59,149
I don't think it has anything to do with it.

150
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,469
Related.

151
00:09:00,469 --> 00:09:02,789
I'm talking about Inspector Mit's harem,

152
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:04,789
Then you must also have information about the girls in there,

153
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:05,949
who they are, where they come from,

154
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:07,189
What is their background?

155
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:09,189
That's what we call sensational news.

156
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:12,789
And Thong is the only girl in the harem that I found.

157
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,589
So we have to ask a little deeper.

158
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:20,749
It's okay, Mont.

159
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:24,469
Yem helped us plan to take Inspector Mit to jail.

160
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:26,309
We must repay her.

161
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:32,749
Thong, if there are any questions you don't want to answer

162
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,469
then you don't need to answer.

163
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:41,069
I don't receive guests like the staff there.

164
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:44,909
I am the boss's concubine, I only serve him.

165
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,269
Serve that she said

166
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,589
is to satisfy his sexual needs, right?

167
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:52,829
That's right.

168
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,869
Basically, she's just a prostitute selling herself.

169
00:09:58,189 --> 00:09:59,149
Right?

170
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:02,429
But the difference is that she sold it to one person.

171
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,389
That's right.

172
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:09,869
Mont, I think it would be better if you went out.

173
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,509
I don't want to hear these stories.

174
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:14,429
Besides, if I have you, then you

175
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,389
It's inconvenient for Yem to give information.

176
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:23,069
That's OK.

177
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:27,469
But if it's not okay, say so.

178
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:47,789
It's convenient.

179
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:51,069
I will tell you all the details.

180
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:53,069
Please post all this news.

181
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:57,269
Boss Bun is a very violent sex man.

182
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:01,149
Be strong from morning to night, if he gets high one day,

183
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,509
the more intense the style will be.

184
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:06,309
Making love all day and all night, without stopping.

185
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:08,709
As for Inspector Mit

186
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,469
no less than each other, they are power-loving people,

187
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:12,989
likes to wear handcuffs,

188
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:14,749
Play the role of a police officer catching criminals.

189
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:17,309
It's very fun, have you ever done it?

190
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,669
Or did she just do it in basic ladylike style?

191
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,589
And her legs

192
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:27,011
Can it be spread more than 90 degrees?

193
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:29,269
You should practice,

194
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:31,549
so you can do more poses without getting bored.

195
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:33,829
This place is yours

196
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,109
There's more talent than you think, you know?

197
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,658
I can practice for you too.

198
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:41,309
Do not.

199
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,029
Let me go.

200
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:51,429
Wait a minute.

201
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:54,629
There are still a lot of details.

202
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:57,669
Don't you want to know anymore? The program is not good.

203
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:01,829
I forgot

204
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:04,363
is my program for educated people.

205
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:06,571
Maybe they don't understand what she said.

206
00:12:06,787 --> 00:12:08,107
It's too vile.

207
00:12:08,524 --> 00:12:10,644
What do you want from me?

208
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:12,949
Why do you keep biting me?

209
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:16,909
Pathogens spend their entire lives in dirty environments.

210
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,069
It will never be known what kind of disease it will bring.

211
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:23,109
I just want you to know that you are very vile,

212
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,869
Not worthy of Mont.

213
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:29,469
Worth it or not, I don't know.

214
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,829
But he chose me.

215
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:35,789
So what about what you're doing?

216
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:39,149
Don't say you want to get back with Mont.

217
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:42,349
Didn't you say you didn't want to read the old book again?

218
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:45,909
People like me absolutely will not compete with anyone for men.

219
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:47,349
Especially with someone like you.

220
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,789
I'm just worried about Mont as a friend.

221
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:51,429
He should meet a better woman

222
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:52,549
Not a woman like you.

223
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:55,109
Worry about money.

224
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:58,069
If it's not yours, why worry anymore?

225
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:01,269
I don't worry about money.

226
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,269
Mont likes anyone.

227
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:05,869
But it must be someone with higher education than me or equal to me,

228
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:07,749
rather than choosing something inferior like you.

229
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:09,269
She just couldn't accept it

230
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:12,309
Mont leaving a noble woman like her

231
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:15,069
to reach the lowly me.

232
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:18,389
But it's worth it.

233
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:20,949
Excellent female reporter

234
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,869
must lose to evil women.

235
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:28,829
If this news spreads out, she will surely lose face.

236
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,549
You probably won't dare to appear on television for the rest of your life, right?

237
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,349
So she finally knows

238
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:36,789
You're a bad woman, aren't you?

239
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:37,949
I know.

240
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:40,989
But this is my life, how can I refuse?

241
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,949
I have to accept it.

242
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:44,989
She said she loved Mont.

243
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:47,549
If you love, you must hope for the best for the other person.

244
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:49,749
I want the person I love to have good things happen to me.

245
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:52,269
Do you want Mont to love someone like you?

246
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,429
Think carefully.

247
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:00,549
If Mont marries a woman like you

248
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:02,789
What will Mont's life be like?

249
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:18,109
Ms. Si.

250
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:21,829
Have you ever truly loved anyone?

251
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:24,069
At this age

252
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:26,829
You have to go through some good things, too.

253
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:29,389
How? Would you marry that person?

254
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:33,509
Then we broke up, I was the one who left him.

255
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:35,869
He's not good, he betrayed you, right?

256
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:37,869
I'm the one who's not good.

257
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:40,629
When I dated him,

258
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:43,709
I also started working in a bar.

259
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,189
And he is the deputy district secretary.

260
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,989
Then one day, there was his friend

261
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:51,389
come hang out at the shop where I work.

262
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,709
Then that person recognized me.

263
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:54,349
The next day,

264
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:57,109
everyone at work knows

265
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:59,269
that he has a girlfriend who works as a bar girl.

266
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:01,589
It's true that friends with big mouths talk a lot.

267
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:04,109
So what does your lover do?

268
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:06,589
Then the next day, his supervisor called to talk.

269
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:09,669
And told him it was state business

270
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:13,109
is an honorable job. If he

271
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:16,069
If you want to advance at work, you have to break up with me.

272
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:17,829
But he refused to break up.

273
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:19,949
He even planned to resign.

274
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:21,949
That's true love.

275
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,069
So did that person really resign?

276
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:27,389
No, he hasn't resigned yet

277
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,149
I said goodbye to him and fled to Bangkok.

278
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:33,429
I don't want his life to fall into a deep hole.

279
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:36,829
But I thought right. Because now

280
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:39,629
He is already district president.

281
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,989
Thong.

282
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:58,869
What are you doing?

283
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:03,429
No, just thinking about some random things.

284
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:07,549
Thinking about Yem coming for an interview today, right?

285
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:12,309
Don't think too much, let it go!

286
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:36,909
No matter who you used to be,

287
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:43,429
Whatever you've been through, please don't worry.

288
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,949
This is my man.

289
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:51,349
Despite what happened,

290
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:57,909
From now on, I will be by your side to take care of you.

291
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:03,549
With love from the heart.

292
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:07,349
So cheesy!

293
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:09,589
Oh.

294
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,869
I'm just a little sweet and you're already saying it's cheesy.

295
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:17,149
Mont.

296
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,109
You are a very good person!

297
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,989
Good personality,

298
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,389
educated,

299
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,909
work is also good.

300
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:39,309
Who said that? There are many bad stories about you.

301
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:41,509
Let me tell you.

302
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:45,429
In 11th grade, he failed the physical education exam.

303
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,149
Back then there was volleyball, he liked to play ball,

304
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,029
then hit the teacher in the face.

305
00:17:52,189 --> 00:17:53,309
So the teacher failed him.

306
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,829
While in college,

307
00:17:56,989 --> 00:18:00,029
The teacher asked him to skip class because he did not go to school.

308
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:03,389
Because class started early, but I was too lazy to get up.

309
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:07,789
This is the main thing, when you become a musician,

310
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:10,469
Customers in the restaurant often boo

311
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:12,669
because he forgot the lyrics.

312
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,309
No one is perfect, Thong.

313
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,629
But he has one good point that no one can deny.

314
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:29,309
What is that?

315
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:33,469
Handsome!

316
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:36,949
YES!

317
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:44,909
Thong!

318
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:47,789
Don't think too much.

319
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:51,789
You are like this, I already love you so much.

320
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,709
Mont!

321
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:01,109
Please take me to supplementary school.

322
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,309
I want to finish high school.

323
00:19:03,949 --> 00:19:05,909
Then go on to university like you.

324
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:10,229
If I graduate, I will find a job.

325
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:12,349
Does Mont think it's good?

326
00:19:14,229 --> 00:19:16,629
Good, Thong! Very good!

327
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:20,909
So when Thong receives his diploma, he has to sing this song.

328
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:25,149
Get to know you

329
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:30,149
- just like this heart is revived. - It's like this heart is revived.

330
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:32,269
What else?

331
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:36,189
- No matter what the world around... - No matter what the world around...

332
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:37,509
Have you heard?

333
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,869
Heard it before.

334
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:00,429
Enough documents? Checked yet?

335
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:01,949
That's enough, Dad!

336
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,669
You act like you're taking your child to register for elementary school.

337
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:06,589
I'm nervous for you.

338
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:08,709
Mont!

339
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:13,509
Go to the temple with mom for a bit, there's work at the temple today.

340
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:16,549
But Mont has to take Thong to register for vocational school, Mom.

341
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:18,869
What time is it coming? Can you follow me in time?

342
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:23,549
Morning work, after the bell rings, is over.

343
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:26,829
So let me follow and clean up for you.

344
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:30,589
So why don't you let Thong register himself?

345
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:33,389
Being this old, acting like a child.

346
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:37,229
Mont promised Thong that he would go with him a long time ago.

347
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:40,509
Mom just said, who can prepare in time?

348
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:45,029
Like this, Mont just go with mom in the morning,

349
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:47,629
Then you can come with me in the afternoon, they accept applications until 4 o'clock.

350
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:50,709
Okay, so Thong will go to the temple with me?

351
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:52,789
I don't want to drive back and forth.

352
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:54,229
Okay mom?

353
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:01,869
Anger is rising.

354
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:04,829
If I knew in advance I was suffering

355
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,069
then there will be no more suffering,

356
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:09,709
won't scream.

357
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:13,589
We must learn to use reason.

358
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:16,109
Like driving,

359
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:20,029
Must practice to know how to drive.

360
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:23,669
If we have never practiced,

361
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:26,669
don't know how to go

362
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,909
will crash into each other everywhere.

363
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:31,429
Sister, sister!

364
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,749
Older sister!

365
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:37,989
My son brought his lover here.

366
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:39,429
Across.

367
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:42,749
There is one thing to always remember

368
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:45,949
if the mind is not pure

369
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:48,389
then watch your breath,

370
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:51,589
That's what will help

371
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:53,949
keep our emotions down.

372
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:57,229
Thongdee!

373
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:10,416
Thongdee!

374
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,947
- You killed my child. - Older sister.

375
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:15,764
- You killed my son. - Older sister.

376
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:17,469
- Don't run away, I'll kill you. - Older sister.

377
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,549
I will kill you.

378
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,269
- You must die. You must die. - Calm down, aunt.

379
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:21,709
 - You must die. - Aunt.

380
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:22,869
 - You must die. - Older sister!

381
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:23,812
 [This is inappropriate behavior] You must die.

382
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:26,829
 [and don't imitate.] Calm down first. Aunt let go.

383
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:29,469
 - Thongdee. - Auntie, let go.

384
00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:31,989
 - I'm scared, help me. - Aunt, aunt.

385
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,429
- Please keep order. - Help, help.

386
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:35,669
- Everyone, please be quiet. - Help.

387
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:38,109
- Everyone said according to Atama. - Aunt.

388
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:40,469
- What happened? - Hey, sister.

389
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:41,869
Aunt, that's enough.

390
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:43,189
 [Inappropriate behavior should not be imitated]

391
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:44,389
You come here.

392
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:45,229
You come and bow.

393
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:46,669
- Be careful, aunt. - You go bow to the dead person.

394
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:48,109
- Aunt. - It has nothing to do with you.

395
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,149
- It's okay to say it slowly. - Don't interfere.

396
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:51,069
If you say don't interfere, don't interfere.

397
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,589
If you're so hot-tempered, you won't be able to understand each other.

398
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:53,469
YES.

399
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:55,629
- Thong. - Come here.

400
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:57,229
Come here. This.

401
00:22:57,229 --> 00:22:59,229
Here, the man you killed.

402
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:00,389
You bastard.

403
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:02,509
Here, look.

404
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:06,109
[Wirachay Rungsirisuk, 22.08.1991 - 18.10.2016]

405
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,509
Wi.

406
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:15,189
Thong, I'm sorry.

407
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:17,909
Thong came to say goodbye to him too late.

408
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:20,749
Today Thong came to bow to me.

409
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:24,349
Pray that you will go to a better world.

410
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:27,709
This demon.

411
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:30,429
Don't pretend to be a good person.

412
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,949
You are the one who caused it to die.

413
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:36,029
Making the boy have to live in a world of crime.

414
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:37,989
Thong did not kill Mr. Wi.

415
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:39,389
Yai was the one who stabbed him.

416
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:41,709
Thong tried to help but Mr. Wi did not wake up.

417
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:55,549
Sister, calm down.

418
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:58,069
Adjust your breathing.

419
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:07,469
I will tell you.

420
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:09,829
My son

421
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:13,349
lay in the intensive care unit for many days.

422
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:20,829
When he woke up, the first thing the boy called

423
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:24,229
it's you, Thong.

424
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:29,509
The boy called out to find little Thong,

425
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:31,509
tell me that

426
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:33,909
Don't be angry Thong,

427
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:35,909
Thong is not wrong,

428
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:38,629
Thong didn't do anything.

429
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,789
But I want to say

430
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,669
Even though Wi

431
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:50,269
I only talk a little and get tired,

432
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:55,469
But the boy still has the strength to protect this child.

433
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,029
And then, the boy waited,

434
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:02,149
wait and wait.

435
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:04,149
Waiting for Thong to visit

436
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:06,149
but she never came.

437
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:09,149
And I think about my son dying

438
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,989
is to die of heartbreak.

439
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:13,389
Because of this demon.

440
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:16,189
You're a bastard, Thong.

441
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:19,269
Wi.

442
00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:24,909
Wi.

443
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:27,149
Mr. Wi.

444
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:29,789
Thong, I'm sorry.

445
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:34,389
Thong didn't know it would turn out like this.

446
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:36,989
Thong didn't know what happened.

447
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:40,309
If Thong knew I was waiting

448
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:44,429
then Thong will quickly come to see you.

449
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:46,189
Thong apologizes.

450
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:49,589
Hey lady.

451
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,469
No need to shed tears. No one believes you.

452
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:55,509
She must have been happy at that time

453
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:57,949
- with her new husband. - Mom.

454
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:59,949
This is not about us.

455
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:02,469
There is no need to give an opinion.

456
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:04,469
This much is enough chaos.

457
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:12,629
Even though you weren't the one who killed Wi

458
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:16,349
But you are the cause of its death.

459
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,909
But you didn't just kill him,

460
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:22,349
but you kill me too, you kill me too.

461
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:28,069
Do you know how much torment I live in?

462
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:29,709
when my child is gone?

463
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,069
Huh?

464
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,069
Con Thong! Bitch!

465
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,269
Let me tell you,

466
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:41,989
I'm trying to stay awake.

467
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:51,109
But I'm trying to stay awake to kill you.

468
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:53,989
I will take out my gun and shoot you.

469
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:02,949
Just one thing,

470
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:06,789
There's only one thing I haven't done yet.

471
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:12,589
People like you

472
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:16,189
You deserve this, Thong!

473
00:27:16,189 --> 00:27:18,149
- Tell me! Tell me! - With Thong!

474
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:19,469
- Aunt, don't! - Don't.

475
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:22,349
That's enough, auntie.

476
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:26,469
What have you practiced?

477
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:28,949
Don't waste your time, practice using it a little.

478
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:32,069
Otherwise people will say it's useless.

479
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:45,109
Mont!

480
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:48,549
Do that with your mother

481
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:50,549
That's very rude, you know?

482
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:52,829
Just because I want to protect this woman

483
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:54,469
But does it have to go to that extent?

484
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:55,669
That's right, mom.

485
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:57,269
Mont has to do the right thing.

486
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:59,869
As for her slapping Thong, that was the wrong thing to do.

487
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:01,869
Mom, please differentiate properly.

488
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:03,389
Can you differentiate?

489
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:05,389
Especially looking at people.

490
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:07,389
This woman is like a comet,

491
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,389
only knowing how to follow and harm people.

492
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:12,389
Now the husbands first

493
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:14,829
are all dead.

494
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:16,829
This time,

495
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,829
She wants to cling to that Mont.

496
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,149
Mont hasn't realized it yet?

497
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:21,389
No, mom.

498
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:22,749
Thong also has his own money.

499
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:25,389
More than me, why is she clinging to me?

500
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:27,869
How can you have money with a face like this?

501
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:29,869
Where to get it from?

502
00:28:30,949 --> 00:28:32,829
Where she got it from is her business, Mom.

503
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:33,949
Mom doesn't need to know.

504
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:36,189
Inspector for Thong.

505
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:39,149
That's the pay, for Thong staying with him.

506
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:41,429
To be clear, it is...

507
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:43,669
money from selling yourself, right?

508
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:48,589
Mont! Our family has never done anything embarrassing.

509
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:51,989
No one has ever had such a dirty background.

510
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:55,069
If Mont wants to choose this woman as his wife

511
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,629
then we are no longer mother and daughter.

512
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:37,750
THE ROSE OF SIN
