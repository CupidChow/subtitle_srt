1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,400
[The film was created for entertainment purposes.]

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,520
[Characters, actions, places and events in the film are hypothetical events.]

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,440
[No intention of sexual arousal,]

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,440
[leading or inciting inappropriate or morally corrupt behavior]

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,000
[And there is no intention to cause damage to any profession]

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[or have a negative attitude toward any organization or group of people.]

7
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:17,019
THE ROSE OF SIN

8
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,495
THE ROSE OF SIN

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
Episode 20

10
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,341
Is Malee waiting to welcome you?

11
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:30,061
When Malee first heard about this,

12
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,421
Malee doesn't feel very well.

13
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:35,221
I don't know if I should tell him or not.

14
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,221
But Malee doesn't want him

15
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:39,021
become a fool who is deceived by others.

16
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:40,181
Should decide

17
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:42,541
will tell you.

18
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,421
Just say whatever you want to say, no need to be shy.

19
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,981
The story of the tycoon was discovered promptly and escaped

20
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:51,421
It's because of Thong

21
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,341
betray you.

22
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:19,741
Oh.

23
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:17,861
Mr. Mit.

24
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:22,101
What happened?

25
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,901
Who did what to Thong?

26
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,581
Why did Thong become like this?

27
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:28,861
Thong did it himself.

28
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:32,981
I took the trouble to make a good offer to Thong,

29
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,981
Let Thong join your side.

30
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:36,941
And if this works

31
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:38,381
then Thong will also get a part.

32
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:40,621
Thong's life will be much better than this.

33
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:44,101
But Thong chose to betray him

34
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:45,461
to protect bad guys.

35
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:54,061
What are you talking about, Mit?

36
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:56,541
Thong doesn't understand.

37
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:58,261
Thong doesn't know anything.

38
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:00,621
Stop acting innocent.

39
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:02,821
I already know everything.

40
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:05,701
Thong has never been sincere with him.

41
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,381
While before, he was always honest with Thong.

42
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:10,701
Surely

43
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,101
Are you always serious with Thong?

44
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:16,901
Thong is not just used as a tool

45
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,341
to take revenge on his brother

46
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:21,421
Or are you hoping to grow at work?

47
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:25,181
He also uses love and good hope

48
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,421
just to trick Thong into working for him.

49
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,261
Thong had to go out and risk his life

50
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,101
work for you every day,

51
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:32,581
while you're at home sitting comfortably,

52
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:34,741
appear like a hero.

53
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,314
But actually,

54
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:38,301
worse than anyone else.

55
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:41,741
If Thong is not satisfied

56
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:44,621
Then why does Thong work for you?

57
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:46,101
Huh?

58
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,501
Isn't it for the sake of it?

59
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:51,741
I know

60
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:54,461
that Thong wants to marry him.

61
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:57,861
I want to work beside you

62
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:00,461
And use charm to grab me?

63
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:05,581
Actually, it almost succeeded.

64
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,181
if Thong doesn't covet the money that boss Thip gives her

65
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:10,421
than you.

66
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:11,981
Thong doesn't believe you.

67
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:13,981
If Thong works for you and succeeds

68
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:16,261
Then maybe you should throw Thong away.

69
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:17,581
And by then,

70
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:18,781
Thong will have nothing left.

71
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:21,981
Thong must choose what to receive in front of him.

72
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,781
The money and bar that the owner gave Thong

73
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:27,341
can grasp much more than his words.

74
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:28,701
Stop arguing with me now.

75
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:30,701
As if

76
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:33,701
Today Thong is yours,

77
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:36,381
Don't even think about being dishonest with me.

78
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,101
Go take a shower and change clothes.

79
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:45,461
I'll take you out to dinner.

80
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:48,261
And these wounds are carefully covered,

81
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:50,141
Absolutely don't let anyone see.

82
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:54,421
Mr. Mit.

83
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:56,461
The thing is

84
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:59,341
Thong's clothes are in Si's room,

85
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:01,421
Can Thong come get it first?

86
00:06:14,221 --> 00:06:17,301
Sister Si, this is Thong, please open the door for me.

87
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,181
Ms. Si.

88
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,901
Are you at home?

89
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:31,741
Hey bro.

90
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:34,301
When he invited Si to live with him,

91
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,981
How did she answer?

92
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:37,261
She rejected him.

93
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,141
She said she doesn't want to stop at just being with one person.

94
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,781
She wants to live a more free life.

95
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:46,061
So she said

96
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,101
What will you do, where will you go?

97
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:02,541
Hey, sister.

98
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:03,101
Yes.

99
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:05,381
Could you please contact Ms. Si in room 609?

100
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,021
The thing is, I forgot to bring my phone.

101
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:08,621
I knocked on her door but she wasn't in the room.

102
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,981
Ah, Miss Siwelay.

103
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:12,941
She moved out two or three days ago.

104
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:17,861
She sent your bag and belongings back to you.

105
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,421
So does she have anything to say?

106
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:22,861
No.

107
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:24,701
I'm just sending you things.

108
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:26,861
So she left her phone number,

109
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:29,101
Any new notes or addresses?

110
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:32,861
No sir.

111
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,221
Let's go, Thong.

112
00:07:42,181 --> 00:07:43,181
Non-existence is non-existence.

113
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:45,381
Thong is not that close of a relative

114
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,381
she must be so worried.

115
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:49,981
Let's go.

116
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:03,061
It's time to start eating.

117
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:04,821
- Yes. - Yes.

118
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:15,621
Oh, that's the band

119
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,261
came to perform at our house the other day, right?

120
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:18,581
Yes, that's right.

121
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:20,021
I love watching them perform here,

122
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:21,661
That's why I hired him to perform at home.

123
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,101
This band plays very good music.

124
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,941
Thong asked permission to go to the bathroom for a moment.

125
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:31,181
Wait, Thong!

126
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:34,941
Damn it!

127
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,181
Can I go to the bathroom with Thong?

128
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:47,541
Let's go.

129
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:53,741
Mit, let me feed you.

130
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:55,581
Oh, really boring.

131
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:57,581
I have to keep watching like this.

132
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,421
Excuse me, can I borrow your pen for a moment?

133
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:00,381
Want to request a song.

134
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:05,061
Stop talking so much, Thong.

135
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,021
When I want to go to the bathroom,

136
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,781
When you ask for a song, what else do you want?

137
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,741
I just have to endure living in the same house as you

138
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:13,341
I'm already very frustrated.

139
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:15,701
I only want to listen to the song I like, can't I just listen to one song?

140
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:18,061
Yes, hurry up, I'm hungry.

141
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:18,781
Thank you.

142
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:25,501
Hurry up, I'll wait here.

143
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,181
Hi everybody,

144
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,421
Come meet us, the Lilison band

145
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:04,061
here every Friday.

146
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:05,461
Actually, I really like Friday,

147
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:07,101
because I think it's Friday

148
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:08,781
Very suitable for finding a lover.

149
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:09,821
Think about it.

150
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:11,661
Friday flirting with each other.

151
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:13,781
Saturday goes out, Sunday is spent together.

152
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:14,981
- Oh! - On Monday, we broke up.

153
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:16,901
Next Friday, find someone else.

154
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:18,821
Just kidding.

155
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:21,061
Coincidentally it was just now

156
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,821
Someone requested the song.

157
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,501
The song "Only You",

158
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:26,901
from Maleewan.

159
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:28,461
I asked my staff

160
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:30,141
Googled it. Because

161
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:32,381
The song is a bit old, I wasn't born yet.

162
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:36,301
But if you turn on the chords, you can probably play it.

163
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:38,661
But what about singing...

164
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:42,061
Which table is the requested table?

165
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,061
Can you show me your hand?

166
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,821
There, it's that girl.

167
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:00,581
So if you want to invite her

168
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,141
Is it okay to sing by myself?

169
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:20,461
Probably still shy.

170
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,821
Please give her a round of applause.

171
00:12:22,821 --> 00:12:23,941
Let's clap.

172
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:01,181
[Only me]

173
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:11,821
Mont.

174
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:14,221
Why are you here, child?

175
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:17,541
Do you want to bow to Buddha with your mother?

176
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:21,781
Mom.

177
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:27,861
If I meet someone who is in trouble

178
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,541
but I don't know what they're having trouble with

179
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,541
so I don't know how to help them

180
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,541
What should Mont do?

181
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,101
Mom was also confused about the question.

182
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,101
Don't you know what they're having trouble with?

183
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:48,941
How do you know they're in trouble?

184
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:53,021
Mont saw it in their eyes.

185
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:55,301
Very sad.

186
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,941
Even though they didn't say anything, Mont felt it

187
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:02,501
They were screaming loudly for help.

188
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:05,861
If so then

189
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:07,861
I have to ask clearly

190
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:09,221
what is wrong with them,

191
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:12,021
How do you want me to help?

192
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,181
That's better than sitting around making wild guesses like this.

193
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:17,181
It's useless.

194
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,821
Did something happen to Mont?

195
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:26,221
Mom, do you remember the girl Mont met at Inspector Mit's house?

196
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:29,421
Mont said she was sitting there crying.

197
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:31,581
Mom remembers.

198
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:33,581
Mont sees her again?

199
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,541
That's right.

200
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,221
Yesterday Inspector Mit brought the girls to the shop.

201
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,221
That girl also came along.

202
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,461
Mont saw the bruises on her face.

203
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,981
And she looked at Mont with eyes asking for help.

204
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:48,981
Really?

205
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,461
But on TV, the detective seems like a good person.

206
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,621
I don't think he's that kind of person.

207
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:03,861
How should Mont help her, Mom?

208
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:10,821
Listening to her story, she feels so pitiful.

209
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:14,501
But each living being has its own karma.

210
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:17,421
I don't think Mont can help her.

211
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:20,501
Before I help anyone

212
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:23,061
Then you have to see if you're in trouble or not.

213
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:32,661
Mont goes to bow to Buddha with his mother.

214
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:34,901
Go pray for her.

215
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:38,141
Yes, I'll follow.

216
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:58,821
Hello, Inspector, I'm Montra.

217
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:01,661
Drummer.

218
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:28,901
Hello Inspector, I'm sorry to bother you.

219
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:29,941
It's OK.

220
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:31,861
Do you remember where you forgot?

221
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:33,861
Not sure anymore.

222
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:37,341
It could be in the bathroom or by the pool.

223
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,341
Can I go to the bathroom first, please?

224
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:41,741
It's better to go to the swimming pool and see first.

225
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:43,301
Please.

226
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:52,821
What is he looking for?

227
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:54,741
I heard I forgot something

228
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:56,461
yesterday, when I came here to play music.

229
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:00,061
Come find that heart.

230
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:02,061
Tell him to come find me.

231
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:05,621
- Oh, so confident! - YES.

232
00:19:05,621 --> 00:19:09,021
I already aimed at him but didn't dare peek at him.

233
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:10,661
Really?

234
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:12,941
Only dare to steal likes, who dares to steal stamps?

235
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:18,541
Hey, he's looking at me again.

236
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,221
He looked at me.

237
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:23,821
- No way. - He looked in my direction, man.

238
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:26,101
He probably wants me, man!

239
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:28,981
Oh, he doesn't want to eat poop.

240
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,501
Stop being delusional, he looked at me.

241
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:32,981
No sir.

242
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:35,461
Probably dropped it in the bathroom or forgot it somewhere.

243
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,941
Can I come in and take a look?

244
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:39,261
Please!

245
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:47,341
Oh, sister, it's here, it's here.

246
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:50,661
Hey everyone.

247
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:53,021
Has anyone seen his handkerchief?

248
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:54,701
He forgot the date of the party.

249
00:19:55,421 --> 00:19:56,901
Do you see?

250
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:59,581
- See? See? - I don't see it.

251
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,381
Oh, I'm keeping it.

252
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:08,701
I saw it fall and didn't know whose it belonged to so I kept it.

253
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,341
Really?

254
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:11,661
Thank you.

255
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:14,661
Maybe I dropped it while going to the bathroom.

256
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:18,181
It's above the room.

257
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,781
Let me go get it for you.

258
00:20:19,781 --> 00:20:20,581
Yes.

259
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:54,421
The handkerchief my mother bought for me.

260
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,221
If you lose it, you will be scolded and slapped in the face.

261
00:20:57,661 --> 00:20:59,221
When I was little, I used to do that a lot.

262
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:01,741
When I was in school, I often lost things.

263
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:08,941
Here.

264
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:11,901
This is exactly what it is.

265
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:13,621
- Thank you very much. - Wait.

266
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:16,301
How are you sure?

267
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,541
Is this your scarf?

268
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:25,341
Here, Inspector.

269
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:26,501
Here.

270
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:28,341
My mother embroidered my name.

271
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:30,341
I think inspector, don't touch it, dirty.

272
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:32,741
There's also my sweat and snot.

273
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,821
Anyway, thank you very much, sister and inspector.

274
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:41,941
I returned home and showed my mother that I had found it.

275
00:21:41,941 --> 00:21:43,381
My mother...

276
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:45,341
It's so easy to get upset. This will stop the sulking.

277
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:46,061
Invite.

278
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:22,501
Come pick me up, at midnight.

279
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:23,621
Tonight.

280
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:47,901
Thong.

281
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:56,141
Seeing someone else's handkerchief,

282
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:58,221
Why don't you ask the owner?

283
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:00,061
Why keep it to yourself?

284
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:03,621
The thing is

285
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:06,261
Thong without handkerchief,

286
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:08,261
I'm afraid to ask you for money to buy it.

287
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:10,261
Saw it falling there so...

288
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:11,541
keep,

289
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:13,621
I'm going to wash it and then use it.

290
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:19,421
Thong,

291
00:23:21,421 --> 00:23:22,301
you are a police officer,

292
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:25,221
interrogate bad guys a lot,

293
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:27,501
I think giving testimony is meaningless like that

294
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:28,821
then will you believe?

295
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:31,981
Did you say it?

296
00:23:33,141 --> 00:23:34,341
Why keep that handkerchief?

297
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:40,461
Thong likes him, right?

298
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,501
So when he dropped his handkerchief,

299
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:44,901
Just put it away myself.

300
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:48,141
At the bar, he saw it

301
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:50,541
pretend to request a song

302
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,261
to sing.

303
00:23:53,941 --> 00:23:55,421
The look in his eyes when Thong looked at him,

304
00:23:56,461 --> 00:23:57,581
he saw it all.

305
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:02,581
Yes.

306
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:06,181
Thong likes him.

307
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,421
He is a music player

308
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:11,141
and he's handsome too.

309
00:24:11,981 --> 00:24:12,581
But

310
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:15,661
Thong likes him like a normal fan.

311
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,461
I secretly like it.

312
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:19,901
Don't think anything more than that.

313
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:23,981
Thong knows that he is yours,

314
00:24:24,301 --> 00:24:25,821
can only live in this house.

315
00:24:26,861 --> 00:24:28,861
How dare you think about others?

316
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:41,861
Very cute.

317
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:47,901
The person beside you

318
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:50,141
then the heart must also have you.

319
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,981
Don't be tempted to think of anyone else but him.

320
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:56,341
Promise me.

321
00:24:58,461 --> 00:24:58,941
Yes.

322
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:00,821
Thong promise.

323
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,261
Very good.

324
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,381
Thong, don't hide.

325
00:27:43,581 --> 00:27:44,141
Thong!

326
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:50,901
Leo left, I helped her.

327
00:27:58,661 --> 00:28:00,501
Jump over the fence and come back, Thong.

328
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:02,021
Thong.

329
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:02,941
Speed.

330
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,421
- Don't hide. Thong. - Let's go quickly.

331
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:05,981
Stop.

332
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:07,781
Thong.

333
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:08,781
Thong.

334
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:24,221
Hey, can he keep up?

335
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,341
There's no time. Even though this car is old, the engine is still very strong.

336
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,981
What's your name? I still don't know her name.

337
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:32,221
Thong.

338
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:33,381
And you?

339
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:34,581
My name is Mont.

340
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:36,141
How old are you?

341
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:37,221
22 years old.

342
00:28:38,261 --> 00:28:40,981
Only 3 years apart, I'm 25 years old. You don't have to call me brother.

343
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,501
Why does the red light take so long?

344
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:46,981
There's no car ahead, or should we just keep going?

345
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:47,821
Impossible,

346
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:50,021
violating traffic laws. There's a camera, see?

347
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:58,581
Hey, he's here, let's go, let's go.

348
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:13,501
Can you drive faster?

349
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,661
He will catch up in time.

350
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,101
Driving fast here.

351
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:18,421
Isn't it said that the engine is very powerful?

352
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:19,581
That's strong.

353
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:21,341
But only this strong.

354
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:37,141
You have to help me, don't let me get caught again.

355
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:38,941
Please calm down.

356
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:40,381
Let me handle it.

357
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:18,492
THE ROSE OF SIN
