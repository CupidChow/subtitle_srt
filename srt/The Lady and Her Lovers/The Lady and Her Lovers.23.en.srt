1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,266
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:41,837
 THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:46,043
Oh.

4
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:46,963
- What is that, little girl? - You...

5
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,043
So boring.

6
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,923
I took the trouble to kick Thong out of the house.

7
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:54,123
Mr. Mit is still following her and observing her life.

8
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:56,523
When will he pay attention to me again?

9
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,683
Oh.

10
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,083
Hey, let's be honest.

11
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,323
Now it's even worse than before.

12
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:04,203
When Thong was still here, I could still see his face.

13
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:05,363
But now what?

14
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:08,323
He just diligently searched for Thong from morning until night.

15
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:10,683
When I got home, I didn't have the strength to do anything with us anymore.

16
00:01:12,163 --> 00:01:14,643
So I know

17
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:16,443
Can we change the name to Thong?

18
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:20,563
Who knows, Mit will return to pay attention to us.

19
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:21,803
YES.

20
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:22,563
- Alright. - YES.

21
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:24,963
Your name is Thong Yim.

22
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:26,083
Thong Yim, okay.

23
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,203
And your name is Thong Yot.

24
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:29,003
Uh.

25
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:30,643
And you Thong Muont.

26
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:34,723
And I will be Nong Ru Thong.

27
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:38,163
Ru Thong, oh.

28
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,803
- You, Mit is back. - Huh?

29
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:51,163
- Mit, hurry up, hurry up. - I've wanted him back for a long time. Mr. Mit.

30
00:01:51,163 --> 00:01:52,523
I'm back.

31
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:53,603
Hello sir.

32
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:55,563
- Here's cool water, Mit. - Mr. Mit.

33
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:58,443
Mr. Mit.

34
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:03,083
Mr. Mit. Mr. Mit.

35
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,483
I miss it so much. Mit, are you tired?

36
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,003
Mr. Mit.

37
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:14,683
Mit, are you tired of driving all day?

38
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:17,323
Mr. Mit, next time if possible

39
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:19,963
Can I take Malee for a drive to the beach?

40
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:22,403
Pataya is fine too. That's great too. Are you?

41
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,283
- Let's go. -I'll go with you.

42
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:27,123
- I'll go with you. Mr. Mit. - Let me go with you. Mr. Mit.

43
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:29,443
- I want to go with you. - I want to go too.

44
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:32,163
Before going anywhere

45
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:34,763
Let's clarify this first.

46
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,643
Please listen to our explanation first, Mit.

47
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:00,643
- It's like this... - We can explain.

48
00:03:00,643 --> 00:03:02,803
- Actually... Actually, it's not... - No explanation, no listening at all.

49
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:05,203
The image denounces to this extent

50
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:08,403
meaning everyone intentionally let Thong go.

51
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:11,363
So you still put on a show to cover your eyes?

52
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:18,083
Thong is the one who told us to do that.

53
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,843
Honestly, we don't want to do it.

54
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:23,603
That's right, we don't want that.

55
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,003
We know our mistake.

56
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:27,563
- She forced us! - Stop it!

57
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:30,763
The more you talk, the more cunning you become.

58
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:32,923
What now?

59
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:36,403
How will you take responsibility for this?

60
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:37,523
Huh?

61
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:39,843
Say it!

62
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:48,323
We think so

63
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,523
We went into the room to apologize.

64
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:52,723
Let's go!

65
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:54,243
Go!

66
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:03,803
Thank you very much today Yem, I'll call if there's anything.

67
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:04,883
Okay.

68
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:07,403
If I have any information, I will contact you.

69
00:04:08,003 --> 00:04:08,883
Bait!

70
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:11,523
Auntie, hello!

71
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:12,643
Hello kid!

72
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:15,443
What wind brought you to my house?

73
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,563
Long time no see you.

74
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:20,323
I came to talk about work with Mont!

75
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:22,123
But now I'm back.

76
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:25,923
Why are you in such a hurry? Stay for dinner first.

77
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:28,243
She bought a lot of things to cook with.

78
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,883
No mom, Yem has work.

79
00:04:33,803 --> 00:04:36,003
Speaking of which, me too

80
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:38,363
I miss your cooking skills very much.

81
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:41,123
Or cook another portion for me!

82
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:42,803
Alright.

83
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:45,563
So go to the kitchen and help her cook.

84
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:46,643
Yes, let me help you.

85
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,523
I'll go first, be careful at home Thong.

86
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:02,723
Yeah, I'll be careful.

87
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:05,523
Mont, hurry up.

88
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,243
Why did you say take your mother away? It's so slow.

89
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:10,603
Yes.

90
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:12,603
I'll go now.

91
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:43,043
Don't, don't come in here.

92
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,483
Let it go, let it go!

93
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:46,403
Let go. Help me. Let go.

94
00:05:46,403 --> 00:05:47,483
Cuff it quickly.

95
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:48,563
Let me go.

96
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:50,523
Help. Let me go.

97
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,283
Everyone, please come down here.

98
00:06:14,803 --> 00:06:16,003
Thong is back.

99
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,683
From now on, I hope everyone takes good care of each other.

100
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,443
Don't let anyone escape anymore.

101
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:23,483
Know yet?

102
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:25,963
Okay.

103
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:29,603
We will take care of each other like sisters and live together in harmony

104
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,203
To be worthy of the love that Mit gives me.

105
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:35,323
That's right, Mit.

106
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:36,443
Very good.

107
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:41,163
So tonight everyone comes into the room to see me,

108
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:42,603
all of it.

109
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,963
I will show everyone how much I love everyone.

110
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:50,123
And also to welcome Thong's return.

111
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:56,923
Hey Thong, please change your clothes.

112
00:06:57,443 --> 00:06:59,723
I don't like such discreet things.

113
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:15,203
Just a little bit, man.

114
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:45,443
Inspector Mit looks like this.

115
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:47,563
What a pity.

116
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:50,643
It looks so calm and harmless.

117
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:53,043
What happened?

118
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:56,363
Tell me now.

119
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:00,763
What happened?

120
00:09:00,763 --> 00:09:03,883
Why did the talented Inspector Mit end up like this?

121
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:06,763
Where do you want me to start?

122
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,523
From the moment you start planning, it's okay to stay home.

123
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:15,843
So that he doesn't get confused.

124
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,203
Inspector Mit has a very good image.

125
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:22,483
All the police in the industry are on his side.

126
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:26,243
If he comes to take Thong back

127
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:28,243
no one can help.

128
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:31,163
Does that mean I can't escape?

129
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:32,843
Do I really have to go back and live with him?

130
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:36,563
Are not.

131
00:09:37,803 --> 00:09:38,843
There is a way.

132
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:42,483
The reporter is trying to expose him.

133
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:45,643
We suspect he is involved in drug trafficking.

134
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:49,083
but no one has yet found concrete evidence to accuse him.

135
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:52,723
If Thong finds evidence

136
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:54,883
then Inspector Mit will be arrested and imprisoned.

137
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:57,363
At that time Thong will be free.

138
00:09:57,603 --> 00:10:00,283
Where is the evidence? How do I get it?

139
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:04,043
The evidence is probably hidden somewhere in his house.

140
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:07,123
Thong had to go back to get it.

141
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:08,403
Are you crazy Yem?

142
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:10,723
Thong just escaped and has to come back?

143
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:13,483
I don't accept it, it's too risky.

144
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:17,923
But if it helps end things

145
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:20,243
then I accept the risk.

146
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:28,243
What is it Yem?

147
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:30,283
I see them loitering around here.

148
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,643
Maybe they were coming to her house.

149
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:34,363
Don't lock the door.

150
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:38,283
YES.

151
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:48,003
Don't, don't go in.

152
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:49,323
Let go.

153
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:50,843
Let go, save me.

154
00:10:52,363 --> 00:10:52,963
Help me.

155
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:58,003
Help me.

156
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:13,003
Con Thong! What are you doing back?

157
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:16,203
Then come back for revenge.

158
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:18,643
Will you cooperate with me?

159
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:22,043
Just live like his slave like that,

160
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:23,523
There is no future either.

161
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:27,723
Seize his property to protect himself,

162
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,243
sounds much more appealing.

163
00:11:32,403 --> 00:11:35,443
And those friends were all happy to cooperate.

164
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:38,043
Yesterday Thong brought me a pod to smoke.

165
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:40,883
But it's a special pod, mixed with sleeping pills.

166
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:43,123
That's why I overslept until this hour.

167
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:48,963
I lost to you guys.

168
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,083
Whoever wants to go can go.

169
00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:54,723
Oh, oh, oh! If you keep leaving like that,

170
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:56,283
Isn't that so easy?

171
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:59,003
We have been here to serve you for so long,

172
00:11:59,003 --> 00:12:00,403
if you have to go

173
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,923
You have to bring something with you, just something small.

174
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,643
It's wages, right?

175
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:16,483
Con Thong! This is yours.

176
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:19,923
And this is for you, Malee.

177
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,243
- Thank. - Hurry up.

178
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,843
We want these things, please.

179
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:34,083
Thinking that after taking your things away, won't you come and get them back?

180
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:38,123
The crime of theft can result in a sentence of 10-15 years in prison.

181
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:40,643
Have you forgotten who I am?

182
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:43,883
That's really scary.

183
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:47,843
So what about the police stealing tax money? Sentenced to how many years?

184
00:12:48,323 --> 00:12:49,843
Thong knows that

185
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:52,123
These necklaces, bracelets, watches

186
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:55,763
You can't buy a police salary.

187
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:59,043
Do it, if you dare to report the case

188
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:00,283
then just do it.

189
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:05,563
Yes, yes, yes.

190
00:13:05,563 --> 00:13:06,883
Whoever takes something, takes it away.

191
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,403
But remember to hide far away, don't let me catch you.

192
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:13,483
Otherwise, you all will die.

193
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:18,283
I hope you have a chance to catch us.

194
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:19,803
Let's go, everyone.

195
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,243
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

196
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:24,603
Untie me first.

197
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,043
Thong! Thong!

198
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:28,443
Then someone will release you.

199
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:29,723
Untie me first.

200
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:40,803
- You guys! - YES.

201
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:45,763
I thank you very much.

202
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:48,483
Without you guys, this wouldn't be possible.

203
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:50,963
No need to thank us,

204
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:53,523
We do it for ourselves, not for you.

205
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:57,523
From day one until today, you're still you, Malee.

206
00:13:57,523 --> 00:13:59,163
Oh that's who I am.

207
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:01,323
You don't need to act sentimental, I'm not used to it.

208
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:04,683
Let's go guys, looking at Thong's face is boring.

209
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:07,203
I'm also tired of your faces.

210
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:13,323
Hey guys, you bring these things to sell

211
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:15,243
Then go to the bar to hang out together.

212
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:18,003
What's up, is everything okay?

213
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:20,083
It's okay, everything is going according to plan.

214
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,363
Now the inspector lies unconscious in the other room.

215
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:24,643
So does it do anything to Thong? Does it hurt anywhere?

216
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:28,683
I just hurt my wrist a little while being handcuffed, it's nothing.

217
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:32,203
Let's go, they're almost here.

218
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:33,443
Yes.

219
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:50,923
Who is that?

220
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:52,523
Thong?

221
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:53,963
Malee?

222
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,883
Go and untie me first, quickly.

223
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:00,083
Who are you?

224
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:06,723
Looks like we got shocking news today.

225
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:12,363
After the police checked Inspector Mit's house,

226
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:15,563
found him tied to a chair.

227
00:15:15,563 --> 00:15:17,203
According to preliminary interrogation

228
00:15:17,203 --> 00:15:19,403
Inspector Mit is not yet ready to provide any information.

229
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:21,683
Police also discovered important evidence

230
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:24,563
That is a book containing the names of many drug traffickers

231
00:15:24,563 --> 00:15:25,883
with the amount.

232
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,563
This raises the question of Inspector Mit

233
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:31,043
Is it related to this illegal business practice?

234
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:32,243
How are things going?

235
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:34,723
Let's wait for the police to investigate further.

236
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:38,124
I'm reporter Yorada Sunthornthana.

237
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:43,523
Thong, do you have anything to do with this?

238
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:46,563
I'm not involved.

239
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:48,603
Thong is alone,

240
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:50,523
How can you do that to an inspector?

241
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:52,523
I mean about drug trafficking.

242
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:56,563
I'm afraid if the police investigation slowly tracks you down,

243
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:58,003
Then I'll be in trouble too.

244
00:15:58,643 --> 00:16:01,043
Mom, you're exaggerating, how can you get into trouble?

245
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:02,723
Mom has nothing to do with it.

246
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:03,923
Related.

247
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,483
Because Thong came to live in his mother's house.

248
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,123
Did you know that letting bad people stay in the house?

249
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:12,163
Is it also a violation? Don't you know?

250
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:16,643
Thong would like to confirm

251
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:19,603
Thong is not involved in drug trafficking.

252
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:22,323
Thong is just an inspector's prey.

253
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:24,003
Whether it's true or not is still unknown.

254
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:27,083
People who lie are hard to believe.

255
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:47,923
You don't need to take what my mother said to heart.

256
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:50,403
Time will prove

257
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,883
that she had no connection with that business.

258
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:56,483
Mont.

259
00:16:58,203 --> 00:16:59,523
Thank you very much.

260
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:02,323
He always helps me.

261
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,123
I have nothing to repay you.

262
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:29,243
I give, as a thank you from me.

263
00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:34,163
Hey Thong! Where did you get it? Is that real?

264
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:36,523
That Inspector's.

265
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,483
We divided our assets before leaving the house.

266
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:42,963
It's probably the real thing. The Inspector probably wouldn't use a fake one.

267
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:46,483
Malee said this brand's clothes cost millions.

268
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,963
I don't know whether it's a scam or not.

269
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:52,283
Who said it was a million, Thong? It must be tens of millions.

270
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:53,083
Huh?

271
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,923
A watch like this costs tens of millions?

272
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:55,603
Uh.

273
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:57,963
So can I not give it anymore?

274
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,763
Had to sell it to protect myself.

275
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,803
Oh, Thong take it away, I won't take it.

276
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:17,603
Wait Thong!

277
00:18:18,803 --> 00:18:20,443
Taking it for personal protection is...

278
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:22,683
where are you going?

279
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:27,683
Well... The Inspector was also taken away.

280
00:18:28,403 --> 00:18:30,083
I will go my way.

281
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:34,163
As we said from the beginning. If this ends,

282
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:37,363
Our practice of being fake lovers is over.

283
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:41,563
So he can go back and reconcile with his mother.

284
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:58,043
Wait!

285
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:05,723
Can't go?

286
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:17,043
I like you.

287
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:22,723
Si, do you think anyone will truly love me in this life?

288
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:26,443
Before you ask if anyone truly loves you,

289
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,003
Have you ever truly loved anyone?

290
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,883
I used to love anyone who treated me well.

291
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:36,443
Like Pete, he takes good care of me.

292
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:40,083
It was the first person who made me know what love is.

293
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:42,003
Like Mr. Wi,

294
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:44,243
he buys me everything I want.

295
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,803
Seeing me like that, I also know how to love.

296
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:49,043
YES.

297
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,443
If you think you truly love those two people,

298
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:55,163
I think those two truly love her.

299
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:57,523
But it's strange to think,

300
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,483
Why did the two people she loved,

301
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:02,443
both die?

302
00:20:03,323 --> 00:20:06,363
Or is she destined to be a killer?

303
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:07,723
Number of killers?

304
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:09,283
What is it?

305
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:11,683
That's it, the number of murderers

306
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:13,203
it is when the woman

307
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:15,443
love someone, or a certain man.

308
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:17,443
That person usually doesn't live long.

309
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:19,003
And will die.

310
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,883
Crazy, I don't believe it.

311
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:24,123
I think it's more like bad luck.

312
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:26,323
Pete died because he stole someone's stuff,

313
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:27,963
And Mr. Wi died because he had an argument with someone.

314
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:31,083
I think good men probably won't die.

315
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,683
So try it? Huh?

316
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:36,563
She tries to find a good man to be her husband.

317
00:20:36,563 --> 00:20:38,923
And she tried to see his life

318
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:41,803
Is it still good? Do you dare try?

319
00:20:50,403 --> 00:20:53,283
What's up, Thong? Do you feel anything for me?

320
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:58,203
Say it, I can accept it.

321
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:04,083
I feel

322
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:06,243
You're just like a good friend.

323
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:09,043
Thank you for giving me your love.

324
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,403
But don't think anything beyond friendship.

325
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:13,963
Impossible.

326
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:17,203
I can't stop thinking so easily.

327
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:23,883
So let's do it, it's okay if Thong doesn't like me now.

328
00:21:24,723 --> 00:21:26,763
I will flirt with Thong until

329
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:28,843
Thong likes me, okay?

330
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:31,563
Don't.

331
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,243
It's better to take the time to like new people.

332
00:21:35,723 --> 00:21:36,683
Wait, Thong.

333
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:40,803
I have met the right person.

334
00:21:41,363 --> 00:21:43,363
Why waste time looking for someone else?

335
00:21:45,523 --> 00:21:46,923
I will slowly flirt with Thong.

336
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:49,363
Until Thong accepted to love me.

337
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:54,963
Please.

338
00:22:03,443 --> 00:22:04,563
Stop.

339
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:09,203
Mont, if you want to flirt, just flirt.

340
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:11,243
But let's say first, it won't fall apart.

341
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:13,603
Thong will find a new place to live.

342
00:22:14,723 --> 00:22:17,923
You can't escape, I'll follow you everywhere.

343
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:20,243
Where are you going? I give it away.

344
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:25,483
I want to live in a province with a sea.

345
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:29,523
Since childhood, I have dreamed of living next to the sea.

346
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:33,443
But since he was born, he still hasn't seen the sea.

347
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:36,523
Do you also like the sea?

348
00:22:37,283 --> 00:22:38,683
I also like the sea.

349
00:22:41,323 --> 00:22:43,683
So shall we go to Chonburi?

350
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:45,243
It's quite close to Bangkok.

351
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:47,203
When bored or feeling discouraged,

352
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:49,523
I also like sitting alone at Chonburi beach.

353
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:51,203
Near Bangkok?

354
00:22:52,323 --> 00:22:54,323
So take me away.

355
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,763
How could Thong's future boyfriend not go?

356
00:23:52,483 --> 00:23:54,763
Mont, the water is so cool.

357
00:23:54,763 --> 00:23:56,803
Now I know how cool the sea water is.

358
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,683
Try it, it's cool and refreshing.

359
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:00,843
Really?

360
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,763
You told me to taste it, but why did you splash water on me?

361
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:09,483
I know sea water is salty.

362
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:10,923
If you want to taste it, taste it yourself.

363
00:24:12,003 --> 00:24:12,883
Are you teasing me?

364
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:14,363
Because you teased me first.

365
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:15,843
Mt., Mt.

366
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:20,003
Mont.

367
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:20,523
What?

368
00:24:20,523 --> 00:24:21,723
Do not.

369
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:26,163
What is Thong thinking?

370
00:24:28,963 --> 00:24:32,323
I don't know, trying to think about the future.

371
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,523
But no matter how I think about it, I can't think of it.

372
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:36,683
It's like the image isn't clear.

373
00:24:38,163 --> 00:24:39,163
Then don't think anymore.

374
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:42,883
Just thinking about it gives me a headache, thinking about it today is enough.

375
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:47,523
That's right.

376
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:52,803
Mont, please take me to the jewelry store.

377
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:55,123
I want to sell Inspector Mit's gold.

378
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:58,043
Should be enough to cover expenses while I find a suitable house.

379
00:24:58,403 --> 00:25:00,603
Then, when I find a house, I'll sell the watch,

380
00:25:00,603 --> 00:25:02,883
Get money to buy a house, can you see that?

381
00:25:05,763 --> 00:25:06,523
It's not good.

382
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:09,803
So how can it be good?

383
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,243
Like being my girlfriend, staying at my house.

384
00:25:13,243 --> 00:25:16,603
And let me take you to the beach every week. This is much better.

385
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,563
Still not finished dreaming?

386
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:24,483
No, I don't give up easily.

387
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:27,483
When I flirt with someone, I'm always serious.

388
00:25:30,483 --> 00:25:31,683
Go to the other side.

389
00:25:41,883 --> 00:25:43,003
Let's ask.

390
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:47,443
Why do you want to be my lover?

391
00:25:48,523 --> 00:25:49,723
What are my good points?

392
00:25:56,523 --> 00:25:58,243
If I were someone's lover

393
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:01,363
then that person doesn't need to have any grades to be good,

394
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:04,643
Just be a normal person.

395
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:08,643
There are bad points and good points, like everyone else.

396
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:12,723
If you like it in your heart, then just like it.

397
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:16,203
I don't hope to be a lover

398
00:26:16,803 --> 00:26:18,163
Where's the Warrior Goddess?

399
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:25,523
You probably don't know my entire background, let me tell you.

400
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:28,123
No need to tell.

401
00:26:31,643 --> 00:26:33,243
I don't care about your past.

402
00:26:35,483 --> 00:26:37,643
It's okay for me to know her now.

403
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:40,203
That's enough.

404
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:43,163
It's not enough.

405
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:47,043
If you love me

406
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:50,083
then you have to know about me too.

407
00:26:56,003 --> 00:26:57,283
I am an orphan.

408
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:03,763
My mother left me to be raised by my mother when I was only one year old

409
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:06,643
then ran away with her new husband.

410
00:27:09,443 --> 00:27:14,083
When I became the inspector's wife, I realized that I had been deceived by him.

411
00:27:16,883 --> 00:27:19,403
I became one of his harem.

412
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:26,603
What happened next is as you saw.

413
00:27:30,323 --> 00:27:32,203
I have had 4 husbands.

414
00:27:33,843 --> 00:27:35,123
Two people died,

415
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,243
a person who escapes sentence abroad,

416
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:42,083
a person in prison.

417
00:27:46,003 --> 00:27:48,563
Do you still want to be my fifth husband?

418
00:27:54,043 --> 00:27:54,763
Thong!

419
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:07,363
I've been through too much already.

420
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:15,243
From now on, let me take care of you.

421
00:28:17,323 --> 00:28:19,243
Then come good things.

422
00:28:20,243 --> 00:28:21,843
I want you to be happy.

423
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:27,443
Be my lover, Thong.

424
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,243
Find someone better than me.

425
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,163
I really don't deserve you.

426
00:28:53,843 --> 00:28:54,563
Thong!

427
00:28:54,923 --> 00:28:58,203
Don't be stubborn, Mont, enough is enough.

428
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:07,883
Okay, that's okay.

429
00:29:10,283 --> 00:29:11,763
I think I can take care of you,

430
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:14,803
Let me be happy without being my lover.

431
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,523
I think you can't stop me from doing this.

432
00:29:20,923 --> 00:29:23,003
Don't embarrass me, Mont.

433
00:30:07,281 --> 00:30:10,898
THE ROSE OF SIN
