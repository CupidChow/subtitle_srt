1
00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:01,353
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:39,771
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,000
Thong. Chicha, eat rice, my child.

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,520
Dad bought a lot of food.

5
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,160
You tell me right away,

6
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,320
What is this?

7
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Well... Just a normal work of art.

8
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,280
He thought it was quite beautiful so he kept it.

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,800
So what about the photo stuck on it?

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,960
When did you secretly take a picture of it?

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,920
Thong, don't think too much. This photo was taken a long time ago.

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,800
He thought it was quite beautiful so he pasted it on the mannequin.

13
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,680
There's a picture of my face stuck on a naked mannequin like this

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,120
Don't you want me to think too much?

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,240
Try replacing it with a photo of your daughter.

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,560
Did you think much at that time?

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,600
Speak properly, Thong.

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,400
Get out of the way so I can take it away.

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,720
I can't stand you anymore.

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,680
This is so disgusting.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,160
I will cancel the contract with you from this moment.

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,200
Where are you going? I won't let you go.

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,880
Do you want to cancel the contract with me?

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,680
Do you dare to be ungrateful to me, Thong?

25
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,040
The one who trained you, pulled you out of the mud

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,000
Isn't that me?

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,960
If it weren't for me, would you be where you are today?

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,960
If it weren't for me, more accurately, would you be here today?

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,800
I know the money you send to your wife and children

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,440
It's all my sweat and tears.

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,760
There is no me

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,960
then you are just a pimp, leading prostitutes

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,280
Only 1,000, 2,000 baht each time.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,880
Stay away, Thong.

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,160
Where are you going to hide from me?

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,680
I know what you did to this dummy.

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
You crazy thing. Disgusting trait.

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,520
Living with you is like living with a crocodile.

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,320
I don't know when I will be caught again.

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,920
Who would want to be with you?

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
I'm not with you anymore.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,120
I'm leaving, I won't be with you anymore. You pervert.

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,520
- Over here, over here. - Let me go, let me go, B.

44
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,000
Let me out, let me out.

45
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,880
Let go.

46
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,120
You remember, Thong, if I want to rape you

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,640
I've been doing it since day one.

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
But I'm just playing around with your photos.

49
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,480
Just that alone makes me so happy.

50
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,960
Do I need to thank you for not raping me?

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,160
Let me go, B.

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,640
I feel disgusting, don't touch me. Let me out.

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,720
It's like you keep to yourself a lot.

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,600
With other people, why don't you feel like that?

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,520
You really disgust me, right?

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,680
Okay, if you disgust me that much

57
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,080
then I will become your next husband, Thong.

58
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,720
Let go.

59
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,800
Boy B, let me go.

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,560
Let go. Help...

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,960
Help me.

62
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,120
Can you do it? You are the one who taught me

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,160
Whatever you do, you have to be careful.

64
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,320
Because people all over the country keep their eyes on it.

65
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,080
You have become an adult film actor.

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
Thong... what the hell are you doing?

67
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,960
[Hey, is it content or something? It's true, call the police.]

68
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,680
Chicha, Chicha.

69
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,000
Chicha, my child.

70
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,000
Chicha.

71
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,120
Chicha, my child, Chicha.

72
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,120
Chicha, wait for me, Chicha.

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,960
 Thong is safe now, someone help call the police here.

74
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,280
 Now Thong, please allow me to turn off the live stream.

75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,760
 thank you for being here with Thong.

76
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,280
Chicha.

77
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,120
Chicha, what's wrong with you?

78
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,400
Chicha.

79
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,920
Don't be afraid, it's dad.

80
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,640
It's Dad, the one who buys cakes and toys for my children.

81
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,520
Chicha, don't be afraid.

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,800
Let dad hug you.

83
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,200
Come here son, come here with me.

84
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,400
Okay, don't cry anymore.

85
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,080
Don't cry anymore, Chicha, it's dad.

86
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,680
- Dad, let me go. - Chicha.

87
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Normally, dad can hold the baby.

88
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
What's wrong with you?

89
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,240
Chicha, Chicha.

90
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,880
Chicha.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,400
- B, put me down now, drop me. - Chicha.

92
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,200
- Chicha. - Jang.

93
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,840
What's wrong with Chicha? She cries non-stop.

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,120
I saw it all on the live stream.

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,280
How dare you do that depraved thing in front of me?

96
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,080
Don't touch my daughter, let her go, let her go.

97
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,640
Chicha.

98
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,600
I won't let go, Jang and Chicha are also my children.

99
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,440
Someone like you?

100
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,640
Someone like you can't be anyone's father.

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,760
Just being human, you can't do it.

102
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
Drop me down now, drop me down.

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Chicha.

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,520
Dad, let me go, I'm scared.

105
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,960
I don't want to live with dad anymore, I want to go home.

106
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,760
Mom, please save me.

107
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,560
Chicha.

108
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,400
Dad, I'm sorry.

109
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,560
I didn't mean to scare you.

110
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,440
Chicha, give me time, okay?

111
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,760
Dad promises to be a good dad.

112
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,720
I believe you, dad.

113
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't try anymore.

114
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,600
Because no matter how hard you try

115
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,160
then he also lost to his own lowly temptations.

116
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,240
And don't expect it

117
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,520
from now on I will see you again with me.

118
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,960
Chicha, let's go.

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,280
Jang, give me a chance, Jang.

120
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,920
Chicha.

121
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,320
Oh.

122
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,960
He really tried.

123
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,280
Oh, Thong.

124
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,760
Is it Thong?

125
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,040
That's right.

126
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,800
Oh.

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,840
I just saw your message Thong.

128
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,560
What's up? Are you injured anywhere?

129
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,160
It's okay. Someone of mine helped call the police.

130
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,240
It's probably coming soon.

131
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,400
Let me sit and wait with you.

132
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,600
My face is all pale.

133
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,640
It's okay.

134
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,480
Is it okay?

135
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,240
It's okay. Thank you.

136
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,040
Is there water? It's so hot.

137
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,160
Luckily I was able to escape. Oh, the police are here.

138
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,000
Police, here.

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,560
Hello. Are you Thongprakai?

140
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,680
That's right. Why are you so late?

141
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,080
Now maybe that crazy guy has fled to the border.

142
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,560
Let's go to the scene quickly.

143
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,800
If I don't get lost in time, please show me the way.

144
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,600
Thank you everyone.

145
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,120
Thank you for being by my side.

146
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,840
Thank you very much.

147
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,720
- Thank you. - Good luck.

148
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,880
Please, please.

149
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,960
That's really scary.

150
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,520
Luckily she was able to escape.

151
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,680
His car is still here, probably still in the house.

152
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,840
So where was the last time you saw him?

153
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,880
Before I ran out of the house, I saw him going upstairs.

154
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,800
So does he have any weapons? Like a gun or something.

155
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,440
As far as I can see, there isn't, but it's better for the police to be a little more careful.

156
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,640
He is not normal.

157
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,320
Mr. BT.

158
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,840
Is Mr. BT here? I'm a police officer.

159
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,560
Please come out and talk.

160
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,320
Are you here, Mr. BT?

161
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,600
Oh, what is that?

162
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,120
Is Mr. BT up there?

163
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,120
Please come down here to talk.

164
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,520
If I don't go down, I'll go up.

165
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Mr. BT.

166
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,120
Mr. BT.

167
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,600
Oh, it's not okay.

168
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,680
Urgent, urgent.

169
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,640
We need an ambulance, there's a man injured.

170
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,120
Use a knife to cut off your genitals.

171
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,720
Excessive blood loss leads to unconsciousness.

172
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,160
Temporary first aid has now been given.

173
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,840
 Surely many people have seen it

174
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,880
 Thong's shocking incident.

175
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,960
 But now there is new news coming in.

176
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,760
 That the culprit used a knife to completely cut it off

177
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,280
 your genitals, causing blood

178
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,080
 overflows the bathroom.

179
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,360
 The police saw him and quickly took him to the hospital.

180
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,000
 But due to excessive blood loss, the perpetrator died at the hospital.

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,520
It seems that during this time,

182
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,920
The monsoon is blowing towards me Thong without stopping.

183
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,680
Having just entered the entertainment industry not long ago,

184
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,280
but there are many things,

185
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,520
making her a topic of discussion.

186
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,880
Thong, you don't need to think too much about this.

187
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,600
She kept thinking that this time her luck was going down.

188
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Rahu is besieging,

189
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,200
make everything dark, as dark as possible.

190
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
But then it will be brighter.

191
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,960
The sky will clear and everything will be bright again.

192
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,200
That's not right, sister.

193
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,320
I don't feel that my life will be brighter.

194
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,160
The salary name B still kept has not been paid out yet.

195
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,320
Going to hell to claim it won't work either.

196
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't rush to think about money, okay?

197
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,120
Now you should rest, both body and mind.

198
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,560
And here with me.

199
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,880
I can't go anywhere else, I'm worried.

200
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,600
If I accept to lie on your sofa

201
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,040
Then it didn't happen, right?

202
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,040
Thank.

203
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,120
I really think we were born to be together.

204
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,160
I also think so.

205
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,160
I am very happy to be with you.

206
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,880
If you don't count those things.

207
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,880
Ms. Dao.

208
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,760
I guarantee

209
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,360
From now on, Dao will be happy.

210
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,680
I stopped.

211
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,400
Don't just prove it to me, Dam.

212
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I have to make my family see it too.

213
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,440
It's my dad's birthday this year

214
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
It was the first time he invited me to attend.

215
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,040
That means he recognizes my talent

216
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,880
from the movie "Castle of Desire".

217
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,640
There's just one more thing left.

218
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,200
Yes.

219
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,000
Sister Dao, look into my eyes.

220
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,000
From now on, Ms. Dao is the only woman

221
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,000
in my life.

222
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,960
If Ms. Dao catches me with another girl

223
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,080
I won't beg or explain anymore.

224
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,960
I will step out of Ms. Dao's life on my own.

225
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Thong, amazing, really sexy!

226
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,960
Dear Buddha.

227
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,880
I hope this outfit

228
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,080
will bring her luck, fame and love.

229
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,400
Hopefully some rich guy will fall in love with her.

230
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,560
Are you too revealing?

231
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,760
Did you hear that wrong? Since when?

232
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,920
Is "too revealing" in your vocabulary?

233
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,040
If I were still working in a bar, I would fight hard.

234
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,840
Now I'm an actor.

235
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,360
Going to the station owner's birthday party,

236
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,920
All are high-ranking officials.

237
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,360
They thought I was there to pick up more customers.

238
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,400
Yes? This is a party for the rich

239
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,480
You should wear something classy and elegant.

240
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,320
Then you have to buy a new one.

241
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,440
She had to buy luxury brand outfits.

242
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,360
Oh...

243
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,440
Did you find it in time?

244
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,640
It's been 10 minutes since the time to serve the appetizer.

245
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,120
But the guest is still missing one person.

246
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,400
Do you want to serve too?

247
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,840
It's always good to serve you.

248
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,040
Oh!

249
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,400
Thong, Thongprakai.

250
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,720
Sorry for being late.

251
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,800
Mr. Phaithun! Happy birthday.

252
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,800
Wishing you good health and lots of happiness.

253
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,760
Everyone is invited to continue dining.

254
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,880
Come and take over, right?

255
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,800
But your scene is very good, you know how to take it yourself.

256
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,520
All beautiful people are like that.

257
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,520
Never watched a TV series?

258
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,240
Knife! Who is that girl?

259
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,440
The new female lead of the station, her name is Thongprakai.

260
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,760
You probably don't follow the entertainment industry much,

261
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,200
She's very famous now.

262
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,680
YES.

263
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Cute, huh?

264
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,640
Sir! Can we go out for a drink later?

265
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,240
Thong is a very pitiful child.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,680
Just filming my first movie, there's been a lot of bad news.

267
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,480
I think I probably won't be able to go far in the entertainment industry in the future.

268
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,560
Probably the best

269
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,080
Became the female lead in several short films.

270
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,640
We are also looking for ways to help her.

271
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,920
If Dao thinks so

272
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,160
I can help make her life better

273
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,600
Will Dao allow you to talk to her just once?

274
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,840
Very welcome, sir.

275
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,680
Dad! Where did Dam go?

276
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,640
Probably in the bathroom.

277
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,920
Where did you and Prajak go out just now?

278
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,240
He asked me to take him outside to get some air.

279
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,800
Except!

280
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,680
Yes?

281
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,440
Where did Thong go?

282
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,040
I heard I was going to the bathroom.

283
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,040
Help me look for her, Dam has also disappeared.

284
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,760
Oh.

285
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,400
Okay.

286
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,080
You go look downstairs, I'll look upstairs.

287
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,480
Remember to bring your phone with you, if you see them together

288
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,920
Take a photo as proof.

289
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,520
Okay.

290
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,280
Hello!

291
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,160
Ms. Thongprakai, right?

292
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,120
Yes, you want to take pictures, right?

293
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,080
Please!

294
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,160
No.

295
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,880
May I please sit with you?

296
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,240
Please.

297
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,680
My name is Lom, nice to meet you.

298
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,360
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Lom.

299
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,440
Why did Ms. Thong hide out here and sit alone?

300
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
The party hasn't served all the food yet.

301
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,840
Thong's face is tired.

302
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,000
Always have to play the main female role in front of adults.

303
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,120
The food is full of unknown things, Thong is not used to eating it.

304
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,520
Only this wine

305
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,120
is what I can drink.

306
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,160
So what kind of food does Ms. Thong like to eat?

307
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,040
What's wrong? Will you take me away?

308
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,400
So can we go now?

309
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,000
Thong likes to eat Somtam with fish sauce.

310
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,280
Recently Thong knows another very delicious restaurant.

311
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,240
Let Thong take it away.

312
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,920
Calm down! I'm just asking.

313
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,200
Now I'm on duty.

314
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,200
I can't get out of this party.

315
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,120
Mission?

316
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,560
Thong forgot to ask Lom.

317
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,640
Mr. Lom is

318
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,240
Which side is Mr. Phaithun's guest?

319
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,640
Are you a relative or work at the station?

320
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Or do we do business together?

321
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,960
I am not Mr. Phaithun's guest.

322
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,120
But my boss is a guest and I followed him here.

323
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,600
Who is your boss?

324
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,600
Ngài Prajak Sian's mother.

325
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,960
Familiar name.

326
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,920
But don't know.

327
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,680
So do you want to know?

328
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,960
My boss wants to know Miss Thong.

329
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,080
So he asked me to come and get to know Ms. Thong a bit.

330
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,640
No, Thong doesn't want to know anyone.

331
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,760
Want to know a little but can't?

332
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,320
If I fail at this,

333
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,720
will definitely be reprimanded by him.

334
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,520
Reprimand him, not Thong.

335
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,560
Please tell your boss if you want to get acquainted

336
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,360
then speak for yourself, not ask someone else to speak for you like this.

337
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,960
Miss Thong, please don't talk to him like that

338
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,600
and do not disobey his orders.

339
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Come with me.

340
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,480
So what if Thong disobeys orders?

341
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,680
Will he use a gun to shoot Thong?

342
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,200
Thong is not afraid,

343
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,480
I've had it before, but I didn't die.

344
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,120
Even if the car flips over, it won't kill you, it will live very long.

345
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,880
Ms. Thong is also really funny.

346
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,920
Not funny, Thong told the truth.

347
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,560
What's up? Did you see it?

348
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,000
Catch it with your own eyes.

349
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,440
Con Thong and Mr. Dam were sitting and touching each other in the garden.

350
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,080
Please look at this.

351
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,560
No, this is not Dam.

352
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,400
Isn't that right?

353
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,320
But this outfit is definitely a Thong.

354
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,840
But if Thong is not with Mr. Dam,

355
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,960
So who is Dam with?

356
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,280
Probably because you think too much.

357
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,200
Maybe Dam just went out to talk to someone.

358
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,880
Let's go back to the table.

359
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,960
Just knowing that Dam is not with Thong gives her peace of mind.

360
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,400
Oh.

361
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,640
You go in first, I'll go change my shoes first.

362
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,240
Running around looking for it hurts my legs.

363
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,560
Yes.

364
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,760
Dam locked the dressing room?

365
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,480
Oh, Damn.

366
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,520
Ms. Dao.

367
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,720
What are you doing here?

368
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,280
But why must the door be locked?

369
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,360
I went in to get the cufflinks, I forgot them.

370
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,640
I must have accidentally pressed the lock.

371
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,520
What are you doing here, Ms. Dao?

372
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,640
She went up to change her shoes. She wore these shoes a lot and her feet hurt.

373
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,760
Change to another pair for more comfort.

374
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,920
So which pair do you want me to bring so you can get them for me?

375
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,640
Let me choose for myself, it's okay.

376
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,360
Are you in a lot of pain?

377
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,840
Just a little bit.

378
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,160
It's this couple.

379
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,080
That's beautiful, sister.

380
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,480
What do you think?

381
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,280
It's very beautiful, it matches the dress very well.

382
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,720
But Dao, let's go quickly.

383
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,520
We are the hosts, if we keep guests waiting like that

384
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,800
it won't be good.

385
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,760
Let's go.

386
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,240
Go.

387
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,560
What's wrong with the carpet? Why is it there?

388
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,240
Because I spilled the wine,

389
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,520
So I'm afraid other people will step on it and it will be dirtier

390
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,680
so I rolled it up like that.

391
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,960
So let me tell the worker to bring it to harvest for me.

392
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,920
Yes.

393
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,760
Are you still in pain?

394
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,040
What's wrong?

395
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,120
Who is that?

396
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,160
What's the matter, Ms. Dao?

397
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,360
Get out here now.

398
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,880
Ms. Dao,

399
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,400
- Listen to me... - Shut up.

400
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,400
Are you out here?

401
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,920
I told you to come out here.

402
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,080
Oh.

403
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,920
Ms. Dao.

404
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,120
Oh.

405
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,880
I beg you.

406
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,680
Just go see him for a little while.

407
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,600
Chris. Where are you going?

408
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,280
Probably rushed off to another event.

409
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,400
Mr. Lom, your duty is to follow the boss

410
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,920
Not following Thong.

411
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,920
Thong has to go back to the party.

412
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,040
Miss Thong.

413
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,280
What's up?

414
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,080
Can you give me LINE please?

415
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,440
Please let me talk

416
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,440
Or speak for the boss?

417
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,240
Thong. What other man did you just go out with?

418
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Many things.

419
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,200
Malee. Do you know?

420
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,480
Mr. Prajak?

421
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,760
I know, but I won't tell you.

422
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,280
I want to let you stay that stupid.

423
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,280
Tell me.

424
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,680
Who is that?

425
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,200
I say it to do good deeds too.

426
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,240
There!

427
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,320
The person sitting near Mr. Phaithun is there

428
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,680
is Mr. Prajak Sianibunya,

429
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,200
Minister of the Interior.

430
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,400
Are you a minister too?

431
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,400
That's right, everyone knows him.

432
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,840
What's wrong?

433
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,080
Don't say that

434
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,440
you

435
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,040
Dream so high that you want to marry a minister.

436
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,600
Oh.

437
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,520
No way.

438
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,520
Old enough to be my father's age.

439
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,000
Go away, get out of my house right now.

440
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
Ms. Dao.

441
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,800
Ms. Dao, I'm sorry.

442
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,160
Please, please listen to me.

443
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
To be...

444
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,720
This time it was really because I was too drunk.

445
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,280
So I accidentally did that.

446
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,760
Besides, Chris is like my younger brother.

447
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,280
He and I were just having fun like normal men.

448
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,120
Enough.

449
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,960
I won't hear anything from you again.

450
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,720
And I have nothing more to say.

451
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,000
Except for the sentence "You and I here are enough".

452
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,000
Go away.

453
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,880
- Ms. Dao. - I said go.

454
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
That's OK.

455
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,080
I hope that one day Ms. Dao will forgive me.

456
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,080
Wait.

457
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,400
House keys and car keys

458
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,560
leave it all here.

459
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,280
Do you really have to go to this extent?

460
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,800
So...

461
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,160
Alright.

462
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,640
Not yet.

463
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,640
Not done yet.

464
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,160
The clothes you're wearing

465
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,600
You also have to take it off and pay it all.

466
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,880
Oh, oh.

467
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,720
- Even the clothes? - Ms. Dao.

468
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,800
Are you joking?

469
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Does my expression look like I'm joking right now?

470
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,880
What is my money?

471
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,880
Then we have to leave it all here.

472
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,240
Ms. Dao, stop behaving like a child.

473
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,440
Can there be some reason?

474
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,960
I don't want to use excuses.

475
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,840
From now on, I will use emotions.

476
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Makes your heart feel satisfied.

477
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Take it all off.

478
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,600
Take it off now.

479
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,640
Oh, I'm so happy.

480
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,720
It's over, it's over.

481
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,720
Take that off too.

482
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,480
Naked already.

483
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,760
Dead.

484
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,760
Briefs

485
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,040
I bought it myself.

486
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,440
So we end up here.

487
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,080
Don't let me see your face anymore.

488
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,080
Variable.

489
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:54,911
THE ROSE OF SIN
