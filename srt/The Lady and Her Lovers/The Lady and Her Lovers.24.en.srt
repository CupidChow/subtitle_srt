1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:01,391
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:41,736
 THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Mont, where are you going?

4
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,320
Mom called but I didn't pick up.

5
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,000
Hey, I've been waiting for you to come home for dinner for a long time.

6
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,920
Mont takes Thong home.

7
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,880
Mont broke up with Thong.

8
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,240
Really baby?

9
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,040
Mo Buddha.

10
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,880
Okay, finally free from karma.

11
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,720
Mom once said it was my destiny with Thong

12
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,960
don't match each other.

13
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,880
Any.

14
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,760
Hungry yet? Any.

15
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,160
Mom has prepared dinner since afternoon.

16
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,200
The food must have gone cold. Sit down first.

17
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,440
Do you want anything else to eat?

18
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,280
Mom will cook for you.

19
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,200
No need.

20
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,240
Mont, why are you sitting so sad?

21
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,000
After breaking up, let it go.

22
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,080
Think about the past

23
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,120
There is no benefit.

24
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,400
We must know how to let go

25
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,280
and live in the present.

26
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,320
Now that you're eating, you should know that you should just eat.

27
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,840
Hello?

28
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,160
Can you come see me?

29
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,240
I accept to be your lover.

30
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,840
Mont, wait, Mont.

31
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,800
Mont.

32
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,800
Mont!

33
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,120
Where are you going?

34
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,800
Mont!

35
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,200
Thong!

36
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,080
Mont!

37
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,720
Mont! Are you back?

38
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,640
Mont bought a cake for mom.

39
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,480
This! Next time don't go anywhere else, staying at my house is best.

40
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,880
YES.

41
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,880
- Good night. - Mont!

42
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,000
Now we are real lovers.

43
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,280
Can we sleep together?

44
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,320
Why do you have to sleep under the sofa to get tired?

45
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,320
Move into this room and sleep with me.

46
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Still not married, can't sleep in the same room yet.

47
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,920
But if one day your mother is not at home

48
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,200
That's fine too.

49
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,280
So what if your mother isn't with you?

50
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,720
We will be doing things

51
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,560
that lovers do to each other, right?

52
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,280
What's going on?

53
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,960
Don't really know?

54
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
If so, let me tell you.

55
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,200
Mom! Let Thong help?

56
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,800
Mom, go rest and let Thong do it for you.

57
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,440
Know what to do?

58
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,600
I know.

59
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,120
Thong has been washing his own clothes since he was little.

60
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,080
When it comes to housework, I just trust you.

61
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,400
I know how to do everything.

62
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,000
This is my shirt.

63
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,760
It is wrinkled silk fabric.

64
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,160
No need to use too much force.

65
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,160
And this is... Mont's collar has such black dust on it,

66
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Wash it all clean.

67
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,080
When I'm done, I'll go check it out.

68
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,160
I'm sure I'll give you all 10.

69
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,280
Act well, Thong!

70
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Mont! It's okay to wake up.

71
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,520
Mont!

72
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,880
What happened so early in the morning, Mom?

73
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,520
Mont!

74
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,040
Come on, sit up and talk to mom first.

75
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,360
Sit up.

76
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,480
What is it, mom?

77
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,240
Thong's story, what do you want in the end?

78
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,800
What do you want, mom? Thong is my lover.

79
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,520
But when we come to our house, we always stir up like that

80
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,440
that's not possible.

81
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,640
Mom doesn't want her to come to our house

82
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,240
when there is no clear identity.

83
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,720
Then you look.

84
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,200
When not, I have to go to the sofa to sleep.

85
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
like homeless people.

86
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,080
So it's okay for Mont to marry Thong today, Mom.

87
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,920
To have a clear identity, that Thong is Mont's wife.

88
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,280
The woman had previously done such work,

89
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,640
Can I get married?

90
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,720
Mont.

91
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,400
Mom told me this.

92
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Mom's retreat buddy,

93
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
she has a son

94
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,440
and her son

95
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,520
I don't know where to choose a dirty girl

96
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,800
to become a wife.

97
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,440
Anyone who forbids it will not listen.

98
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,400
Then do you know what happened?

99
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,680
That girl

100
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,280
have a lover,

101
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
then colluded with his lover

102
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
kill her son.

103
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,080
I don't understand how this can be done.

104
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,920
Why did Mom tell this story to Mont?

105
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Thong is not that girl.

106
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
And Thong also has no intention of killing Mont.

107
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
Mom told Mont

108
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,360
is to set an example in choosing a wife.

109
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
If you choose the wrong wife

110
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,320
it means death.

111
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,160
Really dead, kid.

112
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,480
If mom calls Mont up to talk about this

113
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,360
It would be better for Mont to continue sleeping.

114
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,920
Mont.

115
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,680
Mont, try going back and talking to Yem, okay?

116
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,160
Mom thinks Mont and Yem

117
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,800
There's still a chance to make peace with each other.

118
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Yem is a good girl,

119
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,280
There is no place to criticize.

120
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,640
Mom, can this stop?

121
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,400
Between Mont and Yem, the coals have long gone out,

122
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,200
No matter how much you stir it, there will be no more fire.

123
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,800
Mont, it's not okay for you to leave and avoid me like that.

124
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,560
Mont goes pee.

125
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,360
Oh, you don't need to help.

126
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,760
I can wash it myself.

127
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
Otherwise, my mom will see it and blame me too, that won't work.

128
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,120
As lovers, what's wrong with helping each other do laundry?

129
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,640
When you're in love, you don't want your lover to be tired.

130
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,080
But I'm trying to score points with your mother.

131
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,480
Anything that is easy to get scolded should be avoided.

132
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,880
If your mother saw it, she would blame you for being lazy.

133
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,480
If your mother sees us helping each other with the laundry

134
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,880
it looks cute.

135
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,320
Maybe his mother will like Thong more.

136
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,960
If so, then good.

137
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,600
Alright.

138
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,360
Oh, why so soft?

139
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,960
Do you use fabric softener?

140
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,560
Oh, it's still white.

141
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,800
Really white.

142
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,600
Good at washing clothes too.

143
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,320
- Give it up, I don't know what to play. - Oh.

144
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,040
- Thong, Thong... - I don't know what to play.

145
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,120
Thong, it's in my eyes.

146
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,840
Really? Where? Where? Don't rush to clean it, let me take a look.

147
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,720
Is it burning?

148
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,760
That stings.

149
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,000
Blink first, this side?

150
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,760
Huh.

151
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,560
Just kidding.

152
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,200
- I don't know what the joke is. - Thong, Thong, wet, wet.

153
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,160
Like this is really in the eyes. Thong, Thong, wait.

154
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,400
You said you were afraid my mother would scold you.

155
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,760
Now I'm not afraid of my mother anymore.

156
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,440
More afraid of cunning people.

157
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,040
Cunning but truly loving.

158
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
And not amorous anymore.

159
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,920
What's wrong with Thong?

160
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,400
Older brother...

161
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
Not really amorous, right?

162
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,000
Really. Why ask like that?

163
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,240
The fact that you are so good to me,

164
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,480
Is that who you really are?

165
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,040
You're not pretending to fool me, right?

166
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,280
I promised Thong,

167
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,280
that he won't make Thong hurt.

168
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,520
If Thong still doesn't believe in who he is, that's okay.

169
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,520
I can understand.

170
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,320
Let time prove it.

171
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Here, peeled off.

172
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,720
Good service like this,

173
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,720
Why don't you chew it for me?

174
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,720
Need it? Let me swallow and digest it for you.

175
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,160
Today's short news has reports from overseas reporters,

176
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,520
that Mr. Bancha Selee, also known as boss Bun,

177
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,120
suspect in a drug trafficking and money laundering case

178
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,520
fled to Mexico,

179
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,480
was found dead on a beach in Tijuana.

180
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,640
There were 27 gunshot wounds on his body.

181
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,560
Predict that the cause

182
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,880
Surely the drug trafficking group has conflicting interests with each other.

183
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,440
If there is progress

184
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
will continue to inform the audience.

185
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,200
Thong.

186
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,200
Are you okay?

187
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,800
This is the third person.

188
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,640
My third husband passed away, Mont.

189
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Is it true that I really have the fate of a murderer?

190
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,520
Thong.

191
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,400
It's nothing, just a coincidence.

192
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Nothing.

193
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,520
Mom.

194
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,040
You leave my son.

195
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,240
What are you doing?

196
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,680
Nothing in this world is a coincidence.

197
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,400
Everything happens

198
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,440
all have their reasons.

199
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,120
The story of her husband dying goes from one person to another

200
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,160
also comes from karma from her previous life.

201
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,400
Mont, Mont will be next

202
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,160
must accept karma for her.

203
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,440
Don't have anything to do with her anymore, kick her out of the house.

204
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,040
Mom, you make this ridiculous excuse

205
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,920
To tell Mont to break up with Thong is not okay.

206
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,360
It would be better if she behaved badly and heard it.

207
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,880
But my mother took the story of her past life

208
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,000
but I don't even know if it's true or not to say

209
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,760
It's not fair to Thong.

210
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,440
Is it true or not, I don't know?

211
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,880
She said it herself

212
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,040
that her husband has died three times.

213
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Still not clear at this point, Mont?

214
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,240
Then let's wait for Mont to be the fourth person to die before believing it.

215
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,840
Mont, don't talk like that.

216
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,720
See?

217
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,240
She was even afraid of herself.

218
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,640
Although this cannot be proven.

219
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,840
But it's partly true, Mont.

220
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,160
Otherwise, why have people believed it for hundreds of years?

221
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,560
Okay, let mom rest assured.

222
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,000
Mont will take Thong to perform an exorcism and karma ceremony.

223
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Anything that can be done Mont will do it.

224
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,320
Mom can feel secure like this?

225
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,840
Let's go Thong.

226
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Mont, karma can't cut you.

227
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,560
Holy water cannot wash away karma.

228
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,960
Mont, Mont, listen to me.

229
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,080
Mont.

230
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,040
Thong.

231
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,680
How about this, let me take Thong to find something delicious to eat.

232
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,840
Just now you said you would take him to an exorcism and karma ceremony

233
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
I'm just saying it to give my mother peace of mind.

234
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,720
To him, Thong is an innocent person.

235
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,720
There's no need to go

236
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,880
There is no ceremony like people still believe.

237
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,240
Yem, can I ask something?

238
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,760
Why did Yem and Mont break up?

239
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,720
She asked Mont but Mont refused to say.

240
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,920
Don't know what the secret is.

241
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,960
It's normal.

242
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,480
Thinking that we are not the same so it would be better if we broke up.

243
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,480
Is there any possibility to

244
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,000
Can you two reconcile?

245
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,960
She wants Yem and Mont to get back together.

246
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,120
Do you want Yem to take Mont away from Thong?

247
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,360
Not fighting.

248
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,360
Not married yet.

249
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,200
Yem still has the right to intervene, right?

250
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,920
Just come in for more choices

251
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,640
Mont's only.

252
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,280
Into becoming the choice?

253
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,320
That sounds so sad.

254
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,440
Actually, there have been a lot of people flirting with Yem lately.

255
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,120
Much better than Mont, but Yem refused.

256
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,480
Why must Yem

257
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,880
lower your dignity to do such a thing?

258
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,840
Yem is not that desperate for men.

259
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,840
Try to think carefully.

260
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,480
Mont used to be Yem's lover.

261
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,960
Be the perfect person.

262
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,480
But still broke up

263
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,680
to get to know a dirty girl like Thong

264
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,360
take your place.

265
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,360
Don't you feel anything?

266
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,000
That Mont finds Thong better than me.

267
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,000
I know in my heart that it's not true.

268
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,880
Women like Thong, there is nothing that can compare to you.

269
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,240
Miss!

270
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,800
How are you?

271
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,800
She knows,

272
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,320
If you tell Yem the real reason

273
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,720
Yem would probably think she was talking nonsense

274
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,240
and refused to help her.

275
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,400
But you're really heartbroken about this, Yem.

276
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,120
What's going on?

277
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,880
You can try telling me first.

278
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,800
Then that Thong,

279
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,840
she is not a girl

280
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,920
normal sinister.

281
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,640
She also has the number of killers.

282
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,760
And her three previous husbands are also dead.

283
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,040
If Mont still loves and continues to love her,

284
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,160
Mont will definitely die, Yem.

285
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,760
Yes! Please help me.

286
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,520
Help separate Mont from that Thong.

287
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,000
Hey Yem?

288
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,120
Yem, I'd like to speak frankly, ma'am.

289
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,000
when Yem saw women fighting over men's matters

290
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,920
Yem felt very disgusted.

291
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,440
But it seems like it is

292
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,400
This time, Yem will consider it as respect for her.

293
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,800
Yem will help you.

294
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,880
But Yem will only make Thong break up with Mont.

295
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,240
Wanting Yem to come back as Mont's lover,

296
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,760
Yem won't accept it.

297
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,320
Thank you very much, Yem.

298
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,080
Just cause those two people to break up,

299
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,520
It's already a blessing.

300
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,120
If so, Yem will only be the opening act today.

301
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,040
It's not an official performance yet. Where is Thong?

302
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,680
This housewife profession suits her.

303
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,320
Actually, I don't like doing housework either.

304
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,480
But at his house, how can I stay still?

305
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,720
Do whatever you want, and become his wife

306
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,920
I have to make his mother see that I can do anything.

307
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
That's the way women live thanks to men.

308
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Must try everything,

309
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,280
for the groom's family to accept.

310
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,800
Accept the disadvantages because you still depend on others.

311
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,680
If it were me,

312
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,800
I will hire someone to do the housework.

313
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,560
It's better to spend time working or resting.

314
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,400
My time is more valuable than doing all this laundry.

315
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,600
Then I'm happy, too.

316
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,080
because her life has better options.

317
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,880
But when you have a husband, you have to do it.

318
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,440
As for me, my ability is just that.

319
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,400
So we have to continue to be tired.

320
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,000
But I'm okay, I've been miserable all my life.

321
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,360
Housework like that is nothing.

322
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,560
How pitiful. That's it, I'm satisfied.

323
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,480
Her life will be like this until the end of her life.

324
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,560
But it's also good to be a peaceful person.

325
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,960
What's wrong with him? Come curse and leave!

326
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,480
Yes, no one is better than you and your mother.

327
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,000
What an angel!

328
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,760
I'm here, let me help.

329
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,880
Don't touch it.

330
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,000
Flower offerings to Buddha will be dirty.

331
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,400
If you are a dirty person, you must do more charity

332
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,200
Only then can I be as clean as my mother.

333
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,160
Come on, I'll fold better than mom!

334
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,280
Hey Thong!

335
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,840
What are mother-in-law and daughter-in-law doing?

336
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,840
Turns out they help each other fold flowers, so cute!

337
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,320
Who is the mother-in-law, who is the daughter-in-law?

338
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,280
No one is like that!

339
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,400
So let's do that,

340
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
I think you two are very compatible.

341
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,800
Thong, are you okay?

342
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,840
Enough! Nonsense!

343
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,800
Mont, today is an important Buddhist holiday.

344
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,200
Let's go to temple with mom!

345
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,440
Go do charity.

346
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,080
Let the unjust bondholder disappear.

347
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,960
Okay.

348
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,120
Thong, please come with me.

349
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,560
Mont, come over here!

350
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,000
Let me introduce you to my friends.

351
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Sister, sister Na!

352
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,811
 My son brought his girlfriend with him.

353
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:07,036
 Right there.

354
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,680
 I'd like to ask you, Inspector Mit

355
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,600
How much money does  give you a month?

356
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,560
 If you choose that woman to be your wife.

357
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,800
 We cut off the mother-child relationship.

358
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,520
 Say, between him and his mother...

359
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,440
 Who do you choose?

360
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:09,414
THE ROSE OF SIN
