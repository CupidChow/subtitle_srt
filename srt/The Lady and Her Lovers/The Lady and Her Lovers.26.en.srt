1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,391
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,861
 THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,920
Inspector for Thong.

4
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,880
That's the pay, for Thong staying with him.

5
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:49,043
To be clear, it is...

6
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,400
money from selling yourself, right?

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,320
Mont! Our family has never done anything embarrassing.

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,720
No one has ever had such a dirty background.

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,800
If Mont wants to choose this woman as his wife

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,360
then we are no longer mother and daughter.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,520
Say it!

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,320
Between her and mom, who will you choose?

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,160
Mom, don't use this method on your child.

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,560
I can't leave anyone, mom.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
Mom and Thong

16
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,000
are the two women I love.

17
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,400
If I lose anyone, I won't be able to live, Mom.

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,000
I beg you, mother.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,360
Don't force your child to choose.

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,760
Let's go, Thong!

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,600
Mont!

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,600
Mont did so

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,240
Which means Mont chose her.

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
Mont chose her, right?

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,520
Mont abandoned his mother,

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,800
Would Mont dare abandon his mother?

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,920
Thong!

28
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,920
Thong!

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,280
Don't listen to what your mother says.

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,520
His mother just wanted

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,240
Because I won, I only used those words to attack.

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,960
But no need to worry,

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,960
I never felt like there was anything bad about you.

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,160
But you're making me and mom argue.

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,720
Mont.

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,360
Is this okay?

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
I will rent an apartment nearby to live

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,880
to end the problem between you and my mother.

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,160
And he will go back and forth between the two places.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,160
No way, Thong.

41
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,400
I want mom with you

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,760
live in harmony with each other.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
Your mother is old,

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,080
Need someone around to take care of you.

45
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,720
I want you to help take care of my mother

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,160
when he is not at home.

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,320
I also want to get along with your mother,

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
But you also saw what your mother was like.

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,520
Mom will never accept me.

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,280
Thong.

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,720
This,

52
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,120
Don't think like that.

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
I believe if you try

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,640
then it's fine either way.

55
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,520
Thong treats his mother well,

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,760
gradually proving myself,

57
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,760
Then your mother will soften.

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,160
Thong promise me,

59
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,600
I won't be angry with my mother no matter what

60
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,320
and took care of his mother as if she were her own mother.

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,560
That's OK.

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,920
Whatever.

63
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,240
As long as I can live with you,

64
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,600
I accept everything.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,360
Thong is so cute.

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,360
So cute,

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
One day, my mother will also see the good things in me.

68
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,720
Uncle,

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,720
Can I ask you something?

70
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,120
Did you know?

71
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,520
Miss Ruedee, what fruits do you like to eat?

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,280
Do you want to please your mother-in-law?

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,480
Wow, having such a daughter-in-law is so cute.

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,200
Ms. Ruedee likes to eat tangerines.

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,880
Every time tangerine season comes

76
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
I will buy a few pounds immediately.

77
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,120
So I'll take 5 pounds of tangerines.

78
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,880
Okay.

79
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,000
Uncle, are mangoes sour?

80
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,560
Sour.

81
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
It's always painful.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,160
How many pounds should I take?

83
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,360
- Three pounds. - Okay.

84
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,200
Please allow me a little interview.

85
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
She is a girl

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,760
used to live in Inspector Mit's house, this is a hot case lately, right?

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,480
Please help answer.

88
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,040
Miss...

89
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,840
was also one of the girls

90
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,560
was locked in the house by Inspector Mit, right?

91
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,000
What did she do that for?

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,120
What do you want?

93
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm a reporter,

94
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
Come for an on-duty interview.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Because this news is of interest to many people.

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Because it concerns a state official

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,320
taking corrupt money for personal use.

98
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,000
And she is one of those who benefit from it.

99
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,000
Please help answer.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
Inspector Mit

101
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,160
How much do you pay her a month?

102
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,760
20 baht.

103
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,400
20.

104
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,400
The tangerine is so beautiful today, isn't it?

105
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,400
Get me two pounds.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,880
Thong bought it in the morning.

107
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,880
I saw that I got rich from corruption money

108
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,120
Should buy up to five pounds.

109
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,120
Corrupt money?

110
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,200
What corruption? I do not understand.

111
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,760
Mother-in-law and daughter-in-law

112
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,160
without knowing who she is, why is she rich?

113
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,800
Everybody

114
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,040
everyone knows it all.

115
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,720
Mom, Mont is going to practice.

116
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,480
Where are you packing your things?

117
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,560
No need to call me mom anymore.

118
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,560
If Mont still lets that girl

119
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,000
in our house

120
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,720
then she will no longer be Mont's mother.

121
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,040
Mom will go to the temple to practice.

122
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,360
So that mother's sadness can be reduced.

123
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,760
What happened, mom?

124
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,080
Who said what made her do this?

125
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,360
No one said anything to mom.

126
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,600
Does Mont know that everyone knows who Thong is?

127
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,600
come from?

128
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,800
Do you still have the face to go to the market?

129
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,560
Mom is not thick-skinned enough

130
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
to live with that girl

131
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,120
without feeling anything.

132
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
If Mont can do it

133
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Then Mont should just live with her.

134
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,680
Mom, Thong is at my house

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,960
So what's going on? She's been here a long time, Mom.

136
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,160
And it hasn't done anything to harm us.

137
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,520
She cannot change the past.

138
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,880
But she is trying to do well now.

139
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,880
You must give her a chance.

140
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,520
Mont, don't force me.

141
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,520
Mom is old-fashioned.

142
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,640
Mom cannot accept a woman with a dark past

143
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
be my daughter-in-law.

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,400
Then there was the order to kill her husband.

145
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
If anything happens to Mont

146
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Mother will be heartbroken to death.

147
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,440
Mont.

148
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,440
Mom begged.

149
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,880
Please do it for mom.

150
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,880
Mom.

151
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,000
Mom, can you please stop thinking so badly about Thong?

152
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,160
Basically, she's not a bad person.

153
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,160
She also wants to be a good person like us.

154
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,520
But she's not lucky

155
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
when life goes bad.

156
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,800
And now Mont sees her efforts

157
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,360
Let others accept it and stop looking down on it.

158
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,840
We, the people who consider ourselves good

159
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,040
You should help her so she can do it.

160
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,160
That's right, isn't it, Mom?

161
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,640
The things you say

162
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
which means Mont will be unfilial to his mother,

163
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,840
I have to marry her, right?

164
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
- No, mom. - That's enough, Mont.

165
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,440
No need to say anything more.

166
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,320
Mom will go herself.

167
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,520
You should practice first today, I'm not in the mood.

168
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,320
YES.

169
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,320
Thong.

170
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Why do you say you went to the market in the morning and just came back now?

171
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,760
Thong, I'm sorry. Because there's something going on

172
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,280
so there is a penalty fee.

173
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
What's wrong? What's wrong with who?

174
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,960
This morning, a fight broke out at Happy Land Mai market.

175
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,440
Let's take a look at the recorded images.

176
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,360
This.

177
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,400
Do not.

178
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,080
What do you want from me? What do you want?

179
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,680
After I interviewed a woman,

180
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,040
reported person

181
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
is a member of Inspector Mit's harem,

182
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,480
but just asked

183
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Then this woman went crazy.

184
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,960
Get fruit from the stall next door

185
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,320
then threw it in and relentlessly attacked my body.

186
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
I can only defend myself.

187
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,440
Luckily, there were people around who came to help.

188
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,120
Then the police came to stop the incident.

189
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,560
That woman

190
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
were also punished according to the law.

191
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,080
I'm safe now.

192
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,800
Regarding the case of Inspector Mit and his harem,

193
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,440
I will follow the details

194
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
and notify everyone.

195
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,600
Sorry, Mont.

196
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,160
Thong couldn't control himself.

197
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,360
Yem deliberately embarrassed Thong in front of everyone in the market.

198
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,600
After that, whatever Thong grabbed in his hand, he threw it at her.

199
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,320
It's okay, Thong, Mont understands.

200
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,760
Mont knows what Yem's personality is like.

201
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,120
So please don't go to the market this time.

202
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,600
Let everyone forget about this.

203
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,080
If you want to buy something, just say it, Mont will buy it for you.

204
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,360
It's okay, Thong can still go to the market normally.

205
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,960
This little thing doesn't make Thong embarrassed.

206
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,160
HAS.

207
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Mont's mother likes to eat tangerines, right?

208
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Let Thong squeeze the tangerines and refrigerate.

209
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,080
When Mom comes home, she will definitely like it.

210
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,320
No need.

211
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,320
Mont's mother is gone.

212
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,160
Where to go?

213
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Older sister. She is clearly the homeowner.

214
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,000
Why do you have to leave the house by yourself?

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,960
Why not kick him out?

216
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
He has no right to be in your house.

217
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,720
If it were me

218
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,240
then I will stay in the house forever

219
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,520
and fight it until one side falls.

220
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,640
I can't use that method.

221
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,000
If I quarrel with it

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,720
Then I will become a bad guy in my son's eyes.

223
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
And boys will oppose me.

224
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,160
I play the role of a good person

225
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
and move out of the house on my own.

226
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,720
Then wait for your son to comfort you,

227
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,200
I think that would be better.

228
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,520
Sister, I'm really asking.

229
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,440
Do you think this will work?

230
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,680
Sometimes Mont's mother comes to the temple to stay

231
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
That's also a good thing.

232
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
Maybe mom's mood will be better without having to see Thong's face.

233
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
No need to listen to neighbors' gossip.

234
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,120
Besides,

235
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,640
There, my mother also had many friends.

236
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,760
Mom will not be alone.

237
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,520
How can you say that, Thong?

238
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,840
How could Mont leave his mother? That's Mont's mother.

239
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,640
Thong also doesn't want his mother to be there forever.

240
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,000
What Thong means is

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,800
If you want, you can stay there for a while.

242
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,880
Being in a temple, being close to Buddha can make you feel more comfortable.

243
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,320
And probably will think better of Thong.

244
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,120
Oh, how can you eat that?

245
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,720
Chua wants to numb his teeth.

246
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,160
Thong likes it, Thong often eats this with his friends.

247
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,320
Thong, are you awake yet? Thong.

248
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,520
Thong.

249
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,920
Thong.

250
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,240
Today Mont will go pick up his mother and take him home.

251
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,840
I'll go cook.

252
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Cook 3 or 4 dishes that mom likes.

253
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,880
Wait until I get home and then eat together.

254
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,880
Okay.

255
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,680
What's wrong with Thong? Are you not well?

256
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,680
Are not.

257
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,680
I'm okay.

258
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,080
Thong!

259
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,000
Are you going to the doctor, Thong?

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,480
If something happens, treat it promptly.

261
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,280
No.

262
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,840
Let's see how the situation is.

263
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,680
So how are you now?

264
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,680
Are there any other symptoms?

265
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,080
Then a headache,

266
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,600
and then nausea...

267
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Just woke up.

268
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,440
Oh, sister.

269
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,480
She said her precious baby would come to pick her up,

270
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
It's been half a day now

271
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,800
which I still haven't seen

272
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,080
the shadow of her child.

273
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,800
That's right.

274
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,160
I thought he was coming to pick me up last night.

275
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,160
Or the slowest

276
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
is this morning.

277
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,160
Yet now he is still nowhere to be found.

278
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,960
I say listen.

279
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,640
Now I think he's sleeping next to that Thong.

280
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,640
That girl is a deep hole,

281
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,320
It's so deep.

282
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,720
Who has fallen into it?

283
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,160
it's very difficult to get out.

284
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,760
You must help your child.

285
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,680
Pull the boy out of Thong's hole.

286
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,240
Otherwise

287
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,880
definitely

288
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,680
It will become neither child nor human if it falls into it.

289
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,600
Forget it.

290
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,880
If he considers his wife more than his mother

291
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
then just leave it alone!

292
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,200
I will shave my head and become a monk here.

293
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,560
Oh, I don't know what to say!

294
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,280
[Test results]

295
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,240
[Pregnant 16 weeks from last period]

296
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,320
Thong!

297
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,520
I love you.

298
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:33,402
No matter what happens, I still love you like before.

299
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:36,604
The doctor said yes

300
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,222
I'm 4 months pregnant.

301
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:44,254
Who is your child's father?

302
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:48,552
Inspector Mit.

303
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:02,886
Not!

304
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:05,134
Not Inspector Mit's child.

305
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,320
The child in your womb is mine!

306
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,179
Thong.

307
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:15,942
Listen to me, that's it!

308
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:18,718
This child is our child.

309
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,240
I will marry you as quickly as possible.

310
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,860
When will you become my wife?

311
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:27,536
This child is also your child.

312
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:31,504
Don't, Mont!

313
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:32,889
Don't do that.

314
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,369
- Thong! - I can't lie to myself.

315
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,769
This child is not your child.

316
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,889
We had something together just recently.

317
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:43,929
This child is Inspector Mit's child.

318
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,409
Thong!

319
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:54,649
But this is the best way to help this child.

320
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,769
Thong cannot give birth to it

321
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:58,649
then said that his father was in prison.

322
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:11,249
We'll get married anyway,

323
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:16,009
I will accept this child as my child, Thong.

324
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,609
You don't need to worry,

325
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:28,369
I will love it so much, like it is my child.

326
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:36,089
No problem.

327
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,449
The best way for all of us

328
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:58,929
is to leave the baby.

329
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,609
No, Thong.

330
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:06,529
I won't let you do that.

331
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:08,529
I've made a mistake once before,

332
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:12,129
I won't let that mistake happen again.

333
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,129
No way, Yem!

334
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:16,609
I can't accept this,

335
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:17,649
This is our child.

336
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:21,049
That sounds so delusional, Mont!

337
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,049
It's only been two months.

338
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:24,249
Still no life,

339
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,889
Still no soul at all.

340
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:27,809
It's just a blood clot.

341
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:29,369
We didn't kill anyone.

342
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,969
You don't need to feel so guilty.

343
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:33,329
Say whatever you want,

344
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,329
but he didn't accept it anyway.

345
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,489
When Yem is ready, we will get married.

346
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,769
But I don't want to get married.

347
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:44,769
EH!

348
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:47,489
So what if we love each other?

349
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:52,889
I know you

350
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:54,409
because I want to have a lover,

351
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,449
But that doesn't mean I want to get married, have a family and have children.

352
00:19:57,449 --> 00:19:58,689
It's not the same, Mont!

353
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:01,049
Having a lover and having a family are two different things.

354
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:02,609
That you are my lover

355
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:04,769
That doesn't mean I have the right to order you what to do

356
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:05,849
and do nothing.

357
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:07,849
In particular, this is something related to my body.

358
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:11,169
But the child in Yem's belly is half yours.

359
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:14,969
But you have to be pregnant for 8 or 9 months

360
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:15,969
it's this person.

361
00:20:15,969 --> 00:20:18,169
And the person must breastfeed for a whole year

362
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:18,769
also this person.

363
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:21,049
But that's not what I want.

364
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:24,129
It takes me two or three years to raise a child.

365
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:26,929
I feel sorry, I could have done a lot of things with that time.

366
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:28,729
Don't bring out your own illusions

367
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,089
to make others suffer.

368
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:35,129
This is it, when will you get pregnant on your own?

369
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:37,129
Then you keep it yourself.

370
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:41,929
From that day,

371
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:46,569
He also didn't dare look at Yem's face anymore.

372
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,169
'Cause every time I look at her face,

373
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,249
he will think of the child he once lost.

374
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,689
We had just talked again when she came to help Thong.

375
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:06,889
I beg you, Thong!

376
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:11,369
Don't leave the baby, okay?

377
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:21,449
So what if I say I'm pregnant with you?

378
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,249
What will your mother say?

379
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:41,729
Mom.

380
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:54,529
Merit from mother's meditation

381
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:56,529
has been transmitted to the heart

382
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:58,529
Let me come back to pick you up, right?

383
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:01,289
That's right, mother.

384
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:04,129
Sorry I was late.

385
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:07,409
It's OK.

386
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:10,809
As long as you come to pick me up, I'll be happy.

387
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:14,289
So that means you broke up with her, right?

388
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:18,889
The thing is

389
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,329
Mont has good news to tell his mother.

390
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:29,889
What good news?

391
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,129
Mom is about to have a grandchild.

392
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:36,289
Thong is pregnant with my child.

393
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:38,729
We are preparing to have a child together.

394
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:42,769
Mont star for sure

395
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,089
that she was really pregnant?

396
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,089
Mont has taken Thong to be checked at the hospital.

397
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:48,369
Thong is really pregnant.

398
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:50,729
So how can Mont believe it?

399
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:53,129
that the baby in her womb is Mont's child?

400
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:56,569
She has been through countless relationships

401
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:57,889
then put the baby in your arms.

402
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:00,169
Mont, don't be stupid

403
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:02,169
but it's easy to accept.

404
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:07,929
But Thong really assured me that over the past few months

405
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,649
Thong has not had sex with anyone other than Mont.

406
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:12,489
Mont believes it?

407
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:15,609
Even if she swears in front of Buddha

408
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,609
Mom doesn't believe it either.

409
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:21,329
And Mont's arrival

410
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:24,569
You're coming to pick up your mother to live with her, right?

411
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:28,169
If she gives birth to the baby

412
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:31,009
So you want your mother to help her raise the child too, right?

413
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:35,329
Bastard, I don't know where I'm pregnant.

414
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,769
Mom will never accept me as her grandchild.

415
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:42,009
Well, let's pray for blessings.

416
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:50,969
Mont goes back, mom will continue to meditate.

417
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:59,529
Mom, Mont is going to have a perfect family,

418
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:02,169
Mom, can you please congratulate me?

419
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:06,769
Mom is about to raise her cute grandchild, how good that is.

420
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:09,489
Mom, please don't make this a bad thing, okay?

421
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:13,609
Mom.

422
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:42,169
Mont, that's enough.

423
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:43,729
- Been drinking since afternoon. - Don't interfere.

424
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:47,249
I'll drink until morning, Thong.

425
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:49,369
I'll drink until I can think of a way

426
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:51,289
so that mom and Thong can get along well.

427
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:54,889
Thong is the girl he loves,

428
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,689
but his mother is also the woman he loves.

429
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:00,409
I don't want to lose anyone.

430
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:05,529
That's enough, Mont,

431
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:08,049
- I'm so drunk, let me take you to bed. - I said no.

432
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:10,449
I still haven't figured it out, Thong.

433
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:18,289
Thong.

434
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:21,049
Thong tell me.

435
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:22,729
How to do?

436
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:24,209
How to do?

437
00:25:24,209 --> 00:25:26,209
You've done so well, but why doesn't mom accept it?

438
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:28,169
What should I do, Thong? Thong tell me.

439
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:30,529
Thong! Thong!

440
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,449
Let me answer frankly.

441
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,969
No matter life or death, my mother will not accept you.

442
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:41,209
If I had to choose

443
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:44,849
then you should choose your mother.

444
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:47,489
No need to worry about me.

445
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:50,129
I have a watch worth more than ten million.

446
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:52,129
If I have money, I can manage it myself.

447
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:58,849
Why does Thong speak as if Thong doesn't love him at all?

448
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:02,649
Can Thong leave me without missing me?

449
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,129
We love each other, Thong.

450
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:14,369
Thong.

451
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:23,689
Because I love you,

452
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,169
so I just left.

453
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:30,049
I don't want to stay and become a problem,

454
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,329
Let me be so stressed every day.

455
00:26:35,489 --> 00:26:37,169
If we separate

456
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,609
Then we will forget each other.

457
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,089
Are not.

458
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:48,009
I won't lose you, I love you, I'll be with you,

459
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:51,049
I will find a way to bring my mother back to see you.

460
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,449
Thong!

461
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:26,809
Thong, don't leave me.

462
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:30,169
Stay with me, Thong.

463
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:36,969
Stay with me, Thong.

464
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:57,609
Thong!

465
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:00,769
Is Thong there? Get me a glass of water.

466
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:04,489
Thong!

467
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:24,289
Mont!

468
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:26,129
You are the best man

469
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:27,649
that I have ever met.

470
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:30,849
You are a man I can confidently say

471
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:32,489
I love you.

472
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:34,489
This is true love,

473
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:36,489
This is my sincere love.

474
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:38,849
But because my blessings are not enough,

475
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:41,129
so we can't be together.

476
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:43,129
Forget me!

477
00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:45,129
There are still many good women,

478
00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:46,849
worthy of you,

479
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:48,849
the person his mother likes.

480
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:51,529
Thank you for everything that has happened,

481
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:54,089
I have done so many things for you.

482
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:56,369
No matter how much you repay, you cannot repay it.

483
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:59,249
I would like to repay you with this wish from the bottom of my heart,

484
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:02,049
wish you luck.

485
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:04,409
I will love you forever.

486
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:07,209
Goodbye!

487
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:45,391
THE ROSE OF SIN
