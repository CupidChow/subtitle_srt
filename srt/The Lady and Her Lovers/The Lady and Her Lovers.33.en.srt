1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,347
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:39,752
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,600
 I have installed Thong's phone tracking location.

4
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,840
And the coordinates show Thong here.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,440
Maybe your phone is wrong.

6
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,120
Thong came here the other day to look for Ms. Dao,

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,240
Maybe the positioning is still stuck at that time. What's wrong with you?

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,480
Come talk another day, go home.

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,360
Ms. Dao.

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,640
Ms. Dao.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,480
Ms. Dao.

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,600
Ms. Dao, don't listen to him, it's okay.

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,120
You stay there.

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,360
Whether Thong is here or not, I will confirm for myself.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,880
Ms. Dao.

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,280
See? I said it was nothing.

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,760
Are you satisfied? You go back.

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,840
Thong was originally not here anymore. Next time don't do that again.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,240
I respect you so I don't calculate that.

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,920
That's Thong's shirt.

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,040
Thong.

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,160
Come here.

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,600
I told you to come out here.

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,720
- Ms. Dao, Thong please... - No need.

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,440
Go out.

26
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,760
Ms. Dao.

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,080
I said get out.

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Thong, go home first.

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,760
Apologies are for another time.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,320
Ms. Dao.

31
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,960
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,320
It's okay to go out.

33
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,120
She heard the apology so much that she got used to it.

34
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,920
When I go out, I want to be alone.

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,800
Go away.

36
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,160
Okay.

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,960
But I hope that when you calm down,

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,320
Let me explain so you understand.

39
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,040
Interrupt at the wrong time, if you don't follow through

40
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,760
- Everything will not be revealed. - This!

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,000
Who knows? Ms. Dao said to go to China.

42
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,880
Hey, Thong! Don't blame me.

43
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,160
I said Dam is very bad.

44
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,920
I'm involved in it again. So what now?

45
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,200
My future in the entertainment industry will definitely collapse.

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,000
So it's not your fault that I have to bet with Mr. Dam?

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,880
Thong, you can't blame me.

48
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,640
It was Thong who went betting with him.

49
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,040
Sell ​​yourself for it. What does it have to do with you?

50
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
So if you don't take my money, do I have to go betting?

51
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,000
50% of my money, they paid it a long time ago.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,120
I didn't get a single baht, huh?

53
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
Where did that money go? Where did you take it all? You say it.

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,760
That's money for laser surgery, money for facial work.

55
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,480
Clothes, and how many other things to use for photography?

56
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,560
The new phone that I bought for you. All together, it's several hundred thousand, Thong.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,720
I didn't ask you.

58
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,000
I think if I become a star my life will be better,

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,720
Who would have thought it would get worse like this, because I'm with you.

60
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,120
I'll go, you go get me the contract.

61
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,680
I will tear it up with my own hands.

62
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,480
Are you going to tear up the contract and throw it away?

63
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,160
YES.

64
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,800
Thong, where can Thong go?

65
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,040
I am the one who molds you with my own hands,

66
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,480
Anyway, I have to stay with you.

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,880
You have such a thick skin, when did you mold me?

68
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,000
It's because I changed myself. Don't let me tear up the contract, right?

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
You just go to sleep,

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,280
I'm going somewhere else, I'm not with you anymore.

71
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,920
Thong!

72
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,240
Thong!

73
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,320
Thong!

74
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
Thong, I can't go anywhere.

75
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,400
Thong!

76
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,400
Where are you going?

77
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,360
You can't go anywhere, if you want to go

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Then bring me money to compensate me according to the contract.

79
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,040
Are you delusional? When did I break the contract with you?

80
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Want to know right?

81
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,080
Let me go.

82
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,040
- I said let go. - Come here.

83
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,800
Wait here.

84
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,480
You want to know what you did wrong, right?

85
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,080
Open your eyes and read.

86
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,060
Read the contract to see how much the compensation is.

87
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,160
 [50 million baht]

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,400
50 million?

89
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,200
What the hell?

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,400
When I first read it, it was nothing.

91
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,720
There is Thong, but that's because I didn't read carefully.

92
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,040
 [10 years]

93
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,800
10 year term? When I signed, the contract said 3 years.

94
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,600
What kind of ridiculous contract is this?

95
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
What kind of unreasonable contract?

96
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,840
Open your eyes and look.

97
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,480
It's a contract between us, Thong.

98
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,280
Incorrect.

99
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,440
I have never signed such a cruel slave contract.

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,560
B, you made this up!

101
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,760
Are you crazy? I don't accept.

102
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,520
Don't you accept it?

103
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,640
If you don't accept it, you'll be sued.

104
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,440
Can you afford a lawyer?

105
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,240
I tell you, the contract has a clear signature like this,

106
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,120
No matter how I sue, I will lose. Do you have money to pay me?

107
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,800
Thong, I told Thong.

108
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,800
Now Thong is having problems.

109
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,440
He didn't know it was Ms. Dao

110
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,000
How will I solve it?

111
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,000
No matter what, you must have me so I can help you.

112
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,720
You can't escape me, if you want to leave

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,880
then try to think carefully if you go,

114
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,400
Can I still work in this industry?

115
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,280
Trust me, I'm human

116
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,320
take the best care of Thong.

117
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,400
You go take care of your mother, you hypocrite.

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,800
Thong.

119
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,360
Thong.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,520
Thong.

121
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,880
Dad.

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,160
Dad, don't raise your voice, I don't like it.

123
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,960
Wait a minute, dad is busy.

124
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,480
Thong.

125
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,760
Dad, I told you not to raise your voice.

126
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,040
Dad told me not to interfere.

127
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,120
Thong.

128
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,960
Ms. Dao.

129
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,720
How is Fai Varee progressing? How was the editing of the first two episodes?

130
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,560
Almost finished episode one.

131
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,560
Just need to film the scene of the female lead's house in Khao Yai and that's it.

132
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,400
Will it be broadcast next Friday?

133
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,840
No time yet.

134
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,520
But next Friday

135
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,360
Isn't that the day "Castle of Desire" premiered its first episode?

136
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,880
Jacki has scheduled an appointment with Ice to interview Thong.

137
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,040
I plan to replace it with the movie Fai Varee.

138
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,840
As for the movie "Castle of Desire", I will skip it altogether.

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,400
Oh. What happened?

140
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,840
Do we have to go to the extent of not allowing it to be broadcast?

141
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,720
You don't need to know.

142
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,120
Let's just say I don't want to let some people

143
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
Get benefit from this movie.

144
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
But we notice

145
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,800
This time Chris will star with a new actress.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,400
Almost the whole country is waiting to see this movie.

147
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,360
There is money invested in the film, money from sponsors.

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,640
What should we do, Ms. Dao?

149
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,640
I've been trying to figure out how to handle those things.

150
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,200
You just need to speed up to practice a Fai Varee movie

151
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
It should be broadcast next Friday.

152
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,960
So this is a big deal

153
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,920
Has Ms. Dao told Mr. Phaithun yet?

154
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,040
Oh, that's crazy. What needs to be handled first?

155
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,520
Oh, Yem, what's the matter?

156
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,280
Yem came to see Ms. Dao.

157
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,200
Oh. Are you planning to change your career from reporter to actor?

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,160
I don't know anymore.

159
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,280
Sometimes a female lead gets kicked out of the station

160
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,680
Then Yem will be replaced.

161
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,880
Oh, who got kicked out? But what was the reason for being kicked out?

162
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,720
Yem just joking.

163
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,680
Please tell Ms. Dao.

164
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,880
Okay.

165
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,960
Ms. Thong, open the door for me.

166
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,000
Ms. Thong.

167
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,040
What is up?

168
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,480
Thong, don't be angry with dad anymore and come down to eat.

169
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,880
Thong, come and eat. Let me dig up the rice for you.

170
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,720
Don't want me to leave you, do you?

171
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,120
That's right.

172
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,040
I'm still new in this industry.

173
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,520
If I don't have you, who will I turn to?

174
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,760
So give me my money back.

175
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,720
Even the salary for filming commercials and acting in movies.

176
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,440
No need to ask, I will pay you.

177
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,120
But he paid a part in advance, the customer still hasn't paid in full.

178
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,320
Pay whatever you have.

179
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,760
And the contract issue also has to be discussed.

180
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,560
I don't want to let anyone decide my life anymore.

181
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,200
Okay. Work together

182
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,040
Each person has the right to decide, to make it fair.

183
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,280
Do you still dare to say it's fair?

184
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,720
While you always take advantage of me, you're really thick-skinned.

185
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,680
Thong, don't say that in front of my daughter.

186
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,280
As I said, if anything happens, we'll deal with it later.

187
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,520
Come on. He promised that he would do everything to make Thong comfortable.

188
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,640
About the past time, I'm sorry.

189
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,320
Okay?

190
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,502
You can transfer money first.

191
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,000
Alright.

192
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,680
Thong's filming fee is 8,000 baht per episode.

193
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,000
I deduct 30%,

194
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,480
The remaining amount per episode is 5,600 baht.

195
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,600
Why so little?

196
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,520
Filming from morning until night, 16 hours a day

197
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,680
but only 5,600 baht per episode. One episode filmed for two days.

198
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,640
But for 16 hours, does one hour get 175 baht?

199
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,240
New actors can only do that, Thong.

200
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,480
What more could you ask for? Even higher than the basic salary.

201
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,080
Thong filmed all 24 episodes.

202
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,760
The amount is

203
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,400
134,400 baht.

204
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,520
People transfer the first deposit of 50%.

205
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,240
I will transfer you 67,200 baht.

206
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,440
67,000 baht?

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,320
Wait, Thong, you forgot to deduct 7% of Thong's tax.

208
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,040
Minus the 7% tax, the remaining 62,496 baht.

209
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,080
I've moved on, the other half

210
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,040
Then wait for the movie to be released.

211
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,800
Eat rice, child.

212
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,120
I have to wake up and comfort you right away.

213
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,960
I can't leave you like that.

214
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,040
Jem.

215
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,040
I love you, do you hear?

216
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,040
I love you.

217
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,120
- That's good. - Close the device.

218
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,800
Mr. Dam, thank you very much.

219
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,640
YES.

220
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
Ah, sister, we'll see each other again after the first episode premieres, right?

221
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,520
Ms. Dao said she finished filming and gathered at her house to watch.

222
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,240
I won't go anymore, Ms. Dao has canceled.

223
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,920
I wonder if she is sulking at someone.

224
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,600
Today, filming for the final scene was supposed to happen but it didn't.

225
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,400
Do you know Dam? What's going on?

226
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,920
Probably nothing. I think Ms. Dao is probably busy with work these days.

227
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,720
If so, please allow me to go first.

228
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,120
I have another event.

229
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,440
Hello sir.

230
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,080
Hello.

231
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,280
Let me see you off.

232
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,840
Yes.

233
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,840
Thong, see you again.

234
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,640
What to do now? Ms. Dao remained silent like that,

235
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
I'm so upset I'm about to go crazy.

236
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,920
I'd rather let her grab my head and beat me to it.

237
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,840
Can't do anything either.

238
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,560
Ms. Dao has never been like this before.

239
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,280
Maybe we can just wait.

240
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Impossible.

241
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,520
How can you be so silent?

242
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,600
The movie is about to be released,

243
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,000
How do we continue working together?

244
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Hey, Dam, you're the cause of that incident,

245
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,480
Hurry up and solve it.

246
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Sorry, Ms. Dao is inconvenient to meet.

247
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,280
Tell me Thong can come find you.

248
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,280
Thong has something important to say.

249
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,920
Ms. Dao said it was inconvenient to meet anyone.

250
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,440
Please tell Ms. Dao that we're here to talk about business.

251
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
It's not a personal matter.

252
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,640
Anything is not convenient. I'm really sorry.

253
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,960
Wait.

254
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,160
Please send flowers to Ms. Dao.

255
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,120
Okay.

256
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,920
Thong!

257
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,480
Miss Thong, wait.

258
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,840
Miss Thong, I can't come in. Miss Thong.

259
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,040
Miss Thong.

260
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,480
Ms. Dao.

261
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,400
- Ms. Dao. - Ms. Thong.

262
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,280
Ms. Dao, this is Thong.

263
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,520
Ms. Dao.

264
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,160
Where is Ms. Dao?

265
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,840
- Ms. Dao. - Wait, Miss Thong.

266
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,040
Ms. Dao.

267
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,360
Ms. Dao.

268
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,360
Ms. Dao listen to Thong first.

269
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,760
Ms. Dao.

270
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,600
Ms. Dao, Thong is really wrong about this.

271
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,520
Evil Thong, stupid Thong.

272
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Stupidity like that shouldn't be forgiven, Ms. Dao.

273
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,320
Ms. Dao, please punish Thong.

274
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,600
If Ms. Dao wants to scold, talk, slap, or hit Thong, it's fine.

275
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,480
But don't ignore me like that.

276
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,120
Thong has no relatives or sisters.

277
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,840
Ms. Dao is like Thong's only sister.

278
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,000
Please have mercy on Thong, Ms. Dao.

279
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,480
I kneel and beg you.

280
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Ms. Dao, Ms. Dao wait.

281
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,240
Ms. Dao, Ms. Dao listen to Thong first.

282
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,480
Ms. Thong, go back first.

283
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,360
The more she did that, the angrier Ms. Dao became.

284
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,600
Please.

285
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,760
Jacki, bring the movie "Castle of Desire"

286
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,520
Return to broadcast this Friday.

287
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,480
And tell the public relations department to promote Thongprakai

288
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,840
that the real person is a lovely, kind person,

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,240
Completely different from the movie.

290
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,120
Let's let everyone in the country know.

291
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,920
Let her be famous to the highest level.

292
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,400
As for the next promotion plan, I will report again.

293
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,240
Next program, please watch the movie "Castle of Desire".

294
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,360
Today the first episode airs.

295
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,960
[Castle of Desire]

296
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,480
If I want a promotion...

297
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,920
So who should I sleep with?

298
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,520
- Look at this girl. - What is it?

299
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,640
Don't rush into shock.

300
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,360
There are many more shocking things.

301
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,920
Finally, who is it?

302
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,320
will help me

303
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,840
reach the top position?

304
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,080
Oh.

305
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,720
Linin is so bold, but he could be even bolder.

306
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,840
She is so hot, the whole chili garden is not as good as Linin.

307
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,880
Let's give Linin the Calamine, she's itching.

308
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,120
If I were as beautiful as Linin, I would do the same.

309
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,640
Who is the female lead? Great acting.

310
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
Can it be changed to "The Burning Castle"?

311
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,800
 There is no movie hotter than movies right now

312
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,880
 "The Castle of Desire" is here again.

313
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,640
Top 1 Twitter trend for four consecutive days.

314
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,200
The rating soared to 9.5.

315
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,400
Highest within three years.

316
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,880
 Audiences can watch news about the movie

317
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,160
 at Sod Oh Seet show.

318
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,960
Host, Yem Yorada, investigative reporter,

319
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,320
who will dig deeper into the investigation

320
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,800
to give the audience all the details first.

321
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,320
Don't miss it.

322
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,160
I have news to report, Thong.

323
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,120
What's so exciting? Win the lottery?

324
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,560
It's more than winning the lottery.

325
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,480
Guess who's calling?

326
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,840
Alien.

327
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,760
What crazy aliens?

328
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,640
Customer calls.

329
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,400
There is the Spicy condom brand,

330
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,280
There is the birth control pill Anna,

331
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,120
Neko brand "little girl" washing soap

332
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,800
and Shiny anti-dark spot cream

333
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,560
Contact me if you want me to be your representative.

334
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,760
But what product is that?

335
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,600
Oh.

336
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,320
Those products pay millions of dollars.

337
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,240
Really?

338
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,840
YES.

339
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,600
Millions too?

340
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,200
YES.

341
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,240
Oh.

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,680
Stop.

343
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,600
Sorry, congratulations.

344
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
No need to congratulate me, my anger is still not over.

345
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,520
This time clearly state the exact amount.

346
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,680
When to pay, please write clearly.

347
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,240
I'm not stupid again.

348
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,360
Okay, go shower, change clothes and go to work.

349
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,520
Hey, there's an interview this afternoon.

350
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,080
There's also Ms. Dao.

351
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,280
This,

352
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,960
Are you nervous about making your first media debut?

353
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
No need to be nervous.

354
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,240
I will be by your side.

355
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,000
If any question cannot be answered

356
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,880
then I will help.

357
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Em Chris.

358
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,000
- Yes. - Let's go film a video with fans,

359
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,280
Let them help me promote my image.

360
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,120
Okay. I'll come back later.

361
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,240
Older brother,

362
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,240
Where is Dao?

363
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,720
Haven't arrived yet? It's almost interview time.

364
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,720
Ms. Dao is preparing in her room.

365
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,720
Wait to see you at the interview microphone.

366
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,840
Since what happened,

367
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,440
Ms. Dao refused to talk to me.

368
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,920
Prepare for an interview without meeting each other first.

369
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,960
If she talked about it...

370
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
No need to worry,

371
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,920
Ms. Dao won't ruin anything.

372
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,640
What about you? Have you talked to her yet?

373
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,640
What are you talking about?

374
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,000
We haven't talked since then.

375
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,000
Meeting each other is also because of this event.

376
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,840
Come on.

377
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,240
I will stay close to Thong.

378
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,880
I'll check the situation, if it's not okay

379
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,600
Then I'll come in and pull you out.

380
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,960
Chris, wait.

381
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,240
Jack, I'm hungry.

382
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,720
Can I go get something to eat first?

383
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,280
So go quickly, then come over to my place.

384
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,800
Thank you.

385
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,400
Everyone, get ready.

386
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,600
Let's start now.

387
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,880
Let's ask Chris and Thong first,

388
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,320
The movie's broadcast is so explosive, how do you two feel?

389
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,320
I'm very happy in my heart.

390
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
We tried very hard,

391
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,760
so when you know people like movies,

392
00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:53,946
we are very happy.

393
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,240
So what about Thong?

394
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
I'm startled.

395
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
Nowadays, wherever we go, people call us Linin.

396
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,320
so I'm still not used to it.

397
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,960
Ask Ms. Dao.

398
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,480
Everyone who mentioned Linin said that

399
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,160
Find an actor who is very suitable for the role.

400
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,440
Where did Miss Dao get Thong from?

401
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,160
You have to ask Dam about this.

402
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,840
Dam is the one who recruited her.

403
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,920
She didn't know, didn't see what they did.

404
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,920
Dam, please tell me.

405
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,480
Actually

406
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
as usual,

407
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,200
I followed the steps.

408
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,880
The modeling agency sent her,

409
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
so we rechecked the script a bit

410
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,640
and saw that she was capable,

411
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,920
I'm sure he'll play this role well, that's why

412
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,960
Bring it to Ms. Dao to meet.

413
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,240
And Ms. Dao is the one who decides for herself

414
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,920
Let her take the role of Linin.

415
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,800
That's right.

416
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,000
Ms. Dao was the one who chose Thong.

417
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,080
Thong must thank Ms. Dao very much.

418
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
For giving the opportunity, plus

419
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,720
treated Thong very well.

420
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,520
If so

421
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,560
Thong did something wrong then Thong...

422
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,200
Sorry, Ms. Dao.

423
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,200
No need to apologize.

424
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,080
I believe that everything Thong does, he uses reason.

425
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,320
Think carefully

426
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,800
and comes from your real effort.

427
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,880
So no matter what the result is

428
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,200
then we just need to accept it.

429
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,840
There's no need to regret it.

430
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,160
- Ask Chris. - Yes.

431
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,360
Being able to work with a new female lead like this,

432
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,200
Did you encounter any difficulties?

433
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,680
I must say it's very fun.

434
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,800
Thong is very good at acting.

435
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,120
Really good.

436
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,400
Mr. B!

437
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,840
Do you find that Ms. Dao speaks strangely?

438
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,280
It sounds like nothing.

439
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,120
But the attitude is scary.

440
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,800
Do I think too much?

441
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,200
The movie is so famous,

442
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,600
She won't harm me.

443
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,560
Mr. B! Em Thong!

444
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,880
Are you two planning on going anywhere next?

445
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,960
Because it's urgent.

446
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,120
Not going anywhere.

447
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,040
Where do you want us to go?

448
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Come join the live show "Sod Oh Seet".

449
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
So let's meet at the studio at 6 o'clock.

450
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,440
It starts at 7 o'clock.

451
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,680
Okay.

452
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,920
Oh.

453
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,080
- This program is good. - Mr. B!

454
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,480
The host of this show

455
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Yem Yorada, right?

456
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes, what's wrong?

457
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,360
Can I not participate?

458
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
You can join anything, except that program.

459
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,440
Hey, Thong!

460
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,920
Not famous yet, already a lot of talk.

461
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,400
Such a big program, how can you not go?

462
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,480
The station has the most viewers, and it also broadcasts during prime time.

463
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,440
How could I miss it?

464
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,480
I had an affair with Yem before.

465
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,600
He knows I used to work at Mr. Bun's bar

466
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,160
and was also Inspector Mit's chicken.

467
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,240
Dead!

468
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,880
Oh.

469
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,080
Next time, say it first.

470
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,000
Bait!

471
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,320
Are you ready?

472
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,240
I'm ready, Ms. Dao.

473
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,240
Yem have been waiting for this day for a long time.

474
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,240
Thank you very much, Ms. Dao.

475
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,800
For giving this responsibility to Yem.

476
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,840
I have to thank you too.

477
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,120
Because it appeared at the right time.

478
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,560
Do your best.

479
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
No need to be respectful because Thong is the main female character of the station.

480
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,400
This is your order.

481
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,400
If anyone has a problem, I will solve it myself.

482
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,360
Okay, Ms. Dao.

483
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,400
Yem will not disappoint Ms. Dao.

484
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,480
- Thank you. - Yes.

485
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,440
No matter what happens

486
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,840
Don't make trouble, don't curse, don't be rude.

487
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,320
And don't scream loudly.

488
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,320
Just cry

489
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,320
and just act pitiful.

490
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,760
Others will be merciful.

491
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I will try.

492
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,080
Hello, Thong.

493
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,080
Thongprakai.

494
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,560
Is that the right name for you?

495
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,760
Right.

496
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,600
Have we known each other before?

497
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,320
Why does the face look so familiar?

498
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,320
Miss Yem.

499
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,560
I think we should talk properly.

500
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I know it's Yem

501
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,000
knew something about Thong.

502
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,600
But

503
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,600
something Ms. Yem knows

504
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,880
You shouldn't say it in public.

505
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,560
Yem won't say anything.

506
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
Yem is the host.

507
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,600
Yem's job is just to ask questions.

508
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,840
As for Thong, answer the truth or lie

509
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,840
Well, it's up to her.

510
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,360
If you want to ask anything, just ask.

511
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,172
Think I don't dare answer?

512
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,320
Thong.

513
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,600
Calm.

514
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,520
Think about reputation and work.

515
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,000
Come on.

516
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,760
Well, come on.

517
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,160
Hello.

518
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,600
This is the show "Sod Oh Seet" and I am Yem Yorada.

519
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,160
Today Yem will let everyone meet the beautiful actress

520
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,840
that everyone's been interested in lately,

521
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,240
she is Linin, the film's female lead

522
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,800
"Castle of Desire".

523
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,200
Today Yem will clearly expose...

524
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,640
Oh, to invite her for an interview.

525
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,160
Everyone will know

526
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,280
What is her true self?

527
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,600
Alright.

528
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,120
Everyone is welcome to meet

529
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,640
younger brother Thong, Thongprakai Jarasruedee,

530
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,800
or as Linin in the movie "The Castle of Desire".

531
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,560
- Hello. - Hello.

532
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,720
Please sit down.

533
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,880
In real life

534
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Even more beautiful than in the movies.

535
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,200
It's even more beautiful in the refrigerator.

536
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,080
Oh my god, just coming here is already funny.

537
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,760
If so then

538
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,080
Ms. Yem, please allow me to come to the first question.

539
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,840
Because the audience watching the station is very curious

540
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,080
Thong in real life and Linin

541
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,480
are similar

542
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,600
about perspective

543
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,280
Are you comfortable with sex?

544
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,800
There is also a bit of similarity.

545
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,640
Linin has a relaxed concept of sex.

546
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,320
Anyone can do that, it's normal.

547
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,200
Thong also thinks so.

548
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,960
So in the movie,

549
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,040
Linin uses sex to get ahead in life,

550
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,440
What does Thong think about this point?

551
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,440
That's her right.

552
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,440
She's capable of that

553
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,760
Just use it for good purposes.

554
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
That's really bold.

555
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,800
So in real life,

556
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Does Thong do the same?

557
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,960
The movie emerges

558
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,240
It's not because Thong slept with anyone.

559
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,920
Movies like that

560
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,280
It's because people like Thong's acting.

561
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,440
Also means

562
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,920
Thong goes up with real strength.

563
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,720
Everything said has a reason.

564
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,720
Next question.

565
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,440
In the movie,

566
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,440
Linin has many husbands, right?

567
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,480
What period of time has Thong experienced in his life?

568
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,320
but can play the role so well?

569
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,560
Thong has a lover,

570
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,000
a lot of people.

571
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,120
But...

572
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,640
Get to know each person at their own stage.

573
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,960
Didn't see anything strange at all.

574
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,320
Ms. Yem is also a beautiful person.

575
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,040
must have passed through the hands of men,

576
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,200
Have you ever experienced having many lovers?

577
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,640
Also met a few people.

578
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,760
But probably not as much as Thong.

579
00:32:06,996 --> 00:32:11,102
THE ROSE OF SIN
