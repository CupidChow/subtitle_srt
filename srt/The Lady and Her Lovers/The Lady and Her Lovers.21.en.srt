Episode 21

10
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,767
Save me, don't let them take me away.

11
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:07,087
Calm down, I'll handle it.

12
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:08,487
Get out of the car.

13
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:11,487
Get out of the car.

14
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:14,607
Hands up!

15
00:01:16,087 --> 00:01:17,567
I told you to raise your hand.

16
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:19,847
Let's talk slowly, policeman...

17
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,167
Why don't you talk slowly?

18
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:26,567
You're really good.

19
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,367
How dare you rob my boss's people.

20
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:30,247
I'm sorry,

21
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:33,127
- I just want... - Just want?

22
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:35,527
Want it?

23
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:38,487
This is what you want? Want it?

24
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:40,887
You're really good, really good.

25
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:43,047
You're really good, very good.

26
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:44,887
Damned!

27
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:47,007
Stop it, stop it.

28
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:52,247
Stop it, stop it.

29
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:53,487
Stop it.

30
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:55,167
Enough, enough.

31
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:55,927
Enough?

32
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:56,607
Enough.

33
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:02,047
The person who loves Thong the most

34
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:04,247
will take Thong home.

35
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:07,367
Obediently go home with me.

36
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,607
Thong will come back to you,

37
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:14,167
But can you tell your people to stop?

38
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,567
I'll go get my bag.

39
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:24,727
Then get in your car.

40
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,567
I still really like your band

41
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,327
and still want to listen to music from your band.

42
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:42,807
So today I let you go.

43
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:46,167
But if you want to live and follow music for a long time

44
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:48,327
Then don't touch me anymore.

45
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:52,527
Get in the car.

46
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:45,087
Thong closes his eyes.

47
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:49,687
What for?

48
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:51,207
Just keep aiming.

49
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:16,927
What is this?

50
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:19,607
I already told Thong.

51
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:21,607
I love Thong the most.

52
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:24,807
He will marry Thong.

53
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:27,847
Marry Thong?

54
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:30,967
So what about the other women?

55
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:33,087
In what capacity will they live with us?

56
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:35,247
Domestic worker.

57
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:37,367
Maid?

58
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:39,567
But don't tell anyone, Thong.

59
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,407
That he will marry Thong.

60
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:43,607
He doesn't want others to be heartbroken.

61
00:04:44,447 --> 00:04:47,047
And don't let anyone see this ring, Thong.

62
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,607
Please keep it carefully.

63
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,527
Other people will be jealous of Thong if they see it.

64
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,887
I don't want it to be noisy in the house.

65
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:58,247
Keep it a secret, only the two of us know.

66
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:03,607
If you don't want Thong to talk about this to anyone

67
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:05,887
How can Thong be sure?

68
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:08,287
that you won't give this ring to someone else?

69
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,047
Stay with me

70
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:12,967
then don't doubt me.

71
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:15,767
Just listen to whatever you say.

72
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,327
Hey, good baby.

73
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:24,327
Yes.

74
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:26,207
Thong will believe you.

75
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,287
Now, let's talk about today.

76
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,127
Regarding Thong's escape,

77
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,327
He wanted Thong to reflect on himself.

78
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:39,647
What does Thong think?

79
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:46,447
It's Thong's fault for not trusting him.

80
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:49,287
It's okay to know what you're doing wrong.

81
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:52,807
So what should the wrongdoer do?

82
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:59,527
Thong will punish himself by staying in this room and not going anywhere.

83
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,367
If Thong wanted that, he would agree with Thong.

84
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:06,367
I don't want to force anyone.

85
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,807
I hope Thong will punish himself quickly.

86
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:15,607
My talented girl.

87
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,287
Wake up!

88
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:47,167
What are you doing here?

89
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:49,247
Then I'll bring you rice to eat.

90
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:53,127
Being a nanny and a maid at the same time is so annoying.

91
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:55,687
Can you help me stay still and not cause trouble?

92
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,047
So I don't have to be tired.

93
00:06:57,047 --> 00:06:59,207
Having to worry about your business every day is a burden.

94
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:00,607
3 kila, maruee, mamie, milae, milae, milae, milae, milae, milae, milae, milae, milae, milae, milae, milae, milae, milae, milae

95
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,287
I ask you something.

96
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:06,167
Have any of you guys received a ring from Mit?

97
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:08,487
Who doesn't have it?

98
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:10,487
And even get married to become his wife.

99
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,047
Secret, only the two of you know.

100
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:15,407
There, see? No one can get married.

101
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:17,847
I can't understand him.

102
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:20,647
Think this method is effective?

103
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:23,487
Hey, but don't say anything to him.

104
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:26,487
Just play dumb and pretend to believe him.

105
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,887
Let him be proud of his intelligence.

106
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,847
The better his mood, the nicer he is.

107
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:34,087
If he knew we were playing tricks on him

108
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,087
then he will lose face and become less kind, do you understand?

109
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,087
Is that all men can do?

110
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:42,327
Well, what day is today?

111
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,727
The first day you were locked up, you idiot!

112
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:46,767
What day do I mean, you crazy person!

113
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,167
Some kind of Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.

114
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,967
I don't have a phone, I'm so locked up that I forget the date.

115
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:53,487
Monday, you idiot!

116
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,767
Thanks, you slut!

117
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:07,535
[Monday]

118
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:23,847
Do you scoop your own rice?

119
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,527
Remember to plug in the power to heat it up.

120
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:30,407
You woke up late today, where did you go yesterday?

121
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:34,967
Who are you?

122
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,087
Mom, it's Mont, it's your child.

123
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,127
It made my mother completely startled.

124
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:42,927
What crazy game are you playing, Mont?

125
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,287
Mom, I'm not playing.

126
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,167
I'm trying out a cool style for acting.

127
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:48,087
Here, isn't it cool?

128
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:52,207
What the hell is cool? Looks like a bunch of thieves.

129
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:54,727
Oh, Mom, you don't understand today's youth.

130
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,967
I'll go first, I'll bring the rice to the dining room, Mom.

131
00:08:57,967 --> 00:08:59,607
So why not eat at the dining table?

132
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,927
What if you bring it to the dining room and then the whole bedroom gets dirty?

133
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:21,367
Mom.

134
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,447
Mom should knock on the door first.

135
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:26,447
Mont, what's wrong with your face?

136
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:28,727
It's nothing mom, it's just a little problem.

137
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,087
Open it for mom to see right away.

138
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:42,767
This is no longer called a little bit anymore.

139
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:44,607
What's wrong with you?

140
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,207
Last night the customers at the bar were drunk.

141
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:50,407
So let's have a little chat with each other.

142
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,287
But it's been resolved, it's okay.

143
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:55,527
Men and boys are like that, mom, fighting is normal.

144
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:57,207
Mom, don't make a big deal out of it.

145
00:09:58,087 --> 00:09:59,927
Mom told me before.

146
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,607
Don't work in places like that. It's not good.

147
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:06,127
It's a gathering place for bad people.

148
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,767
Being drunk will make people lose their morality.

149
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:14,007
Quit your job and find a better job.

150
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:16,007
Just like normal people.

151
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:19,807
Mom, Mont won't talk to you about this anymore.

152
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:21,447
We're done talking about this.

153
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,767
Mont loves this job.

154
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:27,327
And Mont won't let anyone force Mont to take time off work.

155
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:32,327
Let Mont be more careful next time.

156
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,647
Have you gone to the police yet?

157
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:40,087
What are you doing, mom? The police can't do anything either.

158
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,487
If the police can't help

159
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:45,287
So who should people rely on?

160
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:47,847
Either way, I have to go to the police.

161
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,247
At least keep a daily record.

162
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:52,687
What if they come back to harm me?

163
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,687
Honey, I'm sure

164
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:05,447
person whose illegal detention you are reporting

165
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,487
and the attacker is Inspector Mit?

166
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,847
Do you have any questions?

167
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:13,487
You've asked this question over and over again.

168
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:16,207
Why don't you take the time to search his house?

169
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:17,207
It takes too much time.

170
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:19,607
If you can't find anything, come back and get me

171
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:21,527
for the crime of making false statements.

172
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:26,327
Don't be impatient, I'm just asking to make sure

173
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:29,567
that I want to face the consequences, that's all.

174
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:30,687
This.

175
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:33,167
Sure, then sign it.

176
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,047
I'll send someone to search.

177
00:11:46,487 --> 00:11:49,287
Thank you, please let me know if you find anything.

178
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:50,767
Yes, boss.

179
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,207
Thank you.

180
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,967
That kid came to report to arrest Inspector Mit.

181
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:07,047
Really?

182
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:09,207
Yeah, who does he think he is?

183
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,807
Mr. Mit, Mr. Mit.

184
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:19,967
Mr. Mit.

185
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,567
- Are you back? Are you tired? - Mr. Mit.

186
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:24,527
Mr. Mit.

187
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:27,887
Mr. Mit, today we are making cookies,

188
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:30,287
Be busy all day to be successful.

189
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:31,367
That's right.

190
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,887
Mit, would you like to try it?

191
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:34,647
If you like, we will make it for you to eat too.

192
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:37,127
- That's right. - Yes, it looks delicious.

193
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
Thank you very much everyone.

194
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:41,727
So let's put it there, I'll ask permission to go up and see Thong first.

195
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,647
Mr. Mit.

196
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,287
Mr. Mit.

197
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:50,327
Older brother...

198
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,407
Are you back?

199
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:11,407
What's wrong with Thong?

200
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:13,167
Why are you crying?

201
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,047
Thong was alone in the room all day.

202
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:21,127
Thong is lonely.

203
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:24,287
But...

204
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:27,727
It's okay.

205
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:30,967
Thong will reconsider himself

206
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:33,767
about the mistakes that Thong did.

207
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:39,607
Oh, how pitiful, my lover.

208
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:43,527
Anyway, please quickly realize your mistake.

209
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,287
This will be remembered as a lesson, so as not to make mistakes again.

210
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:55,327
Thank you for your valuable teaching.

211
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:59,367
You are a very good thinker,

212
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:01,367
have maturity.

213
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:03,287
Thong likes

214
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,247
The times you reminded me to teach me, Thong.

215
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:08,567
Sure.

216
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,767
Stars on your shoulders

217
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:14,007
It's not because you're lucky, it's all because of your skills.

218
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:16,207
You are number one in that class.

219
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:19,207
Oh, that's great.

220
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:22,007
Thong is very proud

221
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,607
when you become my wife.

222
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:29,007
Police uniforms are clothes that all women want to iron.

223
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:33,847
I hope Thong will be blessed to iron your clothes.

224
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,527
Okay, honey.

225
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:38,767
So let's go buy something delicious for you to eat.

226
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,007
Thank you.

227
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:47,447
Thong is happy to be here.

228
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:21,847
What's wrong? Do you like it?

229
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:25,487
Just like every time.

230
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,087
I mean Malee is as good as always.

231
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,127
Every time I like it.

232
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:42,287
How is Thong today? Is there any problem?

233
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:53,847
Can't you stop caring about Thong for an hour?

234
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,367
You're lying with Malee.

235
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,527
What did you ask her for?

236
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:03,527
Oh, Malee, because Thong is having problems

237
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,527
So you have to pay special attention to her.

238
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:09,807
But that doesn't mean he doesn't care about Malee.

239
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,487
I care about Malee no less than Thong.

240
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:17,647
Want one more?

241
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:22,007
To feel how much he liked Malee.

242
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:38,007
Why doesn't Mit come down for breakfast?

243
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:39,367
Has anyone called him yet?

244
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:41,567
I called upstairs just now.

245
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,567
Mit is talking to Thong.

246
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:46,167
Thong, Thong, Thong.

247
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,447
Why are there all Thong's names in this house?

248
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:50,847
Makes me feel like that's the landlord or my mother.

249
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:53,047
What's wrong with you?

250
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,527
It's not like you said you wanted it here

251
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:58,607
so you can take revenge on him? So have you taken revenge on him yet?

252
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:01,167
Not yet. It just makes me feel uncomfortable.

253
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,007
Just hearing its name makes me nauseous.

254
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:06,447
Oh, Mit is here.

255
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,207
Thong said he was hungry.

256
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,087
Can you bring rice to Thong?

257
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:16,607
She wants to drink coconut water too.

258
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:21,007
Malee. Can I go buy coconut water for Thong?

259
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,447
I have to go to work.

260
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:26,567
If anything happens, I'll call to check on Thong's situation.

261
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:27,567
Please go first.

262
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:43,167
What's wrong with you?

263
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,779
[Monday - First Day]

264
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:56,167
Wait.

265
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,247
I have something to tell you.

266
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:01,767
Just seeing your face makes me itch all over.

267
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:02,927
Who wants to talk to you?

268
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,087
In this lunch box,

269
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:07,327
Have you quit smoking?

270
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,767
Who wants to quit smoking?

271
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,767
If I quit smoking, Mit will kick me to death.

272
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:14,567
Yes, that's right.

273
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:17,727
Because Mit loves me more than you.

274
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:23,847
Thong.

275
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:24,887
I told Mit.

276
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:40,862
 [Gaming is illegal]

277
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,487
 I'm here, I'm here.

 [Playing cards is illegal] See!

279
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,372
Get out of the way so I can sit, get out of the way.

280
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,167
Oh, this one.

281
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,567
Did you get bitten by an ant or something that made you dizzy?

282
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:53,687
What's wrong with you?

283
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:56,727
Because of Thong, he made me crazy, but I couldn't do anything to him.

284
00:18:58,007 --> 00:18:59,167
You just wait,

285
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:01,927
When I find a way to get revenge, you will surely die.

286
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:05,607
This! Someone go buy coconut water for him, please.

287
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:07,207
I don't want to be his child.

288
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:08,967
You.

289
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:10,487
I'm going to wash the dishes.

290
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,207
I'm going to wash the glasses.

291
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:14,607
I have a lot of clothes, I'm going to wash them.

292
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:15,847
I'm going to dry my clothes.

293
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:17,007
I'm going to iron my clothes.

294
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:18,687
Ah... I'm going to sew clothes.

295
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:19,687
Oh! I...

296
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:23,367
I can't stand it anymore, I'm so sad.

297
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:27,687
Oh, I'll be back in a bit, I'm about to go crazy.

298
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:30,407
These bastards have all escaped.

299
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,527
So who will buy it for him now? It's me, no one else.

300
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:53,087
Hey lady.

301
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:56,767
Is that you? What did you come here for?

302
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:59,407
Don't tell me you're coming to help Thong, okay?

303
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,847
That's right, can you help take Thong out?

304
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:03,927
It's fine to take her to the gate, then I'll take her away.

305
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:05,767
No one can help it.

306
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:08,807
And I don't want to help him either, you go home.

307
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,247
Wait, miss.

308
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,247
It's illegal to detain people in a house like that.

309
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:15,927
That means you support that illegal person, you know?

310
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,247
Breaking the law?

311
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:22,087
Mr. Mit

312
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:25,167
is the law. And you quickly go away,

313
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:27,167
If not, I'll tell Mit to deal with you.

314
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,007
Go or not go?

315
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,687
Miss... Listen to me.

316
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:34,687
When we meet difficult people

317
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,007
Then we have to help, right?

318
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,727
Because we all have humanity in us.

319
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:41,687
Stop, don't talk like this, I'm tickled.

320
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:45,447
I'm not human, I'm a devil.

321
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:47,847
If you still want to be human

322
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,327
then don't get involved in this.

323
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:52,527
Otherwise, you will definitely become a ghost.

324
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:58,247
But if you help her then you will receive that merit.

325
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:16,367
Yesterday you said you had something to tell me.

326
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:18,887
Come on, tell me.

327
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:21,727
You said you didn't want to talk.

328
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:24,127
So today I want to talk.

329
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:25,807
What do you want? Talk or not?

330
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:30,407
I want to tell you...

331
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:34,247
I just want to say that I'm in this house

332
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,447
No use to you, right?

333
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:39,567
Mr. Mit took time to pay attention to me

334
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,327
while that time is with you.

335
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:44,367
And you have to take care of me

336
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:47,207
Instead, you can stay in peace and comfort.

337
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,367
I'm so touched by this.

338
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:52,647
Today I talk to you

339
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:56,047
Because I have a plan to kick you out of the house.

340
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:58,127
Really?

341
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,167
I'm not hard of hearing, right? Are you willing to help me?

342
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:03,167
I won't help you.

343
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,367
I just want to get rid of you and get it over with.

344
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:08,007
You can call it whatever you want. Thank you very much.

345
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:12,087
You hug me, I get goosebumps.

346
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,167
I have a plan to help you.

347
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:17,127
Are you going today?

348
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:20,767
Are not. I will go tomorrow. Friday night.

349
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,047
I jump in the water.

350
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:37,687
- Illusion. - Let's dance.

351
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:40,327
What's your swaying position?

352
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:43,607
Mr. Mit.

353
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:45,647
Would you like to come play in the water with us?

354
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:47,647
Mr. Mit.

355
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:54,607
Oh.

00:22:55,247 --> 00:22:55,647
Mr. Mit.

357
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:57,047
Where are you going, Mit?

358
00:22:58,007 --> 00:22:58,527
Mr. Mit.

359
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:01,207
Mit, are you angry at Malee?

360
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:02,247
Mr. Mit.

361
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:02,807
This.

362
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:03,527
Except.

363
00:23:04,527 --> 00:23:06,727
I think Mit must be looking for that Thong.

364
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:09,087
Self-locked, self-remembering, true gangster style.

365
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:12,087
I can't stand it anymore.

366
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:14,207
Since I lived in this house,

367
00:23:15,247 --> 00:23:17,847
I only slept with Mit once, guys.

368
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:20,887
And Thong

369
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,247
Meet morning, noon, and night.

370
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:24,887
I'm so bored.

371
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:29,567
Can you hold off a bit?

372
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:31,047
Tomorrow it will go too.

373
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:32,807
From now on,

374
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:34,607
Mr. Mit will be ours,

375
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:35,967
No need to share with Thong anymore.

376
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:37,687
You're right.

377
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:40,727
So are you sure your plan will succeed?

378
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,847
That depends on how smoothly you can act.

379
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:00,847
Dear Thong.

380
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:03,247
Wake up.

381
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:07,327
Mr. Mit.

382
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,367
What's wrong?

383
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:15,247
Thong once said that

384
00:24:16,607 --> 00:24:17,767
Thong doesn't love Bun,

385
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:19,487
but Thong loves him.

386
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:20,727
Right?

387
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:24,727
That's right.

388
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:27,447
So that means in this case,

389
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:30,807
you win, Mr. Bun,

390
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:32,047
right?

391
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:35,527
That's right.

392
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:38,167
But actually,

393
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:41,567
The detective beat him on everything.

394
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:43,407
Like the face

395
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:44,527
also more handsome,

396
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:47,327
Personality and speaking tone are also more polite.

397
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:48,887
One more thing is

398
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,527
you are an inspector,

399
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:53,087
Why are you comparing yourself to a drug dealer?

400
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:58,127
It's important

401
00:24:59,207 --> 00:24:59,967
that

402
00:25:00,727 --> 00:25:02,327
you are also better than him.

403
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:04,167
Both in size,

404
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:05,927
both posture.

405
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:07,527
Really?

406
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:09,647
Is Thong telling the truth?

407
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:11,247
Really.

408
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:13,487
You are the best.

409
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:16,007
That's why Thong loves him so much.

410
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,247
I also love Thong very much.

411
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:25,687
Now Thong understands that

412
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,727
the man in front of Thong

413
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:29,887
is the best person, right?

414
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:33,127
No need to look for anyone else in this world anymore.

415
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:40,767
Yes.

416
00:25:42,327 --> 00:25:44,207
Thong won't go looking for anyone else.

417
00:25:46,047 --> 00:25:47,527
Thong is the only one.

418
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:56,167
[It's the 7th day]

419
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,207
Eat so you can have strength tonight.

420
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:21,767
This place probably has enough money for the car.

421
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:24,047
Thank.

422
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:26,567
So did you tell the others to prepare?

423
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:28,727
That said.

424
00:26:29,327 --> 00:26:31,007
Everyone knows the plan, it's just a matter of time.

425
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:35,567
Except.

426
00:26:36,447 --> 00:26:37,647
I hope it's you and me

427
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:39,207
won't have to see each other again.

428
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:43,167
It's a good goodbye.

429
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:45,327
So I hope this life

430
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,807
You and I don't have to meet again,

431
00:26:48,447 --> 00:26:49,047
Thong.

432
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:09,447
Guys, it's time.

433
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:10,927
Get ready.

434
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:22,367
Hey guys.

435
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:23,847
Thong is about to run away.

436
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:25,687
Catch it, don't let it escape.

437
00:27:25,807 --> 00:27:26,687
Hurry up!

438
00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:28,967
Quick, catch it.

439
00:27:29,007 --> 00:27:29,847
Hurry up!

440
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:31,967
Stop, don't run away.

441
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:34,007
- Catch it. - Let go.

442
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:35,807
Let me go, let me go...

443
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:38,527
Don't come here.

444
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:39,607
Don't come here, guys.

445
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:40,567
Stay away.

446
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:41,727
Catch it again.

447
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,287
Let me out.

448
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:46,207
Let me go, let me go.

449
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:47,647
You leave me alone.

450
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:50,567
Thong.

451
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:52,007
Why are you slapping so hard?

452
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:57,647
Oh, Thong.

453
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,607
Chase it.

454
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:01,127
Thong.

455
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:02,407
You stop right now.

456
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,087
It has escaped.

457
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:09,087
Thong.

458
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:10,567
Thong, come back here.

459
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:13,087
Thong, where are you hiding? Thong...

460
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:14,287
Don't come here.

461
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:17,727
Thong.

462
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:18,367
Oh.

463
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,007
Quickly chase it, it runs away.

464
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,727
Oh.

465
00:28:26,327 --> 00:28:27,087
Stupid people.

466
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,527
Who opened the door to let it escape?

467
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:31,687
Ladies, charge up!

468
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:34,167
Thong.

469
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:35,127
Thong.

470
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,407
Thong, come back.

471
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:40,087
Thong.

472
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:41,847
Where is Thong going?

473
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:43,767
Where are you going?

474
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:46,447
Thong, come back.

475
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,447
Thong, come back.

476
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:50,487
Thong.

477
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:52,407
Thong.

478
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:55,487
There are no cameras here anymore.

479
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:22,087
Great!

480
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:32,847
You,

481
00:29:32,927 --> 00:29:34,047
let's go home.

482
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:35,407
I think so

483
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:38,687
Now Mit has seen everything through the surveillance camera in the house.

484
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:39,927
We

485
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:42,727
certainly not exposed to us

486
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:45,127
- performed very well. - Acted very well.

487
00:29:47,487 --> 00:29:50,327
Girls, let's go.

488
00:29:51,007 --> 00:29:51,567
Everybody.

489
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:53,127
The house is taller, right?

490
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:54,207
Because of Thong

491
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:56,407
- aggravates the soil. - Heavy soil.

492
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:02,847
How is that possible?

493
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:05,567
So many people but can't catch even one person?

494
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:07,207
Mr. Mit.

495
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:09,287
She is very strong.

496
00:30:09,727 --> 00:30:11,407
Slap Malee twice.

497
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:13,527
I see stars flying away.

498
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:17,127
I wonder what she hid in her bag.

499
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:18,047
Take a swing,

500
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:20,527
hit me and was about to fly away.

501
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:22,047
- That's right. - That's right.

502
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:24,247
- Fly away. - Fly away.

503
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:26,167
Then I saw it

504
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,407
How did she escape?

505
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:28,687
Is anyone coming to pick me up?

506
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,567
She got in a taxi.

507
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:33,527
We followed.

508
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:34,487
But

509
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,807
couldn't keep up.

510
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:38,087
- That's right. - That's right.

511
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:39,967
- Can't keep up. - Can't keep up.

512
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:46,007
Hello.

513
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:48,087
Contact the traffic police for me.

514
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:50,527
I'm looking for a taxi.

515
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:54,127
I want to see all the cameras on my street.

516
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:55,550
Right now.

517
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:41,492
THE ROSE OF SIN
