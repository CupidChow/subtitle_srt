1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,360
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,765
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,560
 Yes, what's wrong?

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,800
EH? Did he drive himself?

5
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,240
Yes, I'll take Ms. Thong there and then go pick you up.

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,000
What's wrong?

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,880
Suddenly Mr. Prajak drove himself home again,

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,800
then left the driver at the hotel.

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,640
So he called me to pick him up.

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,160
He has a meeting, right?

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,320
Why go home?

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,320
I don't know either.

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,280
But the strange thing is

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,680
He drove himself and left the driver at the hotel.

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,480
Sir, turn the car around. Take Thong home for a bit.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,880
Thong wants to talk to him.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,920
No way.

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,840
He ordered me to take you to the motel.

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,000
Stop the car, bro, stop the car.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,680
Stop the car.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,120
Don't, Miss Thong.

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,960
Stop the car now. Stop the car.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,600
- Don't, Miss Thong, don't. - Stop the car.

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,840
Get off the bus. Get down.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,720
What is Miss Thong planning to do?

26
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,720
Miss Thong.

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,520
Wait, Miss Thong.

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,440
Hearing this smell reminds me of Ben, Ben likes this smell.

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,600
The wind and waves have calmed down,

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,280
The house is so quiet that it feels scary.

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,840
Ben's not here either.

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,240
Ms. Thong also left. The lady looks lonely.

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,840
That's good, bro.

34
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,160
A quiet house is better than a loud argument.

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,280
What she said is also correct.

36
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Uncle.

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,160
Yes.

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,240
These are the things the boss asked me to buy.

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,960
Go buy it now.

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,000
As for you, go with me, because there's a lot of stuff.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,720
Wouldn't it be better to have this much stuff sent to the person who sent it to you?

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,200
If we all leave, there will be no one at home to take care of the lady.

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,240
It's the boss's order,

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,040
As for the lady, I will take care of her.

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,240
Let's go.

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,520
Yeah, yeah.

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,400
How's it going?

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,160
There's no one at home now.

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
Except the lady is in the room.

50
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,280
Let's get started.

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,440
You're not here, I'm worried that I'm lonely,

52
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,840
Should you come here and talk to me?

53
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,560
Correct.

54
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,920
And this is the last time we talk.

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,160
We have talked about divorce many times.

56
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,360
If she had known from the beginning, she would have divorced me

57
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,480
then what happened today would not have happened.

58
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,000
Nong!

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,600
I need to.

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,200
Before, you said you also saw my good side

61
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,600
in the matter of me maintaining this marriage.

62
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,280
You said you wouldn't hate me.

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,320
Thank you

64
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,160
and I'm sorry for what happened.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,360
So why are you doing this to me today?

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,880
That's the only way

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
Let Thong be with me.

68
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,000
And I don't need to be cautious either

69
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,240
Because I'm afraid you'll find out more about me.

70
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,840
Any last wishes?

71
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Don't think you're better than others.

72
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,200
Someone with a nature like yours,

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,040
One day you will get the reward you deserve.

74
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Forgive me, Nong!

75
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,960
Uncle Sai!

76
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,040
Is anyone here? Open the door for me!

77
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,720
Please allow me, ma'am!

78
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,920
Oh.

79
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,800
Don't think you're the only evil person.

80
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,440
While he was plotting murder

81
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,600
people are also plotting to kill him.

82
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,480
I also know

83
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,200
that when this mission is finished,

84
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,280
you will plan to kill me too.

85
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,400
But my condolences,

86
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,280
I tried to kill you first.

87
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,840
This bastard.

88
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,720
Lady,

89
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,320
I thought it was not wrong to cooperate with her.

90
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,080
That's right.

91
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,840
Thank you very much too, Lom.

92
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,840
I'm sorry, Jak,

93
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,440
Because I can't hug you goodbye

94
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,840
Just like you hugged me goodbye.

95
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,120
Do you have any last words?

96
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,200
You two

97
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,120
You also have to go to hell with me.

98
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,320
Mr. Jak, Mr. Jak. What happened?

99
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,560
Why are you like this? Mr. Jak, Mr. Jak.

100
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Lady, lady!

101
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,440
Lady!

102
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,880
Lady.

103
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,200
Thong.

104
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,080
Mr. Jak.

105
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,040
That's all he can do.

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,880
I wish Thong happiness.

107
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,560
Are not.

108
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,920
Mr. Jak.

109
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,680
No, Mr. Jak.

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,640
Mr. Jak.

111
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,640
Mr. Jak.

112
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Help me put this box in the car.

113
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,160
What is it?

114
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,840
It's gasoline and explosives, I'll turn everything into an accident.

115
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,000
I will let the car fall into the abyss and the car will explode.

116
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,960
Does it have to go that far?

117
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,360
It won't get more serious, will it?

118
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,280
Just think about it, if the boss and his wife were missing

119
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,560
then the two of us will be the ones the police come to.

120
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
You trust me.

121
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,480
Using this method, everything will turn to ashes.

122
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,040
And there will be nothing left to implicate us.

123
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,280
Miss Thong, trust me.

124
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,000
I've done this a lot, bring the box to the car.

125
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,600
Mr. Jak, lady, please forgive Thong.

126
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,440
Thong is really helpless.

127
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
May Mr. Jak and his wife pass away peacefully

128
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,960
and no longer have any problems with each other.

129
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,200
Miss Thong, wait for me here and don't talk to anyone.

130
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,680
I will come back to show you

131
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,160
How should I give a statement to the police?

132
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,280
Ms. Thong, are you at home today?

133
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,200
Put things away first.

134
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,240
Yes. Thong just arrived.

135
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,080
Didn't see anyone. Where is everyone going?

136
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,080
Is there no one? Isn't your wife at home too?

137
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,600
Yes. Thong went up to the room to look but couldn't find anyone.

138
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,680
So strange. I also don't know anymore.

139
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,360
Lom told him to go out and buy things for Mr. Prajak.

140
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,560
And said he would help me look after his wife.

141
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,840
But I don't know why everyone is gone now.

142
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,880
They probably went out on business and will be back later.

143
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,640
Uncle took the things away and put them away.

144
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,360
Yes.

145
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,600
You can't blame me.

146
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,960
It's what you did yourself.

147
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,880
If I don't kill you

148
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Then one day you'll hire someone to kill me.

149
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,760
But you don't need to worry.

150
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,400
Even though you're gone, I'll still work for you.

151
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,240
As for Ms. Thong,

152
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,520
I will take good care of her.

153
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,000
Lom will drive out from my house.

154
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,840
You don't need to worry about what's behind the car.

155
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,600
The goal is to kill Lom.

156
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,320
And burn everything, don't leave anything behind.

157
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,240
Yes, sir.

158
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,640
Miss Thong. Why are you sleeping here?

159
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
Is Lom back yet?

160
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,000
Not yet. No one has returned yet.

161
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,920
Uncle called Lom but didn't answer the phone.

162
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,280
Now there are police waiting in the living room.

163
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,080
Said he wanted to ask about Mr. Prajak and his wife.

164
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
Are the police coming?

165
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,520
So what did they ask? How do you answer?

166
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,160
They haven't asked anything yet.

167
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,200
Miss Thong, go talk to the police.

168
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,880
I feel so worried.

169
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,200
Hello, Ms. Thongprakai.

170
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,880
Hello police.

171
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,280
What's wrong?

172
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,440
Ms. Thongprakai, please calm down first.

173
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,200
I received a report from the police on the highway.

174
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,040
That Mr. Prajak's body was found burned on the side of the road.

175
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,520
Inside the car, three charred bodies were found.

176
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,160
But it has not yet been confirmed who they are.

177
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,680
Ms. Thongprakai, can I interrogate you?

178
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,880
What?

179
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,440
Find... how many bodies were found?

180
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,480
Three bodies.

181
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,000
Two bodies were in the back seat and one body was in the front seat.

182
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,560
Oh, Ms. Thong, please calm down.

183
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
Miss Thong, Miss Thong.

184
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,720
Go get the bottle of oil, hurry up.

185
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,640
Go get it here quickly.

186
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,040
Miss Thong, please calm down.

187
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
Calm down.

188
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,320
People live near the scene

189
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,640
reported hearing a gunshot,

190
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,720
followed by a loud crash.

191
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,640
After going out to look, I saw that the car was on fire.

192
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,200
Currently, the police are leaning towards the hypothesis that this is a revenge killing

193
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,680
of the casino owner whose case the minister solved.

194
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,840
Most recently, he also arrested a gang of online fraudsters.

195
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,240
This can be considered the biggest news today.

196
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,880
My condolences

197
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,840
with the families of the three victims.

198
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,920
Are Ms. Thong and Mr. Ben hungry?

199
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Let me go get food from the feast first.

200
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,040
Thank you.

201
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,960
Where do you want this photo to be placed?

202
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,720
Place on the altar

203
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,480
Or build an altar in the living room? Or put it in the bedroom?

204
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't know either.

205
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,840
Place it anywhere.

206
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,400
Sister, I'm really asking.

207
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,920
Why did my parents die?

208
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,440
Like the police said.

209
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,920
Ben's father

210
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,440
There are conflicts with many mafia groups.

211
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,960
They are investigating which gang it is.

212
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,000
Where are they driving?

213
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,800
They haven't been together for a long time.

214
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,480
Or are they quarreling with each other?

215
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,720
No, when Ben went abroad,

216
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,920
they started to get closer.

217
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,280
Probably since the day of Ben's farewell ceremony,

218
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
We tell stories of the past

219
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,320
and perhaps that reminded them that they once loved each other.

220
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,120
Is that true?

221
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,880
Will my parents reconcile?

222
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,640
Really, why would I lie to you?

223
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,960
They prepare to travel together.

224
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,480
They want to spend time together

225
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,640
to revive their memories.

226
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,720
Did Ben know that Ben's parents

227
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,440
Have you reconciled?

228
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,000
Do you know?

229
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,000
When someone called to say their parents had passed away,

230
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,200
The first image that popped into my head was them killing each other.

231
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,760
All my life,

232
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,120
I've never seen them talk properly to each other even once.

233
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,600
I see them arguing all day long.

234
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,680
So why?

235
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,360
the day they made up with each other,

236
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,240
I didn't have a chance to witness it?

237
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,640
Why are they in such a hurry to leave at this time?

238
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,960
Why?

239
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,000
Why?

240
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,480
It's okay, Ben.

241
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,080
At least in the final stages of life,

242
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,240
they made up with each other.

243
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,680
Now, they must be loved in heaven.

244
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,280
Ben must be happy for them.

245
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,480
Uncle Ben! The lawyer came, probably to talk about property division.

246
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,520
Go wash your face, then talk to the lawyer.

247
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,080
I'm coming back now.

248
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,400
Where are you going?

249
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,800
I didn't register my marriage with Ben's father,

250
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,880
Ben probably already knew that.

251
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,800
Therefore, she has no rights in this house.

252
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,040
You will go your own way.

253
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,360
But Ms. Thong,

254
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,560
The lawyer wants Ms. Thong to come in and talk to me.

255
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,200
I, Prajak Sianibunya,

256
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,760
wrote this will to prove it.

257
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,920
When I was close to death,

258
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,400
I would like to cede all my assets to the following people.

259
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,640
House and land in Bangkok

260
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,360
given to Ms. Thongprakai Jarasruedee.

261
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,320
Cash in all my bank accounts,

262
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,440
including capital and other assets

263
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,520
given to Ms. Thongprakai Jarasruedee.

264
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,680
All the cars are in my name

265
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,840
given to Ms. Thongprakai Jarasruedee.

266
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,560
Valuable items such as watches,

267
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,520
necklaces, rings and other jewelry

268
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,280
given to Ms. Thongprakai Jarasruedee.

269
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Wait.

270
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,760
Does he really want that?

271
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,080
That's right.

272
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,080
He is the one speaking

273
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,920
and I wrote everything he said.

274
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,800
So what about Ben? What will Ben get?

275
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,520
Here.

276
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,560
Cash 5 million baht

277
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,960
and is clearly stated to be used for learning purposes only.

278
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,960
As for the rest, he gave it all to Ms. Thongprakai.

279
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,120
How is that possible?

280
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,880
Just give me 5 million, give the rest to Thong?

281
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,120
Why did he do that?

282
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,480
The day he called me to write his will,

283
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,760
He said he had an argument with Uncle Ben.

284
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,920
He must have been very angry so he wrote his will like this.

285
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Ben, don't worry.

286
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,160
Before he passed away, he lost his anger.

287
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,040
I will return everything to you.

288
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,680
You don't deserve those things,

289
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,360
It's Ben's.

290
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,600
Please take it away.

291
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,080
Dad gave it to my sister, not me.

292
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,800
I don't want anything from him at all.

293
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,240
Hey lawyer!

294
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,200
So what about my mother's assets?

295
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,040
Even though the lady did not write a will

296
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,440
But all her assets,

297
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,200
includes personal property,

298
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,920
will be given to Mr. Ben according to the law.

299
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,520
Yes, so let's do that.

300
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,840
Whenever Ben wants to return to this house, please come back.

301
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,920
After all, this house belongs to Ben.

302
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,840
This house

303
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,760
How do I look?

304
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,920
I only see bad memories of my father and mother.

305
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,680
I don't want to go back anymore.

306
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,240
I will start a new life.

307
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,720
Then

308
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,320
If you have anything, please contact me, just take it as it is

309
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,240
You are a relative of mine.

310
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,880
Yes.

311
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,920
I'm leaving.

312
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,000
Goodbye.

313
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,840
Good luck.

314
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,320
Miss Thong!

315
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,080
Mr. Prajak recorded a video and sent it with the will.

316
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,080
Why not open it while Ben is still here?

317
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,560
Ben should have heard his last words too.

318
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,640
He just sent it to you privately.

319
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,840
And I'm afraid too

320
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,000
If Uncle Ben sees it, it won't be good.

321
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,120
Hello Thong.

322
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,920
He decided to film the video at this time

323
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,680
because when you get older than this it might not be appropriate to watch.

324
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,480
So he filmed while he still had some beauty.

325
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,760
Maybe the lawyer has already announced the will to you.

326
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,480
No need to be surprised because I left everything to you.

327
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,840
Because I want to repay the kindness you showed me.

328
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,240
The other day, when I opened the clip

329
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,440
an old man slipped in the bathroom to show you,

330
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,640
I also remind you that

331
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,200
Be careful of slipping.

332
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,760
After that, I went to buy anti-slip sheets to stick all over the bathroom,

333
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,760
He even asked a worker to come and install a railing for him to hold on to.

334
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,280
His wife and children have never done something like this for him.

335
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,560
And yesterday, when Ben hit me,

336
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,840
Let me know who I should love.

337
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,960
One day maybe I'll leave this world before you,

338
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,880
But I'm sure I'll still live a long time.

339
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,880
It's my money, use it to the fullest.

340
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,800
Born in one lifetime

341
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,080
then live your happiest life.

342
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,600
See you in the next life, Thong.

343
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,040
Hope we will meet again

344
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,920
and be each other's first.

345
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,840
Do you agree?

346
00:27:02,427 --> 00:27:06,586
THE ROSE OF SIN
