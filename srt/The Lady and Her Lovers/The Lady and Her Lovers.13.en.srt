[The film was created for entertainment purposes.]

00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,519
[Characters, actions, places and events in the film are hypothetical events.]

[No intention of sexual arousal,]

THE ROSE OF SIN

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 13

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,439
 Oh, Si! No need for makeup,

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,119
 adding makeup won't make you beautiful.

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,599
 Hurry up and welcome the guests.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,440
 I also know that Malee is not here, man.

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
 Wait!

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,400
 My kids told me that

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,320
 Did you see Thong getting in the car with Inspector Mit yesterday?

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,120
 Where do they go, what do they do together? You tell me.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,240
 I don't have time to tell.

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,160
 You must quickly go pick up the guests, sir.

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,480
 I order you to tell, right now.

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,839
 Stories of the world,

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,160
 You're so excited about number one.

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,800
Yes, I can say it.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,040
 Now Inspector Mit

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,399
 is flirting with that Thong.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
 - Dieu Toa! - YES,

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,760
If I overwrite the prescription, why are you still asking me?

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,239
Yes, what you want to think, what you want to fantasize about is your business.

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,880
But the truth is the truth. It is

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,119
Inspector Mit, you guys

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,439
trying to seduce all year long,

31
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,120
He doesn't care and doesn't care about you either.

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,200
Because he will marry my sister Thong.

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,359
Just be happy. If Mr. Bun

34
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,119
know my dear Thong

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,800
is hanging out with his super handsome younger brother

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,680
I also want to know

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,680
what will happen?

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,240
Hope that day comes

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,239
you're still proud

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,520
About Thongdee, your beloved sister, Si!

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,600
Let's go look for a boss, where have you been?

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,680
Oh my god!

43
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,640
Why are you so talkative, Si?

44
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,519
Come on come on!

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,320
Today you two will compete with each other,

46
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
Provoking you guys here.

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,040
If any baby wakes up the boy

48
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,160
you will receive a worthy reward.

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,479
When the match is over,

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,239
We'll count the points, let's see who we are

51
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,119
the winning side and the losing side.

52
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,440
Baby Thong, Baby Malee, are you two ready?

53
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,960
Ready.

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,719
So guys, are you ready?

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,079
Ready!

56
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,160
If you're ready, let's start competing!

57
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,280
Now, let's finish our glass!

58
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Invite!

59
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,640
Look at the movement.

60
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,733
Oh, I'm starting to dance.

61
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,840
My heart is melting!

62
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,360
If you're satisfied, then clap your hands.

63
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,320
It's so beautiful!

64
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,800
Oh, no!

65
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,800
Oh so beautiful!

66
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,360
Great movement!

67
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,440
Oh, it's not inferior, is it!

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,920
Over here, this place!

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,560
Hurry, hurry!

70
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,800
Today's winner is Thong!

71
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,319
I'm Thong, I'm Thong, I'm Thong!

72
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,079
- Are you happy? - It's fun.

73
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,040
I told you it's fun to watch.

74
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,599
Thong is so smart!

75
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,840
Let your opponent start first to catch the cards.

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,439
If you're a boxer, you haven't thrown any punches in the first round.

77
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,160
Just looked at the opponent first.

78
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,679
I have a way to win without wasting any effort.

79
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,560
Even though Malee was panting, she still lost.

80
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Drink!

81
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,880
This chicken of mine is not just beautiful

82
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,640
but the mind is not ordinary.

83
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,680
Thong, let's go out and get something to drink.

84
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,640
I have something to tell him.

85
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,760
Okay, Mr. Bun.

86
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Thong.

87
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,759
- Do you need help? - It's okay, Mr. Bun.

88
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,440
Thong can handle it himself.

89
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,879
Are you happy today?

90
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,359
- Fun. - Are you happy?

91
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,480
- Fun. - If it's fun, let's ask for everyone's voice.

92
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,920
Out of glasses.

93
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,879
Inspector, Thong has installed a wiretap under the table.

94
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,359
Now Thong has left the room.

95
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,680
Thank you very much, great job Thong.

96
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,440
So let's talk later.

97
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,440
I'll go turn on their eavesdropping device first.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,320
Yes, talk later.

99
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,880
Does Thong know?

100
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,160
about how well Thong helps him improve his position.

101
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,240
 A man who does great things

102
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,440
 must have a woman nearby to support.

103
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,040
 Some of my friends

104
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,520
 pairs up with the stupid kids,

105
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,120
 refers to a beautiful face and big breasts. When we talk together

106
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,760
 they don't carry brains. Such women

107
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,320
 The more we date, the worse we look.

108
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,839
 In short, Mr. Bun sees Thong

109
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,000
 is just a beautiful watch

110
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,760
 or a luxury car to show off to your friends?

111
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,080
 Some of his friends like to raise leopards

112
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,840
 but he doesn't like raising animals, he likes raising women.

113
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,680
Thong danced like before

114
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,800
at the party let me see it again.

115
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,680
He wanted Thong to dance and seduce him

116
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,560
separate style that does not need to be shared with anyone.

117
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,800
 [Opium seriously affects cognition, nerves, and the brain.]

118
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,480
Let's dance seductively.

119
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Let's be seductive.

120
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:59,320
Bend your waist again.

121
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,120
Yes, turn it, turn it right.

122
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,480
What's up? Not in the mood?

123
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,640
Be a cat for me, I like it.

124
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,400
Let's do it again, quickly.

125
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,800
Let's bark. Let's bark.

126
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,680
I say bark.

127
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,120
How attractive is this set?

128
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Replace with another set.

129
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,720
Tell me to go change into another outfit.

130
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,080
Is this a person or a chicken?

131
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,360
Very cute.

132
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Come here.

133
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Come here.

134
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
Sit down.

135
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Tell me to sit down.

136
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Give me your hand.

137
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Bark away.

138
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,280
I say bark.

139
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Son Thong.

140
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,960
Tell me what you want me to do.

141
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,600
I lost to you, I came to receive punishment.

142
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,520
Wherever you want to go, go.

143
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:08,686
I don't want anything to do with you anymore.

144
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,560
You have to do it.

145
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,720
Give me orders if you want me to do anything.

146
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,400
Let me finish this, I don't want to owe you anything.

147
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,879
Then I give you an order

148
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,879
You must keep this in your mind until you die.

149
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,240
That you lost to me.

150
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,719
Even flirting dancing,

151
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,119
the only ability you have.

152
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,560
Yet you still lose to me.

153
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,640
Hey bro.

154
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,800
Malee the rabbit is here.

155
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,960
Jumping is a lot like a toy rabbit.

156
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,400
Dance for me again.

157
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Jump even higher.

158
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Any.

159
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,560
Where does this rabbit keep the battery?

160
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,200
Here?

161
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,880
Hello, Inspector.

162
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,840
Can I meet Thong?

163
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,080
Why did the Inspector invite Thong out here to talk?

164
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,079
He heard Thong's voice and he knew it

165
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,600
It's that Thong has something to worry about.

166
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,200
So he wanted to take Thong to get some fresh air.

167
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,400
Here's the water.

168
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you.

169
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,880
I drink a lot to help detoxify.

170
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,040
Why detox?

171
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,040
Thong is not poisoned.

172
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,693
Isn't Thong doing drugs?

173
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:53,653
Inspector already knows?

174
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,680
You are a police officer,

175
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,080
I've done so many drug cases.

176
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,560
How could you not know?

177
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,160
But Thong knows Thong is the first

178
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,720
After doing drugs, do you want to see the police?

179
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,440
But the Inspector won't arrest Thong, will he?

180
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,560
Come on, let's go sit there.

181
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:29,280
Please sit down.

182
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,600
 Even though we haven't known each other for long,

183
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,640
 but I can feel it

184
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,160
 means you can trust Thong.

185
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,640
 That's why I asked Thong to help me.

186
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,400
 So what about Thong, does Thong trust you?

187
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,920
 Believe it.

188
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,999
 If not, how dare Thong call the Inspector

189
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,880
 after Thong did drugs.

190
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,079
 Thong has something to worry about

191
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,560
 just tell me.

192
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,520
What happened at Mr. Bun's bar, right?

193
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Yes.

194
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,040
I tell you,

195
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,800
What is there that makes Thong uneasy?

196
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,320
Everything.

197
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,880
Thong feels like he's just a toy

198
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,600
Let Bun use it to show off.

199
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,360
If he wants to watch something entertaining

200
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,440
will drag Thong and Malee to fight with each other.

201
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,000
Like last night

202
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,120
Force us to compete in sexy dances in front of others.

203
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,687
Those adulterous men

204
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,800
staring at Thong,

205
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,040
eyes look all over the body.

206
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,680
When finished, throw in the change.

207
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,840
It's like watching a circus.

208
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,440
Thong doesn't know what he is anymore?

209
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
Thong felt disgusted with himself.

210
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,440
Like Thong is not human.

211
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
Thong to.

212
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,960
Don't look down on yourself like that.

213
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,200
Thong knew about the information yesterday. Thong set up a voice recorder

214
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,800
How important is it?

215
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,280
Waiting to see the news.

216
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,720
There will be a major drug bust.

217
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,000
I want to let you know that this is thanks to Thong

218
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,760
assisted the police.

219
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Really?

220
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,720
Does Thong help so much?

221
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
That's right.

222
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,360
That's why he told Thong not to look down on himself.

223
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,400
The value of each person lies in how they see themselves.

224
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,600
Anyway, Thong just endure and continue working at that bar.

225
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,560
Consider it helping you.

226
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,360
This is a very honorable assignment.

227
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,240
Not everyone can do it.

228
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,720
If you're really not good and smart, you can't do what Thong does.

229
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Yes.

230
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,200
Thong won't be sad anymore.

231
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,920
Thong will stay to help the Inspector.

232
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,800
Very good.

233
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
Is it good?

234
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Good, huh?

235
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,199
Now that I've just gone out, I thought I'd sit and wait until tomorrow morning.

236
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,560
The boss is still very strong.

237
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,440
Jan is waiting for you, is something wrong?

238
00:17:59,773 --> 00:18:01,853
Or wait for your turn?

239
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,680
You can do it, you still have the strength.

240
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,479
Boss.

241
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,999
After hearing this news, you may lose interest

242
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,880
to the point of fainting.

243
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
The boss knows

244
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,599
that she just came in and you're so confused

245
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,079
about to become a promiscuous woman

246
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,280
Eat both you and me.

247
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,520
Who is so promiscuous? Mom, speak slowly.

248
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,360
I'm so high, my brain can't think.

249
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,040
It's Thong.

250
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,880
She is currently in contact with Inspector Mit.

251
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,919
It's not just a normal conversation with each other.

252
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,800
I heard they took each other to the room too.

253
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,559
Like this, there is no need to say anything

254
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,679
then you also know what to do.

255
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,720
Certainly not discussing Buddhism.

256
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,080
Boss, you have to quickly deal with Thong.

257
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,280
Before the horns on his head grew into a buffalo.

258
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,160
You guys just keep calm.

259
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,920
Don't make any noise.

260
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,200
And I will observe Mit and Thong.

261
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,720
Jan, don't let Thong know

262
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,760
that he already knew about this.

263
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,200
Did Jan tell the boss about you and the Inspector?

264
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,599
I'm sorry.

265
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,560
She spoke without thinking.

266
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,320
Just intending to brag about it a bit.

267
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,760
Forgot to think if the boss knew about this

268
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,880
then all of them died.

269
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,840
I won't die, it's you who will die.

270
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,640
Inspector, what should we do?

271
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,879
If the boss knew, he would definitely kill Thong.

272
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,080
Stay calm.

273
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,160
I think my brother still doesn't know much.

274
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,960
At most, I probably only know that he took Thong back to his room.

275
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,840
He won't make a big deal about this bit.

276
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,440
He will wait for the evidence to be complete before proceeding.

277
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,160
So we still have a solution.

278
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,120
What way?

279
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,000
Let Thong stay quiet and act like nothing happened?

280
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,359
Oh. If the boss asks

281
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,640
How are you going to answer?

282
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,239
I think

283
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,959
You and the Inspector must prepare in advance.

284
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,560
Let both answers be the same.

285
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,000
We must not hide from him.

286
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,240
Because he already knows about it.

287
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,199
Thong had to automatically go and tell him that he was flirting with Thong.

288
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
What?

289
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,999
Saying that means both of them will be shot dead immediately.

290
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
No.

291
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,800
You know his personality well.

292
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,960
Hey darling.

293
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,879
Money counters don't cost much either. Why don't you buy one?

294
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,120
Why do I have to sit and count until my hands get tired?

295
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,760
It's better to let your hands do fun things with Malee.

296
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,880
I don't trust money counting machines.

297
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,920
What if it counts wrongly?

298
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,480
You can't trust anyone in this world.

299
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,960
Except for myself. Remember that well.

300
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:12,327
Sir, Thong is here.

301
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Let it in.

302
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,400
Thong, come here.

303
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,720
Come sit next to me.

304
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,840
Such an expression, is something wrong?

305
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,240
I have something I haven't told you yet.

306
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,200
It's a secret that's been bothering me for days.

307
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,720
 So I think

308
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,680
 I will confess to you before you know.

309
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,240
 Is there anything Thong wants to confess to you?

310
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
 Come on, say it.

311
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,520
 The thing is... that day when I was about to go home,

312
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,520
 Inspector Mit him

313
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,920
 volunteered to take her back to the apartment.

314
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,200
 I didn't dare to refuse, so I let him take me home.

315
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,720
 In the middle of the walk, he talked as if he wanted to flirt with me.

316
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,000
 But I didn't follow suit.

317
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,119
 At first I intended to stay silent and not let you know, because,

318
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,120
 afraid something will happen. But think again and again,

319
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,600
 I'd better confess to you to prove my innocence.

320
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,480
Brother, you're not angry with me, right?

321
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,440
Thong confessed to him like that,

322
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,040
How can you be angry with Thong?

323
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,680
You already know this.

324
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,280
But he waited to see what Thong would do.

325
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,039
And besides Mit

326
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,240
talking like flirting with Thong

327
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,240
Does it still ask about your secrets?

328
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,239
No sir. Just flirting,

329
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,280
Ask me what I like to eat, where I like to go,

330
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,679
ask a lot.

331
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,999
But I just asked and didn't get an answer.

332
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,560
- I don't want to follow you. - Oh,

333
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,519
It's too crazy. Don't believe it,

334
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,079
Thong was definitely the one to seduce the Inspector first.

335
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,639
Otherwise, how dare he flirt with it?

336
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,439
And to the point of taking each other to the room like that,

337
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,959
Surely it's not just sitting around talking and having fun.

338
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,079
It brings all your secrets out and that's it.

339
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,280
Shut up, Malee.

340
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,480
I'm not stupid, I have a brain.

341
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,559
I know what's right,

342
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,640
what's wrong? Which one lies, which one doesn't.

343
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,680
Come in if I catch you lying

344
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,840
then you will have a suitable solution.

345
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,760
But now he believes Thong.

346
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,200
Thank you Mr. Bun.

347
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,839
But what if Mr. Bun wants Thong to prove it?

348
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,079
Then just say Thong.

349
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,760
Thong is ready to do anything.

350
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,759
Oh god, proof of innocence?

351
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,040
I haven't heard it since I was born.

352
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Mr. Bun.

353
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,560
Hot goods sent to Chiang Rai were arrested.

354
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,319
How can I catch it? Which police officer caught him?

355
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,479
I don't know either.

356
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,119
But spy news said that the information that Mr. Bun talked to each other

357
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,560
The day Mr. Oun's party was held, it came to the attention of the police.

358
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Thong.

359
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,719
Thong doesn't know anything about Mr. Bun.

360
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,160
Thong has nothing to do with it.

361
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Thong.

362
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,640
Unfortunate.

363
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,800
A beautiful woman like Thong shouldn't be so stupid.

364
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,280
If he hadn't betrayed, he wouldn't have died so early.

365
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,759
But if reincarnated in the next life

366
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,599
If you want to betray someone, look at their face.

367
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,120
that that person is not boss Bun.

368
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
With.

369
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,400
 What are you doing?

370
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:14,039
 Brother, Thong won't do it.

371
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,359
 The Nikhoms are the ones who do it.

372
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,919
 They sent someone to wiretapped Oun district chief's party.

373
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,919
 So why didn't you tell me sooner?

374
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,919
 Don't say anything yet, take her to the hospital first.

375
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
 Thong.

376
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,240
 Thong.

377
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
 Thong.

378
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,320
 Try to endure it, Thong.

379
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
 Thong.

380
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,560
 You should quickly take it to the hospital.

381
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,079
Are you awake?

382
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,359
Don't move.

383
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,680
Oh my God.

384
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,199
Stay still, the wound hasn't healed yet.

385
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,759
The doctor said

386
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,479
She had to stay like that for four to five days.

387
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,040
Only then will the wound heal.

388
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,840
Where's the inspector?

389
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,440
Did he come to visit me?

390
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,079
I was unconscious for a day and then I woke up and asked him right away?

391
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,759
YES. He was the one who carried her here and there.

392
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,280
But then he didn't come to visit.

393
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,279
Because he's a police officer.

394
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,800
He cannot be involved in an incident like this.

395
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,120
But

396
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,600
He sent this beautiful flower basket to her.

397
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,400
I think it's probably a few million.

398
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,800
So what about the boss?

399
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,160
Did you say anything?

400
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,559
It's still normal, that's his nature.

401
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,559
Shooting people is like shooting birds.

402
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Seeing him seemed like no big deal.

403
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Thong.

404
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,879
I think

405
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,080
Stop contacting the inspector.

406
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,440
Don't overdo it.

407
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,080
Oh my god, it makes a sad face.

408
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
This,

409
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,319
you and him

410
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,039
We didn't see each other many times

411
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,119
but do as if

412
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,240
love each other from a previous life.

413
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,759
If you don't stop contacting him

414
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,519
Be careful and be eliminated by the boss.

415
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,040
then have to love each other in the next life instead.

416
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,439
So if I escape from the boss,

417
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,719
What about coming to live with the inspector?

418
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Do you think he will protect me?

419
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,040
Are you under the influence of drugs?

420
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Yes?

421
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,039
Are you crazy?

422
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,399
The inspector has a high position.

423
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,399
The women came to him

424
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,239
They are all upper class people, children of this and that.

425
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,679
Celebrities also exist.

426
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,760
He wouldn't marry someone like you.

427
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,240
But he was very good to me.

428
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,479
Because he is a good person.

429
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,920
He's good with everyone.

430
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,480
Wake up, little sister.

431
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,279
At first I thought it was my sister

432
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,519
is a superficial, superficial person.

433
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,759
Who cares

434
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,840
and so foolish that he is so ignorant that there is no way out.

435
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,560
Listen carefully, Thong.

436
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,360
If you are not familiar with this man

437
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,080
it won't die either.

438
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,920
But if you know him then

439
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,920
you might die.

440
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,920
Hey!

441
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,760
If you don't interfere in my affairs

442
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,759
I didn't warn you

443
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,040
and Thong was not shot either.

444
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,773
Stop thinking about using my things.

445
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:03,032
Women are full out,

446
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,200
You go somewhere else to find food.

447
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,599
I don't intend to get serious with Thong either.

448
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,599
I just saw you got a new toy

449
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,280
So I want to try to play together.

450
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,280
You've known since you were little

451
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,520
I don't share toys with you.

452
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
 Mr. Bun.

453
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,879
 Damn it!

454
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,159
 Why did you come to destroy me?

455
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,400
 Let me play with you.

456
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,399
 Give it to me.

457
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,040
 Don't touch it.

458
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,440
 But I also know

459
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,800
 I can take your things and play with them every time.

460
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
 With.

461
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,239
 If you ever touch my toys

462
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,240
 then you die.

463
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
 Are you fighting me?

464
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,639
 You can never win against me.

465
00:29:55,641 --> 00:29:56,841
 And we fought.

466
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,200
Then you lost to me.

467
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,160
Lose to me every time.

468
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,480
It's funny to say, isn't it?

469
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,999
When we were children, we often argued,

470
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,240
Growing up, working together to support each other.

471
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,519
He manages the business,

472
00:30:10,652 --> 00:30:11,772
And I work in law.

473
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,600
And we don't quarrel anymore.

474
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,119
But anyway, me

475
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Still wary of you.

476
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,400
Because that's my intuition.

477
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,160
You stay away from Thong.

478
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,960
We won't have to argue anymore.

479
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,959
When I was little, I only fought.

480
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
But when you get older, I'll shoot you.

481
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,080
I already shot Thong,

482
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,080
Don't let me shoot you too.

483
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,239
I know.

484
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,400
For the sake of business, I won't let a woman ruin it.

485
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,480
Let's have a glass.

486
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:25,260
THE ROSE OF SIN
