THE ROSE OF SIN

00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
Episode 18

10
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,320
Hey darling,

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,320
Total is 30 thousand two hundred.

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,280
Here, sir.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
I hope you can go to the 7th floor of heaven.

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,800
Once you're up, don't forget to get down.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,040
Okay, mom.

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,920
Mr. Chu,

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,560
hello.

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Do you have a room today?

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,840
- Not yet, beautiful Thong. - Please wait a moment.

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,600
Ruby, please take him to his room for a bit.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,160
Okay, mom.

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,840
Let me ask someone to prepare it for you.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,160
Prepare your goods carefully, otherwise you'll end up moaning out loud.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,840
So please prepare quickly.

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,720
Yes sir, please.

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,600
Please, this way.

27
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,880
Hello Inspector.

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,880
What's up, Thong?

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,080
I've been disappearing lately.

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,240
Well... Thong is a bit busy these days.

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,640
The owner ordered me to take care of things at the bar too.

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,040
That's why I didn't have time to call the inspector back.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,600
Um, so can we meet tomorrow?

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,920
The day after tomorrow is delivery day.

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,720
If there is anything, we can update each other.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
Thong is not sure if Thong is free or not.

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,480
Actually, there's nothing to update, Inspector.

38
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
Mr. Bun's plan still proceeds as before.

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,760
Inspector, just follow your plan.

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,080
But I have something to tell Thong.

41
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Tomorrow, meet at the same place.

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,200
I will wait.

43
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,800
Inspector!

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,160
Hello Inspector.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,000
How long has it been?

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Not yet, I just arrived.

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,560
What's up, Thong?

48
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,040
The boss gives you a lot of work, right?

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,600
Are you tired?

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,320
The owner ordered me to stand guard in front of the bar.

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
from 8pm to 2am.

52
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,800
My legs are tired.

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,520
Inspector, what are you doing?

54
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,960
Are you better?

55
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,080
It's better.

56
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,760
From the moment we met each other,

57
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,960
I've held your feet twice already.

58
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,160
The first time was when I was kicked down,

59
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,840
he came and took a look.

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,680
This time he even massaged my feet.

61
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,920
No matter what happens to you, I have to take care of you.

62
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,400
Nothing strange.

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,480
Give me that other leg.

64
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,800
Tomorrow, he will lead the force to set up a control point

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,160
to catch Mr. Bun's drug truck.

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,560
If you succeed

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,880
then you will be promoted to police superintendent.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,080
I want to tell you that

69
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,080
I have this position thanks to you.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,560
Your kindness this time,

71
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,560
you won't forget.

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,440
So has Mr. Bun's plan changed?

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,520
Oh, Thong!

74
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,240
Mr. Bun!

75
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,680
Older brother!

76
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,480
Eavesdropping device?

77
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,000
Who brought it in?

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,960
Since when?

79
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,560
Who else?

80
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,320
It can only be Malee!

81
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,640
He probably put it in before he got fired.

82
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,120
Recently,

83
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,960
what are we going to do,

84
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,440
The police already know everything.

85
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,600
Just because of this shit.

86
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,280
Older brother.

87
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,760
I doubt it

88
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,880
Chinese customer that Mit inspector introduced

89
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,880
Perhaps it's a plan to lure us in.

90
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,240
I think it's better to cancel the plan and return the money to him.

91
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,080
How can I return it?

92
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Up to 80 million baht.

93
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,440
I will use alum instead.

94
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,800
Looks like we're done.

95
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
If Mit says anything

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Then they said the police had caught the goods.

97
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,200
Older brother,

98
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,840
If so that means

99
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,120
We can only gain without losing, right?

100
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,760
You get money, but you don't have to give them the goods.

101
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,760
See? In this world,

102
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
we must have a special mind.

103
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,960
We must think logically in every situation.

104
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,080
I see this in her too.

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,200
Yes, boss, Thong will use his brain like that

106
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,800
to help our business grow.

107
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,960
This is the reward.

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,400
Welcome to our family.

109
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,160
Mistress...

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,040
What did the owner give me?

111
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,280
Thank you, ma'am.

112
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,840
Thank you Bun, I appreciate it.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,080
Mr. Bun's plan has not changed at all.

114
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,680
Everything remains the same.

115
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,160
I wish the inspector's mission a success.

116
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,720
Thong asked for his support.

117
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,680
The first one can go.

118
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,600
- Has it started yet? - That's right.

119
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
We'll quickly say goodbye to Mit.

120
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,800
You said you would transport alum instead.

121
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,800
I don't see anything.

122
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
We changed our mind.

123
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,440
Opening it up to see alum is so childish.

124
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,200
Let him see something a little more terrifying.

125
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,160
- We're ready. - Let's clean it up, okay?

126
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Don't let anyone survive.

127
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,120
Go away.

129
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,000
Mr. Bun, at first you said you were misleading the police,

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,680
Only caught alum.

131
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,080
- Why... - I told you,

132
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,440
some stories

133
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,840
If you keep messing around all the time, it won't be good.

134
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
It is always better to deal with it once and for all.

135
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,640
But the inspector is Mr. Bun's younger brother.

136
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,600
- To the point of killing my brother... - My brother wanted to harm me

137
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,960
So why keep it?

138
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,880
If I don't kill it today, it will kill me tomorrow.

139
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you have a problem with it?

140
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,440
No sir.

141
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,440
Thong just asked that.

142
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,080
Thong is learning how to work in this world.

143
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,320
There are still many things she needs to learn.

144
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,480
This is just a small part of our tricks.

145
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,480
Let's go, Bun.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,480
Let's go have a drink,

147
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,960
Wait to see the news.

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,280
Mr. Bun, the owner.

149
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,280
Mistress.

150
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,710
Our car will park here.

151
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:00,741
If they drive away, use your car to stop them.

152
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,387
Yes.

153
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
Come on, everyone, take down the markers.

154
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,187
Set to points.

155
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:08,260
Right in this row.

156
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,821
Okay.

157
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:11,630
Straight, yes.

158
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,520
Go.

159
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,720
Okay, everyone.

160
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,080
The target car will arrive in 10 minutes.

161
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,760
- Yes. - Get ready.

162
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,160
What's wrong, Thong?

163
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
Nothing. I'm just thinking about something.

164
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,640
Seeing the target vehicle, about 500 meters will arrive. Report.

165
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,960
It's clear. Report.

166
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,560
The target vehicle has arrived, prepare.

167
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,440
- Yes. - Yes.

168
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,840
Oh, what's wrong?

169
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,560
Huh? Whatever you're going to do, go.

170
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Why show such a repressed appearance?

171
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:29,490
[Stop to check]

172
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:37,160
Hello, Thong, what's wrong?

173
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,800
What?

174
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,560
Everyone, wear bulletproof vests.

175
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,400
Yes. Let's go.

176
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,051
Inspector, cancel the plan.

177
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:48,171
And let the car go.

178
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:49,571
It's really dangerous.

179
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:51,891
Having reached this level, he couldn't bear to lose.

180
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:53,731
But...

181
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,611
- Bring the car out to block it. - Yes.

182
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:01,251
Inspect.

183
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:20,291
What happened?

184
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:23,731
Tell me now, what happened?

185
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:25,731
I will make the inspector die, sister.

186
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:28,131
I don't want it to become like that.

187
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,331
I really don't know Mr. Bun

188
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:32,331
Hide the gunman in the car too.

189
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,891
I caused the two people I loved to die,

190
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:37,731
I don't want the inspector to be the third person to die, sister.

191
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:40,331
Thong, come out and take a look.

192
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:42,331
I don't know what the police are doing, but they're all over the place.

193
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:53,331
Stop!

194
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:55,331
Stop!

195
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:02,771
What's the matter, policeman?

196
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:04,771
Hello.

197
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:07,971
I wonder if she is Ms. Thongprakai Jarasruedee,

198
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:09,371
owner of this bar?

199
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:12,411
Yes, it's me, Thongprakai.

200
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:17,531
I have an arrest warrant for you on charges

201
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:19,531
Laundering money by operating bars and selling drugs.

202
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:20,971
This is an order.

203
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:23,731
I invite you to come to the station to testify.

204
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:30,931
Get off!

205
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:33,451
Quick!

206
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:35,451
Turn your back!

207
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,731
Hands up!

208
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,451
What's inside?

209
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:42,211
I'm just going to deliver oranges.

210
00:14:42,211 --> 00:14:43,491
It's nothing.

211
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:44,491
Open it.

212
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:47,731
Oh, maybe it's a misunderstanding.

213
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:49,371
I'm the manager.

214
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:51,131
But that document has my name on it

215
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:52,851
because the owner actually just transferred it to me.

216
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,291
Let me go call her and talk clearly.

217
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,531
Ms. Si, please go find something to drink for the police officer.

218
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:03,371
Go ahead, I'll take care of it.

219
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:08,691
Slowly, slowly, go slowly.

220
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:23,971
Mr. Bun, the owner!

221
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:25,771
Hide quickly, the police are coming.

222
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:27,771
Mr. Bun!

223
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:29,691
Mistress!

224
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,731
Thank you for accepting the stool on our behalf.

225
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:42,411
Good luck.

226
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:49,371
- Thong! - Yes?

227
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:51,331
Just leave it here first.

228
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:55,891
More secure.

229
00:15:58,411 --> 00:15:59,931
Thank you, madam.

230
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:10,651
My money.

231
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:44,851
Stop! Don't move!

232
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:55,331
Do not! Do not! Do not! Don't come any closer!

233
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:57,611
Don't move! Don't move!

234
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:00,011
Let go!

235
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:24,451
Sister, your face is also beautiful.

236
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:26,251
What did I do wrong?

237
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:28,251
but got caught in jail?

238
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,731
This life

239
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:34,411
It's true that I made a lot of mistakes.

240
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:36,051
But this time

241
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:37,371
I'm not wrong.

242
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:39,971
I had nothing to do with it, but I was wrongly blamed.

243
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,931
That cruel couple tricked me.

244
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:46,051
If we do it wrong

245
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:48,051
then ended up in prison like that

246
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:50,451
is still acceptable.

247
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:52,451
But if it's not wrong

248
00:17:52,851 --> 00:17:54,731
but must be punished as such

249
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:56,731
that's extremely painful.

250
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:03,251
Hey, you let me out.

251
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,611
What the hell are you making me do? I didn't do anything wrong.

252
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:07,891
You're only good at bullying women.

253
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:11,051
If you're good, you can catch the guy behind it. Let me out!

254
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:12,651
Let me go, you idiot.

255
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:14,731
- Let go. - That's enough.

256
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:16,731
My ears are burning here.

257
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,331
Older brother...

258
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:22,691
You let me out, right? You know I didn't do anything wrong.

259
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:24,931
That bar belongs to the boss and the owner,

260
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:27,171
has nothing to do with me. Let me go.

261
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:29,491
I don't know, go tell yourselves.

262
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,611
Someone's coming to look for you.

263
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:35,971
He wants to meet you.

264
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:38,251
Go out.

265
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:45,215
[Women's cell]

266
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:47,211
Come in.

267
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:52,876
Older brother.

268
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:54,703
Who came to see me?

269
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:55,731
What did they come for?

270
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:57,336
They won't do anything to me, right?

271
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:01,022
No need to ask, just sit there and wait, he's coming now.

272
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:35,291
This is my coffee.

273
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:43,011
Inspect.

274
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,451
It's okay.

275
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,291
I'm here to help you.

276
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,411
Mr. Bun and the landlady have fled to Mexico.

277
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:17,451
They have been going there to find a way to do business for many years.

278
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,731
I brought money to deposit in the bank there.

279
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:22,731
Maybe the two of them also know

280
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:24,731
is about to be arrested

281
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:27,171
It would be better to find a way to base the capital there.

282
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:32,291
Thong is by their side every day

283
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:34,731
but never knew about this.

284
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,068
They never mentioned it.

285
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:39,751
Thong.

286
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:43,291
I have something to ask Thong.

287
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:49,771
The story about them canceling the medicine delivery,

288
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:53,051
When did Thong know that?

289
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,211
Why did Thong tell him at the last second?

290
00:20:59,251 --> 00:20:59,971
The thing is

291
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:02,771
Thong just found out that morning.

292
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:06,251
When Thong saw Mr. Bun, he let the assassin get into the car

293
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:08,971
Thong called the inspector at that time.

294
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:10,971
Thong apologizes

295
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:13,171
Because I know it's too slow,

296
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,851
puts the inspector in danger.

297
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:18,451
So...

298
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:21,971
What is it like at the checkpoint?

299
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:24,651
There was shooting back and forth.

300
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,651
But luckily we are

301
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,011
Wear bulletproof vests promptly.

302
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:30,411
If you don't answer Thong's phone call

303
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:31,531
then he would probably be dead.

304
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:35,611
Thank you very much.

305
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:40,971
And

306
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:44,051
Even though you can't put Mr. Bun and the landlady in jail,

307
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,611
But I will also keep my promise,

308
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,371
will welcome Thong to his home.

309
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:51,811
Do you still want to come to my house?

310
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:54,811
Do you want it?

311
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:59,251
But what about Thong having to take the blame for Mr. Bun and the landlady?

312
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,691
Thong what should I do?

313
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:02,691
Didn't anyone tell Thong about this?

314
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:04,691
I talked to my superiors,

315
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,331
You said Thong was from the police,

316
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:09,851
not a member of a drug gang,

317
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,411
do not receive any benefit from that line at all.

318
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:14,931
That's why Thong...

319
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:17,211
not guilty.

320
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:19,771
Really?

321
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:23,811
Thong thanked the inspector very much.

322
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:26,651
The Inspector is like a god who came to protect Thong.

323
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:29,131
Thank you very much inspector.

324
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:36,491
Thank you.

325
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:54,211
Come in.

326
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:59,291
The inspector's house is so beautiful.

327
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,731
Thong has never seen a house this big before.

328
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:03,491
Let's go inside.

329
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:05,171
Let's go.

330
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:24,771
The inspector's house really has few things.

331
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:26,771
But it looks beautiful.

332
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:28,771
Very good, Thong likes it very much.

333
00:23:49,451 --> 00:23:51,051
Want to see another room?

334
00:23:53,371 --> 00:23:54,251
Let's go.

335
00:24:02,131 --> 00:24:03,691
This is your office.

336
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,851
I used this room to discuss the plan to overthrow Mr. Bun for up to a year.

337
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:14,011
When Thong helped

338
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:15,651
The plan progressed very quickly.

339
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:20,611
You are so lucky

340
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:22,091
when meeting Thong.

341
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:25,411
Thong is also lucky

342
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:27,411
when meeting the inspector.

343
00:24:28,691 --> 00:24:30,931
Don't call me detective anymore.

344
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,171
It sounds so far away.

345
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:35,571
Please call me Mr. Mit.

346
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,611
Yes, Mit.

347
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:46,891
Thong.

348
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:50,691
Please allow me...

349
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,731
May I ask permission to kiss Thong?

350
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,651
Why do you say that, Mit?

351
00:25:02,771 --> 00:25:04,531
I have a secret I want to tell Thong.

352
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,811
Since the first time I met Thong at the bar,

353
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,691
I already love Thong. Does Thong know?

354
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:14,451
But at that time,

355
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:17,171
Thong is still next to Mr. Bun.

356
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:20,291
So I can't express my feelings clearly.

357
00:25:22,211 --> 00:25:23,651
The more we work together

358
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:26,811
I don't want anything related to love,

359
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:28,491
afraid that the job will fail.

360
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:30,891
But now

361
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:34,571
Thong no longer belongs to anyone.

362
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:38,291
The mission has also ended.

363
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:44,371
Please allow me to kiss Thong.

364
00:27:36,731 --> 00:27:38,811
Please request unit 7, unit 7.

365
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:40,771
You lost to me again.

366
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:49,851
Give it here.

367
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:53,051
This mango, please.

368
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:55,091
- Harmful food. - Play along.

369
00:27:55,571 --> 00:27:56,691
Loser.

370
00:28:14,931 --> 00:28:16,211
