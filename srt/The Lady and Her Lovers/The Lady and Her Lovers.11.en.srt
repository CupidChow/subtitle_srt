[Characters, actions, places and events in the film are hypothetical events.]

[No intention of sexual arousal,]

THE ROSE OF SIN

00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,639
THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 11

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
 Thongdee.

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,800
 Don't come here.

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,279
 You've hurt me too much.

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,279
 Tolerance also has that limit.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,760
 If you hit me again

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,759
 then I'll really stab you.

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,120
 You're very good.

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,120
 Stab me.

17
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:14,640
 - Don't come here. - You stab me.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,640
 I told you to stab me.

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,480
 Stab it.

20
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,926
 Thongdee.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,319
 What? Are you going to kill me?

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,919
 Are you going to kill me?

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,280
 Do you want me to die? Do you want me to die?

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,880
 - Thongdee you... - Calm down. I beg you.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
 Let go.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
 What do you ask for?

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,159
 You're just a hired person and you're going to blame your employer?

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,999
 Do you want to blame the owner?

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,560
 Dog clothes at the temple. Slaves.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,960
 Slave.

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,200
Yai you fight me back?

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Yai.

33
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Yai.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,839
- Thong help me. - How do you want me to save you?

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,679
If you're in pain, do whatever you want first.

36
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,720
Whatever you do, save it.

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,159
Wait Yai Yai. Stop.

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,399
Stop now.

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,399
What's up? Did you follow the plan?

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,560
Sister, why are you here?

41
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,080
Why did you tell me to visit Thong?

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,360
And I'll watch over you at home, right?

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,080
So what?

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,760
Yay Yay.

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,279
He tried to force himself away.

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,920
Call an ambulance first.

47
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
- Thong. - What is the phone number?

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,880
Thong is calling, please wait a moment. Wait a minute.

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,480
Thong, I... I'm sorry.

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,000
What I do is because I love Thong.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,519
I don't want you to belong to anyone.

52
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,640
Thong.

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
Thong.

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,959
Does Thong love you? Thong.

55
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,879
Oh, why do you ask at this hour?

56
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm calling an ambulance.

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Mr. Wi.

58
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,520
Mr. Wi.

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,439
Wi.

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,239
Wi, Wi, my child.

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,319
Thong, what are you doing to my child?

62
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,319
What are you doing to my child?

63
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,439
I don't do anything.

64
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,640
Yai did it.

65
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,279
Wi, wake up baby.

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,199
Wake up, child.

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,160
Wi, my child.

68
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:54,280
Wi.

69
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,879
Woke up and talked to my mother.

70
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Wi.

71
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:58,439
Wake up, wake up.

72
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,200
Wake up, don't close your eyes.

73
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
This.

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,639
No need to be startled.

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,760
I came to help you.

76
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,080
Help with what?

77
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,360
You came to tease me, right?

78
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,359
I really came to help you.

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,160
If you want to escape, follow me.

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,800
Follow me.

81
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,280
My child, wake up.

82
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,680
My child.

83
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,320
My child.

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,680
My child. Be careful, be careful.

85
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,960
Come in.

86
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,799
Quickly clean up all your belongings.

87
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Don't leave anything behind, clean it all up.

88
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,320
Knife.

89
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,039
Let me take the knife and throw it far away.

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,959
Because the knife is the weapon used to commit the crime.

91
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,119
If the police find it lying around you, you're out of luck.

92
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,879
Are not.

93
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,960
I threw it away myself.

94
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:35,600
Oh.

95
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,640
Clear it all out.

96
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:43,239
After I finished, I went to my room to take a shower.

97
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,719
As for the clothes, throw them away, understand?

98
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Go quickly.

99
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,640
Let me hide here.

100
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,159
Surely the police won't find me?

101
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,800
I don't know either.

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,800
Unlikely.

103
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,640
I could be charged with concealing a crime.

104
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,880
But there's no better place than here, right?

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,560
Thanks for helping me.

106
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,840
No thanks needed.

107
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,240
I help you

108
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,680
Not because I'm a good person.

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,040
But because I want you to agree to my proposal.

110
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,840
At this point, are you ready?

111
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,360
Do you want me to sell my body?

112
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
I'm not going.

113
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,240
It would have been better if you hadn't helped me in the first place.

114
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,600
Between jail time and prostitution,

115
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Which one do you choose?

116
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,800
Actually the work that I do

117
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,640
It's not as bad as you think.

118
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,400
Tomorrow, try talking to the boss.

119
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,360
Maybe the boss will have something good to offer you.

120
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,600
Or maybe

121
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,280
The boss will handle the case for you.

122
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,640
Life requires choices.

123
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,400
You must choose what is best for yourself.

124
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,600
But if there are no good things to choose from,

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,280
then we must choose the least evil way.

126
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,160
 What? Do you like this style?

127
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
 Like.

128
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,840
 I never thought I would be this beautiful.

129
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,760
 This is my true style.

130
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,240
 I feel like I have some strength.

131
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,360
 I saw this power a long time ago.

132
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,080
 I just woke it up.

133
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,039
 Therefore,

134
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,720
 you must know how to use this power.

135
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,040
 Because of the place I will take you to,

136
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,040
 is not like other places.

137
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,320
Not like other places.

138
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
What does it mean?

139
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,360
Is it that scary?

140
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,039
It may be so,

141
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,640
for the weak.

142
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,200
But for her,

143
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,200
I know you can do it.

144
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,960
Oh, oh, oh.

145
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,800
Is this the best you've found?

146
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,160
What a waste of advertising for you.

147
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,920
Turns out he captured a country boy and decorated it into precious goods.

148
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,200
Yes, my people

149
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,480
Not good enough to be your opponent.

150
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,399
So don't let me see

151
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,640
it's you,

152
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,159
you and all of you

153
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,480
bully my people.

154
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
Go, Thong.

155
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,480
Oh, Thong.

156
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,600
Now I know the people here are like this.

157
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,119
The mouth puts others down.

158
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,359
But in my heart

159
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,880
I'm afraid I won't be able to win against them.

160
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,880
That's why we use childish jokes to tease each other like this.

161
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,879
People like you

162
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,239
where I call you incompetent

163
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,440
but likes to brag.

164
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
I brushed your eyebrows

165
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,240
It's not because I'm afraid of you.

166
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,240
But because my personality is quite miserable.

167
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,640
I also tease dogs and cats near my house like that.

168
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,639
You're just a dog

169
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm just joking.

170
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't flatter yourself.

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
With Jan!

172
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,200
With Janrai!

173
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,680
This is a joke from me.

174
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,600
The next person you have to call mom.

175
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,040
Is it acceptable?

176
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,559
If not acceptable,

177
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,360
Then go home and sleep comfortably.

178
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,080
Life here is very harsh.

179
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,920
Not suitable for kids to come here to hang out.

180
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,280
This one!

181
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,640
Don't you dare get in my way.

182
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,119
And this old one!

183
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,800
Dare to spit in my face.

184
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,800
I will remember it.

185
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,240
That you said life here is harsh.

186
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,719
I swear.

187
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,039
That whenever I step foot on this place,

188
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,799
Life here will be a hundred thousand times harsher.

189
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,679
Especially with you guys.

190
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,080
With what you guys did to me.

191
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,360
And who else is here?

192
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,360
What else do you want me to do?

193
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,840
If you want to do it, do it right now.

194
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Do it?

195
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
No?

196
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,240
Let's go, Sister Si.

197
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,840
I want to meet the boss.

198
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,080
What's wrong, mom?

199
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,319
Just experimented with it a bit.

200
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,480
How much is it?

201
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,959
Still not confirmed.

202
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,000
It's still calm.

203
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,439
Si must have reminded you carefully,

204
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't rush into a fight on the first day.

205
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,000
To the point where I spit in his face, he remained silent.

206
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,359
Remember to keep a close eye on these two anytime, anywhere.

207
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,079
If there is any progress,

208
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,679
Remember to notify me immediately.

209
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,160
Yes.

210
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:23,353
Hello!

211
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,240
This is Thong.

212
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,520
Come closer and say hello to the boss.

213
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
No need.

214
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,880
I want to see the overall picture first.

215
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,160
Hello sir!

216
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,160
Let's try spinning around.

217
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,520
Come here!

218
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Sit here.

219
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,840
Sit close to him.

220
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
This!

221
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
I like it!

222
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Exquisite.

223
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
What's your name?

224
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
Thong.

225
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Thongdee.

226
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Thongdee?

227
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,880
 The name resembles your grandmother's.

228
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,400
 Sounds like an old person's name.

229
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,480
 Here you go.

230
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,596
 I'll call you Thong.

231
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,720
 I'll let you do it

232
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,840
 your main concubine.

233
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,360
 Do you agree?

234
00:14:58,152 --> 00:14:59,152
 I agree.

235
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,520
But Thong wants to ask you

236
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,240
two things okay?

237
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,040
What please?

238
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,040
Try saying it.

239
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
First thing,

240
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,760
Thong please do not receive guests.

241
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,440
Thong only wants to serve him alone.

242
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,760
Second thing,

243
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,279
You must forbid everyone in the bar from bullying Thong.

244
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,880
If you give Thong those things

245
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,760
then Thong will accept to be his concubine.

246
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,959
You dare put conditions on me?

247
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Who does she think she is?

248
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,120
You dare to make a deal with me?

249
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,159
That's not true, Mr. Bun.

250
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,279
That's not it.

251
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,719
That's all she asked, if it doesn't work then it's okay.

252
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,080
Shut up.

253
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,040
Try talking.

254
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Speak.

255
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,200
Those are not conditions, Mr. Bun.

256
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,640
That is a request.

257
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,920
If you give Thong,

258
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,680
Thong will thank you very much.

259
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,160
It was she who told me just now

260
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,159
If I can't give it.

261
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,479
Meaning if I don't give it

262
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,880
then you won't accept?

263
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,280
There are many choices, right?

264
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,640
I heard the news.

265
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,520
You just escaped a case, right?

266
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,240
What right do you have to choose?

267
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,280
Dear Thong.

268
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,840
If you don't come back to me

269
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,560
Who will I live with?

270
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,160
I have no place to go anymore.

271
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,320
 Thong, apologize to Bun immediately.

272
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,360
 This is not the time for her to be upset.

273
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,799
 Mr. Bun made her his main concubine

274
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,280
 is very good.

275
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,760
 - Apologize. - Don't yell at her.

276
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
 Kind of like this

277
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
 I like it.

278
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,760
 If you dare to make a deal with me

279
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,000
 means you

280
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,200
 know that you are valuable,

281
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,200
 not everything is acceptable.

282
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,240
 It's just like you do business.

283
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,000
 I refuse to let anyone take advantage of me.

284
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,760
 Don't accept letting anyone push your head.

285
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
 Agree.

286
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:19,293
He agreed.

287
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,280
Thank you Mr. Bun.

288
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,680
But he only accepted the first one.

289
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,640
I accept that I won't let you attend guests

290
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,360
because you want your stuff

291
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,200
always fresh.

292
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,880
Otherwise it's loose.

293
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,520
Do you understand?

294
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,440
The remaining conditions,

295
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,040
Tell me to go tell others not to bully you

296
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,760
you can't ban it.

297
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,760
I still believe that statement

298
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,280
life is a struggle.

299
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,520
The enemy is power.

300
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,080
If you don't have any obstacles in life

301
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,280
life is very boring.

302
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,120
Please listen carefully to my words.

303
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,400
If someone comes and slaps me in the face

304
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,720
Then I used my foot to kick him in the face.

305
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,160
You won't lose anything.

306
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Do you understand?

307
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,520
Thank you Bun.

308
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,520
Thong thanks Mr. Bun.

309
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,680
Thong will act as his concubine

310
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,440
so good.

311
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,280
And Thong will

312
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,440
Apply his teachings.

313
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,640
So can we try it together?

314
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,040
Looking from the outside, I didn't know there was a room like this anymore.

315
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,960
The light is like what Thong sees on TV.

316
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,160
Why do we have to hide it in the basement?

317
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,200
This is Naka Cave, his residence.

318
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,280
The room is a secret room, no one can find it.

319
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,520
If someone sneaks in

320
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,720
There are many exits here.

321
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,640
Have some wine?

322
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
Thank you.

323
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,200
Do you have many enemies?

324
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,520
That's why you're hiding in a secret room like this?

325
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,880
As many friends as there are enemies.

326
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,640
Be friends today,

327
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,920
Tomorrow can also become enemies.

328
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,120
This room,

329
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,120
I've never brought my friends here to visit.

330
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,120
Very few people get in here.

331
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,560
But you brought Thong here.

332
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,040
I'm not afraid

333
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,080
Will Thong be your enemy one day?

334
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,000
If Thong is your enemy

335
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,520
then Thong will be the most adorable enemy.

336
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,720
I'm not afraid.

337
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,999
But if one day Thong has bad intentions

338
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,720
or want to betray you

339
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,199
Then Thong will die by your hands

340
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,840
before thinking of a plan to betray.

341
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,680
If you're not good at it

342
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,640
You wouldn't be able to make it to this day either.

343
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,359
But if you treat Thong well,

344
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,119
Take good care of Thong

345
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,240
So how dare Thong betray him?

346
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,520
Really sweet mouth.

347
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
First time drinking?

348
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,960
Yes. Normally I just drink normal wine and beer.

349
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,480
As your person, your throat must be very good.

350
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,800
I will teach you to drink everything.

351
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,360
And this too.

352
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,439
Mr. Pisai.

353
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,119
I bring another one here.

354
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,039
 To stir up the atmosphere a bit.

355
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,559
 Oh, I like it, come with me.

356
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,000
 Come dance together.

357
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
 Mom.

358
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,640
 Where is the new girl?

359
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,520
 Why not let him out to receive guests?

360
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,759
 Oh, he entered the boss's room in the afternoon,

361
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,840
 couldn't see its face.

362
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,480
 At this hour, the boss may have beaten you to the point that you can't get up.

363
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,039
 Malee, where are you going?

364
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,679
 Then go see what happened.

365
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,519
 By this time, it might have eaten the boss completely.

366
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,760
 No need to go.

367
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,800
 Let me tell you.

368
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,520
 The boss has just allowed Thong to be his main concubine.

369
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,200
And now the tycoon is probably enjoying the new stuff.

370
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,720
I think

371
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,160
If you come now to bother the boss

372
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,160
Maybe the boss will kick you out.

373
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,440
The tycoon's regent?

374
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,640
With that face, do you want to be the boss's main concubine?

375
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,440
Whoever believes will give birth to a monkey.

376
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:15,632
Except.

377
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
With Jan.

378
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,920
Mr. Pisai wants to sing a duet.

379
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,159
- Is that right, Mr. Pisai? - That's right.

380
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,439
What song are you singing?

381
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,119
Nok Khao Khu Rak.

382
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,360
Jan's true lesson. Come, Jan.

383
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,160
The boss is already in there.

384
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,320
If something happens, wait for the boss to come out and talk.

385
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,160
I have something to say right now, open the door.

386
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,960
Even though I volunteered to "blowjob" with you

387
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,279
I won't open it for you either.

388
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,920
If you try to open the door, the boss will beat you to death.

389
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,919
Then go in and talk to the boss

390
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,879
that I came to blow the boss's trumpet.

391
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Let's see if the boss will let me in.

392
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,639
 [Severe effects of stimulants]

393
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,440
 [to consciousness, body and brain.]

394
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
How?

395
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
How do you feel?

396
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,480
Gather Thong's lifelong happiness

397
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,040
I'm not as happy as this moment.

398
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,120
Stay with me

399
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,840
will have endless happiness.

400
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,600
Because you are the producer of happiness

401
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,520
biggest here.

402
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,000
The Pacific Ocean too.

403
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,840
Boss, Malee came to find me.

404
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,640
Do I need to bring it up?

405
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,440
Thong, what's wrong?

406
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,240
Do you want her to come in?

407
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,080
Or do we not want her to come and hinder our happiness?

408
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,280
It's okay. Just let it in.

409
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,720
Also want to know what to do.

410
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Lead here.

411
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,240
Walk properly, the road is dark.

412
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,120
Yes, I know. I go to Bun's place more often than you.

413
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Come in.

414
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,040
At home on enjoyment,

415
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,720
When you get to use good stuff, you get high, right?

416
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,000
Looking at your appearance, it seems like you're in a bad mood, right?

417
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Take two or three breaths,

418
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,680
Your mood will be better.

419
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,160
But what if it's because of a trait?

420
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,280
No matter how good the product is, it probably won't help you.

421
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,640
You dare scold me in front of Mr. Bun?

422
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm Mr. Bun's top dancer.

423
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,000
You're just a newbie, don't be arrogant.

424
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,960
That's right, I'm the new chicken.

425
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,120
But I'm also Mr. Bun's top dancer.

426
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,200
Star? Enough to be proud?

427
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Mr. Bun, is what she said true?

428
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Real.

429
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,080
Is there any problem?

430
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,200
So where did Mr. Bun leave you?

431
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,599
I am wholeheartedly devoted to you.

432
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,720
Mr. Bun abandoned me

433
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,680
And let this crazy girl replace you?

434
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,159
So I sleep with you every second of every day,

435
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,120
Morning, noon, and night don't mean anything?

436
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,360
Except,

437
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,119
I'm really too noisy.

438
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,080
I'm still at my place.

439
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,200
Who abandoned you?

440
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,880
You are still my top dancer.

441
00:29:22,837 --> 00:29:27,000
THE ROSE OF SIN
