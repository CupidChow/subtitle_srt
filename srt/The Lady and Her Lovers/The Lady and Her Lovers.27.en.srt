00:00:36,977 --> 00:00:41,727
 THE ROSE OF SIN

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,360
 [Drinking and driving is a violation of the law]

4
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,840
Excuse me, have you seen this woman before?

5
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,360
Thank.

6
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,400
Thong.

7
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,320
Thong.

8
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,160
Thong, Thong.

9
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,880
Thong.

10
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,120
Thong.

11
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,120
Thong.

12
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,520
What are you doing?

13
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,720
Let's go to shore first.

14
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,000
Sit down.

15
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,280
Why do you do that, Thong?

16
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,280
Your life is very important to me.

17
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,080
And now it's not just me,

18
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,880
but there is also a life in my belly.

19
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,880
I don't intend to do anything like you think.

20
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,000
I just

21
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
I want to find something to torture myself

22
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,080
to forget the pain in my heart.

23
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,080
If it's so painful, why did you leave?

24
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,880
If we love each other, we have to be together, Thong.

25
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,520
Do you think being together like this will make you happy?

26
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,120
You have to see me arguing with mom every day,

27
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
drinking, getting drunk, not doing anything.

28
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,160
Constantly seeing that image

29
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,520
makes me think I'm the cause,

30
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,920
I am also suffering no less.

31
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,480
But the two hugged each other and cried

32
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,480
It's still better than crying alone.

33
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,440
Thong. Believe me.

34
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,280
Everything will get better.

35
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,000
One day mom will understand our love.

36
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,000
Come home with me, Thong.

37
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,000
Are not.

38
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,360
I've been through something like this before.

39
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,120
Love is not about two people.

40
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,440
Just loving each other is not enough.

41
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,520
If we keep trying to make it last

42
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,280
While knowing clearly that it is impossible, it will eventually fail.

43
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,840
I don't want something like that to happen to you.

44
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,280
So you have to believe that we can do it.

45
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,240
Our love will conquer everything.

46
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,840
I have to think like that first.

47
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,640
Are you ready to move forward with me?

48
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,920
(Sattahip District Office)

49
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,240
Congratulations. Now two people

50
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,760
are already legally married.

51
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,400
Wishing the two of you a lasting married life,

52
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,120
Let's love each other and take care of each other until the end of our lives.

53
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,120
Thank you.

54
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,600
Thong, smile.

55
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,400
We are already husband and wife.

56
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,800
We'll show this marriage certificate to your mother.

57
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,280
Let your mother know how serious you are about me.

58
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,040
At that time, please kneel and worship my mother.

59
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,960
And calls his mother mother.

60
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,160
Let's talk about your children too.

61
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,880
Tell her that you're really pregnant with me. If you use this method

62
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,760
I think my mother will be soft-hearted no matter what.

63
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,800
I will think positively.

64
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,040
Thinking that one day, my mother will accept you.

65
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,240
But what if she doesn't accept?

66
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,880
I will still smile and keep fighting.

67
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,920
I will behave well,

68
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
until she knows that I really love you.

69
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,760
That must be so.

70
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,560
My child, let's go see grandma together.

71
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,000
So let me call and tell my mother first.

72
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,200
Drive carefully, let me call you.

73
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,760
He saved his mother's name as "My mom".

74
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,680
See?

75
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,040
Which one?

76
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,840
MY MOM, that's my mom.

77
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,120
Come on, give it here.

78
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,080
Here it is.

79
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,920
Mont!

80
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,080
Mom won't say anything to you.

81
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,760
Until I heard that you broke up with her.

82
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,960
Hello?

83
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,520
See you, Mont!

84
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,240
Mont!

85
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,760
Have you woken up to accept the truth?

86
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,760
Yem. What happened?

87
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,440
Why did you slap me?

88
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,920
Answer me,

89
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,200
Why are you and Mont going to Chonburi?

90
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,600
Answer me.

91
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,520
I said goodbye to him,

92
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,200
Then he looked for me until he found me, then took me home.

93
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,920
Lie.

94
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,720
Why did you slap me?

95
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,040
When Mont is stressed, he likes to go to the beach.

96
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,720
I think he's the one hiding from you there.

97
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Then you flirt again to get him back.

98
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,080
You got him drunk, right?

99
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,400
If you don't believe it, leave it alone.

100
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,120
So what happened?

101
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,960
Mont's car had an accident.

102
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,080
The person involved in the incident said that Mont's car almost crashed into their car,

103
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,960
So Mont turned and crashed into the tree, following inertia.

104
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,160
So where is Mont?

105
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,240
Yes! Where is Mont?

106
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,120
Where is Mont? Where is Mont?

107
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,840
Is Mont okay, Yem?

108
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,640
Yem tell me, where is Mont?

109
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,360
- I have to go find him. - No need.

110
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,320
You don't need to go, stay there.

111
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,640
You listen to me, a good person like Mont

112
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I shouldn't have met a bastard like you.

113
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,960
Otherwise, his life wouldn't have turned out like this.

114
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Thong! You are an unlucky person!

115
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,160
- Oh, you! - You are an unlucky person.

116
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,400
Bait!

117
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,720
Oh, Yem!

118
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,680
What are you doing?

119
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,400
- You are an unlucky person. - Where is Mont?

120
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
Say, where is he?

121
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,440
Stop...

122
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,280
You can't hit a patient like that.

123
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,440
Let go.

124
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,920
You listen here, Thong.

125
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,560
I won't let you continue to live comfortably.

126
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,520
Bait.

127
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,160
Yem, where is Mont?

128
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,960
Bait.

129
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,360
You tell me right away.

130
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,400
- Calm down. - Yem.

131
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,280
Calm down.

132
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,400
The patient just lost a lot of blood due to a miscarriage.

133
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,120
Don't get too excited.

134
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,600
What?

135
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,040
Miscarriage?

136
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,880
That's right.

137
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:35,363
The accident caused injury to the fetus.

138
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:39,933
My condolences to you.

139
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,760
Let me go call the doctor.

140
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,960
Sister, sister.

141
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,120
What about the man who was hit by a car and was with you?

142
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,320
Which room is he being treated in?

143
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,040
Can I come visit him?

144
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,080
Do not have.

145
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,080
When the rescue team arrived, she was alone.

146
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,200
Is anyone at home?

147
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,480
Is anyone at home?

148
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,600
This is Thong.

149
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,960
Mom.

150
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,880
Did anyone hear it? This is Thong.

151
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,560
Mom.

152
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
Mom.

153
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,560
Mom, please open the door for Thong.

154
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,640
Mom.

155
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,920
Mom, what happened?

156
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,280
Mom, tell Thong what happened.

157
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,880
Where is Mont?

158
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,560
Mom, tell Thong where Mont is. What happened?

159
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,920
Thong is so worried about Mont that she can't bear it, Mom.

160
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,160
Tell Thong.

161
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,240
You wait, mom.

162
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,920
Mom.

163
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,400
What are you doing?

164
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,960
Get out of my house right now, you thick-faced, unlucky thing.

165
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,680
Mom, where is Mont?

166
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,840
Tell me where Mont is!

167
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,560
What's wrong mom? Why are you crying?

168
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,200
How is Mont?

169
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,240
What's wrong?

170
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,040
Why do good people have short lives?

171
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,080
and evil people

172
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,960
Are you still absent-minded and doing nothing?

173
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,000
This life isn't fair.

174
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
What did mom say?

175
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,840
I don't understand, please explain clearly, I don't understand.

176
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,200
My child died, what do you want me to say?

177
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,840
How long do you want to rub salt in my wound?

178
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,760
You've hurt me so much, aren't you satisfied yet, Thong?

179
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
You murderer!

180
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,280
Son Thong, you are a murderer!

181
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,920
Son Thong, you are a murderer.

182
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,560
You killed my child, Thong!

183
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,520
Thong, you murderous woman!

184
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
You made my child die!

185
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,800
[Montra Mansattha]

186
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,120
Mom!

187
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,600
Hello mom.

188
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,800
Go out!

189
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,320
I don't want to see Mont's soul

190
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,120
flirting with women like you.

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,760
I just bow to Mont.

192
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,080
After all, we are husband and wife.

193
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,760
Mont doesn't have a cursed wife like you.

194
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
Go away!

195
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,760
Go away, go away now!

196
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,040
Go away, Thong! Go away!

197
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,000
Go away!

198
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,600
Hey, Thong!

199
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,400
Dirty things! Why are you causing trouble with people at a funeral?

200
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,520
You look like that,

201
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,200
do you see?

202
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,800
You should respect other people's souls.

203
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,120
Go away, go away!

204
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,600
I won't let you bow to my child

205
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,080
so that in the next life it will be tainted by bad luck.

206
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,520
This life is enough.

207
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,440
I beg you, mother.

208
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,200
I just want to say goodbye to Mont for a moment.

209
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Are not!

210
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,800
I won't let you in at my child's funeral.

211
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,040
I won't let you in, you know?

212
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
You know what? You can't come in.

213
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,040
I won't let you in, Thong, you sinner!

214
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,360
Go away!

215
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
You cursed me too much.

216
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,040
Go to the temple regularly to make merit to accumulate virtue.

217
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,680
So you look down on others?

218
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,640
Yes, I am a person with karma,

219
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,080
But I don't violate the precepts like you guys.

220
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,440
Brazenly stealing my things. At first I didn't intend to ask.

221
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,720
But curse me for bad karma

222
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,680
then you have to demand it. Give me back my watch!

223
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,760
What's yours?

224
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,600
What watch?

225
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,160
Well, that watch is 10 million baht more expensive than mine.

226
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,160
I keep it in my bag,

227
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,040
When you returned it to me, I couldn't see it anymore.

228
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,920
Who would get involved with your assets, Thong?

229
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,560
Just hold your bag

230
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,600
I still find it disgusting.

231
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,160
So how do I know what's in there?

232
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,520
Religious people sometimes lie

233
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,560
That fake stupid face is so smooth.

234
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,560
If you don't take it, who will?

235
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,280
While my bag is at your place.

236
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,640
How do I know?

237
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,960
Lifeguards saved you

238
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,120
bring your bag back from the car wreckage,

239
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,760
then send it to me

240
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,400
so I give it back to you.

241
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,440
If only I knew how to be so resentful

242
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,320
I threw it away and won't give it back to you.

243
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,400
This is the property of the person who had the accident.

244
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
I've kept it all in here.

245
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,280
Do you want to open it and check first?

246
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,080
No need, put it there.

247
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,280
Hey, Thong, don't bring up other things

248
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,560
blame this on others.

249
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,040
No way. The priest is reciting sutras.

250
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,040
If you want to have merit

251
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,240
then you go out

252
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,960
Be a hungry ghost waiting for your share of merit outside.

253
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,080
Get out.

254
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,240
I don't really want to be here either.

255
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,080
I would like to say goodbye to my husband first.

256
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,640
I told you not to let you in, Thong.

257
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,600
- Thong. - You stop.

258
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,960
- Anyone is welcome, come help. - Stop, stop.

259
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,800
- Come here and help chase her away. - Mom, I just want to

260
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,640
Just say goodbye to Mont.

261
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,840
- Don't get involved with my child, go away. - Take her out.

262
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
- Let me go. Evil people. - You bastard.

263
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,560
- Take her out. - Go away.

264
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,600
Are not.

265
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
- Are not. - Send her away first.

266
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,680
- Let me go. I came to bow to my husband. - Drive her away.

267
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,760
- You guys let go. - Send her away already.

268
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,840
You guys treat me like that?

269
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,080
Chase it away.

270
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,800
Hey, you stop.

271
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,520
There was no one at the funeral to greet you.

272
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,400
Don't come back to his funeral anymore.

273
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,440
You don't respect the funeral director

274
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,480
Then you should respect it too

275
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,200
who passed away, Thong.

276
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,720

The wound has not yet completely healed.

282
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,720
If something happens, it will be a big deal.

283
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,160
Understand?

284
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,600
And

285
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Change into patient clothes.

286

I'm coming to see you, Mont.

297

00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,880
if Mont is no longer there

301
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,600
then asked Thong to take care of her mother.

302
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,200
Your mother is old,

303
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,560
There must be someone nearby to take care of you.

304
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,400
I want you to help me take care of my mother

I promise you that

307

I won't be angry or hate my mother no matter what happens

308

Today Thong is my mother's official daughter-in-law.

as Mont had begged

315
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,040
Then don't come back and show me your face again.

316
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,440
Go out.
