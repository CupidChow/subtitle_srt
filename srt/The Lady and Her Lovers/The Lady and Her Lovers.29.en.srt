1
00:00:00,113 --> 00:00:01,366
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:39,821
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,160
You know how to ride a horse, right?

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,680
Can ride.

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,000
What about French?

6
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,880
Know.

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,680
How about playing the piano?

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,360
Know how to play.

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,080
That's good, no matter what he asks

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,440
Just answer and you'll know in advance.

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,360
To increase the chances of him choosing you.

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,520
If you have to do it for real when acting

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,600
then what should I do?

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,400
It's OK.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,000
If he chooses me, we'll go to school later.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,120
Don't forget what I told you.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,880
I remember.

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,640
No matter what, don't sacrifice yourself.

19
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,280
Dam.

20
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,920
Damn, I'm here.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,000
Wait a minute, I'll be right down.

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,920
Hello.

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,440
How are you? Long time no see.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,440
I'm fine, how about you?

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,640
I'm so busy with work these days. Just now I was still editing.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,320
Customers are so demanding.

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,640
There's no time to rest.

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Come on.

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,120
Still better than no job.

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,440
Thong, this is Dam, a junior in college.

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,920
Hello Mr. Dam.

32
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,760
Hello.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,440
Dam, this is Thong, the new person I'm managing.

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,240
Really?

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,920
Is she the one in the photo?

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,280
That's right, it's a person.

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,520
Really? Don't you have work these days?

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,400
What's wrong?

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,880
Skills have decreased a lot.

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
Taking pictures of her is nothing like in real life.

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,440
She is much more beautiful in real life.

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,960
Damn, you really haven't changed.

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,120
You teased her and I didn't say anything, but you still stabbed me.

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,600
But is it true?

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,880
Thong, don't listen to him.

46
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,000
Whoever you bring to him, he will say the same thing.

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,960
Not everyone I praise.

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,120
I'm telling the truth, Thong is very beautiful.

49
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,600
Are you ready today?

50
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,760
What are you ready for?

51
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,640
Well... I auditioned today.

52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,640
Damn, please forgive her.

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,640
Don't do anything to her.

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,240
She is still very new, still very innocent and pure.

55
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,960
If you're unlucky, she'll be haunted.

56
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,280
How are you? Why do you think it's so far away?

57
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,680
I just wanted to give her an audition.

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,000
Not planning to do anything.

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,920
If she doesn't agree, that's fine.

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,240
Hey, hey, hey, whether you agree or not is another matter.

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,960
Dam. Be a little more professional.

62
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,680
You are the director. You "eat" your actors

63
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,840
it doesn't fit the rules.

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,840
That's because I'm the director

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,080
So I can control everything.

66
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,920
I only bring new people,

67
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,520
You do your job right.

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
He has come to me, I can do whatever I want.

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,160
That's it.

70
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,320
This movie is called "Castle of Desire".

71
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,040
The female lead's name is Linin.

72
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,480
Linin is someone who accepts everything

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,800
to achieve your own goals.

74
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,320
Today I will

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,080
Test your acting skills.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,640
We will perform spontaneously.

77
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,080
What are you acting?

78
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Improvisational performance.

79
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,120
It's a random performance, not according to the script.

80
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,320
He will be the one to determine the plot.

81
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,120
The two of us will take on the roles

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,080
is the character who will appear in that story.

83
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,200
Just like when I was a kid playing family

84
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,560
or sales, something like that?

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
Think whatever you want.

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,040
But things will be more serious than that.

87
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,440
Suppose you are a man

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
which I really want to have.

89
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,280
But I don't care about you.

90
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
Today's goal

91
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,640
I have to win you over by all means.

92
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,320
Let's try it.

93
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,640
Okay.

94
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,640
You will sit comfortably in your home.

95
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,200
Then I go in, after that I just act as I want.

96
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,400
Is that Okay?

97
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,360
Do you think I'm beautiful?

98
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,640
Also beautiful.

99
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,240
But you don't need to use beauty to tie me down.

100
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,800
Because no matter what, I won't fall for you.

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,520
So which woman have you seen?

102
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,680
more beautiful than me?

103
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,840
Absolutely yes.

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,160
I have met many beautiful women.

105
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,560
Why ask like that?

106
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,720
Because I know beautiful women like me are not easy to find.

107
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,880
And all men want me.

108
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,880
And I also know that

109
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,920
he also wants to have me.

110
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,720
She really knows my personality very well.

111
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,880
Then I think... we...

112
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,640
You also have to know what I really think in my heart.

113
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,240
I want to have you

114
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,600
not because of love

115
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,840
but because of money.

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,000
When will I receive money from you?

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,800
then you will have me too.

118
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,240
Is my acting okay?

119
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,640
Hey, Thong, tell me now.

120
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,120
Did he do anything to Thong?

121
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,120
Yes.

122
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,160
See? I told you, don't give yourself to him.

123
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,200
Then I won't sacrifice myself.

124
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
He just asked me to take on the role and act a little. That's all.

125
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,560
Really?

126
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
Just acting?

127
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,120
Yes.

128
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,280
Why did Dam choose you as the female lead so easily?

129
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,560
Normally, whoever he chooses must "pass" him first.

130
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,560
Is it because I act well?

131
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,960
Maybe so.

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,440
Prepare well tomorrow,

133
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,000
I will take you to meet Ms. Dao. Bring her to meet me.

134
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,280
Who is that? Miss Dao?

135
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,560
The person who will allow me to be the main actor in this movie.

136
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,000
Dam is just a director.

137
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,040
His mission is to bring the actor to introduce to Ms. Dao

138
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,400
Let her decide again.

139
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,000
Because Ms. Dao is the director of the filmmaker.

140
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,680
Oh.

141
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,080
So what if Ms. Dao doesn't like you?

142
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,480
then I have to endure it.

143
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Will definitely like it. Trust me.

144
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,480
Because Dam and Ms. Dao are lovers.

145
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,480
Whatever Dam said, Ms. Dao believed it all.

146
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,160
Mr. Dam already has a lover, but is he still having sex with an actor like that?

147
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,680
That's just how bad he is.

148
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,880
I warned you before. Absolutely do not get involved with Dam's name.

149
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,920
Because if Ms. Dao knew

150
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,440
I will definitely be kicked out of the world.

151
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
One more thing is

152
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,680
Ms. Dao is not only the director of the filmmaker's side

153
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,200
but also the station's daughter.

154
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,600
Hello.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,720
Mr. Dam is waiting in Ms. Dao's room.

156
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
Tomorrow there's an audition for Fai Varee, right?

157
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,360
Has Zaza cut her hair yet?

158
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,400
I can bear it.

159
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,040
But she negotiated to only cut it 2cm shorter.

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,520
So tell her thank you very much,

161
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,120
But there's no need to audition tomorrow.

162
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,400
You contact the new actor and introduce them to me.

163
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,160
Speak clearly from the beginning,

164
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
that to play this role you have to cut your hair short,

165
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,040
If you don't want it, you don't need it.

166
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
Okay, Ms. Dao.

167
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,680
Oh.

168
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,200
Please.

169
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,160
Come on, give it here.

170
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,040
Come this way.

171
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
Please sit down.

172
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,520
Ms. Dao, this is the document that you need to sign.

173
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,280
This place.

174
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,880
Do you need to fire Jacki and let me take over?

175
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,720
Playing the role of a secretary is so good.

176
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,320
I agree with the dismissal thing.

177
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,000
But what if I told you what to do?

178
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,480
then this is not correct.

179
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,120
I just want to take care of Dao.

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Having a lover who is both beautiful and talented like that,

181
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,160
Who doesn't want to take care?

182
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,920
If you ask me to take care of you for the rest of my life, I'll accept it.

183
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,280
Is that right?

184
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,720
Dam.

185
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,040
Coffee.

186
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,520
I told you before, don't do nonsense at the company.

187
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,920
It's not good for subordinates to see.

188
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,520
Why is that, sister?

189
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,520
We're just in love,

190
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,840
What's wrong with expressing love to each other?

191
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,480
That's even better,

192
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,080
If someone sees it then goes to the police station and does something that will reach my father's ears

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,200
then let him know

194
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,560
that I really love you

195
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,600
And I won't be harsh on you anymore.

196
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,880
Dad doesn't care about love.

197
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,040
If you want, dad won't be strict anymore

198
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Then I'll do a good job.

199
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,960
If your movie has high views and has many follow-up projects,

200
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,320
Dad will automatically accept you.

201
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,640
This is this film project.

202
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,880
I'm sure this movie will be popular.

203
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,360
This new female lead

204
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,200
will bring the highest viewership ratings in the history of the second station.

205
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,040
Am I always that confident?

206
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,200
Sure. But if Ms. Dao is not confident

207
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,080
Then try going to see her.

208
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,160
I believe that Ms. Dao will definitely have the same thoughts as me.

209
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,000
Having met me, now you know

210
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,440
Why did he leave you for me?

211
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,560
Can't blame anyone.

212
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,680
If you blame her, blame her for being bland.

213
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
bored and annoying.

214
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,760
I know this is my fault.

215
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,920
But I beg you,

216
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,280
Can you leave him?

217
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,160
Because if he goes with you

218
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,440
Who will be the father of the baby in my womb?

219
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,600
Really goosebumps.

220
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,280
Oh my God. Excellent!

221
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,200
What does Ms. Dao think?

222
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,200
She plays dramatic scenes so well,

223
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,840
Actually, he can even act in romantic scenes.

224
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,400
Do you want to try it out?

225
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,120
Thong...

226
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
No need.

227
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,440
That's enough to see the potential.

228
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Do you see? I told you, this girl has potential.

229
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,840
And most importantly, I find it very compatible with our character Linin.

230
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,800
Can you see it?

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,320
I'll try pulling your hair up and see.

232
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,040
Can I fix it anywhere?

233
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,120
The whole face is real.

234
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,920
It's truly natural beauty, right when I was looking for this style.

235
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,880
So that means you agree, right?

236
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,440
Not yet. Thong, go into the room and talk to me a bit.

237
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,280
Damn! You think

238
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,400
What will Ms. Dao talk about with Thong? You know what?

239
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,520
I don't know, maybe it's just a personal thing.

240
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,360
Nothing.

241
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,520
Then hey...

242
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,000
I added a little bit to the story you told me.

243
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,760
From now on if someone asks, just answer like this.

244
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,400
It is forbidden to reveal. Come on, try reading it to me.

245
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,960
My parents went to work in Saudi Arabia when I was one year old

246
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,160
I should give you to my uncle to raise.

247
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,600
After that, I couldn't contact my parents anymore.

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,160
I grew up with my uncle until I was 18 years old, when he got sick and passed away.

249
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,560
I didn't have money to continue studying, so I went to Bangkok to find a job.

250
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,400
Work as a waiter at a restaurant.

251
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,400
Like that, people like something a little dramatic.

252
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,280
And that day, Mr. B came to eat

253
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,920
So we met by chance.

254
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,680
Then he invited Thong to take photos for his records.

255
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,720
That's how it is.

256
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,200
As difficult as life is, what a good start.

257
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,360
Did you see Mr. B say you just created a Facebook and Instagram account?

258
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:54,312
Yes.

259
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,640
Previously, Thong did not have a smartphone.

260
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,040
Thong regrets money, Thong wants to save money

261
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,400
to pay for room and tuition.

262
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,320
Mr. B just bought it for Thong a few days ago.

263
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,600
That's good, so that nothing unfortunate gets exposed.

264
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,360
Last question

265
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,920
before I accepted you as an official actor on the station.

266
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,520
I hope you answer truthfully. Is that Okay?

267
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,720
Okay.

268
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,560
Do you have anything with Dam?

269
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,920
What?

270
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,360
Answer me, I just want to know the truth.

271
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,360
To know how we will cooperate with each other.

272
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
Do you have anything with Dam?

273
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,360
Not yet. Nothing ever happened to each other.

274
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,160
So did he ever ask you to do that?

275
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,560
Yes.

276
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,560
First time meeting Mr. Dam,

277
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,960
He acted like he wanted something with Thong.

278
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,040
But Thong refused.

279
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,680
Thong doesn't like things like that.

280
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,680
If Thong gets the job

281
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,320
Thong wants to get it with his own ability.

282
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,080
Not to exchange my body.

283
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,560
Thank you, for telling me the truth.

284
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,040
The others all denied, saying they had never asked.

285
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,400
But those people already have a relationship with Dam.

286
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
They deliberately hid it.

287
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,640
Ms. Dao said this is good.

288
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,080
If next time

289
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,520
Mr. Dam said he wanted to have something with Thong

290
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,320
So what do you want Thong to do?

291
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,960
Refuse.

292
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,160
If he threatens to get his role back or whatever

293
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,720
There's no need to believe it, because the one who has the right to decide is you.

294
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,560
Ms. Dao said so, Thong also felt more secure.

295
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,400
Actually, at first Mr. Dam said he wanted to have something with Thong,

296
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,400
Thong was very scared.

297
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,000
Thong had never encountered such a thing before.

298
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,440
In the future, if he does anything, just tell me.

299
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,000
I will handle it.

300
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,360
Yes, Thong will let Ms. Dao know.

301
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,920
Then

302
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,200
Congratulations on becoming the new main actress of the station,

303
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,480
Thongprakai.

304
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,720
For the next three years, I will be the one to take care of you.

305
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,800
Both in terms of work and personal matters,

306
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,160
if it affects work.

307
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,160
But you don't need to worry.

308
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,920
We will take care of each other like family.

309
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,280
From now on, please watch me

310
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,840
like my brother.

311
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,160
Sign it.

312
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,880
Now I know that you also have to sign a contract.

313
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,080
This is just a procedure.

314
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,160
When the time comes, we will work together with our hearts.

315
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,360
We are like a family.

316
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,120
Any.

317
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,280
Sign it.

318
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,000
Let me read a bit first.

319
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,120
Fine.

320
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,720
Before signing anything, you must read it in detail.

321
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,360
I like it like this, very careful.

322
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,080
I read it and wondered where it was

323
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,120
then tell me.

324
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,200
I will explain.

325
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,280
Actually, I have never signed a contract before.

326
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,000
From what I read, I can see it.

327
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,440
If it's okay, please sign it.

328
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,800
[Thongprakai]

329
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,200
From now on, I will be the one to take care of you.

330
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,360
[Thongprakai]

331
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,440
Thong, this is Chris.

332
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,440
Chris, this is Thong.

333
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,840
Let's get to know each other, because you two will be acting together.

334
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,640
Have you ever seen him act?

335
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,040
Miss Linin, you tell me,

336
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,440
Why did she suddenly get promoted?

337
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Because of my own ability.

338
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,680
If it's because of work, then good

339
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,000
but as far as I know,

340
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,320
She uses her powers for other things more.

341
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,200
I feel so pitiful

342
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,960
when there are employees of this type in my company.

343
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,560
No matter what kind of story it is

344
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
then that is also my ability,

345
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,360
unlike you, working at a company

346
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,240
because he is the son of a tycoon,

347
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,480
but actually

348
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
don't have any abilities at all.

349
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,040
Regardless of those things

350
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,880
It's probably just as bad.

351
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,200
So do you want to try it?

352
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,800
Hey, wait.

353
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,280
- Yes. - I think this part,

354
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
When you react, you have to be more confident.

355
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,600
- Wait. - How?

356
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,680
Let me do it and see.

357
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,240
Now, let's do that last part.

358
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,560
Regardless of those things

359
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,560
It's probably just as bad.

360
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,080
So do you want to try it?

361
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,840
Huh? See?

362
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,200
Attack right away.

363
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,160
And when we act out the slapping and kissing scene

364
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,640
must be sure.

365
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,640
If you want to touch, you can touch.

366
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,520
Threaten, touch, entice.

367
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,120
Understand?

368
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,720
Try it once. Any.

369
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,160
Let's get a little closer together.

370
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,920
Look at the face again. Look at each other's faces and interact with each other.

371
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,840
Touch each other.

372
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,880
If I want a promotion

373
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,920
Who should I sleep with?

374
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,360
Don't be so quick to be silly.

375
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,640
There's something more stupid than that.

376
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,920
After all

377
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,280
person

378
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,680
can make me

379
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,960
reach the highest position?

380
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,440
Treat it already.

381
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,920
Cut.

382
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,400
Alright.

383
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,400
Take a break from filming.

384
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,320
Alright.

385
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,080
You guys take a rest.

386
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,360
You guys go out quickly.

387
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,360
He wanted to give instructions to the actors.

388
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,080
Let's talk to you a bit.

389
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,240
Let's talk outside, I just want to reapply my powder.

390
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,040
- You can work here too. - Mr. Dam.

391
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,040
Be careful, someone sees it.

392
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,760
Who will see?

393
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,760
There's only two of us here.

394
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,600
Everyone has gone to rest.

395
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,960
I think...

396
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
we...

397
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,840
have fun with each other

398
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,040
Is it possible to stay in this room?

399
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,560
What's wrong?

400
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,560
Just now

401
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,560
Sexy girl on the table.

402
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm so "hungry".

403
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,000
I don't want anything to happen.

404
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,240
What's wrong?

405
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,800
Now I'm satisfied with being the female lead.

406
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,800
Right?

407
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,120
Then your fame and fortune will also grow.

408
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,920
It's about time,

409
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,320
It's time for me to follow the contract.

410
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,160
Now,

411
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,200
It's time for me to repay you.

412
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
Hello.

413
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,400
Hello!

414
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,960
Hello!

415
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,800
- Hello Ms. Dao! - Hello!

416
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,920
We just took a break from filming.

417
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,600
Didn't know you were coming here.

418
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,960
Are you hungry? Let me call to order!

419
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,880
- I'm just a little hungry, I'll just eat some cake. - Yes.

420
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,720
Where is dam?

421
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,480
Probably still at the studio.

422
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,920
- Let me go call! - No need!

423
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,320
- Let me go find him myself, - Yes.

424
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,360
Where is the studio?

425
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,840
The meeting room.

426
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,320
Ms. Dao can follow the camera wire.

427
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,880
Give it to me!

428
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,360
Just once

429
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,760
it will be done.

430
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,800
Is that Okay?

431
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,200
Mr. Dam!

432
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,960
Mr. Dam, stop!

433
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,280
Stop, I'll tell Ms. Dao.

434
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,360
Are you really going to tell me?

435
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,080
Okay.

436
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,080
If you sue Ms. Dao

437
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,760
I will also lose my role.

438
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,440
It's a pity, isn't it?

439
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,760
I can't become a star.

440
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,280
Think about it, if you accept

441
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,440
just once

442
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,480
Then in the future I will take on the female lead role in all your movies.

443
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,880
Isn't it better?

444
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,800
A little later, while filming,

445
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,800
I'll just keep doing that.

446
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,800
He feels very similar.

447
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,520
That's it.

448
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,240
Ms. Dao came at the right time.

449
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,240
She acted very well.

450
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,680
She did very well, so I decided to

451
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,360
a bit more of Linin being raped.

452
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,040
Surely she can do it.

453
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,680
I had just finished setting up the scene and Ms. Dao went to watch

454
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,280
previous footage?

455
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Those scenes can be cut out for media purposes.

456
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,480
Let's go.

457
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:13,186
THE ROSE OF SIN
