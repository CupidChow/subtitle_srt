Episode 15

10
00:01:08,147 --> 00:01:11,160
Hey, guys! Tell me what,

11
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,000
Is this a theater or a temple?

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,840
Why is a nun here like this?

13
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,000
Mom, maybe he's not reciting Buddha's name.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,270
Maybe you're chanting a spell to chase away ghosts.

15
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,760
Dear nun!

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,040
Please pray for the guests to flock to me.

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,827
I'm hungry.

18
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,040
Give me something big and long, so my baby will be full.

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,240
That's what makes me happy.

20
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,280
With Jan!

21
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,440
Your sister Malee is on a dangerous mission.

22
00:01:52,854 --> 00:01:55,414
Don't you worry about him at all?

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,400
I'm sitting and reciting Buddha's name for Thong.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,280
And I hope it's a blessing,

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,225
I'll find your sister in a bit.

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,880
But what is this, you still come to disrupt my party.

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,600
You are truly as evil a monster as your name suggests.

28
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,476
I'm comfortable, don't worry about Malee.

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,120
Because I know Malee is smart.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,840
It can save itself.

31
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,440
It's not as stupid as Thong.

32
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,240
I have to let you sit and pray for me.

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,280
Hey, sometimes I chant the spell wrong.

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,920
Again, chant Buddha's name to send off the dead soul.

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,040
Evil people like you deserve this.

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,240
You!

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,720

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,051
 Let me go get a snack for you.

44
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:26,927
Malee, why do they look so confused and bewildered?

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,800
What did you do?

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,240
Sleeping pills, how did you bring them in?

47
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,520
Wherever I hide oranges, I hide medicine there.

48

What are you doing?

52
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,840
Give me your camera, give it here.

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,040
No, I won't give it.

54
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,800
This is my achievement, I won't let you take it away.

55

This is my achievement, you have plenty of water left to fish.

56
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400

57

Let me go.

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600

00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:24,502
You bastard, I thought I was despicable, but who knows, you're even better than me.

75

You come back here, Thong.

76
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,502

Please allow me.

- Get out. - Son Thong?

80
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,182
What about Malee?

81
00:05:58,502 --> 00:06:00,502

86
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:22,782
It's normal.

87

I'm just afraid if she dies

88
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:28,942

89
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:36,302

91

Thong is very good.

92
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:47,222
It's a pleasure to help you.

93
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:51,102
But don't forget the promise that the winner will get something?

94
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:55,662
You haven't seen Malee's picture yet, so how can you decide?

95
00:06:57,262 --> 00:07:00,422
Where did Malee go? Why don't you come together?

96
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:02,382

Did you slap me?

100

- You dare slap me? - Son Si.

101
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:18,702
- Malee. - Oh, let me go.

102
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:20,302
- Did you hit my brother? - Oh, Jan.

103
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:23,422
How dare you hit my sister?

104
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:42,822
Enough.

105
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:52,302
Someone told

106
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,302
Has anything happened yet?

107
00:07:55,782 --> 00:07:57,662
Thong stole my achievements.

108
00:07:57,662 --> 00:07:59,222
I'm the one who arranges everything

109
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:02,182
He drugged the others until they all collapsed, then he took out his camera

110
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,502
Then take the photo and then take the photo.

111
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:08,182
In short, I don't have any photos to bring to you?

112
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:11,342
Mr. Bun, he threw my camera into the water

113
00:08:11,342 --> 00:08:12,902
Where can I get the pictures to bring to you?

114
00:08:12,902 --> 00:08:15,662
He doesn't care what happened.

115
00:08:16,222 --> 00:08:18,142
Thong has a photo to send to you.

116
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:22,062
The photo is very beautiful, but I don't have a photo.

117
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:24,382
That means Thong is better than me.

118
00:08:25,582 --> 00:08:28,942
In short, Thong is the winner.

119
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:32,342
But boss

120
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:34,702
Thong cheated, she didn't do anything.

121
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:36,702
This is clearly Malee's photo.

122
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:39,342
Boss can't say that Thong is better than Malee.

123
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:43,622
This one is just a poisonous snake that specializes in taking advantage of opportunities.

124
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:47,022
I don't care how to do it.

125
00:08:49,702 --> 00:08:53,342
He only cares about the results. But it's good.

126
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,182
If Thong is a poisonous snake

127
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,422
Having a poisonous snake by your side is also very interesting.

128
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:03,422
More toxic

129
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:06,222
more interesting.

130
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:07,582
Right?

131
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,662
Thong will sink his fangs deep into the boss's body.

132
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:15,542
Boss.

133
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:18,982
The boss said

134
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:21,422
The boss will kick out the loser

135
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:23,742
from the position of concubine, right?

136
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:27,102
Effective starting today.

137
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,502
Are not.

138
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:41,422
Is it over?

139
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:43,102
End.

140
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:09,502
I don't lose to Thong.

141
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:11,662
I don't lose.

142
00:10:14,742 --> 00:10:16,062
but, but.

143
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:26,822
Malee, you have to remember this feeling.

144
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:28,862
You hate it even more

145
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:31,862
Then you will have to take revenge a hundred times harder.

146
00:10:34,022 --> 00:10:36,942
Mom, don't worry, I will definitely take revenge.

147
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:39,902
I will depose her from the position that should belong to me.

148
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:42,342
What will you do?

149
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:45,382
I will kill her.

150
00:10:46,782 --> 00:10:48,142
So it's so simple.

151
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:50,262
If she dies

152
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:53,622
then you won't feel the pain.

153
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:57,822
You must make her life worse than death.

154
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,262
Let her sit and look at you

155
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:04,582

Done yet? Very good.

I'll pay the rest extra.

161
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,022
If I see work I like

162
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:42,422
Then I will reward you more.

163
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:46,662
How? Is it broken?

164
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:49,622
It's all broken, mom.

165
00:11:51,582 --> 00:11:53,782

I want to ask something.

168
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,302
Just now there was a crazy guy...

169
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:06,182
Follow Thong and throw acid on her face.

170
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:09,742
Does anyone know about this?

171
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:15,462
No one accepts it, right?

172
00:12:17,582 --> 00:12:19,062
Bring him in here!

173

You just go!

174

Who hired you?

175
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,662
Throw acid on my chicken's face?

176
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:33,782
Just go!

177

That's right boss!

179

You are cruel!

180
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,502
Boss Bun, we have to deal with it!

181
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:56,342
But boss, don't you like it?

183
00:12:58,622 --> 00:13:01,462
Actually, I should praise you.

184
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:04,382
When you are a fighter, don't give in to the Thong easily.

185
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:08,782
I like it when you're a fighter,

186
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:11,462
but I'm very stupid.

187
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:14,422
When you hire an idiot to work for you.

188
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:17,662
What's wrong, what's going on?

189
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:20,542
Using incompetent types,

190
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:22,342
So how can it be done?

191
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,022
 Thong!

192
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:32,855
 [This is a violation of the law and should not be imitated]

193
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:34,662
Wait, wait.

194
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:36,222
I'm boss Bun's man.

195
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,262
Boss Bun's people?

196
00:13:37,262 --> 00:13:38,822
Yes, you know right?

197
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:41,062
If my skin gets any acid on it,

198
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:43,342
Your skull will definitely have bullet marks.

199
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:44,502
Who hired you?

200
00:13:44,502 --> 00:13:45,342
I can't say.

201
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:48,422
Help, drugs, psychotropic substances, cocaine

202
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,822
Whatever you take, I'll give it to you.

203
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:52,542
Take it!

204
00:13:53,662 --> 00:13:54,702
Thank you boss!

205
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:00,862
Thank you, thank you!

206
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,502
What to do now?

207
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,102
It dares to harm me.

208
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:16,062
How do you want me to handle this?

209
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:20,462
Well, Malee took revenge on the person she hated in the right way.

210
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:22,782
Where do you see what's wrong?

211
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:30,982
Are you surprised, Thong?

212
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:33,062
You've been here a long time.

213
00:14:33,062 --> 00:14:34,862
Don't you understand how to live?

214
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:38,542
If there is hatred, it must be reported. If you always forgive me,

215
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,102
When can you take revenge on me?

216
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:42,742
If you take revenge on me,

217
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:44,022
then do it.

218
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,622
I'm ready to accept it all.

219
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:51,022
Boss!

220
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:54,342
You are my pet chicken.

221
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:56,382
Yet someone secretly harmed me.

222
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,702
It's truly an insult to you.

223
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:00,662
I intend to forgive him,

224
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:02,942
without protecting me at all?

225
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:05,422
If anyone knows about this,

226
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:07,502
People will think you are "powerless".

227
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:09,622
When you let your chickens get bullied.

228
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:12,062
Where have you put your face?

229
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:30,102
 [Inappropriate behavior should not be imitated]

230
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:31,422
 With Malee!

231
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:44,017
 Are you satisfied? Your pet chicken?

232
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:47,026
Not yet.

233
00:15:49,222 --> 00:15:51,382
If it's still around,

234
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,142
That means you forgive him.

235
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:55,702
You have to chase it away for me.

236
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:59,782
How can I chase him away? There are rules here.

237
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:02,342
Once you get in, you can't get out. If it wants out,

238
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:04,182
then the only thing left to do is leave its body out.

239
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:09,942
You're right.

240
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,702
If he dares to secretly harm you,

241
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:18,502
Which means it doesn't look at you.

242
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,942
My condolences to you Malee.

243
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:33,262
Maybe he couldn't raise Malee.

244
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:36,902
Don't, Mr. Bun.

245
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:48,782
You are truly so lucky.

246
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,662
You are the first

247
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:54,022
when he was kicked out of here but was still alive.

248
00:17:00,142 --> 00:17:02,382
You owe me a favor, Malee

249
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,342
And don't even think about coming back to bite me.

250
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:07,022
Because I'm much more skilled than you.

251
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,982
I will never fail the station.

252
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:12,382
Go away and don't show up for me to see you again.

253
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:17,142
You thought wrong to save my life.

254
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:19,182
From now on when you're on the road

255
00:17:19,182 --> 00:17:21,182
Then worry and be careful for the rest of your life

256
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:23,422
Because I will always be waiting to hinder and cause trouble for you

257
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:24,782
until I win.

258
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:29,422
Yes, keep your strength and breathe.

259
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:31,582
I don't have the strength to speak but I still speak loudly.

260
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:34,902
Go home and apply medicine, it's pitiful when you see it.

261
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:37,182
Thong

262
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:11,622
Except.

263
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,502
Get in the car so I can take you home.

264
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:36,062
You really have an evil mind, right?

265
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:39,022
Seeing Malee being beaten before his eyes

266
00:18:39,022 --> 00:18:41,142
Moreover, he had a gun pointed at his head

267
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:43,942
and you didn't even think to scream for her once.

268
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:46,782
What are you shouting for, you idiot?

269
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:47,862
If I scream

270
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:50,102
then the Don will think I am complicit in him.

271
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,462
If I leave him alone like that, I will live to take care of him.

272
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:55,862
When both die, who will take care of whom?

273
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:58,342
Rain. Just making excuses.

274
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:03,342
It's good when you're put down and you're no longer anyone's mother.

275
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,342
Because you are a mother

276
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:07,782
They will protect their children better like this.

277
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:12,262
You also protect your children well.

278
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:15,662
Because me and Malee won't end up like that.

279
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:20,902
Lots of time, so good, right? Then you clean the floor.

280
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:23,262
When finished, go out and clean the customer's vomit outside

281
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,822
and clean the toilet too.

282
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:28,662
Because I have to go take care of my child first.

283
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:33,262
Stumbled on my feet.

284
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:57,542
- Here's some cold coffee. - Thank you.

285
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:02,222
I have a gift for Thong.

286
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:04,174
Open it and see.

287
00:20:09,294 --> 00:20:11,374
Ms. Thongprakai

288
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:12,654
Jarasruedee.

289
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:14,654
Who's name is that? It's so good.

290
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:17,094
This is...

291
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:19,094
Thong's photo.

292
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:21,477
This is Thong's new citizen identification card.

293
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,479
This is Thong's new name.

294
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:25,504
He changed both his first and last name.

295
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:29,054
What is Thong's new name?

296
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,054
Do you like Thong?

297
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:33,134
If Thong doesn't like it, I can change it.

298
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:34,694
I like it.

299
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:35,854
Please use this name.

300
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:38,054
Whatever the inspector gives you, Thong will like it.

301
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:43,334
Ms. Thongprakai Jarasruedee.

302
00:20:44,054 --> 00:20:45,334
It's so good.

303
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:48,054
Where did the Inspector get such a cool name?

304
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:50,734
Then when typing Thong's new name,

305
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:52,934
When I remember Thong's face,

306
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:55,334
seeing Thong's eyes sparkle,

307
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:57,334
he came up with the word Prakai

308
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,734
connected with the word Thong.

309
00:20:58,734 --> 00:20:59,963
And them,

310
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,494
Anyway, there is the word Prakai

311
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,494
so he wanted more from Jarasrue.

312
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:07,134
So took the word Dee from the old name

313
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:09,134
connecting behind the tail, forming Jarasruedee.

314
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:12,054
Just found out

315
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,294
that the inspector is also good at Thai.

316
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:17,614
If Thong was allowed to name it himself, there would be no way he would have such a good name.

317
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:20,774
So what about the old name?

318
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:22,054
What should we do?

319
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:24,054
He said he was gone.

320
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:27,614
From now on there will be no more girls named Thongdee.

321
00:21:28,214 --> 00:21:31,214
And here is the birth certificate and all important documents

322
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:33,894
to prove Thong's new identity.

323
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:39,694
Thank you, Inspector,

324
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,174
for giving a new name to Thong.

325
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:45,054
Don't want to believe that

326
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,334
the life of a naive child like Thong

327
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:49,334
met a good man like the inspector again.

328
00:21:50,254 --> 00:21:51,894
Stop devaluing yourself.

329
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:54,934
If something is not good, just throw it away along with the old name.

330
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:57,094
Now the name is Thongprakai

331
00:21:57,094 --> 00:21:58,574
Jarasruedee already.

332
00:21:58,574 --> 00:21:59,694
Thong's life

333
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,814
There will be more freshness.

334
00:22:02,374 --> 00:22:03,574
I will assist.

335
00:22:23,094 --> 00:22:24,294
What day is today?

336
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:26,814
More spicy than ever.

337
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:32,054
That comfort.

338
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:34,614
There's no annoying Malee,

339
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:38,174
That's why the emotions are so high.

340
00:22:40,094 --> 00:22:41,214
Really soaring.

341
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:45,494
Know so

342
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:48,734
would have chased Malee away a long time ago.

343
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:52,854
And don't make anyone else the number one dancer.

344
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:55,134
Otherwise, I don't know if Thong will be in a bad mood.

345
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:17,294
Do you think Jan is beautiful?

346
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:20,334
That's OK.

347
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:22,334
What's beautiful when you're old?

348
00:23:28,094 --> 00:23:29,934
Jan was also your number one dancer.

349
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:34,694
With that face?

350
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:37,134
She is the beauty queen of that province.

351
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:39,854
He took her from the stage

352
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:42,374
Come back to be my number one dancer.

353
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:44,934
The next few years,

354
00:23:47,174 --> 00:23:49,174
Si came here to apply for a job.

355
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:52,294
She is beautiful and captivates him.

356
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:54,574
I sent Jan down,

357
00:23:54,574 --> 00:23:56,254
then put Si in place.

358
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:57,854
Of course it is

359
00:23:58,614 --> 00:24:00,774
That's why Jan hates Si.

360
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:02,974
It's like hating your father and killing your mother.

361
00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:06,854
Also because of jealousy,

362
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:09,494
so Jan brought Malee to find him.

363
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:12,214
So Si failed again.

364
00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:16,254
And also because of that jealousy

365
00:24:17,214 --> 00:24:18,694
that Si brought you here

366
00:24:20,414 --> 00:24:22,134
Let me take Malee's place.

367
00:24:28,054 --> 00:24:29,334
I understand now, right?

368
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:31,734
Sooner or later

369
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:35,174
There will also be someone to replace me.

370
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:38,654
I know.

371
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:40,934
But I...

372
00:24:41,854 --> 00:24:44,294
Absolutely do not let that happen.

373
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:01,814
You guys probably know, Jan...

374
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:03,814
been kicked out of position.

375
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:05,534
And me

376
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:08,334
has become your big sister.

377
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:10,534
So,

378
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:12,974
You can't pass by and touch shoulders,

379
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:16,694
Or just look at me with disdain like before.

380
00:25:17,454 --> 00:25:21,094
You must respect me as a father and mother.

381
00:25:21,974 --> 00:25:23,094
Got it yet?

382
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:24,574
- I understand. - I understand.

383
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:27,614
After all, I'm your boss.

384
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:30,134
Just call me mom!

385
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,910
- Mom. - Mom.

386
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:33,174
Get bigger!

387
00:25:33,694 --> 00:25:35,174
- Mom. - Mom.

388
00:25:36,374 --> 00:25:38,214
Hey, Jan?

389
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:41,534
What's in your mouth?

390
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:43,334
Why don't you say?

391
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:48,374
You didn't give birth to me.

392
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:50,974
You are not my mother.

393
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:52,974
I didn't call!

394
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,374
But now

395
00:25:55,774 --> 00:25:57,094
I'm the manager of this place.

396
00:25:57,694 --> 00:25:59,414
You must call.

397
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:01,414
Honestly,

398
00:26:01,414 --> 00:26:02,614
tao

399
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:06,294
I'm not someone who likes to show off or coerce others.

400
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:10,454
But I want to give you a taste of being forced

401
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:12,734
Just like you did to me.

402
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,974
Are you willing to call me mother?

403
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:33,094
Hello sister-in-law, hello.

404
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:39,054
Are you willing to call me mother?

405
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:40,454
Are not.

406
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:42,094
Do you want to be my mother that much?

407
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:43,814
Then give me your breasts so I can suckle them.

408
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,814
- Jan. - You are.

409
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:48,174
Sister-in-law arrives.

410
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:58,094
Hello madam.

411
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:00,294
Hello.

412
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,534
The hostess comes

413
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:15,174
Are you no longer bossy?

414
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:18,494
If you're good, go grab the boss's head and force her to call you mom.

415
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,654
Your mouth is also good.

416
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,534
So are you willing to call me mom yet?

417
00:27:26,574 --> 00:27:27,694
Okay.

418
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:30,294
Mom!

419
00:27:31,294 --> 00:27:32,414
Let's go, kids.

420
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:43,374
- Mom. - Mom.

421
00:27:46,894 --> 00:27:48,934
This is all the money for this time.

422
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:50,934
Is this all there is?

423
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:52,454
That's right, ma'am, that's all there is.

424
00:27:54,054 --> 00:27:54,894
Take it away.

425
00:27:59,254 --> 00:28:00,414
Is Mr. Bun here?

426
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:02,014
Mr. Bun is in the room.

427
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,254
Madam, please come this way.

428
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:05,574
Have you resolved this year's protection money yet?

429
00:28:06,094 --> 00:28:07,574
Don't let it be like last time.

430
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,294
If a problem occurs again

431
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:11,294
I will probably change to someone else.

432
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:13,294
Like that.

433
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:17,934
I sent the bag of money away.

434
00:28:18,534 --> 00:28:19,934
How much did you get this time?

435
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:24,134
30.

436
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:27,574
Why so little?

437
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:28,894
How are you selling "goods"?

438
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:30,454
Why are there less and less?

439
00:28:30,454 --> 00:28:32,494
I really tried.

440
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:34,413
It should have been 50,

441
00:28:34,665 --> 00:28:35,734
but lately

442
00:28:35,734 --> 00:28:37,654
There are too many insiders.

443
00:28:37,654 --> 00:28:40,054
The police kept flirting everywhere.

444
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:42,174
I still have to pay interest at the end of the term.

445
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:43,614
How much is spent?

446
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:45,014
Damned.

447
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:27,133
THE ROSE OF SIN
