THE ROSE OF SIN

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 05

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
 Hey little brother.

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,120
 You pushed me just now and it still hasn't been resolved.

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,320
 Okay.

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,840
 Want to solve it, right? Then it's resolved.

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
 Pete.

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
 Oh, Pete.

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
 Come here.

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
 Pete don't.

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
 Pete.

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
 Come here.

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,800
 You are scum.

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
How much is left?

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,080
 If I didn't have to pay for your dental work and wound treatment,

22
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,560
 is still 3,200 baht.

23
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,359
Now there's only 1,000 baht left with an additional 100 baht in change.

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,800
 If we don't quickly earn more, we won't be able to stay long.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,560
What are you doing?

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Why don't you drink water?

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,119
Can you stop acting so poor in front of me?

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,560
Go buy a pack of water.

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,360
This photo here.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,520
This is my son named Pete, real name Petesut.

31
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:50,404
Have you ever seen its face?

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,439
I have never seen it. Please try asking the staff here.

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,920
The office is over there.

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,160
Yes, thank you.

35
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Dad.

36
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,640
Star? Is it sweet?

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is it delicious?

38
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,000
Delicious, dad!

39
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,240
Dad drove to buy it at Suan Panit.

40
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,400
What's wrong with your face?

41
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,240
Causing trouble with someone?

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,720
Just a little, dad.

43
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,160
Be careful.

44
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,000
The people here, I don't know what they are like, they're not like those in my hometown.

45
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,000
How do you live? Where to spend money?

46
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,640
Thong a little.

47
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,720
Thong has a sum of money with him.

48
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Pete!

49
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,040
If you have any problem, you can tell dad.

50
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,480
Do you have any problems with your father?

51
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,520
That's why I have to avoid you like that.

52
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,520
I just want to come and stay with Thong.

53
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,920
Dad!

54
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,520
Just because of a girl?

55
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,400
Well... it's up to you.

56
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,520
Remember this, my child.

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,880
Someday I want to go home,

58
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,600
My family is always waiting for you to come home.

59
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,800
Remember clearly, Dad is still waiting.

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,840
So... how did you find me?

61
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,920
Dad asked his friend who is a police officer to investigate my car registration for him.

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What?

63
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Do the police know where you are?

64
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,520
Know.

65
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,520
Dad went to report missing people, so they could help find him.

66
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,640
So, do you know about...

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,240
Oh, how are you doing?

68
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:54,640
What news did you hear from them?

69
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,480
Did you go buy water in another district or why did it take so long?

70
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Your father comes.

71
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,440
Really? Where? Where is he?

72
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,680
You said he's gone home.

73
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,880
He said that the two of us are still living well.

74
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,120
Did he say anything about your mother?

75
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
How is your mother?

76
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,720
Just like we thought.

77
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,800
My mother is dead.

78
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
What?

79
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Say it again.

80
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,400
My father came to my house looking for us.

81
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,760
And dad saw my mom

82
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,920
lying dead on the floor.

83
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,520
When the police arrived they concluded that

84
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,360
My mother died because she fell down the stairs.

85
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Thong.

86
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,120
My condolences.

87
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,000
Condolences?

88
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,160
Why should I be sad when she dies?

89
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,560
I should be happy.

90
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,920
Not right, not right.

91
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm still in debt to her.

92
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,079
She said I owe her 10 million baht.

93
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,520
If she's dead, how can I repay the debt?

94
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,640
The creditor is dead.

95
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,920
The debtor does not need to pay the debt anymore.

96
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,999
 Don't think too much, Thong.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,679
 Why don't you think much? How can you not think?

98
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,439
 She said she was my master.

99
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,119
 If you don't pay her debt,

100
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,280
 then your whole life will be in her hands.

101
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:55,692
 But now she's dead. Who are you going to pay the debt to?

102
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,560
 Yes, that's right. So that means

103
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,879
 you will never be in control of your life.

104
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,400
 Does my life have to belong to my mother forever?

105
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
 No, no.

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,639
 No.

107
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,360
 Thong, Thong.

108
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,399
 - No. - Thong, Thong.

109
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,679
 Thong, Thong stop.

110
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,479
 - Thong. - Why?

111
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,759
 - Stop. - Why?

112
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,840
 Why is that?

113
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,440
Where is Thong going?

114
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,959
Go enjoy life, your own life.

115
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,880
Without worrying about anything.

116
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,000
This life is yours.

117
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,200
If you are born, you must use it to your advantage.

118
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,440
If you think like that then it's good, I'll go with you.

119
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,400
- Live life to the fullest. - No need to go, I'll go see Matt.

120
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
What to do there?

121
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,760
He beat me to death and you still came to find him?

122
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,920
But he's okay too.

123
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,320
Pete, don't think too much, okay?

124
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,400
If you want to live life to the fullest, you must have money.

125
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,759
Mr. Matt said if he worked as a car salesman

126
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,440
There is both salary and commission.

127
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:57,360
A beauty like you can earn thousands of baht a month.

128
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,680
But he took a gun and pointed it at his head.

129
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,439
You can't go work for someone who almost killed your husband.

130
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,480
I won't let you go.

131
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,120
My life, I choose it myself.

132
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Thong.

133
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Oh.

134
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
I'm your husband, listen to me.

135
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Husband?

136
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Besides giving orders

137
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,480
Then help me earn money to spend.

138
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,800
If not possible

139
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
then don't give orders.

140
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,400
Hello Matt.

141
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,040
How long has it been?

142
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
It's been a while.

143
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,360
So, Thong, please allow me to sit together.

144
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,680
I thought

145
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
It's better not to.

146
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,080
I don't want anything like last time.

147
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,880
Tonight my lover Thong won't come.

148
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,120
And I apologize on his behalf too.

149
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,280
He was very drunk that day.

150
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,000
It always becomes like that when you get drunk.

151
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,920
But he's not normally like that.

152
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
The thing is

153
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I have friends to come along.

154
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,160
It's better for Thong to find someone else.

155
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,120
Story of being a salesperson in a showroom

156
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,759
What day should I call to register?

157
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,960
Is tomorrow always possible?

158
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
The thing is...

159
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,600
His job as a salesman.

160
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,799
Thong had to bring the car to the customer for inspection,

161
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
have to go out of province,

162
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,280
I have to go back to sleep.

163
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,720
His main customers

164
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,560
is a man.

165
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,720
Thong is probably not suitable.

166
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,400
Thong learns to drive a bit and knows immediately.

167
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,600
Going out of province is not a problem.

168
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,599
And talking to customers is a man

169
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,840
That's Thong's job.

170
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,880
Subscribers like Thong

171
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,280
I don't have any problems but...

172
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Thong's lover

173
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,440
if someday he

174
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,680
angry,

175
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
jealous,

176
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,080
Pushing customers, hitting his customers in the face

177
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,120
then who will be responsible?

178
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
I think

179
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's better not to.

180
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Let's go.

181
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,560
Why did you agree to do this today?

182
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,000
Have you stopped loving your lover?

183
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Love it.

184
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,640
Love you so much,

185
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,400
so I just did it.

186
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,160
I want money to take care of her.

187
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,320
Want her to be proud of me.

188
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,200
Surely she will be proud of you.

189
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Thank you.

190
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,400
I also thank you.

191
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,240
 When I see you stressed,

192
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,800
 thought he had fainted.

193
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,760
But I didn't expect it

194
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
 when entering the battle

195
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,400
 means working without stopping.

196
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,840
 At first I didn't think I could do it.

197
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,160
 This is the first time

198
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
 I did it in exchange for money.

199
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,920
 I see

200
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,440
 the two of us

201
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,560
 are very compatible with each other.

202
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:06,248
 Let's do it again next time, okay?

203
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,240
 So...

204
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,353
 When do you plan to call me again?

205
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
 I don't know.

206
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,120
 Depends on the mood.

207
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,800
 For you,

208
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,480
 Sex is not as necessary as eating rice, it is necessary every day.

209
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,680
 Wait until you're in the mood again

210
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,680
 I don't know when.

211
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
 What?

212
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,280
 Money is not enough to support a wife, right?

213
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,440
 Thank you very much, Pete.

214
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,480
 If you need help with anything, just let me know.

215
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
 - Thank you. - Pete.

216
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,320
 Why did you go to her room?

217
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,280
 You're welcome.

218
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,000
 Ms. Si dropped her phone in the corner of the bed.

219
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,000
 So she asked me to come and lift the bed.

220
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
 That's right.

221
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
 In Pete

222
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,320
 has very good strength.

223
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,800
 Move the bed so hard that

224
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,760
 almost broke the leg of the bed.

225
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,600
And her hand

226
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,960
also very long.

227
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,880
Reaches the deepest places.

228
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,760
And use your fingers

229
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,440
slowly, slowly

230
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
move.

231
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:28,964
She was also very nervous.

232
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,120
I don't know if it can be included.

233
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,360
Is it possible to go deeper?

234
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,040
But she is very good.

235
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,800
Finally got it there.

236
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
But

237
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,400
finally got it out.

238
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,120
This old woman.

239
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,280
- Thong. - You're so loud, aren't you?

240
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,839
- Thong, stop. - Come here.

241
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,480
- Thong. - Come here, come here.

242
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,599
- Thong, don't. - This old woman.

243
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,120
Sister Si, don't do that.

244
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,599
My lover doesn't like that.

245
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Go, go into the room.

246
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,200
Her phone often falls on the corner of the bed.

247
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,920
Come by often to get it for me, Pete.

248
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,280
Don't bother helping her anymore.

249
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,600
I hate her face.

250
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,120
Can't we have some peace in rooms close to each other?

251
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:10,817
Don't mess with her anymore.

252
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
What if something happens to me?

253
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,400
need her help.

254
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,120
Are not.

255
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:16,834
Whether I live or die, I don't need her help.

256
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:18,648
How can someone like her help us?

257
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:21,328
Sit down.

258
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:24,302
Why should it be like that?

259
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,309
I said it myself.

260
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,883
Living in Bangkok, try to make as many friends as possible.

261
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:31,006
Can you not repeat it?

262
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,310
I'm in a bad mood.

263
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,226
You know what?

264
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:36,307
Matt just rejected me.

265
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,520
He's afraid you'll get jealous and make trouble with his guests.

266
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:41,018
Pete.

267
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,401
Tomorrow I'll go apologize to Matt.

268
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,720
What if he softens his heart and forgives?

269
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,080
If he doesn't let you do it, there's no need to coax him.

270
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,360
Have some self-respect.

271
00:16:52,182 --> 00:16:54,062
Is there only him in Bangkok?

272
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:56,449
It's okay to go to work with other people.

273
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Where did you get it?

274
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,520
My father sent it to me.

275
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,360
Dad told me to spend two thousand a week.

276
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Each person gets one thousand.

277
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:17,053
We can't live in Bangkok on this amount of money every month, Pete.

278
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,520
Go and apologize to Matt tomorrow.

279
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:22,211
I will work with him.

280
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:23,466
Are not.

281
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,360
Killing me won't apologize to the guy who wants to eat my wife.

282
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:29,485
Do you have a better way?

283
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Have.

284
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,120
Actually, her boss does many types of business.

285
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:39,933
There is a type of business that is booming.

286
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:43,886
They are also recruiting high-volume delivery staff.

287
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Do you dare do it?

288
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,136
What delivery?

289
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,640
Are you going to deliver medicine?

290
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:51,364
YES.

291
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,421
What should I do if the police arrest me?

292
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:56,035
Don't get caught.

293
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,812
This man is a big man, no one dares to touch him.

294
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,680
How much do they give per day?

295
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,400
Newbie like you

296
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,360
500 per order.

297
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,040
But if you order a lot in a day, you get a lot of money.

298
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Don't worry.

299
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
Just stay home.

300
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Making money

301
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
let him shoulder the burden.

302
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
I promised you already.

303
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
I will take care of you.

304
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
I will do it.

305
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,520
Be careful, Pete.

306
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:39,526
If I have money but don't have you,

307
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,852
I can't live either.

308
00:18:44,844 --> 00:18:45,844
It's OK.

309
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,506
The story of running away from the police,

310
00:18:48,315 --> 00:18:49,315
you're good.

311
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,880
Will there be a day when I can wear that outfit?

312
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,710
Not long now.

313
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,028
When I get the big deal, I'll buy it for you.

314
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:26,800
I will wait until that day.

315
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:35,871
 Yes, sir?

316
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,560
 Yes, okay.

317
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
 I'll be there soon.

318
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:41,849
 Yes.

319
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
 There's another shipment.

320
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,600
 Can I go home and wait?

321
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,240
 Can I go together?

322
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,600
 I want to know how to deliver the goods?

323
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,240
 I'll help you next time.

324
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,840
 No, it's dangerous, don't go.

325
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,480
 Go back to your room and wait.

326
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,080
 I'll give you money to spend.

327
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,080
 Let us check your driver's license and ID too.

328
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,960
 Park on the side of the road.

329
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
 Park your car.

330
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,679
 Park over here.

331
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,880
 Park, park your car.

332
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,520
 I really threw it here, bro.

333
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
 I don't dare lie to you.

334
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,960
 I know if I pull any tricks, you'll kill me.

335
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,799
 Who would dare?

336
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,680
 So where? Found it yet? I see you've been looking for it for a long time.

337
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:35,342
 Don't tell me the doll got up and ran away.

338
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
I think someone picked it up and took it away.

339
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,760
Yes, I believe you.

340
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,040
I don't blame you, come up here.

341
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,599
Still consider yourself smart

342
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,880
for throwing things away before being searched by the police.

343
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,360
I'm really sorry.

344
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,880
So let me work to pay off my debt.

345
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,800
I go home first, my wife has been waiting for me for a long time.

346
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,120
You still can't go.

347
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Why is that?

348
00:23:13,373 --> 00:23:16,333
The thing you throw away is not 2 baht.

349
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,960
That's 20,000 baht,

350
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,200
You have to compensate first before you can leave.

351
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:48,759
Happy birthday to me

352
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,040
Happy birthday, happy birthday

353
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,480
Happy birthday to me

354
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,160
Is today Thong's birthday?

355
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,960
That's right, today is my birthday.

356
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,404
I never told you, right?

357
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,440
I'm sorry, I never asked.

358
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,120
I'll take you to congratulate me.

359
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,200
It's okay, I celebrate my birthday every year.

360
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,880
Next year, I'll organize it for you.

361
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,440
I will remember that today is Thong's birthday.

362
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Pray.

363
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,400
Praying for you and Pete

364
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,520
Love each other for a long time, until the earth crumbles.

365
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,720
Pray for Pete to work and make a lot of money.

366
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
That's all I pray for.

367
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Happy birthday to me

368
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Thank you.

369
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,200
You are the best gift of my life, Pete.

370
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,120
Be so happy, Thong!

371
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,680
Let's eat cake, come on, sit, sit.

372
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
Is it delicious?

373
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Tasty.

374
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,520
Came home so late today.

375
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,040
Surely you get a lot of money, right? How much work is that?

376
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,040
Just one thing, I'll see the police again.

377
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,000
He had to throw things away to escape.

378
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
Really?

379
00:25:30,324 --> 00:25:33,284
But it's good to escape. It took a day, it's okay.

380
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,360
Thong, how much cash do we have left now?

381
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,760
About more than 20 thousand, oh no,

382
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,040
just over 10 thousand. Ah, here.

383
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,240
I just went to buy a handbag, is it beautiful?

384
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:57,164
When buying expensive things, why don't you tell each other first?

385
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,280
You have to use money to pay off your debt, you know?

386
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,079
Must pay?

387
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,839
YES.

388
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
How much to pay?

389
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
20 thousand.

390
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
20 thousand?

391
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,199
Are you crazy? Why throw away such expensive items?

392
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,079
If I don't throw it away, I'll be arrested.

393
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,239
Why don't you run away? Why do you say it's so good?

394
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,680
Turns out you're just a coward.

395
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,480
Don't curse me.

396
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,880
I only go out to take risks like that to make money for you to spend.

397
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,479
Are you still cursing me?

398
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:25,368
If you do something wrong, will I scold you?

399
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,440
I don't want anything to happen.

400
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,600
Don't curse me anymore. Go get the money back.

401
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,160
If I don't quickly return it to them

402
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,288
Then they will come here and beat you to death.

403
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,239
The bag already exists, so why would you buy another one? What is it?

404
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,360
Can you stop talking?

405
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,960
15,000 baht. Where to get another 5,000 baht?

406
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,799
Thong, Thong.

407
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,280
- Pete. - Thong, stop.

408
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,080
Thong, stop.

409
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,639
Pete, Pete.

410
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,759
Why are you so gluey? I just borrowed it to pawn.

411
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,640
If I have money, I will return it to you.

412
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I don't allow it.

413
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,800
You can take anything and pawn it, but not this.

414
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,160
Can you be a little more reasonable?

415
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,800
If I don't bring money to pay them, I will die.

416
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,000
Do you value that shake more than me?

417
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,239
This bracelet is proof that I really have a mother.

418
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,680
Mom gave birth to me.

419
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,640
I was not born from a bamboo tube and then taken home by Mrs. Gim.

420
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,800
Pete, I beg you. It's really important to me.

421
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,280
Yes, just 5,000 baht more, I earned it myself.

422
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,200
Let me borrow Si from the next room.

423
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Pete.

424
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,480
If you take it away,

425
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:08,444
How long will it take to redeem it?

426
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,319
Please don't use this bracelet to be manufactured.

427
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,800
I'll take it back, I'll come back next week to redeem it.

428
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,600
Only one thread, worth 4,000 baht.

429
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,480
Is 5,000 baht okay? Okay?

430
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,640
Okay, I see you're a regular customer.

431
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,919
So who will leave fingerprints?

432
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Me.

433
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,802
THE ROSE OF SIN
