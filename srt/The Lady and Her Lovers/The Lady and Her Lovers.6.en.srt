00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,799
Please don't use this bracelet to be manufactured.

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,280
I'll take it back, I'll come back next week to redeem it.

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,080
Only one thread, worth 4,000 baht.

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,960
Is 5,000 baht okay? Okay?

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,120
Okay, I see you're a regular customer.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,399
So who will leave fingerprints?

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400

 Here, take it.

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,800
 I've made enough money, where do you want me to take it?

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,360
 Yes, okay.

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,719
 Dear brother, today I would like to do a big job,

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,000
 Is it okay to do about two or three things?

21
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,680
 I borrowed money from someone so I have to pay it back quickly.

22
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,720
 Can't I ask?

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,680
 Give me the job, please.

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
 Hello?

25
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,080
What's up? What's wrong?

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,360
They said if they failed at their job, they would have to take three months off work.

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,639
What to eat now?

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,279
Just over 100 baht left.

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,320
Obviously it's because of your stupidity, doing things without thinking first and thinking later.

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,760
Can you stop nagging? You've been complaining for 3 hours.

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,120
Enough. I know. Let me earn money for you.

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,760
How to search? Sit and ask for money in front of the building?

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,040
I have my way.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,640
During this time, you should also limit going to the hairdresser.

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,520
What do you do every day?

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,120
One day it's curled, the next day it's straight.

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,640
The day after tomorrow, I'll go back to curling again.

38
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,800
You choose a style: curling or straightening.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,320
And your nails too,

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,160
How can you bathe with such long nails?

41
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,959
Pete, you won't let me complain

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,639
But you complain more than me.

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,439
It's all your fault.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,199
And don't forget to shake your leg, which I'll pawn.

45
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,799
Hurry up and get money to redeem it for me.

46

52
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,000
You heard it all.

53
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,600
Are you in the mood today?

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,680
At first, I was not in the mood.

55
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,840
But when I saw Pete's face...

56
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,680
 Were you stabbed or eaten?

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
 If you whine like that, show some respect to others.

58
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,239
 Just wait and see, when my husband comes home,

59
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,440
 I will moan a thousand times louder than you.

60
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,840
Shut up. I don't know if it's done or if it's dead.

61
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Where did you get it from?

62
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
No need to know.

63
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,640
I asked where you got this money from.

64
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Want to know what to do? If you have the face to spend money, just spend it.

65
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,480
You never cared

66
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,760
that I would risk life or death.

67
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,920

69

70
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,160

73
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,279
When you leave the room, Si starts screaming,

74
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,240
When Si is quiet, you come home.

75
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,039
What does that mean? What does it mean?

76
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,079

77

You tell me, you guys slept together, right?

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,160
- Pete! - YES. I slept with her and then went home.

79
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,319
Then she gave us money to spend.

80

To have money to eat, this is two thousand.

81
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,119

84
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,119
Why? You leave this room and go into that room.

85
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,519
You've trampled my heart so much.

86

What the heck is trampling?

88
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,080
I'm going to make money for you to spend, so what am I doing wrong?

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,559
I never told you to make money this way.

90

00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,200
I have never been angry with you.

184
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,640
No matter what you do to me,

185
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
I love you too.

186
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Pete!

187
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,280
Pete!

188
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,480
Pete, what's wrong, why are you bleeding so much?

189
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
Pete!

190
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,560
Thong, even if you die,

191
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I love you too.

192
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,639
I love you, Thong!

193
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
Pete!

194
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,600
I love you.

195
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,920
Aside!

196
00:18:57,993 --> 00:19:00,920
 [Pete]

197
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,160
 [Wirachai Apartment]

198
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,680
 [Thong Tenant]

199
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,400
 Hello Thong. Is there anything wrong?

200
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,720
 Hello Thong. Is there anything wrong?

201
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,880
 Can Mr. Wi come see Thong for a bit?

202
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,760
 What now?

203
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
 Right now.

204
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,200
 Is something wrong with Thong?

205
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,240
 Don't rush to ask me, okay?

206
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,320
 Come see me first. Right now?

207
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,040
 Okay, okay. So let me go quickly.

208
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,840
 Thank you, Mr. Wi.

209
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,800
What's going on anyway?

210
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,640
Why is Thong crying? Em Thong!

211
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
What's wrong?

212
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,120
Tell me about it.

213
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
So where has my lover gone? Not here?

214
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,000
Mr. Wi, don't rush to ask me, okay?

215
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,480
Let me tell you tomorrow morning.

216
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
Yes.

217
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,400
But why did you call me here to help me?

218
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,705
Can you help keep me company?

219
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,280
Come morning.

220
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,640
Okay, okay.

221
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,720
Mr. Wi can sit wherever he wants.

222
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,320
But don't leave me alone.

223
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,200
Thong, go to sleep.

224
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,640
Mr. Wi! Can you hold my hand for a bit?

225
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,400
Why do we have to hold hands?

226
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,880
When I close my eyes,

227
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,840
you won't see anyone,

228
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,800
I will feel like I am alone.

229
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,920
Hold my hand for a bit, okay?

230
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,400
You will know that I am by your side.

231
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,446
Okay.

232
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,160
I will stay by your side, not going anywhere.

233
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Are you awake?

234
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,240
Mr. Wi, don't you sleep all night?

235
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,480
Thong said you sit and watch, so you have to watch.

236
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,719
Thank you. If it weren't for Mr. Wi

237
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,640
I must have been scared all night.

238
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,920
Mr. Wi should go home and rest, he must be very sleepy.

239
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,880
Last night, before I went out, I slept.

240
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,119
I think now Thong

241
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Go take a shower and change your clothes.

242
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,959
Let me go out and buy you something to eat.

243
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,320
He'll be back in a bit.

244
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Thong.

245
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,080
What happened in the end?

246
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,640
Can I tell you?

247
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
The thing is...

248
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,080
Thong's lover, him

249
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,440
he's gone.

250
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,440
He's not here anymore.

251
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:55,240
 You mean Thong and his lover broke up?

252
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
 That's right.

253
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,279
 We both don't understand each other a bit,

254
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,360
 so we broke up and he left.

255
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,600
 Are you gone?

256
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,080
 What a worthless kind of man.

257
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,679
 If it were you

258
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,679
 I won't let my lover be alone like that.

259
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,720
 Unacceptable.

260
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,960
 Don't scold him.

261
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,720
 He probably has his reasons.

262
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,320
 So Thong can only hope for him

263
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,920
 go in peace,

264
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,800
 there is no need to suffer anymore

265
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,640
And don't owe each other anything anymore.

266
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Thong.

267
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,040
Thong is a girl with very good thoughts.

268
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
It's okay, Thong. Here it is,

269
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,400
from now on, no matter when Thong has any problem

270
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,160
Just call me, I'm always ready to help.

271
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Really?

272
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,920
So, Thong, can you please not pay the rent?

273
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,000
Thong's lover, he's spent all his money.

274
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,320
The gold bracelet my mother gave me,

275
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,000
He also stole it and pawned it.

276
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,880
Thong's whole body doesn't even have 100 baht in his wallet, Mr. Wi.

277
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,440
If Mr. Wi doesn't buy this rice, it will be given to you

278
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,880
Thong also doesn't know what to eat.

279
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,520
Okay, Thong, no problem.

280
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,119
I will give you Thong here for free.

281
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,879
As long as it takes, Thong.

282
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,000
Really, Mr. Wi?

283
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,200
Thank you very much Mr. Wi.

284
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,680
No one has ever been so kind to Thong before.

285
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,080
When Thong has money,

286
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,200
Thong will return every penny to Mr. Wi.

287
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,760
Oh, Thong, there's no need to pay.

288
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,600
I'm willing to help.

289
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,560
Thank you.

290
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,720
Eat, eat.

291
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,680
Please go take a call.

292
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,240
Hello, mom.

293
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Oh, the thing is I went out to do some business around here.

294
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,960
Yes, yes, I will be back soon.

295
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,320
Yes, yes.

296
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Dear Thong.

297
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,679
The thing is, he probably has to go home first.

298
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
But I will come see you this afternoon.

299
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,799
Anyway, I have to go quickly, my mother is regretful.

300
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Yes, yes.

301
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,240
 I'm sorry, Pete.

302
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,840
 But my life must go on.

303
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,960
 If these things are still there, I can't help but miss you.

304
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
 Goodbye, Pete.

305
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:52,566
 Wait a minute.

306
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,080
Mr. Wi, Thong just finished showering.

307
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:46,073
THE ROSE OF SIN
