1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,340
THE ROSE OF SIN

2
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,765
THE ROSE OF SIN

3
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,520
Are your clothes still here?

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,080
I remember leaving a lot of things here.

5
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,280
It's true that it's still here.

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,600
Ms. Dao.

7
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,800
You must be tired after coming home from work. You should sit down and rest a bit.

8
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,640
Who is Ms. Dao calling?

9
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,560
She called Thong.

10
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,360
I wanted to ask how the filming was today.

11
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,960
But now it's really late. I don't think I should call.

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,320
She must have rested.

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,920
Ms. Dao.

14
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,640
No need to call.

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,840
This,

16
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,240
We don't get to be alone together like this often.

17
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,760
Why are you calling to find someone else?

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,560
Or so we say

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,560
about your story.

20
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,320
Okay?

21
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,320
Let's go.

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,840
Go to the other side and talk.

23
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,880
Come on, let me.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,640
What do you want to talk about?

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,040
Then...

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,520
talk

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,480
in bed.

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,000
Is that Okay?

29
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:28,630
[Mr. B]

30
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:30,151
[Mr. B]

31
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,480
Oh.

32
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,240
Thong, are you awake yet?

33
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm up.

34
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,360
Can you come in?

35
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,280
If you want to come scold me for what happened yesterday

36
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,680
there's no need.

37
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,960
I don't have time to listen to you curse.

38
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,960
If I go with you

39
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,680
then he agreed.

40
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,320
But

41
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,760
If you go with a man like Dam

42
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,760
I'll say it first,

43
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,760
it's much worse than I thought.

44
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
That's it, right?

45
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,280
Then you can go out.

46
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,720
Today is a day off, I will continue playing games.

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,720
Alright.

48
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,160
So I'll give you ten minutes,

49
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,680
quickly shower and change clothes,

50
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,680
He took me to the audition.

51
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
I don't accept auditions anymore.

52
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,320
Upcoming movie,

53
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,800
I'm about to be famous.

54
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I'm just waiting to receive an invitation to act in a movie.

55
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,360
That's good.

56
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
There's a lot of bad character acting, it's a waste of time

57
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,560
His face was bruised again.

58
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,120
Go!

59
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,120
It's okay to go down and eat.

60
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,120
I prepared a special dish for you.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,760
Breakfast is on the table here.

62
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,440
Whose phone is this?

63
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,440
Also the newest model.

64
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,440
There it is.

65
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
The special breakfast I prepared for you.

66
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,440
Really?

67
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,480
Oh, thank you!

68
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,320
Oh, is this the same model?

69
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,400
Hello.

70
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,760
Hello.

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,160
Ms. Dao.

72
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,160
Hello.

73
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,320
How are you?

74
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,760
In the end, did you catch Mr. Dam and Thong secretly meeting?

75
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Couldn't catch it.

76
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,760
Because I don't see anyone.

77
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,800
Dam stayed with her all night.

78
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,640
Huh?

79
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,720
How is this possible?

80
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,600
Malee's own ears clearly heard that those two people were meeting.

81
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
That's enough, Malee.

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,800
No matter why I do this

83
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,680
Then I also hope you stop.

84
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,000
Stop nitpicking and making up stories.

85
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,120
Because if this gets spread out, it will be very difficult to resolve.

86
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
But Malee didn't make it up.

87
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,400
Con Thong actually called Mr. Dam to make an appointment.

88
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,480
She said stop.

89
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,160
If you can't stop this action

90
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,720
Then I won't do this job anymore.

91
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,400
And this will be the last time I act in your movie.

92
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,440
If you think Thong is better than you,

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,440
I see you like Thong more than me

94
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,800
Then what you should do is develop yourself.

95
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,480
Not looking for something to harm her.

96
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,720
Remember carefully, and don't let this happen again.

97
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,840
Thong.

98
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,800
It's done.

99
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,680
Thong, come and do your makeup.

100
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,920
Wait a minute, points are increasing.

101
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,440
Thong.

102
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,440
What game are you playing?

103
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,440
I see you playing it so often these days.

104
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,240
Tell me so I can play along.

105
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,080
Can't say. Secret.

106
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,760
Everybody.

107
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,320
- Hello, Ms. Dao. - Hi everybody.

108
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,680
She has something to say.

109
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,440
I watched the first episode in the editing room.

110
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,840
Very good.

111
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,280
Thong, you act very well.

112
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,800
Please tell me.

113
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,000
Just the first broadcast and everyone will immediately ask who I am.

114
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Really?

115
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,760
I'm so nervous.

116
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
Calm down, stay focused.

117
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,040
And please prepare well to receive attention.

118
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,720
Because maybe there will be people who like you and people who hate you.

119
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,280
But I have prepared a plan for you.

120
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,280
What's the plan?

121
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,440
So this character must act very strongly, right?

122
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
After this series, I had to get out of the role completely.

123
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Because of the next movie

124
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,120
I will let you play a completely different character.

125
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,840
Next movie?

126
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,680
- That means... - That's right.

127
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,160
I intend to make you the female lead in the second movie.

128
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,920
Thank you, Ms. Dao. Thank you.

129
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,120
Dad, Chicha is here.

130
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,440
Dad comes here.

131
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,080
Oh, you're so much older.

132
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,800
Come on, let dad carry you.

133
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,880
Looks like mom took good care of her child, right?

134
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,960
Come on, let's go home. Dad has prepared a surprise gift for you.

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,960
Any.

136
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,600
Let's go, let's go into the house.

137
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,400
Oh, so beautiful.

138
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
Thank you, dad?

139
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,760
Thank you, dad.

140
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,800
Be careful.

141
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,760
Hey, Jang,

142
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,240
child's tuition

143
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
he closed it all.

144
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,520
I know.

145
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,800
The teacher told me.

146
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,320
But

147
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,640
Where did you get the money?

148
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Looks very rich lately.

149
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,640
You just got a new person.

150
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,640
She's very good.

151
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Help him also have money to go to the fields.

152
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,640
After that,

153
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
I don't have to look for a job anymore.

154
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,440
Your revenue now

155
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
can comfortably take care of you and your child.

156
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,760
Are you pimping a girl?

157
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,120
That's why you get so much money?

158
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,120
What does it mean to pimp a girl?

159
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,240
Bringing a girl is someone who serves in a restaurant.

160
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,400
Hey, I don't do that anymore.

161
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,000
This person is the female lead,

162
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,000
looks promising.

163
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Now

164
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,000
made so much money already.

165
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,240
If the movie is broadcast

166
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
I think the revenue will be many times higher.

167
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,160
After that,

168
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,880
You will no longer be a bastard in the eyes of others.

169
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm happy for you.

170
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,720
I hope so

171
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,520
I won't do anything to my people other than business,

172
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
like I used to have.

173
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,840
Why do you say that?

174
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,840
He is no longer the same as before.

175
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,600
This Friday, Saturday,

176
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,880
Can I stay with you?

177
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,440
I haven't seen you for a long time.

178
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,200
I want to hug my child so I don't miss him.

179
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,400
Let's go!

180
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Chicha is also my child.

181
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,360
That's OK.

182
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,280
But please take those pictures down.

183
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,680
I don't want you to know

184
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,320
What kind of person is his father?

185
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,680
Why did you suddenly lose again?

186
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,520
Damned!

187
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,960
I'm out of money.

188
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,280
Where did you come from?

189
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,520
Why are you talking so rudely?

190
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,080
Whether I say rude or not is my business.

191
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,520
Who are you? Why are you peeking at me?

192
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
This is my bedroom.

193
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,160
Chicha!

194
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,000
Have you said hello to Ms. Thong yet?

195
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,560
Hello sister.

196
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,040
Chicha, this is Ms. Thong.

197
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,040
Thong, this is Chicha, my son.

198
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,920
Chicha will sleep with him for two nights.

199
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,240
Chicha, this bedroom

200
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,240
Dad gave it to Ms. Thong.

201
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,240
Tonight, I'll sleep with dad.

202
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,280
Let's go, don't bother Ms. Thong.

203
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,480
Go!

204
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,240
Is it hot?

205
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,560
Oh.

206
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Looks like he likes you more than me.

207
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,560
Being with you is not as affectionate as this.

208
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,240
If Ms. Dao wants it to cuddle with her

209
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,720
You should pamper it more.

210
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,720
Eat cake?

211
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,200
This.

212
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,880
Dad, get the cake.

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,560
During the time she attended a film exhibition in China,

214
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,360
Can I come stay with him?

215
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,160
She left for four days, afraid it would be lonely.

216
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Okay.

217
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,560
You don't need to worry, because...

218
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,120
Diamond is just like my child.

219
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,120
Live here

220
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
ensure that

221
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,600
I'll grow it so fat that Dao won't recognize me when she comes home.

222
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,600
There's no need for that.

223
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,000
I have to let him participate in a weight loss course again.

224
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Hello, bro.

225
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,320
At Ms. Dao's house.

226
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,320
My tip just can't be used anymore.

227
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,040
It was usable at first.

228
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,600
I earned up to three hundred thousand.

229
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,320
Then suddenly I kept losing.

230
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,880
Now my account is out of money.

231
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,320
I think we need to change the program.

232
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,640
Yes, when I have free time, I will come and see it.

233
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,520
When will you be free? Can't do it now?

234
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Should I keep playing?

235
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,200
Sorry.

236
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,160
Actually, today is not very convenient.

237
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,520
Yes, goodbye.

238
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,560
Oh.

239
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,680
Oh.

240
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,320
What's the matter, Dam?

241
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,040
Just a brother's project.

242
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,400
He can't open the file.

243
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,120
That's all I have to worry about anymore.

244
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,320
The seniors' work comes later, right?

245
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,640
Dad has to stay with Diamond first, right?

246
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,320
I bring you Jaem...

247
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,800
Report on performance appraisals.

248
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,520
You can test as strictly as you want.

249
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,920
I promise I won't complain to the Ministry of Labor like Linin did.

250
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,000
Evaluation is the responsibility of the human resources department.

251
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,880
Please dress appropriately.

252
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,200
Then you can leave.

253
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,680
Are not.

254
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,400
Sherbet wants Jaem to judge only.

255
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,760
You alone.

256
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,600
You alone.

257
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,400
You alone.

258
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,760
You alone.

259
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,840
Thong.

260
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,600
Sherbet, do you dare to take Jaem away from me?

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,720
Thong, it's not your turn yet.

262
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,200
Cut.

263
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,280
Thong had to let Malee finish her line first.

264
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Then slap.

265
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,360
Yes.

266
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,760
Sorry.

267
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,320
Thong.

268
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,440
What's wrong with you today? Why can't I concentrate?

269
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,440
To be...

270
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,920
Thong read the script until late so he lost concentration a bit.

271
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,280
Not getting enough sleep?

272
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,760
So I'll send you herbs to replenish your body's energy.

273
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,760
You must take good care of yourself.

274
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,000
The movie is about to premiere.

275
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Have to run many programs to promote the movie.

276
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes, Ms. Dao.

277
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,080
And...

278
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,040
I won't be in Thailand for four days.

279
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,360
I ask you for that.

280
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
Dam's story.

281
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,160
Ms. Dao doesn't need to worry.

282
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,560
To...

283
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,920
Please take care of it.

284
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,040
Thank you.

285
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,200
- Please go. - Hello, sister.

286
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,280
- Damn. - Yes.

287
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,120
Please go and ask me to take care of Diamond.

288
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Yes, have a safe journey.

289
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,280
Let's meet in the car?

290
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Miss Dao, do you want anything to eat?

291
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,000
Or should I stop by your regular shop?

292
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,080
No need.

293
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,520
Dao brought cakes to eat to stave off hunger.

294
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,080
Just go to the airport.

295
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,000
Yes.

296
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,520
Wait!

297
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,240
What do you want, Miss Dao?

298
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,600
Nothing.

299
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,880
Let's go.

300
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,520
Okay.

301
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,120
Older brother! Surely no one saw?

302
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,400
Wouldn't it be better to come to your house?

303
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,400
It's nothing.

304
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,040
The workers are all asleep, it's past 11 o'clock.

305
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,480
Come in.

306
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Nothing.

307
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,480
Hurry up.

308
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,320
Quickly find a solution!

309
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,960
I don't want to stay here long.

310
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,000
Calm down, it's okay.

311
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,000
Just

312
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,000
Old accounts can only be used for the first phase.

313
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,200
If we play and lose

314
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,040
Then change to a new account, that's all.

315
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,320
So why didn't you say it sooner?

316
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Just let me play and lose forever.

317
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,600
I forgot.

318
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,920
But there's no need to be surprised.

319
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,440
Just use your new account.

320
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,440
Ensure

321
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
I win more than before.

322
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,400
Okay?

323
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,400
But

324
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
I do charge a fee for teaching.

325
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,560
This!

326
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,120
This is not what we discussed.

327
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
You never said you could change multiple accounts,

328
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,480
Then every time you change, you have to pay a fee.

329
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,480
I thought it was just once and it was over.

330
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,880
So everything requires investment.

331
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,440
Thong has not lost anything.

332
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,680
Right?

333
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
I thought

334
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,560
Thong is only beneficial.

335
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,440
Be happy

336
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,040
and get money.

337
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Right?

338
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,920
This!

339
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,320
I can have happiness with anyone I want.

340
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,320
But not with you.

341
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,600
Ms. Dao is very good to me.

342
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,600
I cannot betray her.

343
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,040
Why not?

344
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,680
We've done it once before.

345
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,000
Right? Think about the sound of money ringing.

346
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,360
Play to earn more money.

347
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,880
From ten

348
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,240
become one hundred.

349
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,320
From one hundred

350
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,800
into a thousand.

351
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,560
From one thousand

352
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,040
into ten thousand.

353
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,720
And much more.

354
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,720
Up to a million.

355
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,840
Is it really a million?

356
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,680
That's a million.

357
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,640
That's a million.

358
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,680
Die with me.

359
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,560
I've been playing since last night and still haven't slept yet?

360
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm playing up my hand, I have to hurry up and continue playing.

361
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,880
His stuff is also getting hard.

362
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,880
That's enough, I won't give you any more.

363
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,640
Last night seemed like the last time.

364
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,880
Oh.

365
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,240
This Mr. B really... just likes to supervise.

366
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,400
Don't you find it annoying? How can I live with Mr. B?

367
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,880
I don't want to live with you either.

368
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,280
But it's my manager, what should I do?

369
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,280
Signed a contract with him for three years.

370
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,280
Once the contract expires, I will not renew it.

371
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,880
I'll be honest, if Thong doesn't want to continue anymore

372
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,040
Then tear up the contract and pay the contract compensation and you're done.

373
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,920
How much is written in that contract?

374
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,480
I don't remember how much anymore.

375
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,240
Anyway, I don't have any money to pay, I don't even have a penny from my salary.

376
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,040
Sao?

377
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,360
Why can't you have it?

378
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,320
Before filming started, I had already paid 50%.

379
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,320
50%?

380
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,200
YES.

381
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,000
I don't know anything, Mr. B never mentioned this.

382
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,120
That's really bad.

383
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,640
How could Thong work with him?

384
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,440
I think Thong escaped,

385
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,240
Don't work with this type of exploiter.

386
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,440
Besides, he was extremely uncomfortable every time he came to the set.

387
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,960
I know he sat there watching the two of us.

388
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
If what happens to us is exposed, it will be because of him.

389
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,240
Okay.

390
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
When I got home, I cursed him for making him sick, he was fat.

391
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,000
It's jackpot.

392
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,160
Oh.

393
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,520
He also wanted to "get out".

394
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,480
Seam.

395
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,080
Ms. Dao, why are you back?

396
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,200
Something happened so I went back first.

397
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,840
- Has Diamond eaten yet? - No, I'm about to take you out to eat.

398
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,200
But Dam doesn't come to feed her?

399
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,960
Mr. Dam hasn't woken up yet.

400
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,200
Do you know what time he came home last night?

401
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
I don't know.

402
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,360
Som went to bed at 10pm and still hasn't seen him return.

403
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,640
Take him out to eat, it's late.

404
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,720
Yes.

405
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,600
I've won a lot.

406
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,680
Give me some reward.

407
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,160
Enough, I can eat a lot of Thong.

408
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,600
Benefits are over.

409
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,080
Thong is hungry, can you find something for Thong to eat?

410
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,320
Give orders like a lover.

411
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,520
Okay, my love.

412
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,640
Please wait a moment.

413
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,520
EH?

414
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,880
Ms. Dao.

415
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,040
Dam.

416
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,240
What happened? Why come back now?

417
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,000
Because there was a blizzard coming. The plane was afraid it wouldn't be able to land.

418
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,800
All work must be canceled.

419
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,760
Really? This is so bad.

420
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,360
So has Ms. Dao eaten anything yet?

421
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,560
Right when I'm hungry. Let's go have breakfast together.

422
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,680
I heard the maid say you came home late last night?

423
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,960
Where are you going?

424
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,600
That's right. Last night I went to see the film editing situation.

425
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,360
When I finished work, it was 12 o'clock at night.

426
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,600
So this morning I woke up a bit late.

427
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,520
I also forgot to feed Diamond.

428
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,280
Yes.

429
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,920
Sorry.

430
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,800
But let's go have breakfast first.

431
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,960
Okay.

432
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,360
Thong, Ms. Dao is back. Find a place to hide.

433
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,200
The last room is on the left.

434
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,320
Who are you talking to, Dam?

435
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,760
Don't you mean you're very hungry? The food is cold.

436
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,760
I'm directing the work.

437
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,280
Please let me assign the work to complete.

438
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
What's the problem?

439
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,280
Honey, read my LINE messages.

440
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,280
I have sent you the details already.

441
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,120
Please read quickly, it's urgent.

442
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,480
Dead.

443
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,760
Damned.

444
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,360
Dam. What's going on? Thinking about work?

445
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,680
That's right.

446
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,840
Ms. Dao, how about we go to Spa?

447
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,400
During this time, I sit and edit work all day.

448
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,760
I'm all tired.

449
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,600
Also good.

450
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,000
She also sat on a plane going back and forth for many hours.

451
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,520
If I get two or three hours of sleep, it will probably be good.

452
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,760
Okay.

453
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,920
So go change first.

454
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,400
Been wearing this outfit for over 24 hours.

455
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,080
Ms. Dao, but Ms. Dao still looks very beautiful

456
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,480
and it's still fragrant.

457
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,720
There's no need to change it, it's better to quickly go on vacation.

458
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,040
Okay.

459
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,880
This way you will be able to rest. You will be tired when you come home from work.

460
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,280
Wouldn't it be better to have a hot spring?

461
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,040
Okay.

462
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,560
Right?

463
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,200
Yes.

464
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,840
Miss Dao, Mr. BT is here to see you. Waiting in the living room.

465
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,040
Mr. BT?

466
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,600
What did he come for?

467
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
I don't know either, he didn't report it.

468
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,440
Did you call the business desk?

469
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,520
No sir.

470
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Mr. B, hello.

471
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
Ms. Dao, hello.

472
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,440
I thought Ms. Dao wasn't here. Are you not going to China anymore?

473
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,760
Had a little problem so went back first.

474
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,320
So what happened when Mr. B came?

475
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,240
I came to find Thong.

476
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,960
Looking for Thongs?

477
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,600
YES.

478
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,800
Thong is not here.

479
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,480
Are you drunk? Why is Thong here?

480
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,080
That's funny.

481
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,240
You can go back now. The two of us are getting ready to go out.

482
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,600
Ms. Dao, Thong is really here.

483
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,400
The thing is that I have installed the location

484
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,320
to track Thong's phone.

485
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
Coordinates indicate Thong here.

486
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:34,695
THE ROSE OF SIN
