1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,399
[The film was created for entertainment purposes.]

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,519
[Characters, actions, places and events in the film are hypothetical events.]

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,440
[No intention of sexual arousal,]

4
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:06,439
[leading or inciting inappropriate or morally corrupt behavior]

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,999
[And there is no intention to cause damage to any profession]

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,480
[or have a negative attitude toward any organization or group of people.]

THE ROSE OF SIN

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
THE SINNER'S ROSE Episode 14

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,159
But anyway, me

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Still wary of you.

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,440
Because that's my intuition.

12
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,200
You stay away from Thong.

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,000
We won't have to argue anymore.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,999
When I was little, I only fought.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But when you get older, I'll shoot you.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,120
I already shot Thong,

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,120
Don't let me shoot you too.

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,279
I know.

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,440
For the sake of business, I won't let a woman ruin it.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,520
Let's have a glass.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Oh.

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,079
What's up?

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,079
I accidentally dropped the glass.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,520
Please call someone to help me clean up.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,760
Okay, okay.

26
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:51,128
Be careful not to hit your hand.

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
- Thank. - Yes.

28
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,320
Slowly, go over there and sit.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Any.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,160
It's so painful, isn't it?

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,599
Sit down slowly.

32
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:13,813
Slow down, slow down.

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,879
YES.

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,159
This is the room card.

35
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,359
Oh, stop it.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,440
Ah, here it is, here's the medicine.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,440
Hand bag.

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,839
Please take care of yourself first.

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,919
Because...

40
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,079
I'm in a hurry. If you're hungry

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,479
The food is in the refrigerator.

42
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,639
But if you don't like it, just order food outside.

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,239
I'm really in a hurry, there's a guy downstairs waiting for me.

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,839
Ah. Don't forget to take your medicine.

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,200
- Understand? - Ms. Si.

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,120
When will you come back?

47
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,199
 I hired him for 6 hours.

48
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,479
 I'll be back around 12 o'clock, I won't be leaving until morning.

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,080
 I also don't want to use too much.

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,440
 - Ms. Si. - YES.

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,760
 Come back quickly.

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,760
 Don't want to be alone.

53
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,160
 It's very lonely, besides, being alone makes you think a lot more.

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,959
 If so then

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,639
 Do you want to hire a man to be your friend like me?

56
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,879
 Let me find it for you. Choose someone who cares,

57
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,200
 follow all your desires, both emotional and physical.

58
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,479
Is it okay to hire men like that?

59
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,039
It feels so strange.

60
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,039
Not strange at all.

61
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,639
If you try it once, I guarantee you will be very satisfied.

62
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
That's great. Understand?

63
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,519
This. Just love each other passionately for a certain period of time.

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,160
When the time is up, we separate, no one owes anyone anything.

65
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,159
Don't be like that anymore.

66
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,400
Don't keep looking for a man to be your husband.

67
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,799
Hire someone by day like this

68
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,039
much better.

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,119
Oh, no.

70
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,559
It's time for my husband's appointment today, I have to go first.

71
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
The timer has started, it's not even 6 hours late.

72
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,079
Mr. Wi, can you hold Thong's hand?

73
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Why do you want me to hold your hand?

74
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,680
When Thong closed his eyes,

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,800
Then no one will be seen.

76
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,480
Like Thong is alone.

77
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:52,606
Hold Thong's hand for a bit.

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Let Thong know he is still by his side.

79
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,246
Okay.

80
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
I'm here, next to you Thong.

81
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,960
I'm not going anywhere.

82
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,240
Hello dear Thong.

83
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,679
Sorry.

84
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,200
Doing so much makes me forget all about time, date and time.

85
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,800
Where are you packing your things?

86
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
I go home.

87
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,720
Which house? Is the house in Ang Thong?

88
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Are not.

89
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Mr. Wi's house.

90
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,720
I will go back to live with Mr. Wi.

91
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm with him,

92
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,120
before the incident happened,

93
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,119
he proposed to me.

94
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,559
I will return to get married,

95
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,559
start a new life with him.

96
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,600
Thong, are you crazy?

97
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,999
Whether he's dead or alive, she doesn't even know.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How did you get back there?

99
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,599
He's not dead yet.

100
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,599
Stabbed by a knife that small,

101
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,080
The nurse arrived in time, he would have survived anyway.

102
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,639
Even if he survives, how can she be sure?

103
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,119
that he would welcome her?

104
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,559
Did you forget anything?

105
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,359
He caught it with his own hands

106
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,960
that you're with another man.

107
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,239
Will definitely welcome me.

108
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Mr. Wi loves me very much.

109
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,280
It's been a long time,

110
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,439
maybe he's calmed down

111
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,439
and listen to my explanation.

112
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,680
What about his mother?

113
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,039
When we returned, we fought each other like before.

114
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,720
Sometimes they fight even harder.

115
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,040
Thong, you listen to me.

116
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,279
Wi also beat her.

117
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,559
His mother also beat her.

118
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,479
Yet you still came back to let those two beat you?

119
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,080
Use your brain to think.

120
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,560
We

121
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,880
must live with self-respect.

122
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,160
If you return to that house

123
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,840
then she will become the weak one.

124
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,240
Then they will gradually erode her self-esteem.

125
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,160
So what about the things we do in the bar?

126
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,839
She must accept sleeping with guests.

127
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,439
I have to sleep with Mr. Bun.

128
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,999
- Doesn't that lose your self-respect? - Not the same.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,640
We work to make money.

130
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,159
If you come back to be the daughter-in-law of that family

131
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,480
It means she came back to beg for food.

132
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,800
What is angry, what is spicy?

133
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,320
But I was shot by Boss Bun.

134
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,320
Want me back?

135
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,719
I told you to break up with the detective,

136
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,679
If the boss doesn't like it, don't do it.

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,159
Not only that.

138
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,440
I don't just want to work to make money.

139
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,440
I want someone to take care of me,

140
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,080
Be by my side when I'm weak.

141
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,560
That's her.

142
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,320
No one takes care of you better than you take care of yourself.

143
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:12,407
Why do you want to find a man?

144
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,040
Men come and go.

145
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,119
Finally, hey!

146
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
We can only rely on ourselves.

147
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Thong!

148
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,680
Hey, Thong!

149
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,800
I said so much, do you understand?

150
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Thong!

151
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Oh!

152
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,839
I'm so frustrated with you!

153
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,200
That little girl looks at life in rosy terms.

154
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,800
Mr. Wi!

155
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,160
 Mr. Wi!

156
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
 Mr. Wi!

157
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,680
 Mr. Wi!

158
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,800
 Mom!

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
 Uncle Ieng!

160
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,760
 Thong is back.

161
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,440
 Mr. Wi!

162
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:23,446
 Mr. Wi!

163
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Mr. Wi!

164
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,840
That's not it.

165
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,960
Not!

166
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Not!

167
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,160
Not!

168
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,200
Why did you leave Thong like that, Mr. Wi?

169
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,480
How could Mr. Wi leave me?

170
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:59,086
You said you loved me very much.

171
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,840
Why does everyone leave me?

172
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,079
Mr. Wi!

173
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,000
Why did you leave me like that?

174
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,040
Why am I always the one abandoned?

175
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,160
Mr. Wi!

176
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,080
You said you love me.

177
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,840
This!

178
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,480
Call the police, Thong is back.

179
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:38,753
Why call the police?

180
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,678
So I came to arrest you.

181
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,679
You are Yai's accomplice.

182
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,679
Kill Wi, Yai is captured.

183
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,719
It's just you who's being hunted.

184
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,399
I didn't do anything to Mr. Wi.

185
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,999
Don't kill Mr. Wi.

186
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,960
Where is Ba Na?

187
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:52,959
I'll explain to her that I didn't do it.

188
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,439
Today, Ms. Na went to the temple.

189
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,079
You wait for her to come home.

190
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,199
Every day she says she wants to kill you.

191
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,559
I didn't do it.

192
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,319
Go and argue with the police.

193
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,280
- This! Where are the police? Have you called yet? - Called, the police are coming.

194
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,759
Hey, don't hide!

195
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,959
Come on, everyone help keep it together.

196
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,039
Don't come any closer.

197
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,000
I have a gun.

198
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,320
- Run. - Don't come closer.

199
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,880
 Where are you? I'm here.

200
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,360
 I'm behind the tree.

201
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,040
 I see.

202
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
 Thong!

203
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
 Thong!

204
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,280
 Cry.

205
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,320
 Just cry it all out.

206
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,640
I'm so sorry!

207
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,640
Unbelievable

208
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,440
I have had to go through so many difficult things in my life.

209
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,400
About to get married

210
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,760
but also slandered

211
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,760
even though I don't do anything.

212
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I don't want to believe it either

213
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,600
My life has fallen apart to this point.

214
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,640
From birth,

215
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,120
I have never once been happy.

216
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,320
Avoid melon rinds

217
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,320
met coconut shell again.

218
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,960
I don't know which way to go.

219
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,320
Go back to Mr. Bun

220
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,120
there is only fear.

221
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,880
If you live somewhere else

222
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,040
You also have to hide and hide from the police.

223
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,840
You don't need to be afraid.

224
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,640
I have you.

225
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,960
You are a police officer.

226
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,020
I will take care of you.

227
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,600
Really?

228
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,479
Inspector must help you.

229
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,639
I have no one anymore.

230
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Okay.

231
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,840
I will help you with the penalty case.

232
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,319
I will go investigate

233
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,680
See where the report is.

234
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,120
I will solve it for you.

235
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,440
Let me

236
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,599
make a new citizen identification card,

237
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,720
Change your last name for me too.

238
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,040
Does it have to go to this extent?

239
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
That's right.

240
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,199
For protection,

241
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,840
so they can't find it anymore.

242
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,880
That's good too.

243
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,880
You will have a new life,

244
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,440
Don't let the past haunt you.

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,359
There is accommodation

246
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120
So where should I be now?

247
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,160
Inspector, can you let Thong stay with you?

248
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,160
It's good for Thong to stay with Si like before.

249
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,160
Also, go back to working for Mr. Bun.

250
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,880
Why?

251
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,279
Thong doesn't want to see Mr. Bun anymore.

252
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,599
Thong is afraid.

253
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,720
Thong doesn't need to be afraid.

254
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,800
I talked to Mr. Bun,

255
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,440
He doesn't care about us anymore.

256
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,760
But if Thong returns to Mr. Bun's place

257
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,760
then we have to cut off contact

258
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,080
and won't see each other again.

259
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,800
See you soon, Thong.

260
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,680
Thong still has to be there to support him.

261
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,840
Thong don't forget

262
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,719
that Thong is valuable to the police,

263
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Help destroy the drug trafficking ring.

264
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,280
But Thong almost died because of this mission.

265
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,999
Thong doesn't want to take any more risks.

266
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Is it okay if Thong doesn't do it anymore?

267
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,560
Come here, Thong.

268
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,920
That won't happen again.

269
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
I promise.

270
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,240
From now on,

271
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,520
I will work more carefully.

272
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,920
I will be careful,

273
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
Don't let Thong happen again.

274
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,520
Thong accepted his offer.

275
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,840
If Thong helps you

276
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,200
Only then can you help Thong.

277
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,840
That way, we will see each other often.

278
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Yes.

279
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,520
I will return to Mr. Bun's place

280
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,760
to assist with inspection.

281
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,600
Very well, my good girl.

282
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
 Oh...

283
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,280
 In short, what's going on?

284
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,800
 In short, what's going on?

285
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,800
 Mr. Wi is dead.

286
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,400
 Are you dead?

287
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,400
 I've decided.

288
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:14,197
 I will stay with Mr. Bun next.

289
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
 What are you doing?

290
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,119
 Oh, Thong.

291
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,000
 Oh, are you crazy? Die.

292
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,159
To stay with Mr. Bun

293
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,840
must be stronger than others.

294
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,080
He left scars on my body

295
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,160
then I need to get something of value back.

296
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,160
What are you going to do?

297
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,159
I still don't know.

298
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,399
But I won't just be the tycoon's concubine for the rest of my life.

299
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
I have to reach higher than that.

300
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
How high can she rise?

301
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,320
The highest ceiling is just being a concubine.

302
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,800
as long as there is still something called "mistress".

303
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Do you know the "mistress"?

304
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,280
Mistress?

305
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Who is the landlady?

306
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,320
We must be very careful.

307
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,080
Whether new or old customers.

308
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,400
Must keep a close eye

309
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,840
See if they are following anything or not.

310
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,839
And you guys

311
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,120
must observe,

312
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,119
If you see anything suspicious

313
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,319
Then come and tell me.

314
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,880
I will give a reward.

315
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,519
And people with disloyal thoughts

316
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,519
must die according to the law.

317
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,639
That's why,

318
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,599
Don't make me doubt you.

319
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,959
Because you shoot first and ask questions later.

320
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,439
You guys see it too

321
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,640
What happened to Thong?

322
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,240
Older brother.

323
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,879
Thong apologizes to you

324
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,560
for making you suspicious.

325
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,959
From now on, Thong will do everything

326
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,359
to show loyalty to him.

327
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,519
He told Thong to jump into the fire wherever he ordered.

328
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,120
Thong is always ready.

329
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,000
Really cute.

330
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
My dear Thong, come sit here.

331
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Sit here.

332
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,720
How are you? Are you okay?

333
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,720
come here to find me?

334
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,479
I'm still not feeling well.

335
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,479
But the waist can be lifted.

336
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,240
Do you want to check it out?

337
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,279
Not yet, I have work today.

338
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,520
Right on time

339
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,800
he is looking for volunteers.

340
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,280
What if Thong cares?

341
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
I care.

342
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,640
Thong would like to register first.

343
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,639
Thong didn't intend to ask that first

344
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,519
What is that? This job is life-threatening.

345
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,519
Really? Good.

346
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,760
Thong likes.

347
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Mr. Bun.

348
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,159
Malee, please register.

349
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,520
Malee likes adventure.

350
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,360
It's true.

351
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,759
Are you sure?

352
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
YES.

353
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,600
I remember seeing their faces.

354
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,240
He is a drug lord.

355
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,239
And this name

356
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,400
His name is Soso.

357
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,399
Them

358
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,399
Like to sit and play cards together.

359
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,399
The mission of the two of you

360
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,760
pretend to be a receptionist

361
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,479
and the two of them secretly took pictures of them

362
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,359
at the name Soso

363
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,559
sitting next to the drug dealer.

364
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,519
The tasks of the two of you are only that much.

365
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Can you do it?

366
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,119
Please feel free.

367
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,119
Such easy work,

368
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,959
I just need to put my phone up and pretend to take a selfie

369
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Then take all their pictures. Didn't find it difficult at all.

370
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,240
But it's not as easy as it sounds.

371
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,240
Because they are very careful.

372
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,839
They will confiscate your phone and check you

373
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
before the children enter the room.

374
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,280
I'll give you both a camera.

375
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,320
Your mission

376
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,480
I had to sneak this camera in

377
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,440
And don't let the bodyguards check the person who found out.

378
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,440
And when I get the chance

379
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,159
Then you secretly took pictures of them.

380
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,240
I use a good trick, any way is fine.

381
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,600
Just bringing the photo is enough.

382
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,320
Like that.

383
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:12,718
So why did you take their photos?

384
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,280
Why do I have to take secret photos?

385
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,280
Name Soso

386
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,800
always waiting to play with you.

387
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:21,518
I want to take his photo as security.

388
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,120
Use it to negotiate with him.

389
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,720
When will he fuck you?

390
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,720
then you will expose him.

391
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,879
Then Thong will try his best to complete this job.

392
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,479
Because Thong is Bun's chicken.

393
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,279
We are like the same person.

394
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,759
If Mr. Bun's business fails

395
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,160
Thong also collapsed.

396
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,559
I will also try to do it with my life, Mr. Bun.

397
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,519
Do you want more pictures of him naked?

398
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,680
Let me do it.

399
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
Good.

400
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,680
 He enjoys competing while working.

401
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
 Like this,

402
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,480
 if anyone has a better photo

403
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,806
 then you will have a reward.

404
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,520
 What's the reward, Mr. Bun?

405
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,440
 If you speak in advance, you will have the strength to do the work.

406
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,879
 If someone wins

407
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
 then I will make you the number one dancer.

408
00:22:12,393 --> 00:22:13,873
 And the loser

409
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,000
 will chase her away.

410
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,640
 Play, play. Do it, Mr. Bun.

411
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,640
 I will definitely win.

412
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,239
 This job

413
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,440
 Malee has to be number one.

414
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,840
But if you are caught by them

415
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,280
I don't know what you guys will be like.

416
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,560
They probably won't send your bodies back to me.

417
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,719
 A-yu-wan-no-su-khang.

418
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,440
{8 /8 Encents.

419
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,719
 Hey, can you tell me?

420
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,280
 Why must there be two sets of ceremonies?

421
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,119
 A set of Wi,

422
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
 I know.

423
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,600
 But there's another set for whom?

424
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,959
 I still remember Pete's name,

425
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,320
 my first husband that you ever slept with?

426
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,600
 Another set is for him.

427
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,600
 For Pete?

428
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
 Why give it away?

429
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,360
Hey, do you hate him that much?

430
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,240
Pete's dead.

431
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Sao?

432
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,440
Is Pete dead?

433
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,919
When will you die?

434
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,319
And how do you know?

435
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
You and him broke up a long time ago.

436
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,080
After you slept with it,

437
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,080
I chased it home.

438
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,080
So he went to the gold store to steal the gold and give it back to me.

439
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
That day.

440
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,160
He was shot dead by the gold shop owner.

441
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,600
I saw its body with my own eyes.

442
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Damned!

443
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,519
Why don't you tell me?

444
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,799
I kept thinking

445
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,000
It disappeared just because two people broke up.

446
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
YES.

447
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,480
Am I the cause of its death?

448
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,040
Don't think too much.

449
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,640
It has nothing to do with you.

450
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,640
And don't worry that I will be angry with you.

451
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,040
I'm not angry at anyone.

452
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,520
It's because of my number,

453
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
When I was born, I encountered all sorts of bad things.

454
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,560
There was her first husband who was shot dead,

455
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,560
The second husband was stabbed to death.

456
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Who has an unlucky life like me?

457
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
No way.

458
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,199
Don't rush to any conclusions.

459
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,559
She is young,

460
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,120
life is long.

461
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,119
Future,

462
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,119
She can become a wife or mistress, if not, she can also become a businessman.

463
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,320
Who knows?

464
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,320
 I was an unlucky child.

465
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,640
 What do you think my future will be like?

466
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,960
Sometimes

467
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,960
 My life is shorter than I thought.

468
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,399
Because I just took the risk to work for Mr. Bun.

469
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,279
Oh, don't think so negatively.

470
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,959
When thinking, think of good things.

471
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,319
Because when you think something bad,

472
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,159
Bad things can happen.

473
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,520
 - Did you know? - I'm still trying to think positively.

474
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,160
 Like during the ceremony, I also asked the monk for everything to go smoothly.

475
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
 But

476
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,320
 I think it

477
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,320
Does  have a happy ending?

478
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
This!

479
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Disappear.

480
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,320
I'll give you some more holy water.

481
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,319
Here, tell me.

482
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,240
A prostitute's saliva is very effective.

483
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,279
No matter what, you'll succeed, Thong.

484
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,880
Trust me here.

485
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,000
Any!

486
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,520
Let's go again.

487
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,040
Just to be sure.

488
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,239
Hello sir.

489
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,039
My name is Cheese Cake.

490
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,039
Pleased to serve you.

491
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,680
The name makes me want to eat it.

492
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
What about you?

493
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,399
Hello sir.

494
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,399
My name is Honey.

495
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,119
Can do it all.

496
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,280
I will use all my skills, just give me the command.

497
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:46,319
Before starting work,

498
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,919
I want to check on you first.

499
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,520
For peace of mind.

500
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Check every nook and cranny.

501
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
Alright.

502
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
Via.

503
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,960
Both are safe.

504
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,600
Then start working.

505
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,920
Come on, come on.

506
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,800
Come pour us some wine.

507
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:20,913
Choose a delicious one.

508
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
It must be a strong flavor.

509
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,279
Okay. But

510
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,999
Please allow me to wash my hands first.

511
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,319
When pouring wine for a gentleman, your hands must be clean.

512
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,559
hygienic.

513
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
Hey.

514
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,560
I also ask permission to wash my hands.

515
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,559
Come on, come on.

516
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,640
We continue to play.

517
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
With Malee.

518
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,199
We have to stop fighting with each other.

519
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,000
Otherwise, there may be a mistake on both sides.

520
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,159
We must temporarily stop fighting

521
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,800
and have to accept being friends for one day.

522
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,919
 Today, I came to compete.

523
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,599
 Don't come to find friends.

524
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,679
 I have to get the best picture for the boss.

525
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,719
 Because of that, I will do everything

526
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,919
 to hinder you.

527
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,319
 Con Thong. If you are weak

528
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,600
 then give up.

529
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,679
 Let me start first.

530
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,840
 If you start first, you will have the right to win first.

531
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,360
 Why do you have to make things more difficult, you idiot.

532
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,480
Let me go pour you more wine.

533
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,000
Let me shuffle the cards for you.

534
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,560
Do well, let me be lucky.

535
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,400
Thong, you bastard.

536
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,599
Hey honey, are you done pouring the wine?

537
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,920
Your neck is a bit dry, sir.

538
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Yes.

539
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,919
 Gambling is illegal.

540
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,479
 2 of hearts.

541
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,879
 Oh.

542
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,840
 Thank you for coming today.

543
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,279
 Oh.

544
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,759
 Obviously on the same side.

545
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,999
 Can't you let us win a little?

546
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,119
 Oh, you.

547
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,519
 Can't give in.

548
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,399
 Even though we are on the same side,

549
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,239
 but we came to fight each other.

550
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,560
Not here to find friends.

551
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:33,180
THE ROSE OF SIN
