[The film was created for entertainment purposes.]

[Characters, actions, places and events in the film are hypothetical events.]

[No intention of sexual arousal,]

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,440
[leading or inciting inappropriate or morally corrupt behavior]

00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,000
[And there is no intention to cause damage to any profession]

THE ROSE OF SIN

THE ROSE OF SIN

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
Episode 16

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,640
I sent the bag of money away.

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,640
How much did you get this time?

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,840
30.

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,280
Why so little?

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,600
How are you selling "goods"?

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,160
Why are there less and less?

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,200
I really tried.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
It should have been 50,

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,440
but lately

19
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,360
There are too many insiders.

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,760
The police kept flirting everywhere.

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,880
I still have to pay interest at the end of the term.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,320
How much is spent?

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,720
Damned.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,920
Thong, say hello to the owner.

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,800
Hello madam.

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,400
My name is Thong.

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,440
I think if the situation continues like this

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,440
then we have to increase the price of goods.

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,480
To bring profits close to the same as before.

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,040
As for those stinky ants,

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Please send me the list.

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,200
I want to know who their father is,

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,720
How high a position does it have?

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,360
Okay, let me send it.

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,280
So what is the meeting with the big guy about?

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,760
He is also very cunning.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,040
He said that DSI is seriously handling the money laundering case.

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,640
So it is mandatory to take 40% from us.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,000
What the hell?

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,200
I sell so hard that I want to die.

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,320
Deposit some money into that party's bank to launder money but want to get 40%.

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,840
Damn it.

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,560
Boss, boss lady.

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,920
Would you like a glass of wine?

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
Okay.

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,440
Please fill my glass full.

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,880
So what about the owner?

48
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,880
No thanks.

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,880
Have a drink.

50
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Will be in a good mood to discuss work.

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,160
The tycoon has just imported a new batch of wine from France.

52
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,440
Thong tried it, it's very sweet.

53
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,080
Please give it a try, I'm sure you'll be satisfied.

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,680
That's OK.

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,000
So wait a minute.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,520
Your new person? I have never seen it before.

57
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,400
Yes, the name is Thong.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
I also know how to live.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,760
The first time we met, he already knew how to please me.

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,760
Not like the little girl from before.

61
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,720
What's the name?

62
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Except.

63
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,200
Yes, that's right.

64
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,840
It's too arrogant and doesn't know how to behave properly.

65
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
How dare you act like you're showing off to me.

66
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Where is it now?

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,320
I kicked it and chased it away.

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,960
Good.

69
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
Here's the wine, ma'am.

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,720
- Thank. - Here, sir.

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,160
- Bag. - Thank.

72
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,960
No need, ma'am.

73
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,640
Thong doesn't want to accept money.

74
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Thong just wanted to say goodbye to the hostess.

75
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,840
And want to be closer to the lady a little more.

76
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,040
Because the owner is so beautiful and smells good too.

77
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,040
Take it.

78
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,480
I already took it out.

79
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Are you going to let me put it back in my bag?

80
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,640
Thank you very much ma'am.

81
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,000
The owner comes here often.

82
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,200
What is it? Lightning like an elephant.

83
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,400
I just met the owner just now.

84
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,920
Talk to each other a lot.

85
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,640
Then what's so interesting?

86
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,880
The owner also comes here often.

87
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,280
The bar business is hers so she should come here.

88
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,080
I think it's the boss's.

89
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,840
Why is this the first time I see her here?

90
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,840
Don't know.

91
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,080
It's not like I've been missing for a month like this

92
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Probably coming back from a trip abroad.

93
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,080
That's what rich people are like.

94
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,000
You have to find time to spend money, otherwise you won't lose money

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
crushed to death, do you understand?

96
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,040
I also want to be crushed to death by money.

97
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,560
Just wait and see, I will go through the roof.

98
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,440
What are you talking about?

99
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,040
What goes through the roof?

100
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,240
She said it herself

101
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,600
The mistress is the roof of the house,

102
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,200
making me at most just a concubine.

103
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,720
I won't accept that.

104
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
It's me

105
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,440
will become the boss.

106
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,640
Wake up, wake up.

107
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,040
Do you do drugs?

108
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
Want some tangerine?

109
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,840
Take some vitamin C to remove impurities.

110
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,880
Thong, stop dreaming.

111
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,520
You'll never be able to pull the boss down.

112
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Do you know who the owner is?

113
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,200
So who is it?

114
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,520
Also has the same limbs.

115
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,160
In addition, I am as beautiful as the owner.

116
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
Wait a minute.

117
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,520
Let's get it over with.

118
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,120
Read it.

119
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,600
Thip.

120
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,120
Thida... Senee... Tara...

121
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,680
youngest granddaughter of...

122
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
M.R.W.

123
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,920
What's the name that's so hard to read?

124
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,720
Originated from...

125
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
- Praya... - That's enough.

126
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,720
It's just their real names that she can't even read.

127
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Huh?

128
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,720
You know, right?

129
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,080
That she and her are in two different classes.

130
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,720
She is a member of the royal family,

131
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,440
And you only have bacteria.

132
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,720
Why would you fight with her?

133
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,200
This!

134
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
If she's that noble

135
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,000
So why do you like Mr. Bun?

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,320
They don't look like they are a good match.

137
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,160
They must have done meritorious deeds together in previous lives.

138
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,520
But sticking together for such a long time

139
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,960
Just for the benefit of both parties.

140
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,720
She

141
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,720
He is a man with big ears and a wide acquaintance.

142
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,720
People in positions of authority have power everywhere

143
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,040
Everyone must respect her.

144
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,520
And Mr. Bun

145
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,960
There are many huge business deals.

146
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
See? Huh?

147
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,640
They fit together like fish to water.

148
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,880
To, im sao?

149
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,280
Frustrated, right?

150
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,720
No, I'm thinking

151
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,160
see how I can win against her.

152
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,160
Oh, this one!

153
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Aren't you afraid of death?

154
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,880
Fight her

155
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,880
It's much more dangerous for Mr. Bun.

156
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,680
Talking to you is so tiring.

157
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,880
My investigator reported as

158
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,160
Owner Thip has returned.

159
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,680
So we will proceed with the plan this week.

160
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,680
We'll combine the boss and mistress cases together.

161
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,080
But there is a lot of information that we still don't know.

162
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,880
All their forces,

163
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,280
their hiding place,

164
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,600
or the place they will choose as a base.

165
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
So how can we prepare our forces?

166
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,560
block their way?

167
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,760
It's true, no one knows these things yet.

168
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,680
Even me, even though I'm his younger brother

169
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,680
I have never had access to that information.

170
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,680
But today,

171
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,620
we will know.

172
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Please.

173
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,320
Hello madam.

174
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,680
Hello.

175
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,080
Always work from early morning?

176
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,000
Thong knew the lady would come

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,480
so I wanted to go see the owner,

178
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,400
Sometimes the boss will ask Thong to get something for her.

179
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,880
What are you doing, ma'am?

180
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,280
Check the shop's revenue.

181
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,760
A month without being here,

182
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Have to see if there's anything wrong.

183
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
Let Thong make a cocktail for the hostess, okay?

184
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,800
Can you do it?

185
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay.

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,920
Thong likes to sit and watch the bartender mix, it looks very interesting.

187
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,720
So I asked them to teach me a little.

188
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,480
So make me a drink.

189
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,960
What flavor do you want, ma'am?

190
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,400
Whatever recipe you think is best, do it.

191
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,880
So let Thong do it for you.

192
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,160
Surely the owner has never had this flavor before.

193
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,880
The owner was gone for a month,

194
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,240
Didn't even go to the restaurant.

195
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
Is the owner traveling abroad?

196
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,960
Going abroad is correct.

197
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,240
But not traveling.

198
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,240
Go talk business

199
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,200
in Mexico.

200
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,800
The owner is really good.

201
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,080
If Thong wants to become a good businesswoman like the boss

202
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,840
so what should I do?

203
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,480
Are you telling the truth?

204
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,160
Really.

205
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,800
Thong has dreamed since childhood.

206
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,440
If Thong grows up

207
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,400
Then Thong wanted to do some business.

208
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,800
But unfortunately,

209
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Thong's father and mother

210
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,200
just a farmer,

211
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,800
There is no money to send Thong to higher education.

212
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,720
There is also no spare money in the house.

213
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,880
Until the land is confiscated

214
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,800
Then Thong went to the boss

215
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,280
to earn money to send back to pay off family debt.

216
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,760
Done, ma'am.

217
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,920
Thank.

218
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,600
People say the flavor of cocktails

219
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,000
will reflect a person's true nature.

220
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,560
Fresh.

221
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,560
Hot.

222
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,760
But it also hides a bitter taste.

223
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,080
Are you really that kind of person, Thong?

224
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,160
I don't know.

225
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,080
Maybe when we know each other better,

226
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,480
The hostess will see for herself whether this is really the case.

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,920
I like this new person of yours, Bun.

228
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,360
Who? Thong?

229
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,280
YES. Looks good to me.

230
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,640
You be careful.

231
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Thong is not normal.

232
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,280
Looking so cute and innocent from the outside,

233
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,960
but deep in her eyes

234
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,400
The brutality is evident.

235
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
Just like we raise snakes.

236
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,400
Love or hate

237
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,280
cannot be seen at all.

238
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,320
But if we raise it well

239
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,920
then we will receive many benefits from snakes.

240
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,040
I think I have it under control.

241
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,520
Because I...

242
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,000
is a poisonous mongoose.

243
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,440
And Thong

244
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,440
just a baby snake.

245
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,840
The fangs haven't grown enough yet.

246
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,440
What can you use to fight me?

247
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,800
That's OK.

248
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,880
If you're sure, just use it.

249
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,160
What are you going to let Thong do?

250
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,880
Or is there a new plan?

251
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,600
Our business

252
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,280
Sometimes you also need someone to help.

253
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
I think

254
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,640
I'll find some small things for her to try.

255
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,200
Also to prove her honesty.

256
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,680
Okay.

257
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,800
But you can't let her work too much.

258
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,320
Because Thong has to come work with me too.

259
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,040
She also knows

260
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,360
I did it very strongly.

261
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,680
If she works too much, she won't be able to do it with me.

262
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,840
If not

263
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,000
Then you have to take responsibility for her.

264
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,320
Stop it.

265
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,960
I lost my feelings for him a long time ago.

266
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,440
No help.

267
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,440
Help yourself.

268
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,280
How to help yourself?

269
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,800
What to do?

270
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,840
Forgot it.

271
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,240
This.

272
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,760
I see Thong

273
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,040
Go talk to the lady.

274
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Don't know what it's talking about. Do you guys know?

275
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,800
I think he probably gossiped and said bad things

276
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,960
Then she's just flattering like a dog.

277
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,480
Or...

278
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,720
She took the story that we used to tease her

279
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
gossiping with the boss?

280
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,120
I probably don't know you guys are talking bad about me.

281
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
I know

282
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,200
that you guys are slandering me about something.

283
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,520
Is the story of me standing with the boss right?

284
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,080
You guys don't need to secretly say bad things.

285
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
I will tell you.

286
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,560
Mistress

287
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
I love you very much.

288
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
She's giving me instructions.

289
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,760
Like before,

290
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,200
She showed me the shop's books.

291
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,560
I see it all

292
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,280
Who earns how much or how much money?

293
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,280
Miss Jan.

294
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,720
You should also push yourself a bit.

295
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,600
This month

296
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
I was only called twice.

297
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,200
You probably want to get promoted through your boss, right?

298
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,400
I tell you it's not easy.

299
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,200
In the past, there were people who tried to get along

300
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,080
to get promoted like you.

301
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,520
But in the end

302
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
only receive a funeral wreath as a reward.

303
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,520
The owner is very smart.

304
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,520
How could she let someone else rise to the same level?

305
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,800
She's just taking advantage.

306
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,560
After taking advantage, get rid of it.

307
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,000
Because I know too much about her.

308
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,080
Actually

309
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
I've been to many people's funerals.

310
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,080
Consider it a blessing for you.

311
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
Do you want porridge or fish balls?

312
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,640
Let me buy it right.

313
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,360
Thanks for reminding me.

314
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,560
Just wait and see

315
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,400
am I successful or not?

316
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,800
What about porridge or fish balls?

317
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,440
Then you ask yourself.

318
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
To go to your mother's funeral.

319
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,840
What?

320
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,840
Thong.

321
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,200
Come sit down and eat together, we just ate.

322
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,560
Then we talked about what she would do for me.

323
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Yes, then Thong go prepare the wine.

324
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,760
The owner is very smart.

325
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,200
How could she let someone else rise to the same level?

326
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,400
She's just taking advantage, that's all

327
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,960
then dispose of it.

328
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,280
Because I know too much about her.

329
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,320
Hey, sister!

330
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,160
She said someone went to work for the boss and was killed.

331
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,600
Who are there?

332
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,720
- I've never heard it. - Yes, that's right.

333
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,160
I've never heard it either.

334
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,560
EH!

335
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,040
So I made up a story to trick Thong.

336
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,720
Let it be afraid, when going to work it is easy to be careless.

337
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,320
It's worth it.

338
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,440
You are really good at making prescriptions.

339
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,200
Are you praising or cursing me?

340
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,480
- Compliment. - Compliment.

341
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,400
Oh, what is this?

342
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What is it, Si? What's wrong?

343
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,360
Here it is.

344
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,560
It took a lot of effort to hide it.

345
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,920
I can see for myself again.

346
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,040
Don't tell anyone I secretly took the photo.

347
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,800
No, but why are you taking pictures? Huh?

348
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,040
If discovered

349
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,320
Then you will be shot once and for all.

350
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,960
Got shot once,

351
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,320
Still not afraid of death?

352
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,000
Because of fear of death,

353
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,480
so I had to take a photo.

354
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
I am preparing to work closely with the boss.

355
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,880
Maybe she'll kill me to silence me.

356
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,000
When she pointed the gun at my head,

357
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll pull these pictures out

358
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,160
to agree.

359
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,400
Hey, Thong!

360
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,360
How can you think that far?

361
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,920
Why did she have these thoughts in her mind?

362
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,400
It was Mr. Bun who taught me that.

363
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
He said if you want to have the power, you can dictate conditions to anyone

364
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,520
then we must have something to exchange.

365
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,040
If the other party is not interested

366
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,720
I will reveal everything.

367
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,160
Try to think about it.

368
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,160
Descendants of people of royal blood

369
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,240
Would you accept revealing photos of yourself having dinner with a drug lord?

370
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
Thong!

371
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,720
Can't you live a normal life?

372
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,760
She is the main concubine as she is now

373
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,440
already many times more comfortable than others.

374
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,160
If one day she loses this position

375
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,640
Then you can just sit and receive guests like us.

376
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
It's not difficult at all.

377
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
It's still better than giving your life away

378
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,120
to do such risky things.

379
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,040
I have already stepped one foot into this world.

380
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,760
Anyway, it's a risk

381
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
It's worth taking the risk.

382
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,760
If I can do it

383
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,080
then I would be in a different position.

384
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,800
In a different position?

385
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,000
What is it?

386
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,040
What do you want? Thong! Tell me.

387
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,960
I have already taken the money from the previous shipment abroad.

388
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,280
Safe, no need to worry.

389
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,320
I'll ask for a portion first.

390
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,680
Who knows, maybe someone will know by chance

391
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,680
then there will be a solution.

392
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,600
Okay, I'll deal with it.

393
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,800
Can Thong take photos and record videos?

394
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,800
How can you do that?

395
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,160
I know this kind of evidence

396
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,480
Can't even a professional investigator collect it?

397
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,360
The inspector kept talking too much.

398
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,160
I'm serious, I just need this photo

399
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,720
can be convicted of human trafficking, drug selling,

400
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,800
money laundering, complicity, all of it.

401
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,560
Thank you very much Thong.

402
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,640
This case is almost over.

403
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,920
Thanks to you, it was successful.

404
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,320
Because there is an inspector who motivates me.

405
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,240
The Inspector is the first

406
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,400
always motivate me,

407
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,320
so that I want to stand up and do good things for others.

408
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,240
This, this is my Thong.

409
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,520
Inspector,

410
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Thong asked this for a moment.

411
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,520
If we

412
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,680
Arrest Mr. Bun and the landlady in prison,

413
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
The opium trade collapsed

414
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,920
Where will their money go?

415
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,440
Money and assets from the opium trade

416
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
will be confiscated and brought into the royal family.

417
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,440
Thong asked what are you doing?

418
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,120
The thing is...

419
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,480
Let's talk straight.

420
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,480
Thong wants money.

421
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,480
Thong has been poor since childhood.

422
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,280
Up to now, I still haven't held tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of money

423
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,120
like people.

424
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,800
If when we confiscate the property of Mr. Bun and the landlady,

425
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,400
Divide by Thong about...

426
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,000
part

427
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,000
Is it possible?

428
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
It's okay to consider it as Thong's working salary.

429
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,520
Actually

430
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,120
not quite right,

431
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,000
but

432
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,400
There is also a way.

433
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,000
Inspector, please help Thong.

434
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Thong will do this with all his heart.

435
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,320
Even if he dies, Thong is not afraid.

436
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,240
Well done, my talented girl.

437
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,840
Where to go?

438
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
When she became a madam

439
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
Then work worthy of the title, right?

440
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,600
I went to get some fresh air in the garden.

441
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,680
You have something to hide from me, right?

442
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,280
Say it now.

443
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,440
What's up? What do you know?

444
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,680
Then he knew she was preparing to betray the boss

445
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,680
and now

446
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,160
You're a spy for Inspector Mit, right?

447
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
How do you know?

448
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,680
- Did you follow me back from the garden? - YES.

449
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,760
Then I suspected her many times so I followed her.

450
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,120
Thong, why don't you tell me what you're planning to do?

451
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,120
Why should I say it?

452
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,360
I'm an adult, I can do whatever I want, it has nothing to do with you.

453
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,360
Why is it irrelevant?

454
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
You're taking my life

455
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
hanging on the same rope as her.

456
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,560
If the boss catches you

457
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
then I will also be involved in the war.

458
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,440
The boss will definitely think that

459
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,440
I am complicit with you.

460
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,240
Thong, I want to be a simple whore,

461
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,760
don't want to get on the bullet train

462
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
like you're doing.

463
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,520
So you want to be a prostitute at the boss's bar

464
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
When you get old, do you go through menopause?

465
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Even if you want to do it, you can't do it.

466
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Maybe you'll get caught first.

467
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,840
Because of the inspector

468
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
is preparing to overthrow the tycoon's business.

469
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
I was the one who brought him the information.

470
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,640
Oh, what's wrong with you, Thong?

471
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
I'm so confused with you.

472
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,160
Why do you say you're trying to approach the boss?

473
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,520
Is it because you want to take her place?

474
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,240
So why do you suddenly want the inspector to overthrow the boss?

475
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,960
I have new thoughts and new actions.

476
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,520
Anyway, I can't win against the boss.

477
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,320
So I think sticking by the boss's side is probably not okay.

478
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,600
Because in the end, the bad guys are caught by the police.

479
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,200
It's not like I jumped away from the bad guys and instead stuck with the police

480
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Before the robbery den breaks down, it's better.

481
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,240
So what does that mean? Stick to the police?

482
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,080
Don't tell me you're a spy for the police?

483
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,080
Do not have.

484
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,960
When I looked into the inspector's eyes,

485
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,960
I can guess

486
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
that he has some feelings for me.

487
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,360
I'm sure I have the ability to be his wife, sister.

488
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,360
He's a good person.

489
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,840
He doesn't criticize my past.

490
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,880
- Thong, be careful... - That's enough.

491
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,680
I trust my senses. You don't need to say anything else.

492
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,040
I think he has feelings for me anyway.

493
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,680
Thong, hey, listen to me.

494
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Thong, hey... Uh.

495
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,120
Closed forever?

496
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,560
Dead.

497
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,840
Except.

498
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,200
Yes, Inspector.

499
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,600
What's up?

500
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,480
You've been at my house for many days, have you been able to sleep yet?

501
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,920
I'm better now, thank you for the medicine that the inspector gave me.

502
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,920
Otherwise, I probably won't be able to sleep all night.

503
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,840
Mean

504
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,600
Malee still hates Thong in her heart, right?

505
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,600
Oh, Inspector.

506
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,680
Look at the things he did to you, who could forget?

507
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,760
That Thong hurts me to the core like that.

508
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,760
If the inspector doesn't stop, don't ask for help

509
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,760
I'll probably follow it until morning.

510
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,160
Maybe I thought of you.

511
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,720
I thought

512
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,720
Malee turned her focus to Thong

513
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,720
Can I go to Mr. Bun?

514
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,120
Mr. Bun is definitely a bad guy.

515
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,720
He created arguments between Malee and Thong

516
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,480
just for entertainment only.

517
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,160
To be honest, I also hate Mr. Bun.

518
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,640
I devoted myself so much,

519
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,120
Of course, now that I have to beat him, I don't have the heart to do it.

520
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,640
But the inspector's job of taking down Mr. Bun

521
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,000
where have you been?

522
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,000
Tomorrow I will come see Mr. Bun

523
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,160
to start the first plan.

524
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,280
Because I got the information from Malee

525
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,160
So the new work can begin.

526
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,640
Thank you.

527
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,920
I don't like taking risks.

528
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,280
How much does it cost to trade with new partners?

529
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
If not trapped

530
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,600
Money was also stolen.

531
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
This group has many tricks.

532
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,600
Especially Mr. Jing,

533
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
talking nonsense.

534
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Trade with acquaintances

535
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,960
I feel much more secure.

536
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,320
But over here, people order a ton.

537
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,960
There aren't many such large orders.

538
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,720
Do it once, earn hundreds of millions of baht.

539
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,120
You can close the factory and take a long break.

540
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
There's no need to sell one hundred or two hundred kilograms at a time.

541
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,480
That's much more tiring.

542
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,480
Inspector is right.

543
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,320
The more missions, the easier it is to get caught.

544
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
Bribes must be paid continuously.

545
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
But if the deal is big, pay once and you're done.

546
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,840
But the downside

547
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,520
is to sit and watch

548
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,920
See if there is a risk of being scammed.

549
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,160
Because this is the first transaction

550
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,600
order such a large quantity up to a ton

551
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
