1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,400
[The film was created for entertainment purposes.]

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,520
[Characters, actions, places and events in the film are hypothetical events.]

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,440
[No intention of sexual arousal,]

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,440
[leading or inciting inappropriate or morally corrupt behavior]

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,000
[And there is no intention to cause damage to any profession]

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[or have a negative attitude toward any organization or group of people.]

00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:16,992
THE ROSE OF SIN

8
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:54,940
THE ROSE OF SIN

9
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:56,640
Episode 22

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
There is a question that everyone always asks.

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,720
That's what we were born for.

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,720
For me, I was born to bring happiness to others.

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,560
That's why I decided to become a musician.

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,040
When I see someone cry,

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
I want to come and make them laugh.

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,400
If I can't do it, I feel bad.

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,920
I don't say that to start any song.

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,640
Just a little side chat.

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm still the one who loves you with all my heart.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,440
I just keep missing you like that.

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,160
I still look back at the photos all the time

22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,240
with which we were intimate

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,360
everyday.

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,640
I'm still waiting for you to come back.

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,520
I still think about it every night.

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,800
Just because of this one word in my heart, it binds us together

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,320
together.

28
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,200
Wait a minute.

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,520
Why did you come here?

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,560
Take me to hide first, quickly! I'm afraid he'll follow.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,120
Go!

32
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,640
Did you escape from him here?

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,680
So does he know?

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Now you probably know that.

35
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,960
Probably looking for me.

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,920
I don't know where to go, I don't know who to turn to.

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,360
So I came to find you.

38
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,240
So how did you know I was performing today?

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,360
Luckily I'm here.

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,040
What should I do if I arrive on the wrong day and can't meet her?

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,360
No mistake.

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,440
I intentionally hid today.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,800
I remember you telling me that you perform here every Friday.

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,040
Mont!

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,000
Please help me!

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,520
I really don't know who else to turn to.

47
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,520
Can't you help me?

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,600
If I don't, I will be locked up and tortured again. Please help me.

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,840
Help, I always help.

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,880
I'm just thinking about it.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you good at lying?

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,720
No, but it's okay to try.

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
Who do you want me to lie to?

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,480
I had to make up a story to trick my mother.

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,560
Wait a minute.

56
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,800
Sorry.

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,160
My room is a bit old.

58
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,200
But I guarantee there are no cockroaches.

59
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,200
My mother has already cleaned the toilet.

60
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,720
This room

61
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,200
don't call it old.

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,440
Even better than my room.

63
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,920
Hearing you say that, I feel reassured.

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,840
Today,

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,640
You sleep in my room, I'll sleep on the sofa downstairs.

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,080
Tomorrow I will take you to introduce you to my mother.

67
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:50,840
But

68
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,240
aren't we pretending to be lovers?

69
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,080
Why don't we sleep together?

70
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,280
If your mother sees us sleeping apart, will she be suspicious?

71
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,400
They are lovers, not husband and wife.

72
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,960
How can we sleep in the same room?

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,600
Well, these are my mother's thoughts, not mine.

74
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,000
If at my house

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,280
Don't do anything against my mother's wishes. Understand?

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,440
Now then

77
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,320
let's go to sleep.

78
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,320
I'll wake you up tomorrow. Good night.

79
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,360
Mont.

80
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,080
Huh?

81
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,000
I...

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,360
Thank you.

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,120
You treat me so well.

84
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,040
Accept the trouble to help me

85
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,840
while we are nothing to each other.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,320
Why can't it be nothing?

87
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,440
We are lovers.

88
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,760
Even though it's just pretending.

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,040
Is there anything left?

90
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,480
It's okay to repeat it again.

91
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,280
Repeat until God is satisfied.

92
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,600
What else will fate encounter?

93
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,480
Mont!

94
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,040
Mont!

95
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,240
Mont! Get up now!

96
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,000
You were drunk so you slept here yesterday, right?

97
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,080
What is it, mom? It's just early morning.

98
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,160
How many times have my mom told me not to drive when you're drunk?

99
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,520
What if you have an accident and fall to death?

100
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,120
Dragging others to die with them.

101
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Who's drunk, mom? I'm not drunk.

102
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,040
Yesterday, a friend asked me to sleep at home, Mom.

103
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,480
So I let people go upstairs to sleep.

104
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,680
Women? Who is that?

105
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,520
Is it Yem?

106
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,400
No, mom.

107
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,680
Mont and Yem broke up a long time ago, mom, don't mention it anymore.

108
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,200
If not Yem, then who? Why did you take him home to sleep?

109
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
As a woman, is it okay to go to a man's house to sleep like that?

110
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,280
Didn't her parents say anything? Besides, do you know this woman?

111
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,160
Oh, you ask so many questions, even the rap singer is confused.

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,920
Mont!

113
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,280
So let me bring her down so you can get to know her. Okay?

114
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,120
Thong, are you awake yet?

115
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,360
Let me come in.

116
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,040
Thong!

117
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
Thong! It's okay to wake up.

118
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:34,840
Strange but true, this should not have happened to me.

119
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,800
- It's love... - Why are you playing the piano here?

120
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,480
Can you wake up? I sing to wake you up.

121
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,840
Go, go wash your face.

122
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
My mother is waiting to see you downstairs.

123
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,360
Before going down,

124
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
Go change clothes and look a little more discreet.

125
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,080
My mother is a bit difficult.

126
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,360
Discreet?

127
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,320
This is the most discreet set yet.

128
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,280
So wear my clothes.

129
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,560
Is your mother angry?

130
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,440
My mother? My mother is not evil.

131
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,040
It's just that she's a bit picky and a bit nagging.

132
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,200
So what if your mother hates me?

133
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,400
Do you see?

134
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,480
The type of mother-in-law who hates her daughter-in-law and then tries to sabotage her.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,560
I'm really afraid that it will be like that.

136
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,080
You've been watching too many movies.

137
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,240
War between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law

138
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,200
Only in movies, right?

139
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,240
I've seen it in real life.

140
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,440
Neighbors near the house quarrel with each other and the whole market knows about it.

141
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,520
I don't want that.

142
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,440
No need to think too much, my mother is not that kind of person.

143
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,800
Don't forget it's the two of us

144
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,080
Just pretending to be a lover.

145
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,280
When Inspector Mit stops hunting for you, we will break up.

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,280
That's why you don't need to care if my mother is cruel or not.

147
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,120
Here, change your clothes.

148
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,720
This is Thong.

149
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,800
Mont's lover.

150
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
Hello mom.

151
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,520
Hello.

152
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,680
Sit down.

153
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,840
Thong is a junior at university and has known each other for a long time.

154
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,880
But we've only been dating for two months.

155
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,640
You really deserve to be beaten.

156
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,720
I have a lover but I don't tell my mother.

157
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,720
Mom asked and said no.

158
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,520
At that time, I wasn't sure, Mom, but now

159
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,360
Then sure, I should bring it home and introduce it to my mother.

160
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,960
Where did you go last night?

161
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,920
Why don't you go home and sleep here?

162
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,920
Thong wants to ask

163
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,320
stay at my mother's house for a while.

164
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,640
Huh? Come live together?

165
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,160
What's up? Is there anything wrong?

166
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,880
Thong is an orphan,

167
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,480
grew up in an orphanage,

168
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,360
lived there from childhood to adulthood.

169
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,840
But now there are many new children coming in,

170
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
so there's not enough room.

171
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,680
Thong is big now,

172
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,600
I want them to live comfortably.

173
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,920
So Thong sacrificed himself and asked to go out.

174
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,040
What a pity.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,240
Actually

176
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,440
Thong also saved some money.

177
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,400
I plan to rent a small apartment to live.

178
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
But I can't accumulate much.

179
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,960
But every month

180
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,800
Thong had to save money to pay off his student union debt.

181
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,800
Although Thong graduated with high scores,

182
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,400
But Thong also wants to repay the debt as quickly as possible.

183
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,640
I want them to have money to continue studying.

184
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,360
Oh, what a pity.

185
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,840
So what is Thong doing?

186
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,160
Have enough money to live?

187
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,560
Thong used to work as an office worker.

188
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,040
But the company just closed,

189
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,920
The boss fled to a foreign country.

190
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,640
Thong did not receive a single penny of compensation.

191
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,640
If mom asks yes

192
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,280
Do you have enough money to live?

193
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,840
there isn't much either.

194
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,360
It's true that it's all kinds of bad luck.

195
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,800
This is it. Just stay here.

196
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,680
When you find a solution, then consider moving forward.

197
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,480
Thank you very much mom.

198
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,720
Thong. You don't need to rush to find a job.

199
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
If luck comes, it will come.

200
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,320
During this time, just stay home and help your mother with the housework first.

201
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,160
Then go to the temple with my mother.

202
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,480
Yes, mother.

203
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,200
Thong also likes doing housework and going to temple.

204
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,120
Thong's family can do all the work, it's not boring at all.

205
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,000
As for going to the temple, Thong can stay there all day.

206
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,960
Thong likes the peaceful and quiet atmosphere of the temple.

207
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,680
Every time I recite sutras and bow to Buddha,

208
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,920
Thong feels very comfortable and relieved.

209
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,800
It's truly fate.

210
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,440
Make two people with the same interests meet each other.

211
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,360
The two of us probably met each other thanks to that merit.

212
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,760
There are three of us, including Mont.

213
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,360
Ah, right?

214
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,040
That's also fate.

215
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,280
Let's go, Thong. Go in there and see the clothes.

216
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,600
I heard that Thong didn't bring any clothes with him.

217
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,880
That's why I wear Mont's clothes, right?

218
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,680
Come on, let mom buy new clothes for you.

219
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,680
Let's go.

220
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Thank you.

221
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,680
See which one you like.

222
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,960
Mom will buy it for you.

223
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,760
Thong. This is so cute.

224
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,560
I think it suits Thong. Do you like Thong?

225
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,320
I like it.

226
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,880
There are flowers too, very cute.

227
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Mom chose the right clothes Thong.

228
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,600
So take this one.

229
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,640
If you want to take more, please feel free to take them.

230
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,720
- Yes. - Mom will also find help.

231
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Inspect?

232
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,760
Thong, what's wrong?

233
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,560
I lost my balance so I staggered.

234
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,840
Have you been hit by the wind?

235
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,400
Why is your face so pale?

236
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,440
Maybe so.

237
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,160
I think we'll buy it quickly and go home.

238
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,800
Okay.

239
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,760
So choose which one you get.

240
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,400
Let mom wait at the checkout.

241
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,040
Yes.

242
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,880
How do you know it's Inspector Mit's man?

243
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,280
Can you see his face clearly?

244
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,320
He wore a helmet to cover his face.

245
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,640
But I'm sure it's the inspector's junior.

246
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,640
So what do you think he came for?

247
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,160
If you come to take her away

248
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,160
Could he rush in and take her away?

249
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,080
With so many people, he wouldn't dare.

250
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,520
Maybe he came to see where I was

251
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,720
and wait for the right opportunity.

252
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,200
Hey, help me!

253
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,720
I don't want to be caught, I don't want to be with him anymore.

254
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Help!

255
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,360
Thong, calm down!

256
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,040
If he met her at the market, he probably wouldn't know where she was.

257
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,760
Mont, he knows where I live.

258
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,400
What should we do now?

259
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,200
Thong, Thong!

260
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,000
If we were in the house, he wouldn't dare enter.

261
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,960
If he broke in, he would be charged with trespassing.

262
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,320
But he's a police officer,

263
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,480
If you have the right, you can do anything.

264
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,800
Just try going in, I'll fight him.

265
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,000
These people don't know how to repent.

266
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,560
Cling to whoever you cling to.

267
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,120
Causing trouble to people like that,

268
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,080
Then karma will find you.

269
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,040
Tomorrow I think I will go to the temple,

270
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,360
Pray for them some blessings.

271
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,280
Thong, come with mom.

272
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,680
Can it be later?

273
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,440
I still don't feel better.

274
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,520
Okay, so let's leave it later.

275
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,960
Mom goes to temple almost every day.

276
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,840
Thong, if you want to read Buddhist scriptures

277
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,440
Then you can go to the Buddha worship room.

278
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,640
Yes.

279
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,920
20 baht.

280
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
20 baht.

281
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,000
- Thank! -Yes!

282
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,400
Finished cleaning this place

283
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,040
Then go clean the Buddha worship room.

284
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,600
My mother will be very happy. I will help you.

285
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,600
He wanted me to be with him so much

286
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,440
Must help to this extent? Do you have any thoughts on me?

287
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,640
In short, is it at this house or somewhere else?

288
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,520
Stay. If not here, then where?

289
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,200
So do you want help with housework?

290
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,560
or want to do it alone?

291
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,320
I want you to help me.

292
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,760
Oh my god, just joking around makes me angry.

293
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,800
I know what you mean to me.

294
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm just as kind as my mother.

295
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,920
His mother and I get along so well that we can't see anything wrong.

296
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,880
At first I was scared to death, afraid that the cobra was keeping eggs.

297
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,640
Mom isn't worried about my eggs,

298
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,520
I'm the one taking care of my eggs.

299
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,120
Sinister, that can be said.

300
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,640
My mother is a very loving person,

301
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,160
But the fact that we helped each other draw up your resume was to trick my mother

302
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,440
The results were really good and you lied really smoothly.

303
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
Just like a professional scammer.

304
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You keep exaggerating, I'm not that bad.

305
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,880
Mont, come down and see mommy for a bit.

306
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,280
Yes, mother.

307
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,520
Mom's back, go prepare some cool water for her.

308
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,520
Mom, why did you come back so quickly?

309
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,640
The two of us are planning to clean the bathroom to surprise mom.

310
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,440
Mont, go talk to mom.

311
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,640
What's wrong, mom?

312
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,480
Do you know who I met when I came home from the temple?

313
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,600
Who is that?

314
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,080
Mom met Inspector Mit.

315
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,760
What's wrong with Inspector Mit?

316
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,880
Then what? Did he do anything to mom?

317
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,920
Do it. It's more painful than that.

318
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,120
It hurts to know that Mont is a liar.

319
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,280
Shaking hands with this woman made up a story to deceive her mother.

320
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,000
Mont, which story is true?

321
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,960
Mom, what story did Inspector Mit tell you?

322
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,920
Thong used to work as a prostitute at tycoon Bun's bar.

323
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,040
The person who is currently hiding from the case has gone abroad.

324
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,360
Are you sure it's the same person named Thong?

325
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,120
She said she does office work.

326
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,320
That's right Thong.

327
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,760
Boss Bun's bar is closed

328
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,080
I took her in to live with me because I felt pitiful.

329
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,760
She didn't live with me for long and then ran away without saying goodbye.

330
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,240
I came to talk to my aunt today

331
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,800
nothing,

332
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,280
I just want to remind you

333
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,880
Please be careful with Thong's words.

334
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,880
Because when she speaks, tell the truth or lie

335
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,640
I can't even tell the difference.

336
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,720
If she says bad things about me

337
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,160
Well, just try to think about it,

338
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,160
Does a police officer like me like what she says?

339
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,440
Inspector Mit told me something?

340
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,680
Can you still ask?

341
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,040
You're the one who should tell me.

342
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
Tell me, who are you?

343
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,880
Let's ignore who Thong is, mom.

344
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,160
I think Thong is in trouble now, she needs to hide.

345
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
I think we can help her with this alone.

346
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,600
Helping is one thing,

347
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,440
but what mom doesn't like

348
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,640
is about Mont lying to his mother.

349
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,800
You tell me,

350
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,320
Which story is true?

351
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,840
Thong is really Mont's lover, mom.

352
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,280
I think this reason alone is enough for her to stay here.

353
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,960
Mont, stop and talk clearly.

354
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,080
Mont.

355
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,880
Thong, you don't need to think too much.

356
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,280
You just stay in this house. Let me go down and talk to mom.

357
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,920
Wait, Mont.

358
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,200
Did you lie again about us being lovers?

359
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,040
Then what else do we need to lie about?

360
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,960
The inspector has probably told all about her history to my mother.

361
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,080
Just have to accept it like that.

362
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,920
The only thing that can lie

363
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,360
is that we are lovers,

364
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,360
help her stay in this house.

365
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,920
Just like that.

366
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,760
Mom.

367
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,760
Mont is sorry, Mom.

368
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,880
If it's not really necessary, Mont won't lie to his mother.

369
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,640
What I want to lie about

370
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,200
It's something I'm familiar with Thong.

371
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,760
Not the truth, right?

372
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,400
Mont and Thong really know each other, mom.

373
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,280
Thong is the woman Mont once told about

374
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,120
that Mont found her crying in Tra Tra Mit's house.

375
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,000
Mont felt sorry,

376
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,040
so I talked to her.

377
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,360
And... we secretly met each other.

378
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,280
Because of this woman

379
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,200
that I did against morality and ethics.

380
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,320
She is the detective's lover,

381
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,480
Why do you rob people?

382
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,000
Please bring her back quickly.

383
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,920
But Thong doesn't love the inspector, mother.

384
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,840
She was forced, imprisoned, so Mont helped her escape.

385
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,320
When we meet people in need, we must help them, right?

386
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,600
But such a dirty woman,

387
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,600
I can't be your lover.

388
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,960
You and her are different, you two have two different paths.

389
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,000
Your lover must be a suitable person,

390
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,000
have a good job and education

391
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,160
not that kind of woman.

392
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,960
I see that in this matter, we do not have the same opinion, mother.

393
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,840
Mont doesn't see how Thong is different from us.

394
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,000
She is also human like us.

395
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Mont sees nothing wrong with loving her.

396
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,720
Let Thong stay here, mom?

397
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,840
Mont really can't let her go back to see Inspector Mit.

398
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,120
I bow to God and Buddha.

399
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,640
Please help light the way for my son.

400
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,800
Mont! I'm sorry.

401
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,800
Sorry for what?

402
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,080
Because it caused him to quarrel with his mother.

403
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,040
No need to think too much about it, Thong.

404
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,040
My mother understands, she will understand.

405
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,880
I know, no mother wants her son to have anything to do with me.

406
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,640
I don't want you and your mother to have conflicts.

407
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,720
Just tell mom, that we are nothing to each other.

408
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,720
Let me go find a new place to live.

409
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,760
Maybe move to another province.

410
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,440
The inspector couldn't find it.

411
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,640
Thong, stop thinking like that.

412
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,400
I've already helped you, so I have to help you properly.

413
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,800
As for my argument with my mother

414
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,960
then there's no need to worry.

415
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,800
I argue with my mother like this often.

416
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,560
It's not a big deal.

417
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,920
It won't end here.

418
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,080
I'm afraid the inspector will come here.

419
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,360
causing him and his mother to be implicated.

420
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,520
No need to worry about this, I found a solution.

421
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,680
I have a friend who is a journalist,

422
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,760
I'll try asking her to see if she can help.

423
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,840
Some people have influence

424
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,480
I'm only afraid of one thing: journalists.

425
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,240
Yem, I need help with something, can we meet?

426
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,680
Busy with work these days, about 3-4 more days.

427
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,720
Bait!

428
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,360
What's up? Long time no see, still beautiful as before?

429
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,800
You too, long time no see, still handsome as ever.

430
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,600
Have you showered today?

431
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,880
Have you taken a bath?

432
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,600
When I know I have to meet you, I have to take a shower.

433
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,560
Come on, let's go home.

434
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,600
Yem, this is Thong, my lover.

435
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,400
Thong, this is my friend Yem, she's the resident reporter.

436
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,560
Hey, if there's an introduction, you should introduce it well enough.

437
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,920
Currently we are friends, but in the past we were lovers.

438
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,560
But you needn't be afraid that we'll come back.

439
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,480
I don't like reading the same book twice.

440
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,480
Once you know the ending, there's nothing interesting anymore.

441
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,040
Yes, she loves to read.

442
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,160
Let's get to work, there's work later, right?

443
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,600
Alright.

444
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,920
Say, do you want me to report to help the band become more famous?

445
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,760
This is also a big deal.

446
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,480
At first I didn't think it would be this serious.

447
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,040
It's a big deal, otherwise how would you dare ask Yem for help?

448
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,720
What, Yem? After listening, is there any way to inspect Mit?

449
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,080
Not related to Thong anymore?

450
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,800
Inspector Mit is a man with a very clean background.

451
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,200
People in the police world are also his people.

452
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,480
If one day he comes to take Thong back

453
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,440
Surely no one can help.

454
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,160
Which means I have no way to escape,

455
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,080
Will I have to go back to living with him?

456
00:30:58,352 --> 00:31:02,742
THE ROSE OF SIN
