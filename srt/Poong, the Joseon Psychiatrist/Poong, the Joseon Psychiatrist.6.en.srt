Eun Woo.

3
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,478
Were you reading a book?

4
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:20,408
I thought so.

5
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:24,877
Here.

6
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:28,448
Oh. Thank you.

(Gugeubyangbang)

8
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,688
If you will read all night,

9
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:33,117
I will take them back.

10
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:35,287
No. I will not do that.

11
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,397
I will assist you tomorrow.

12
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,328
Treat the madam with acupuncture.

13
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:45,468
Already?

14
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:47,908
Yes.

15
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:01,088
It is a gift...

16
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:03,317
for your first treatment.

17
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,396
I cannot take it. It is yours.

18
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,957
You need it for when you can treat people again.

19
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:19,498
Until then,

20
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:22,308
could you be my hands?

21
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,208
Could you do that for me?

22
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:37,917
Until then.

23
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:40,857
When the time comes.

24
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:44,857
Yes.

25
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:47,227
When the time comes,

26
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:49,468
return it then.

27
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,507
Yes. I will do that.

28
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:36,248
Yoo Se Yeob is the King's childhood friend.

29
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:39,218
You must get rid of him in a way that cannot be traced.

30
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,317
Leave no trace.

(Episode 6)

32
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:55,567
I found out where the runaway court maid Wol Yi's family lives.

33
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:09,607
- Chungju? - Yes, my lord.

34
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:12,077
With your permission, I can go there and get them at once.

35
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,947
It must be done without fail this time.

36
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:19,257
If we get rid of Yoo Se Yeob and that court maid,

37
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:23,627
all the evidence regarding the deceased King will be gone.

38
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:25,458
Of course, my lord.

39
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:30,868
I will go there and see to it myself.

40
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:47,987
Ouch, my back.

41
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:50,758
My gosh! A ghost!

42
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:56,128
There is a ghost!

43
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:57,426
This little...

44
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:58,627
Go away!

45
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:00,926
Where? Where is this ghost?

46
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,296
The ghost. Where is it?

47
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:04,268
- Where... - My gosh.

48
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:05,997
Oh.

49
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,037
It is me, Eun Woo.

50
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:13,307
Gosh, you scared us.

51
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:14,408
What?

52
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:17,417
What were you doing?

53
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,917
My lady.

54
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:29,628
Do not practice acupuncture on the delicious meat. What a waste.

55
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,028
You should...

56
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:32,927
just practice on me.

57
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:39,167
So you have been practicing since the wee hours?

58
00:05:41,638 --> 00:05:44,338
I could not fall asleep after you gave me this.

59
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:49,408
Then let us practice right away.

60
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:51,878
It is the back, so start from here.

61
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,758
The Baesu point requires a diagonal, shallow-depth insertion.

62
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,258
Right?

63
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:01,687
Yes.

64
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:14,468
Oh, no.

65
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:17,037
It is fine.

66
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,208
You are okay.

67
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,237
You did an excellent job for someone who has never done it before.

68
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:55,676
Oh, it did not hurt at all.

69
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:59,318
My, you should take the medical licensing exam right away.

70
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,648
- Stay still. - That hurt.

71
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:05,186
Physician Yoo! This person has a terrible stomachache.

72
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:06,218
Come out at once!

73
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:08,487
A patient is here already?

74
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:10,927
Keep practicing.

75
00:07:16,328 --> 00:07:21,208
When he practiced on me, I ended up with so many bruises.

76
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:24,708
Go on and practice on other parts too.

77
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:27,977
Then...

78
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:30,778
how about Habgok?

79
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,318
Oh.

80
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:36,148
Here.

81
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:39,617
Oh, you see...

82
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:43,287
After his mother passed away, he suddenly decided...

83
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,958
to become a physician even though he had aced...

84
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:48,867
the Special Exam for Liberal Arts, and the family went bonkers.

85
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:52,568
He practiced on me nonstop back then,

86
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:55,008
so I know where Habgok is.

87
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:59,976
My, he even aced the Special Exam for Liberal Arts.

88
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:02,547
Of course, he has aced every exam he has ever taken.

89
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:04,078
And he is the most stubborn man I know.

90
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:10,617
You see, that needle box...

91
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,487
His Majesty the King bestowed it upon him...

92
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:15,357
when he aced the medical licensing exam.

93
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,528
It is one of a kind.

94
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,698
I did not know that it was such a cherished possession.

95
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:24,996
In the Palace,

96
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:27,837
everyone called him "Divine Needle."

97
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:30,637
His Majesty the King came up with that nickname.

98
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:32,637
He always knew exactly which medicine to give.

99
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,907
And with a single acupuncture treatment,

100
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:37,378
he could even bring back the dead.

101
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:41,648
Oh, my. He was that skilled?

102
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:44,318
Others would think...

103
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:46,758
that you are lying.

104
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:52,758
It is fine.

105
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:54,628
I am okay.

106
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:58,498
That is why this is so crazy.

107
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:00,738
You see, it is nice...

108
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,467
to gain a skill that you did not have,

109
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:03,977
but if you lose a skill you had,

110
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,837
it drives you crazy.

111
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,787
There is a first time for everything.

112
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:26,927
Were you nervous when you treated your first patient?

113
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:28,427
Of course, I was.

114
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:31,937
My first patient was the Crown Prince.

115
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:34,967
Really?

116
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:36,307
Yes.

117
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:41,148
My hands trembled even more than this.

118
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:42,707
Like this.

119
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,217
Like this.

120
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:49,447
Oh, I should not laugh.

121
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:50,817
I apologize.

122
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:55,457
"I have gained the best hands."

123
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,797
"They are better than my own hands."

124
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,598
I know...

125
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:02,327
you will make me think that someday.

126
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:28,358
Madam.

127
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:31,028
May I feel your pulse first?

128
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,268
Sure.

129
00:10:43,738 --> 00:10:46,508
Have your fingers been stiff lately?

130
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:49,348
How did you know that?

131
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:52,748
And being worried excessively has kept you up at night.

132
00:10:57,358 --> 00:11:00,216
Energy is stagnant in the liver, which has caused a stringy pulse.

133
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:02,686
On top of that, I sense it beating rapidly too.

134
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:03,857
(Chok: a rapid pulse)

135
00:11:03,858 --> 00:11:05,696
Your husband's illegitimate son Seok Cheol...

136
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,497
and the mistress who resides with you...

137
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:08,697
must be the cause of it.

138
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:17,608
Were you able to obtain all that just by reading my pulse?

139
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:21,647
Do you know where...

140
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,047
I have come across this illness the most?

141
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:27,148
The Queen's chambers.

142
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,018
As you know, the Internal Court has many concubines.

143
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:31,716
The heartache and frustration...

144
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:33,658
lead to an energy block in the liver.

145
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:36,187
Thankfully, acupuncture can easily clear it up.

146
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:40,667
Why did you not seek treatment despite the discomfort?

147
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:51,978
Rather than letting me see a physician,

148
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:55,008
my husband called shamans to the house.

149
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:58,417
He believes more in the spiritual world.

150
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:01,148
Who brought you to this level of discomfort?

151
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,988
Was it Seok Cheol? Or was it the mistress?

152
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,287
Physician Yoo, you are out of line.

153
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:08,628
Poor Seok Cheol is a sweetheart.

154
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:11,228
Unlike his mother.

155
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,467
Due to personal reasons,

156
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,598
I have not been able to keep an eye on the boy.

157
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:21,337
The mistress must be causing a lot of heartaches.

158
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:28,978
It has been two years...

159
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,317
since the concubine moved in and acted like the lady of the house.

160
00:12:33,077 --> 00:12:36,648
The fear of people gossiping had me suffering in agony.

161
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,417
You are right.

162
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:42,587
I have let a gisaeng mistress stroll around the house,

163
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:45,797
which I am truly ashamed of.

164
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:52,167
Can you now perform the acupuncture?

165
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:55,937
Yes, madam. I will be of service today.

166
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:36,848
Do you sense that?

167
00:13:40,348 --> 00:13:42,417
You should feel it sucking you in.

168
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:47,888
Right.

169
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:35,108
Jun Young, you are next.

170
00:14:39,408 --> 00:14:41,278
What have I always told you?

171
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:45,978
Once I am summoned by the Second State Councillor,

172
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:47,388
I will immediately...

173
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:50,248
become an official of high rank.

174
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:53,217
An opportunity is still out there for me.

175
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:54,927
However, my eldest son...

176
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,398
thinks he can be a slack!

177
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:11,037
It was wrong of me. I apologize, Father.

178
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:12,508
Please have mercy on me.

179
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:14,848
How is it...

180
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:19,417
that you are not even as smart as your illegitimate half-brother?

181
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,148
Stand up.

182
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:25,518
On your feet!

183
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,008
She must not have been able to sleep these past few days,

184
00:15:41,368 --> 00:15:43,268
judging by how she instantly fell asleep.

185
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,536
It is all due to her energy being able to flow again...

186
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:47,278
thanks to your acupuncture treatment.

187
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:49,377
Who are you people...

188
00:15:49,378 --> 00:15:50,917
and why are you trespassing on my property?

189
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:08,467
We are physicians from Gyesoo Clinic who were here to see the madam.

190
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,467
I see.

191
00:16:10,998 --> 00:16:12,966
I heard that a widow let her hair down again...

192
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,408
and became a female physician.

193
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,537
That must be you.

194
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,306
Forgive me, my lord.

195
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:20,978
We were only concerned about her health.

196
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,677
Physicians are only meant to see sick patients.

197
00:16:24,478 --> 00:16:26,477
My wife is not ill.

198
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:28,546
It just so happens to be a period...

199
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:30,087
where her luck has been drained.

200
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:32,956
Illnesses must be treated with proper treatment...

201
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:34,556
Of course, my lord.

202
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:36,557
We were only here as companions she could talk to.

203
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:39,557
Nothing lifted her spirit which is why we were heading out.

204
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,147
Lady Eun Woo, I know Lord Cho is a respected man, but...

205
00:16:58,148 --> 00:16:59,778
- Keep it down! - What?

206
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:09,927
We should check on the children.

207
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:20,667
You are a disgrace!

208
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:23,507
Arrogant brat.

209
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,838
You are worth nothing.

210
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:28,378
Just get lost!

211
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:30,818
Hwi Young, Jun Young.

212
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,277
Let me see.

213
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,348
My poor boys. Are you all right?

214
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,858
Goodness me.

215
00:17:48,927 --> 00:17:51,767
Do not cry, my boys.

216
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:53,138
It is all right.

217
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:55,308
It will be all right.

218
00:18:01,878 --> 00:18:03,577
Lord Cho's right index finger.

219
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:06,017
There is a wound you get from using a whip often.

220
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:07,848
He must have regularly whipped the boys.

221
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:10,288
Hallucinating and speaking incoherently...

222
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:12,717
are symptoms of dehydration.

223
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:16,158
- Dehydration? - Yes.

224
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:22,798
But no one suffers from heat strokes around this time of year.

225
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:25,098
How could he be dehydrated?

226
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:28,338
When I checked his pulse, I could not sense any trouble...

227
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,408
in his stomach or other organs.

228
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:32,108
Then...

229
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:34,947
That means he does not have an illness.

230
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,648
He could be in even bigger trouble.

231
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:43,417
How can we help him?

232
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:47,388
We cannot treat him properly until he is out of that house.

233
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:05,507
Where does Father disappear so many times during the day?

234
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:07,007
He is gone yet again.

235
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:09,308
Jang Gun, have you seen him?

236
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:13,118
Is that true?

237
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:16,548
That is all you need from me?

238
00:19:19,217 --> 00:19:20,987
I ardently request it.

239
00:19:22,957 --> 00:19:24,827
Gye Ji Han, the legendary physician...

240
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:27,297
of the Medical Office came all the way to Hanyang...

241
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:28,997
just to make that request.

242
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:31,838
You have gotten old, my friend.

243
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:37,878
I am truly ashamed of not staying in touch.

244
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,347
I understand since your close friend Yoo Hoo Myung...

245
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,078
met an untimely death.

246
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,177
I am the only one you can turn to now.

247
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:49,687
What do you mean Yoo Hoo Myung passed away?

248
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:51,917
Did you not know?

249
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:54,388
Right after the former King passed.

250
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,026
Commissioner Yoo Hoo Myung...

251
00:19:59,027 --> 00:20:00,756
was found dead after falling from a horse...

252
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:02,068
which had people gossiping.

253
00:20:02,898 --> 00:20:03,997
Did you really not know?

254
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:06,398
His son Yoo Se Yeob was the one...

255
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:09,107
who performed acupuncture on the late King...

256
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,578
which is why the family was completely ruined.

257
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:14,477
That must be why you did not receive the obituary.

258
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:18,177
My goodness. How can you have not known?

259
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,277
Anyway, let us drink.

260
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:55,388
Physician Gye!

261
00:20:55,818 --> 00:20:56,818
Are you in?

262
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:59,687
Will you please come out? Physician Gye!

263
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:03,328
Physician Gye!

264
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:05,058
Hello.

265
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:07,128
What is it?

266
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:11,437
The young master.

267
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:13,697
Master Seok Cheol.

268
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:16,707
I think he is dead.

269
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:21,308
What are you saying?

270
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:22,848
Speak plainly.

271
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:24,817
The child died?

272
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:26,547
When? How? Why?

273
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:27,548
He said...

274
00:21:27,947 --> 00:21:29,247
he heard ghosts...

275
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:31,358
and stopped breathing.

276
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:37,527
Get your needles.

277
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:39,857
Jang Gun, get the books on pediatrics.

278
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:40,926
Okay.

279
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:41,927
Where is Physician Gye?

280
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:44,196
He is not yet back from Hanyang.

281
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:45,466
His room is still dark.

282
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:46,538
I will inform him when he returns.

283
00:21:47,237 --> 00:21:49,637
We must go and check on the child.

284
00:21:49,638 --> 00:21:50,638
Okay.

285
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:05,532
The madam had these monstrous things buried around my chambers...

286
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:08,401
and cursed the child.

287
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:12,201
Seok Cheol is sick because he is possessed!

288
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:17,241
Please protect this child at least, my lord.

289
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:26,151
You failed to act with class that befits a lord's wife.

290
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:29,292
Why did you resort to such sorcery?

291
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:32,122
Not only were you jealous, but you cursed others too?

292
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:34,931
- Why... - I know nothing of this.

293
00:22:36,261 --> 00:22:37,261
Fine.

294
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:39,201
Until she confesses,

295
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:41,431
lock her up!

296
00:22:42,102 --> 00:22:43,102
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

297
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:50,511
Are you falling for her tricks because you are a fool,

298
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:53,711
or are you pretending because you are cunning? I do not know.

299
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:56,411
But I have nothing to do with this.

300
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:58,352
If you mistreat me like this,

301
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:00,582
you will come to regret it!

302
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:02,651
Do not just stand there!

303
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:06,261
- Mother! - Mother!

304
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:10,062
Are you all right?

305
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:26,582
Come this way.

306
00:23:36,892 --> 00:23:39,760
Did he have to go somewhere on such an important day?

307
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:42,292
He has been going out often at night.

308
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:44,031
Where are you headed this late?

309
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:45,362
What took you so long to...

310
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:48,802
Just come with us. It is seriously important.

311
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:50,132
We will talk on the way.

312
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:51,900
Seok Cheol is dead!

313
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:53,441
Because you did nothing.

314
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:56,441
Physician Yoo will revive him.

315
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:59,180
What is he talking about?

316
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:00,881
Let us get going first.

317
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:03,112
Run. We will find out when we get there.

318
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:04,352
What on earth...

319
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:09,691
Seok Cheol.

320
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:11,261
Seok Cheol!

321
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:14,161
Seok Cheol. Wake up.

322
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:15,491
Seok Cheol.

323
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,072
I think we are too late.

324
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:42,122
Good. Get your needles.

325
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:44,121
Baekhae, Injung, Habgok.

326
00:24:44,122 --> 00:24:45,861
Then Geumjin, Ogek.

327
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:47,592
He is dead already.

328
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:49,832
No. It is not too late yet.

329
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:52,001
I felt a faint pulse.

330
00:24:52,562 --> 00:24:53,632
If we do it just right,

331
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,072
we can save him.

332
00:25:01,142 --> 00:25:02,342
What must I do?

333
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:04,511
Put the first needle in Baekhae.

334
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:18,592
Move slightly closer to the face.

335
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:31,201
This is the spot. Feel it again.

336
00:26:12,282 --> 00:26:15,181
Well done. The next points are Geumjin, Ogek.

337
00:26:16,552 --> 00:26:18,382
They are inside the mouth.

338
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:20,881
And this requires letting out blood.

339
00:26:20,882 --> 00:26:22,122
I cannot do it.

340
00:26:22,522 --> 00:26:23,822
You must do it.

341
00:26:58,892 --> 00:26:59,892
One,

342
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:01,491
two,

343
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:02,931
three.

344
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:15,941
Mom.

345
00:27:17,072 --> 00:27:18,072
Seok Cheol.

346
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:21,511
You are alive.

347
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:23,181
Well done.

348
00:27:24,612 --> 00:27:25,622
Water.

349
00:27:32,022 --> 00:27:34,160
Will you get inside already?

350
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:36,032
He is so bossy.

351
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,802
Which way is it?

352
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:46,642
Here.

353
00:27:48,312 --> 00:27:49,411
I will not tell.

354
00:27:50,642 --> 00:27:52,842
I will not tell anyone.

355
00:27:57,282 --> 00:27:59,751
So please let me live.

356
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:04,991
Jang Gun.

357
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:08,661
Here.

358
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:16,372
Oh, dear.

359
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:19,602
Water.

360
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:24,542
Water.

361
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,011
Get out of here.

362
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:30,211
Take them all outside!

363
00:28:31,151 --> 00:28:34,250
- We are not leaving. - My goodness!

364
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:35,750
- Why... - Keep walking.

365
00:28:35,751 --> 00:28:37,851
- Will you hear me out? - No!

366
00:28:37,852 --> 00:28:39,221
Stop complaining!

367
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:40,421
Stop it.

368
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:41,591
We are walking.

369
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:44,391
- Go on. - Leave us alone!

370
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:46,301
- You people... - Oh...

371
00:28:46,302 --> 00:28:47,302
How dare you...

372
00:28:48,032 --> 00:28:51,332
enter my home without permission and cause a ruckus?

373
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:56,911
My lord. We saved a dead child.

374
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:04,951
Bad things have been happening.

375
00:29:05,552 --> 00:29:06,782
Leave for now.

376
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:13,661
Leave!

377
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:15,531
Drag them out of here!

378
00:29:15,532 --> 00:29:16,532
- Okay. - Yes, sir.

379
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:17,761
- No. - Wait!

380
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:31,511
Goodness.

381
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:33,882
What do you think you are doing?

382
00:29:36,251 --> 00:29:37,711
Why use talismans...

383
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:41,751
when you care not for the water that is quenching your energy?

384
00:29:42,151 --> 00:29:44,622
That is why there is never a peaceful day in your family.

385
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:53,032
"Water that is quenching my energy?"

386
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:57,201
Where is that "water?"

387
00:29:58,941 --> 00:30:01,812
Seok Cheol has been complaining of thirst as of late.

388
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:04,011
That is because of the water energy.

389
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:09,211
Do you mean...

390
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:13,082
I predominantly embody the fire element?

391
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:14,250
Correct.

392
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:16,721
What do you think, Physician Gye? You agree, right?

393
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:19,862
Yes.

394
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:22,990
You are upright,

395
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:26,031
so you do not hesitate to point out others' mistakes.

396
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,101
You are righteous and cannot tolerate injustice,

397
00:30:28,102 --> 00:30:30,970
which is why you whip even your own son...

398
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:33,241
and reprimand him without a moment's hesitation.

399
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:36,171
That is what the fire element does to you.

400
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:45,021
How dare you!

401
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:47,751
Your pulse tells me that it is quite serious.

402
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:51,251
You are bound to have a stroke if you leave it untreated.

403
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:52,761
What? What did you say?

404
00:30:53,221 --> 00:30:55,091
Your face is red,

405
00:30:55,092 --> 00:30:59,000
and I see the accumulation of fat on the back of your neck.

406
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:00,901
You will have a stroke.

407
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:06,501
A stroke?

408
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:10,642
Then what should I do?

409
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:13,611
This old physician here will take care of you.

410
00:31:13,612 --> 00:31:15,510
He will tell you exactly what kind of medicine to take.

411
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:17,210
I will take Seok Cheol and treat him...

412
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:18,921
for he is brimming with the water energy.

413
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:22,421
Okay, do that.

414
00:31:22,892 --> 00:31:24,221
You stay.

415
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:27,562
And you, take Seok Cheol and leave at once.

416
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,832
Please pour your heart and soul into treating Lord Cho.

417
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:35,872
Sure, I will.

418
00:31:43,312 --> 00:31:45,312
You have too much heat in your body.

419
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:47,812
Yes, I do!

420
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,711
There.

421
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:53,521
Physician Yoo, that was pretty good.

422
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:56,352
I know. I almost asked him to feel my pulse too.

423
00:31:56,991 --> 00:31:59,591
It was gratifying to see you tell him that he would have a stroke.

424
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:01,862
- It served him right. - Yes.

425
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:03,792
It is true.

426
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:06,561
His pulse told me...

427
00:32:06,562 --> 00:32:08,601
that he had too much heat and fire energy going upward,

428
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:10,931
which was taking a toll on his heart and organs.

429
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:14,401
If left untreated, a brain attack is bound to occur soon,

430
00:32:14,572 --> 00:32:16,671
which is also called a stroke.

431
00:32:17,842 --> 00:32:20,440
You can predict such things when you feel someone's pulse?

432
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:22,352
Oh, my. That is fascinating.

433
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:24,882
You correctly predicted it would rain on the third day of March.

434
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:28,892
I can correctly guess what you had for dinner yesterday.

435
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:31,862
Let me feel your pulse if you have nothing to hide.

436
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,490
You can even tell such things?

437
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:36,792
Yes, he sure can.

438
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:40,332
Jang Gun, did you have crunchy rice?

439
00:32:45,241 --> 00:32:47,700
I had yumilgwa by myself.

440
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:49,542
(Korean dessert made by deep-frying a mixture of flour and honey)

441
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,032
(We shall protect our poor Seok Cheol.)

442
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:17,201
(We shall protect our poor Seok Cheol.)

443
00:33:17,431 --> 00:33:20,501
(Salt)

444
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:22,911
(Seok Cheol)

445
00:33:23,312 --> 00:33:24,611
Salt?

446
00:33:26,642 --> 00:33:29,812
Someone fed him salt to make him look possessed.

447
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:31,821
That is so horrible.

448
00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:35,051
Right. Those who drank seawater when they ran out...

449
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:37,351
of drinking water while crossing the ocean in a boat...

450
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:39,791
started talking nonsense as if they were possessed...

451
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:40,921
and had fainting spells.

452
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:43,160
Correct. You could make someone look insane.

453
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:44,631
It is absolutely evil.

454
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:47,860
We must find out who did this and make them pay for it.

455
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,131
He is just a kid.

456
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:51,902
How could someone do such a thing?

457
00:33:54,172 --> 00:33:56,470
We just have to find out who fed him salt, right?

458
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:59,341
It will not be easy. Everyone in that household looks suspicious.

459
00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:02,451
Come to think of it,

460
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:04,212
no one in that family is normal.

461
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:06,951
Anyone could have done it,

462
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:09,351
and everyone is at least partially responsible.

463
00:34:09,352 --> 00:34:11,922
Even so, I am certain that it was not Madam Jeodonggung.

464
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:13,391
No way.

465
00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:16,731
I agree. When she first brought Seok Cheol to the clinic,

466
00:34:16,732 --> 00:34:18,700
it seemed like she was truly concerned.

467
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:22,172
Physician Gye. Quickly. Please examine this boy.

468
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:26,341
However, she had been neglecting Seok Cheol.

469
00:34:28,002 --> 00:34:29,171
Do not cry.

470
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:32,681
What if she tried to hurt Seok Cheol...

471
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:35,212
because she felt cornered and threatened by the mistress?

472
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:37,852
It is plausible, is it not?

473
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:41,522
Come on. Even so, how could she try to kill a child?

474
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:43,422
You went a little too far with that one.

475
00:34:43,692 --> 00:34:45,462
Raise your hand if you believe that she did not do it.

476
00:34:56,131 --> 00:34:57,902
Physician Yoo is right.

477
00:34:58,201 --> 00:34:59,902
How do we know for sure that it was not her?

478
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:02,241
You never know what someone is truly thinking.

479
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:05,780
And since salt is expensive, she must manage the key...

480
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:07,442
to the storage.

481
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:12,852
The lady at the fish store told me the other day...

482
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:16,292
that she suddenly became stingy about two years ago.

483
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:21,061
Right. She stopped donating rice to help the needy.

484
00:35:21,062 --> 00:35:22,161
- Right. - Yes.

485
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:23,892
Ip Bun, you are the stingy one!

486
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,872
You took the key to the storage, saying you would give out the rice.

487
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:31,131
You mean wench!

488
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:34,240
We should only give it out to the needy, not to anyone and everyone!

489
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:36,341
- You little... - Let go!

490
00:35:37,212 --> 00:35:38,240
My gosh.

491
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:40,010
(We shall protect our poor Seok Cheol.)

492
00:35:40,011 --> 00:35:42,212
Just go to bed.

493
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:45,212
What are you doing? This is a waste of time.

494
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:48,021
You. I told you not to meddle...

495
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:50,252
in that family's business, did I not?

496
00:35:50,591 --> 00:35:54,061
An incident like this must be reported to the magistrate's office.

497
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:55,831
Report it and take your hands off it.

498
00:35:55,832 --> 00:35:57,731
I will report it.

499
00:35:57,732 --> 00:36:00,661
But you promised to help me.

500
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:03,331
I saved him. What more must I do?

501
00:36:03,332 --> 00:36:04,970
Messing with Madam Jeodonggung...

502
00:36:04,971 --> 00:36:07,341
is like messing with the royal family.

503
00:36:07,872 --> 00:36:09,240
You, dunce. This is not good.

504
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:12,641
You cannot idle around or make house calls anymore.

505
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:13,841
It is not allowed!

506
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:18,411
Seok Cheol is not well! You are mean!

507
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:21,621
Yes. I knew about your foul mouth,

508
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:23,151
but you are rotten to the core.

509
00:36:23,152 --> 00:36:25,521
Exactly. You are always so mean.

510
00:36:25,522 --> 00:36:27,820
That is the only consistent thing about you.

511
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:30,062
How could a physician show no compassion for others?

512
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:32,232
- Exactly. - You scoundrel.

513
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:34,131
Why will you not help such an adorable child?

514
00:36:37,971 --> 00:36:40,772
Do not jump on it recklessly.

515
00:36:41,642 --> 00:36:43,712
Bring me a fail-proof plan.

516
00:36:44,442 --> 00:36:45,812
Otherwise, just forget about it.

517
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:47,781
(We shall protect our poor Seok Cheol.)

518
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:25,005
Have your fingers been stiff lately?

519
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,164
Oh, boy.

520
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:52,866
This is harder than I thought.

521
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:57,306
- How dare you. Put it back. - Okay.

522
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:03,846
It takes a lot of work to make even just one.

523
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:06,676
I will give you an ugly one later. You can take that.

524
00:38:06,775 --> 00:38:09,915
Why an ugly one? Give me a pretty one.

525
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:12,085
The pretty ones are for the patients.

526
00:38:13,656 --> 00:38:14,755
Oh.

527
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:17,525
This is Jang Gun's poop.

528
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:20,255
No, I did not poop!

529
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:24,795
Seok Cheol...

530
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:27,236
Is he okay now?

531
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,505
Of course.

532
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,406
If we send him home, he will fall ill again.

533
00:38:39,446 --> 00:38:41,775
Can he not stay here with us?

534
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:44,946
I was sick too.

535
00:38:46,056 --> 00:38:49,625
But Physician Gye allowed me to stay at the clinic.

536
00:38:50,556 --> 00:38:51,886
Really?

537
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:53,696
That he did.

538
00:38:54,855 --> 00:38:55,866
On the 3rd day of the 3rd lunar month.

539
00:38:57,096 --> 00:38:58,125
I see you are back.

540
00:38:58,426 --> 00:39:00,765
The sky was clear, so he left to build a herb shed.

541
00:39:00,766 --> 00:39:02,266
He left with a large sum of money...

542
00:39:02,536 --> 00:39:04,735
but came home with a young boy on his back.

543
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:05,736
Is he a patient?

544
00:39:05,906 --> 00:39:07,775
Even though money was everything to him.

545
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,145
Lady Namhae, please get him some water.

546
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:15,616
Here.

547
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:41,576
Physician Gye.

548
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,505
Where is the boy?

549
00:39:44,045 --> 00:39:46,246
Inside. Please help him.

550
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:01,496
Who is it?

551
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:05,325
You cannot take my boy without paying a price!

552
00:40:05,326 --> 00:40:06,535
Please leave with him.

553
00:40:06,536 --> 00:40:08,335
Why you...

554
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:14,136
You will accept the money and sever all ties with this boy.

555
00:40:14,906 --> 00:40:17,775
A father who cares more about money than his sick son?

556
00:40:18,406 --> 00:40:19,576
He is better off without one.

557
00:40:23,185 --> 00:40:24,684
Darn it.

558
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:26,815
These new prescriptions are a pain in my butt!

559
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:30,556
You cold-hearted man.

560
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:33,295
What now?

561
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:36,065
You are loving enough to care for Jang Gun,

562
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:38,295
so why will you not let us help Seok Cheol?

563
00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:41,765
How can you help when you do not have a plan?

564
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:42,766
That is pure idiocy.

565
00:40:48,935 --> 00:40:51,076
Please have this gongjindang.

566
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:55,786
I, Jang Gun,

567
00:40:57,545 --> 00:41:00,355
love you, Physician Gye.

568
00:41:01,656 --> 00:41:03,926
Just like me, I know you will...

569
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:06,255
save Seok Cheol too.

570
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:08,926
You brat.

571
00:41:10,295 --> 00:41:12,196
I see that this is a bribe.

572
00:41:25,176 --> 00:41:27,415
Lady Eun Woo and I stayed up mastering a plan.

573
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:28,746
Maybe you should hear it.

574
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:32,815
I will only hear you out.

575
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:35,556
If it harms the clinic in any way,

576
00:41:35,855 --> 00:41:38,556
I will snap your legs and make you stay indefinitely.

577
00:41:40,395 --> 00:41:41,395
Now, go ahead.

578
00:41:43,826 --> 00:41:46,334
These are much better than the ones we had before.

579
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:47,794
I urge you to keep them coming.

580
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:50,866
I owe it all to Lady Namhae.

581
00:41:51,435 --> 00:41:54,235
She guessed the weather, read my fortune,

582
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:56,044
and helped me decide on a grave site.

583
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:57,275
She knows everything and anything.

584
00:41:57,705 --> 00:42:00,615
The cook at Gyesoo Clinic, right?

585
00:42:00,616 --> 00:42:03,215
That is her. Lady Namhae.

586
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:05,414
No one can be that gifted though.

587
00:42:05,415 --> 00:42:08,215
I am telling you that she is, and her name is Lady Namhae.

588
00:42:08,216 --> 00:42:10,685
Lady Namhae!

589
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:11,855
"Jaseungjabak."

590
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:15,625
Falling into one's own trap.

591
00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:18,965
So tell me.

592
00:42:18,966 --> 00:42:19,995
Do you see me being summoned...

593
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,895
by the Second State Councillor any time soon?

594
00:42:22,536 --> 00:42:23,536
Of course.

595
00:42:23,935 --> 00:42:27,375
Wear a jade accessory on an auspicious day...

596
00:42:27,676 --> 00:42:28,676
and...

597
00:42:31,846 --> 00:42:33,315
you will be called into the office.

598
00:42:34,645 --> 00:42:35,645
The energy...

599
00:42:38,645 --> 00:42:39,656
Yes?

600
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:42,755
I can sense you becoming a high-ranking official.

601
00:42:43,286 --> 00:42:44,286
That is it!

602
00:42:47,295 --> 00:42:49,895
However, I also sense a blockage around you.

603
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:53,435
Can you detect what that is?

604
00:43:02,036 --> 00:43:03,045
Here you go.

605
00:43:03,645 --> 00:43:05,846
This is where you come in, Physician Gye.

606
00:43:06,645 --> 00:43:08,474
The boy is back in good health...

607
00:43:08,475 --> 00:43:09,846
and has been taken to his room.

608
00:43:11,346 --> 00:43:14,385
Please make sure you put the emphasis on "tonight."

609
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:16,124
Tonight!

610
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:19,084
He must make it through the night to make a full recovery.

611
00:43:19,085 --> 00:43:20,894
Inform Lord Cho...

612
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:22,894
that I will not have to return to check on him.

613
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:25,025
Of course. Thank you, Physician Gye.

614
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,395
Tonight!

615
00:43:29,536 --> 00:43:30,605
Right.

616
00:43:43,216 --> 00:43:44,216
Tonight,

617
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:48,116
I will pray to the spirits by serving them freshly drawn water.

618
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:50,056
Please make sure...

619
00:43:50,426 --> 00:43:53,295
that no one wanders around the house today.

620
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:09,974
- Mother. - Mother.

621
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:13,644
Boys, why are you here?

622
00:44:13,645 --> 00:44:14,645
Let us help you out of here.

623
00:44:15,076 --> 00:44:16,385
Do what you need to do.

624
00:44:16,386 --> 00:44:18,516
Sure. Let us leave.

625
00:44:22,386 --> 00:44:26,525
Lord Cho, you must wait at the designated location.

626
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:20,576
My boy.

627
00:46:21,306 --> 00:46:22,306
Wake up.

628
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:26,875
Eat your porridge.

629
00:46:29,685 --> 00:46:31,415
Get up and eat your porridge.

630
00:46:37,525 --> 00:46:38,525
Wake up.

631
00:46:40,295 --> 00:46:41,525
Get up!

632
00:46:53,835 --> 00:46:55,505
You wicked wench.

633
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:58,705
How could you have harmed your own son?

634
00:46:59,205 --> 00:47:00,216
How?

635
00:47:11,355 --> 00:47:12,685
Why did you do this?

636
00:47:13,955 --> 00:47:16,295
You were a beautiful and innocent flower.

637
00:47:17,366 --> 00:47:18,466
So why?

638
00:47:25,165 --> 00:47:27,136
I wanted to raise my head up high.

639
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:29,236
What?

640
00:47:29,237 --> 00:47:33,016
Did you not tell me that I could move into the master bedroom?

641
00:47:44,955 --> 00:47:47,596
When... When did I ever say that?

642
00:47:52,935 --> 00:47:54,236
Why?

643
00:47:57,605 --> 00:47:59,435
Just why?

644
00:48:01,736 --> 00:48:04,475
Why did she repeatedly have her son eat salt every night?

645
00:48:13,815 --> 00:48:15,516
She wanted him to project an illness...

646
00:48:16,585 --> 00:48:17,886
so that she could...

647
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:22,625
earn sympathy and attention as a caring mother.

648
00:48:26,266 --> 00:48:28,394
By doing so, she also framed your legitimate wife...

649
00:48:28,395 --> 00:48:29,906
in order to take her place.

650
00:48:31,906 --> 00:48:34,536
Her wicked plan served a dual purpose.

651
00:48:42,116 --> 00:48:43,386
You fool!

652
00:49:10,775 --> 00:49:11,806
Oh, no.

653
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,016
You interfered and ruined my plan!

654
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:18,045
You will die for this!

655
00:49:22,616 --> 00:49:23,725
Eun Woo.

656
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:29,255
Eun Woo.

657
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,136
You must not move.

658
00:49:45,205 --> 00:49:46,915
I think it is dented.

659
00:49:48,446 --> 00:49:49,576
I am sorry.

660
00:50:00,395 --> 00:50:01,596
I am so relieved.

661
00:50:02,926 --> 00:50:04,096
What a relief this is.

662
00:50:16,005 --> 00:50:17,105
Goodness...

663
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:24,116
I am fine.

664
00:50:24,545 --> 00:50:26,486
Whether the kid lived or died,

665
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,056
you did not care, so why the huge fuss?

666
00:50:31,426 --> 00:50:34,895
Beating him to his death or this!

667
00:50:35,355 --> 00:50:37,065
What is the difference?

668
00:50:37,426 --> 00:50:38,466
Take...

669
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:42,036
Take this wretch out of here!

670
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:43,266
Yes, my lord.

671
00:50:44,605 --> 00:50:45,736
Let go of me!

672
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:47,576
Let me go!

673
00:50:48,236 --> 00:50:49,435
Release me!

674
00:50:50,275 --> 00:50:52,005
Do you know who I am?

675
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,045
Let me go!

676
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:56,315
My goodness.

677
00:50:56,746 --> 00:50:58,386
My lady.

678
00:51:03,556 --> 00:51:05,125
Send everyone else away.

679
00:51:08,225 --> 00:51:10,696
I will give you the real solution.

680
00:51:12,426 --> 00:51:13,435
Yes.

681
00:51:14,266 --> 00:51:17,036
Yes. I forgot about you.

682
00:51:17,335 --> 00:51:19,975
The final touch.

683
00:51:21,236 --> 00:51:24,346
You must get Seok Cheol away from him for good.

684
00:51:25,005 --> 00:51:28,045
I found the energy that is preventing your return to glory.

685
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:30,644
What is it?

686
00:51:30,645 --> 00:51:31,746
Men.

687
00:51:32,085 --> 00:51:33,954
There are too many in this house.

688
00:51:33,955 --> 00:51:36,685
There is no room for yang to enter from the north.

689
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,696
(Male)

690
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:48,835
The power of the sun.

691
00:51:49,966 --> 00:51:51,205
What could that be?

692
00:51:52,036 --> 00:51:54,204
It is the character for sunshine.

693
00:51:54,205 --> 00:51:56,406
(Sunshine)

694
00:51:56,806 --> 00:51:59,005
- This means... - Hanyang.

695
00:51:59,406 --> 00:52:01,045
(Hanyang)

696
00:52:02,616 --> 00:52:05,216
Send the boy away to a place with good energy.

697
00:52:08,616 --> 00:52:10,326
I feel the energy within this home.

698
00:52:10,685 --> 00:52:11,786
Death.

699
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:13,895
Intent to kill.

700
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,056
Will someone die?

701
00:52:18,665 --> 00:52:21,996
Something is preventing the positive energy from flowing.

702
00:52:22,366 --> 00:52:24,504
That something is your actions.

703
00:52:24,505 --> 00:52:27,105
That is what is creating the deadly energy within.

704
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:31,275
With your own hands, you are reducing your chances.

705
00:52:32,045 --> 00:52:35,645
I will not do that from now on.

706
00:52:38,886 --> 00:52:42,815
I had a rotten time feeding Lord Cho such nonsense.

707
00:52:43,855 --> 00:52:45,156
With your help,

708
00:52:45,326 --> 00:52:47,725
we were able to get Seok Cheol out.

709
00:52:50,665 --> 00:52:53,696
Some credit should go to Lady Seo who risked her life for someone.

710
00:52:57,205 --> 00:52:58,266
Do not...

711
00:53:00,205 --> 00:53:01,475
do that again.

712
00:53:08,216 --> 00:53:12,085
You saved my life three times.

713
00:53:12,145 --> 00:53:14,056
I did not risk my own to do so.

714
00:53:19,185 --> 00:53:20,326
Ip Bun.

715
00:53:20,926 --> 00:53:23,894
Physician Gye. Shall we leave them alone?

716
00:53:23,895 --> 00:53:25,196
- No. - No!

717
00:53:31,466 --> 00:53:33,005
Physician Yoo.

718
00:53:33,906 --> 00:53:35,875
How did you know the mistress was guilty?

719
00:53:37,105 --> 00:53:39,176
Can you tell that from the pulse?

720
00:53:41,216 --> 00:53:42,975
You are the one who told me.

721
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:45,946
I did?

722
00:53:46,886 --> 00:53:49,886
They got stingy starting two years ago.

723
00:53:50,826 --> 00:53:53,595
They stopped handing out grain to the poor too.

724
00:53:53,596 --> 00:53:54,625
Yes.

725
00:53:55,056 --> 00:53:56,665
It has been two years...

726
00:53:57,596 --> 00:54:00,164
since the concubine moved in and acted like the lady of the house.

727
00:54:00,165 --> 00:54:02,766
You took the storage key to give out the grain.

728
00:54:02,895 --> 00:54:05,306
You evil wench.

729
00:54:05,406 --> 00:54:08,906
I thought maybe Madam Jeodonggung no longer had the storage key...

730
00:54:09,105 --> 00:54:10,605
and I was right.

731
00:54:11,275 --> 00:54:13,775
She had kept it a secret...

732
00:54:14,016 --> 00:54:16,246
because she was ashamed to let others know.

733
00:54:19,346 --> 00:54:21,255
I thought you got that from her pulse.

734
00:54:22,486 --> 00:54:25,325
Wait. You did get it from her pulse.

735
00:54:25,326 --> 00:54:26,625
Because that is when...

736
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:29,596
patients bare their hearts.

737
00:54:31,266 --> 00:54:34,036
If you think about it, that is your specialty.

738
00:54:34,835 --> 00:54:36,065
See?

739
00:54:36,466 --> 00:54:39,465
I said you should use your pretty face...

740
00:54:39,466 --> 00:54:41,036
to practice medicine.

741
00:54:41,205 --> 00:54:42,435
Was I not right?

742
00:54:44,705 --> 00:54:47,775
What will happen to Seok Cheol now?

743
00:54:49,576 --> 00:54:50,946
I wonder too.

744
00:54:55,216 --> 00:54:58,225
A physician I know well who lives in Hanyang...

745
00:54:58,455 --> 00:54:59,926
will teach him medicine.

746
00:55:01,795 --> 00:55:05,725
You are so nosy and interfering and no good at making any money.

747
00:55:10,165 --> 00:55:12,005
When I grow up,

748
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:16,105
I want to become a physician who heals the sick.

749
00:55:17,176 --> 00:55:18,676
Can I do that?

750
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:21,915
Yes, you can.

751
00:55:29,056 --> 00:55:30,656
Oh, dear...

752
00:55:34,295 --> 00:55:35,426
Good.

753
00:55:36,255 --> 00:55:39,596
Seok Cheol has the face of a boy blessed with good fortune.

754
00:55:53,205 --> 00:55:55,315
Oh, hello.

755
00:55:55,616 --> 00:56:00,116
Is there anything new that will make me some money?

756
00:56:00,755 --> 00:56:04,185
If it is something you want, I will make it if it does not exist.

757
00:56:05,025 --> 00:56:06,525
You must have something, then.

758
00:56:17,766 --> 00:56:20,775
- This is... - Yes. It is that thing.

759
00:56:21,076 --> 00:56:24,576
The flower that makes money that you mentioned before.

760
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:26,005
The money flower.

761
00:56:27,815 --> 00:56:31,946
I have been short on finances lately.

762
00:56:32,346 --> 00:56:35,855
Do you own land in Sorak Village?

763
00:56:36,755 --> 00:56:40,056
This grows famously well in that area.

764
00:56:40,525 --> 00:56:43,196
There is not enough space to grow this on a large scale.

765
00:56:43,395 --> 00:56:46,565
If you had land, money would not be a problem.

766
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:51,935
Are you in?

767
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:54,475
Be quiet.

768
00:56:58,176 --> 00:57:00,644
Royal Inspector Cho.

769
00:57:00,645 --> 00:57:02,475
What brings you to this shabby place?

770
00:57:02,846 --> 00:57:03,946
Cho Sin Woo?

771
00:57:04,685 --> 00:57:06,516
I heard your pharmacy is the oldest.

772
00:57:07,516 --> 00:57:09,185
That is the truth.

773
00:57:09,815 --> 00:57:12,255
Is there a medicinal herb that will change the colour of metal?

774
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:17,165
That would depend on the kind of metal.

775
00:57:26,935 --> 00:57:28,906
It looks like an acupuncture needle physicians use.

776
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,185
I do not know about this.

777
00:57:42,556 --> 00:57:44,125
I wish you a safe return home.

778
00:57:46,556 --> 00:57:47,996
Why is he asking about that?

779
00:57:53,665 --> 00:57:56,136
Your litter is ready. Please get inside.

780
00:57:57,036 --> 00:57:59,005
My lady!

781
00:57:59,105 --> 00:58:01,475
My lady.

782
00:58:01,736 --> 00:58:06,375
My lady. Where are you going, leaving me alone at home?

783
00:58:06,576 --> 00:58:09,616
The Second State Councillor will soon send good news.

784
00:58:09,746 --> 00:58:11,516
You can join me then.

785
00:58:12,746 --> 00:58:15,955
I am all dressed. Can I not come with you now?

786
00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:19,556
You cannot.

787
00:58:20,525 --> 00:58:23,894
Her Highness the Princess... Your mother, my mother-in-law.

788
00:58:23,895 --> 00:58:27,535
I heard she gave you a nice patch of land as an inheritance.

789
00:58:27,536 --> 00:58:30,035
She did, and with what I gain from it,

790
00:58:30,036 --> 00:58:32,004
I will send my sons to a good school...

791
00:58:32,005 --> 00:58:34,475
and raise them well, so do not worry.

792
00:58:35,835 --> 00:58:37,374
I hope you get a title...

793
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:40,005
and move to Hanyang soon.

794
00:58:42,746 --> 00:58:43,746
Let us go.

795
00:58:47,556 --> 00:58:48,556
No.

796
00:58:49,585 --> 00:58:50,855
This is not good.

797
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:59,024
Hey! You think you can do whatever you want...

798
00:58:59,025 --> 00:59:00,065
because your mother is a princess?

799
00:59:00,966 --> 00:59:02,136
Darn it.

800
00:59:02,935 --> 00:59:06,266
Fine, leave! I will not even bat an eye...

801
00:59:07,576 --> 00:59:08,576
Oh, no.

802
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:14,975
You are bound to have a stroke if you leave it untreated.

803
00:59:22,915 --> 00:59:24,886
You did not even let me try it.

804
00:59:30,295 --> 00:59:32,625
What has gotten into you? You are giving me some?

805
00:59:33,025 --> 00:59:34,036
Yes.

806
00:59:40,705 --> 00:59:41,875
Does it make you that happy?

807
00:59:43,806 --> 00:59:45,306
You seem truly obliged.

808
00:59:47,475 --> 00:59:48,475
You are giving me more?

809
00:59:50,946 --> 00:59:51,946
Oh, my.

810
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:14,875
I am sorry.

811
01:00:17,205 --> 01:00:19,605
You saved me. Why are you sorry?

812
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:23,076
It was the adults' responsibility...

813
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:25,685
to protect and cherish you.

814
01:00:27,755 --> 01:00:28,815
They should have saved you...

815
01:00:29,486 --> 01:00:31,025
and made sure that you were not hurting.

816
01:00:35,426 --> 01:00:37,996
If you do not wish to go to Hanyang,

817
01:00:38,466 --> 01:00:39,826
you must tell me.

818
01:00:40,966 --> 01:00:43,766
No, I wish to become like you.

819
01:00:44,636 --> 01:00:46,934
I will go to Hanyang and study hard...

820
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,236
to ace the medical licensing exam.

821
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:55,016
You see, that will not be easy.

822
01:00:55,315 --> 01:00:58,016
I received the highest score ever.

823
01:01:01,216 --> 01:01:02,455
I promise I will ace the exam.

824
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:13,395
If someone tries to hurt you again,

825
01:01:15,435 --> 01:01:17,236
just know that it is not your fault.

826
01:01:18,205 --> 01:01:22,705
Never forget that, no matter where you are. Do you understand?

827
01:01:34,116 --> 01:01:35,315
I am truly sorry...

828
01:01:36,386 --> 01:01:37,556
for everything.

829
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:40,625
I am sorry.

830
01:01:41,355 --> 01:01:43,055
If anyone in Hanyang bullies you,

831
01:01:43,056 --> 01:01:44,125
we will teach them a lesson.

832
01:01:50,065 --> 01:01:51,165
You can share this.

833
01:02:11,525 --> 01:02:12,786
What has gotten into you?

834
01:02:13,286 --> 01:02:16,395
Why are you suddenly sharing your crunchy rice with everyone?

835
01:02:18,866 --> 01:02:19,866
I do not know.

836
01:02:22,466 --> 01:02:23,565
Mom...

837
01:02:24,906 --> 01:02:26,435
Mom...

838
01:02:27,676 --> 01:02:28,875
You will be home soon.

839
01:02:29,605 --> 01:02:30,605
Do not cry.

840
01:02:31,946 --> 01:02:33,946
Mom...

841
01:02:36,846 --> 01:02:39,085
Mom...

842
01:02:43,216 --> 01:02:44,886
Mom...

843
01:02:51,266 --> 01:02:52,266
Open wide.

844
01:03:05,645 --> 01:03:06,645
Get on my back.

845
01:03:16,156 --> 01:03:18,656
Crying, vomiting, and relieving yourself...

846
01:03:19,426 --> 01:03:20,795
will break your fever.

847
01:03:21,996 --> 01:03:22,996
Go ahead and cry.

848
01:03:33,806 --> 01:03:35,335
I am fine now...

849
01:03:35,636 --> 01:03:37,005
because you saved me, Physician Gye.

850
01:03:40,475 --> 01:03:42,045
I did not save you.

851
01:03:42,516 --> 01:03:43,915
You saved yourself.

852
01:03:44,386 --> 01:03:46,946
All I did was help you a little.

853
01:03:49,986 --> 01:03:53,525
And Seok Cheol will be fine without us now.

854
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:59,596
You are always the only person...

855
01:04:00,466 --> 01:04:01,795
who can save yourself.

856
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:05,136
Do you understand?

857
01:04:06,466 --> 01:04:07,475
Yes!

858
01:04:35,266 --> 01:04:36,266
My gosh.

859
01:04:39,435 --> 01:04:41,806
Oh, my goodness. What brings him to Sorak Village?

860
01:04:42,105 --> 01:04:44,105
This village is improving by the day.

861
01:04:44,705 --> 01:04:45,746
Are you kidding me?

862
01:04:46,705 --> 01:04:48,475
That face tells me that bloodshed may be awaiting us.

863
01:04:48,746 --> 01:04:50,246
My gosh.

864
01:04:50,815 --> 01:04:53,516
Stop saying mean things about handsome men.

865
01:04:53,585 --> 01:04:55,016
Let me admire his face for as long as I can.

866
01:05:02,455 --> 01:05:05,225
My gosh. What brings you here?

867
01:05:05,565 --> 01:05:06,725
Are you hurt?

868
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:09,736
Oh, no. The clinic is closed now.

869
01:05:10,466 --> 01:05:11,565
I am here to see Physician Gye.

870
01:05:12,406 --> 01:05:14,736
Did you not hear what I said? Did you hurt your ears?

871
01:05:18,275 --> 01:05:20,504
We are closed.

872
01:05:20,505 --> 01:05:24,016
We are done for the day!

873
01:05:24,415 --> 01:05:26,616
How dare you speak to the royal inspector in that manner?

874
01:05:27,855 --> 01:05:28,855
This way, please.

875
01:05:36,496 --> 01:05:37,996
What is with her voice?

876
01:05:38,926 --> 01:05:41,496
"This way, please." Is she a mosquito?

877
01:06:06,926 --> 01:06:08,295
This is a stiletto needle.

878
01:06:08,656 --> 01:06:09,826
Strictly speaking,

879
01:06:10,326 --> 01:06:11,996
a stiletto needle whose colour has changed.

880
01:06:14,536 --> 01:06:17,505
Why did you come all the way here...

881
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:20,775
with this needle at this late hour?

882
01:06:21,406 --> 01:06:22,906
This concerns an urgent matter.

883
01:06:25,205 --> 01:06:26,205
This needle.

884
01:06:27,076 --> 01:06:30,315
Tell me why you think the colour changed.

885
01:06:33,385 --> 01:06:36,956
I am a mere small-town physician who lives hand to mouth.

886
01:06:37,156 --> 01:06:38,685
What would I even know?

887
01:06:40,525 --> 01:06:42,225
You are an expert when it comes to poisonous herbs.

888
01:06:43,656 --> 01:06:44,925
That is what people say.

889
01:06:48,565 --> 01:06:50,264
You are mistaken.

890
01:06:50,265 --> 01:06:51,666
I am surely not an expert.

891
01:06:57,275 --> 01:06:58,275
Is that so?

892
01:07:02,046 --> 01:07:03,916
Then I am sorry.

893
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:07,046
If you ever feel unwell, visit us anytime...

894
01:07:23,736 --> 01:07:25,105
What is this about?

895
01:07:47,286 --> 01:07:49,424
You knew who I was all along?

896
01:07:49,425 --> 01:07:51,825
What? Why would you shove this in my face now?

897
01:07:51,826 --> 01:07:53,464
Hand over Gyesoo Clinic.

898
01:07:53,465 --> 01:07:54,634
- Oh, no! - Gosh!

899
01:07:54,635 --> 01:07:56,934
You must all tighten your belts from now on!

900
01:07:56,935 --> 01:07:59,336
If I could be born again, I wish to be born as you.

901
01:08:00,265 --> 01:08:02,575
Save face as a nobleman? Being a nobleman is no big deal.

902
01:08:02,576 --> 01:08:04,974
Physician Gye said you were a glutton.

903
01:08:04,975 --> 01:08:06,474
- What? - You scoundrel!

904
01:08:06,475 --> 01:08:07,814
Will you keep slacking off?

905
01:08:07,815 --> 01:08:09,876
I shall twist your neck.

906
01:08:10,345 --> 01:08:13,415
I am truly embarrassed that he is my father.

907
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,354
Can I tell Ip Bun...

908
01:08:15,355 --> 01:08:17,725
that her mother...

909
01:08:17,986 --> 01:08:19,924
died at your hands, you quack?

910
01:08:19,925 --> 01:08:21,996
Shut your mouth!
