(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:18,935
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,570
You fool!

4
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,510
Where are you going?

5
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,449
Goodness. The things I have to do to earn a living!

6
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,589
Please come with me.

7
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,919
What is with that face?

8
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,419
Did you cause trouble again?

9
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:31,660
She needs an acupuncture treatment at once!

10
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,660
Acupuncture?

11
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:43,740
You cannot leave like that!

12
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,210
Hurry. Her pulse is weak.

13
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,880
Insert a needle into the glabella at once.

14
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,710
You and that mouth of yours.

15
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:53,809
Shut it, unless you wish to do this yourself!

16
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
Who is she?

17
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:05,990
She is the family's eldest daughter-in-law.

18
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,460
Please save her.

19
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,359
She will be okay, right?

20
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,070
Go get the lady of the house.

21
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:14,369
Pardon me?

22
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:17,470
I must discuss the details with your master.

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,769
About the remedy...

24
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,940
and how much they can afford to get her treated.

25
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,010
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,350
She must be the one you pulled out of the water.

27
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:33,049
The one who ran away.

28
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,199
Hello.

29
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,739
How is my daughter-in-law? Is she okay?

30
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,470
She is not in critical condition.

31
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,350
But if she is not treated, her wound will fester.

32
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:02,380
Gosh, my dear daughter-in-law.

33
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:05,949
Does she want to follow her deceased husband?

34
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:08,959
Those who are alive must live on.

35
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,060
Forget about my herbal decoction.

36
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,690
Please focus on treating her.

37
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,959
I will pay you very well.

38
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,030
I will make an herbal decoction with top-quality ingredients.

39
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,230
I will do my very best.

40
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,500
Very well. I trust you.

41
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,070
Thank you, ma'am.

42
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:26,040
You can give him that.

43
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
Yes, my lady.

44
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,060
Oh, my! She is very generous.

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,660
You can have this with your staff at the clinic.

46
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,030
What is this?

47
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,470
Pickled Siberian onion leaves.

48
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:55,070
It is the family's specialty. Try it.

49
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:56,769
Pickled onion leaves?

50
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,810
Hold it properly, or the juice will leak.

51
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,619
This is nice.

52
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:13,049
Mind your own business. Why worry about their family affairs...

53
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,859
when you can barely take care of yourself?

54
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,260
I did not say anything.

55
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,989
Do not put on a long face!

56
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,999
That good-looking face is all you have got.

57
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,400
Will you treat patients with such a frowning face?

58
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,169
What kind of physician treats patients with his face?

59
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,140
You are a dunce who cannot administer acupuncture.

60
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,140
So you need to use all you have got, which is your face.

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
What?

62
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,179
Do you want to try?

63
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,109
When patients come, just hear them out.

64
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:43,450
Nod along when they vent their anger.

65
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:46,989
That is your job from now on.

66
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:50,619
You dunce!

67
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,859
You are probably thinking...

68
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,359
that I am talking nonsense because I am drunk now.

69
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,499
"I cannot administer acupuncture,"

70
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:59,770
"so what is the point?" I bet you are thinking that now.

71
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:02,369
Wait and see.

72
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,809
It could save...

73
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,669
or kill someone.

74
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:13,109
What a nice day!

75
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,030
Who says you must do it in the air?

76
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,200
Who says the rope must be held above our heads?

77
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:41,809
My gosh.

78
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
- I got this.
- What are you doing?

79
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,650
This is mine!

80
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,650
What?

81
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:49,319
Do not misunderstand my intentions.

82
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,749
I am trying to help you. I want to help.

83
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:57,759
You see, I am really good at stuff like this.

84
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,759
- You boar!
- What?

85
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,290
I will tell Poong on you...

86
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,059
if you do not go away at once!

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,530
"Poong"? What is "Poong"?

88
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,900
Who is that?

89
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,439
You do not know Poong? My Poong.

90
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,540
My handsome Poong.

91
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Poong!

92
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,220
- You are back.
- Yes.

93
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,419
Poong!

94
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,890
You must be tired, Poong.

95
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:30,119
"Poong"? That physician's name is Poong?

96
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,319
Yes, my Poong.

97
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,390
Wait, why...

98
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:39,100
What is the matter with my young master?

99
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,840
I bet my father cursed him.

100
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,869
You and your foul mouth, Father!

101
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,340
You curse every time you open your mouth.

102
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:48,270
Have some class.

103
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,879
I am truly disappointed too.

104
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,220
You fools are being ridiculous.

105
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,749
Go prepare lunch!

106
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,189
When will Lady Namhae come back?

107
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:02,220
We will all starve to death before she returns.

108
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,319
Oh, dear.

109
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,970
You will save many,

110
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,009
so stay alive, okay?

111
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:42,999
Did you do this on purpose?

112
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,929
You had to cause such a scene when the physicians were here?

113
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,129
Do you want people to spread rumors...

114
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,770
that I picked on my widowed daughter-in-law?

115
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,109
No, my lady. Please do not get the wrong idea.

116
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:55,980
Take her and give her a good beating.

117
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,150
As for Lady Seo, lock her up in the storage.

118
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,850
Get rid of all the sharp objects so she cannot do this again.

119
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,850
Please, my lady.

120
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,989
If you lock her up again, she really will die!

121
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,189
Please, my lady. I beg you.

122
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,290
What are you waiting for?

123
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:13,689
Yes, my lady.

124
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,200
No, my lady! No!

125
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,470
I will go to the storage, so please do not hurt her.

126
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,470
Daughter-in-law,

127
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,140
how this ends depends on you.

128
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:41,889
If you keep this up,

129
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,090
people will say you are being too harsh on her.

130
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
Who will say such a thing?

131
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,730
Ask anyone on the streets.

132
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,700
On top of getting my eldest son killed,

133
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,800
she is disgracing the family now.

134
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,340
Everyone will say she should pay for it with her life.

135
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,080
You have me, Mother.

136
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,550
You did not pass the provincial exam yet again.

137
00:09:08,619 --> 00:09:10,920
It is such a shame.

138
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:15,690
I suppose I am not smart enough.

139
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,359
Do not say that.

140
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,730
It is not easy to obtain a government position.

141
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,580
I am sorry to put you through this.

142
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,249
Do not be sorry. You are here too, my lady.

143
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,029
Did she order you to make sure I empty the bowl?

144
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,230
Yes.

145
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,060
She is giving you food so you do not have to take it...

146
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,800
on an empty stomach.

147
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,330
I suppose she does not hate you that much after all.

148
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,670
Eun Woo.

149
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,090
Drink this.

150
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,259
So you can live.

151
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,840
I told you that he had to eat well to get better.

152
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,840
If only there was anything to eat.

153
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,739
There is only so much bark one can eat.

154
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:45,039
Rather than starving yourself for over a month,

155
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,550
you should have come to me.

156
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,950
We were born with mouths for a reason.

157
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,379
Were you saving your words for the afterlife?

158
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,090
Granny, hand him some barley, will you?

159
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,289
When I cannot even pay for the treatments?

160
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,389
What is new? Now, get going already.

161
00:10:58,889 --> 00:10:59,960
Over here!

162
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:01,960
Let us go.

163
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,129
- Physician Gye.
- My goodness.

164
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:09,399
Could you please see me next?

165
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,499
- Physician Gye.
- Please.

166
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,739

Well,

169
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,499
it seems as though you should get out there.

170
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,940
Physician Gye is threatening to call the officer...

171
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,539
or to extend your contract for another day.

172
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:49,340
Back in Hanyang, your eyes flickered with light...

173
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,340
every time you saw someone sick...

174
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,810
and stuck needles everywhere,

175
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,220
including a lady's chest area, putting yourself in a predicament.

176
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,389
So why you are refusing to see patients here is beyond me.

177
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:03,359
- Please.
- Physician Gye.

178
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,499
What is the meaning of this?

179
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,029
Put me down this instant.

180
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,730
How dare you.

181
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,239
I sense a strong pulse.

- Thank you.

May I take your hand?

- Next.
- This is what is troubling me.

Look how convenient this is.

Foolish monkeys?

That is what Ip Bun said.

195
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,950
It is easier to serve patients their medicine.

196

Jang Gun, you!

Silly girl. You have been making a habit of belittling me.

A physician from Hanyang sure is different though.

Not only is he handsome, but he is also talented.

His face is practically glowing.

do this instead.

Why are you not considering your lodging bill?

Have I not warned you that I would have to stick in...

253

a needle this big if this continues?

It is the leftover tonic brewed for the young lady from Ssarit Village.

I could not let it go to waste.

I smell a lot of ginseng too.

278

The young lady from Ssarit Village was given a one-ingredient tonic.

could tell the difference just by its aroma.

282

You are not some master cook.

- Whatever.

Throw it away if this is not needed, then.

Physician Gye is out to get you today,

Young Master Yoo, you have nothing going on for you at the moment.

However, what you still have are your good looks.

299
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,110
So keep them that way like I tell you to...

300
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,650
before you lose the only edge you have.

301
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,920
That is enough. I am done.

302
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,089
What the...

303
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,559
That time could have been spent reading at least a few books.

304
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,900
My goodness.

305
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,210

Goodness.

310
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,989
- Is he a physician?
- Oh, gosh.

311
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,319
Look.

312

He touches her.

315

Look at that.

316
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,400
Look.

317

You feel sore from the stomach to the heart.

318

How do you know that?

319
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:14,309
You have heartburn.

320
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,809
Your sides hurt and your throat closes up,

321
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,440
making it hard to swallow.

322
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,049
Yes. You are right.

323
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:23,450
Do you regurgitate sour liquids or do you feel pain?

324
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:24,620
Well...

325
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,890
Sour liquid.

326
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:29,360
It must be rough.

327
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,690
How do you know all that?

328
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:34,989
The sourness keeps coming up and it is so dreadful.

329
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:36,829
In that case...

330
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:41,029
you need something to counter the acid.

331
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:42,170
It will be slightly bitter.

332
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,440
But...

333
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,009
why is your pulse so quick?

334
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,140
It is not a heart issue.

335
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,739
(An overworked heart)

336
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:51,339
Oh, dear.

337
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,349
Do you have any other ailments?

338
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:55,450
No.

339
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,289
Just looking will cure anything.

340
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,049
- That is right.
- My gosh.

341
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:03,989
Of all the patients whose faces he looked at,

342
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,160
not one has died yet.

343
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:09,029
- That is not what...
- He can cure anyone.

344
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:11,360
That is not the face I meant.

345
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,799
His is a piece of...

346
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:14,769
Never mind.

347
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:17,299
- Do you...
- I do not.

348
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,940
I was going to ask what is for dinner.

349
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,339
What kind of answer is that?

350
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,610
You just had lunch and you are talking about dinner already?

351
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,349
- You glutton.
- Why are you so annoyed?

352
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,509
Help us!

353
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:28,749
She's dying!

354
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
What is it?

355
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:35,220
My lady suddenly turned strange.

356
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,759
She was fine a while ago...

357
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,259
Do not waste time. Bring her inside.

358
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,430
What happened to her?

359
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:48,029
She was locked in storage.

360
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,069
I went to see how she was...

361
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,739
What was she doing locked in storage?

362
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:52,739
Her mother-in-law...

363
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,309
Please save my poor lady.

364
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,349
Bring a brew of mung and black beans.

365
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:01,210
She will need a lot, so make much more too.

366
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,279
Okay.

367
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,049
What is it? Was she poisoned?

368
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,390
Yes, I think so.

369
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:08,789
But I do not know what poison it is yet.

370
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:12,289
She tried to drown herself, and this time she took poison?

371
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,059
What did she eat today?

372
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,130
A plain porridge I made her,

373
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,430
and the medicine the physician prescribed.

374
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:20,999
She took poison?

375
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,769
She was locked in storage all day. She could not have taken anything.

376
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,809
Where is my daughter-in-law?

377
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,049
Who gave you permission to smuggle her out?

378
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,660
Oh, there she is.

379
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,289
Bring her out immediately.

380
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:48,289
Yes, my lady.

381
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,200
You cannot enter without my master's permission.

382
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:54,329
How dare you?

383
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:57,400
You will only get hurt.

384
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,749
All is well.

385
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,579
Nothing is wrong.

386
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,150
She almost drowned, harmed herself, and took poison.

387
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:14,390
Without any treatment, your daughter-in-law will die.

388
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:15,989
Still,

389
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,519
I cannot allow the widow of a nobleman...

390
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,390
to lie in such shabby quarters.

391
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,400
You can come to treat her.

392
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,930
Let her come home.

393
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,900
Her life is at stake.

394
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,769
I cannot allow it.

395
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,640
Who are you to say that?

396
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:32,839
He is a physician.

397
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,110
Any acupuncture treatment...

398
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,839
must be administered with caution upon caution,

399
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,809
and one hundred administrations...

400
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:41,509
of moxa cautery only might barely save her.

401
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
That cannot be done at your residence.

402
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,849
She married into our family.

403
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:48,289
If she dies, she will haunt our family, not yours.

404
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:51,319
Do not just stand there. Take her home.

405
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,319
Yes, my lady.

406
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,430
You evil wench!

407
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,630
Oh, dear...

408
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:00,829
Oh, no.

409
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:05,239
Let go of her. Oh, dear. Let go.

410
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,940
How dare a lowly broad touch me?

411
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,180
Calm down.

412
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,079
Please leave.

413
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,480
I must find out what caused your daughter-in-law's condition.

414
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,749
Do you think I will let this go?

415
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,160
I will make all you lowly brutes pay...

416
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,390
for insulting a woman of noble birth!

417
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,529
I shall see the magistrate.

418
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Stay right there!

419
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,239
There are three things no one can touch while I live.

420
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,870
You seem to have forgotten.

421
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,440
I will say it again, so listen up!

422
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:44,410
My clinic, my patients, and my family.

423
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,009
Touch any of those and Gye Ji Han will not forgive you. Understood?

424
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:54,989
Until the patient who has entered...

425
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:58,759
Gyesoo Clinic is cured, they cannot be taken away.

426
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,829
Not even if the King himself appears.

427
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:02,259
As the physician,

428
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:06,029
only me, Gye Ji Han, and that young new physician...

429
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:09,099
can decide who can leave or not.

430
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,569
Do you...

431
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,410
really want to face the magistrate...

432
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,870
and decide which of us is in the right?

433
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,339
Oh, my goodness. It was you, my lady?

434
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:21,009
Oh, dear.

435
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:23,749
You crazy... We must go to...

436
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:28,019
If we are to argue in front of the magistrate,

437
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,460
word will spread throughout the village.

438
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:39,160
I apologize.

439
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:42,130
I just remembered the ruckus,

440
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:43,670
and it made me laugh.

441
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,809
What do you want? Shall I call Chil Sung the guard?

442
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,380
No.

443
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:58,319
I do not wish for the situation to get any worse.

444
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:01,789
We shall leave.

445
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,220
I wish you a safe return.

446
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,079
Take your medicine.

447
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,349
You must drink this to get better.

448
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,220
If you won't take your medicine, eat.

449
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,930
Your daughter-in-law is poisoned.

450
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,839
She took something.

451
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,140
Or someone else gave it to her.

452
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:02,950
How dare you suggest such a thing?

453
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,720
Who would poison my eldest son's widow in my house?

454
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,989
The medicine she is given.

455
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,519
May I have a look at it?

456
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:14,089
Physician Gye said she needs medicine to prevent gangrene,

457
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:16,130
so she was given this today as well.

458
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,900
I will take a look.

459
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:24,400
Did you brew the medicine for her in this pot?

460
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,440
I did.

461
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,839
Is the bowl the same one you gave her the medicine in?

462
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,339
Yes. Because she fainted,

463
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:32,210
I had no time to wash it.

464
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,650
It still contains the medicine we had left over.

465
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,400
Will that do?

466
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,470
If you are a true physician,

467
00:28:57,499 --> 00:29:00,739
you had better think carefully before deciding what to say.

468
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:02,009
I apologize.

469
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,779
I did as was told and spent money and effort...

470
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:08,110
to brew medicine for my widowed daughter-in-law,

471
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,920
and this is the kind of prejudice I must put up with.

472
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,349
It is such a disgrace.

473
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,759
I think you should leave.

474
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,430
Please take good care of my sister-in-law.

475
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:27,299
Mother.

476
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,069
My mistress is disgruntled because her younger son...

477
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,900
failed the state exam yet again.

478
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,069
I hope you understand.

479
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:47,549
I gave her an antidote to let her energy circulate,

480
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:49,289
and her pulse is stronger at last.

481
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,420
She is definitely poisoned,

482
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:54,190
but no one poisoned her.

483
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,700
How could that be?

484
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,069
I am sorry.

485
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:09,569
I am sorry.

486
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:11,940
I will not do it again. I am sorry.

487
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:13,410
I am sorry.

488
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,410
It is okay.

489
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,650
It is fine.

490
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,420
She is just sick.

491
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,089
If you do not mind, can you bring another bowl?

492
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,860
What are you doing...

493
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:30,759
to those trying to help you?

494
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,059
I never asked for help.

495
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,730
Why do you keep trying to save me?

496
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,569
Then why did you save me that day?

497
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,739
You must remember me.

498
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,880
No, I do not.

499
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,470
My goodness. Look at that frowning face.

500
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,970
What is the matter? Did she reject you again?

501
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:21,450
It is chilly. If you have been drinking, go inside.

502
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,849
There is a right time for everything.

503
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:28,049
You probably think that you can take care of everything...

504
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:30,259
since you used to work in the Medical Office.

505
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,660
Do not do anything.

506
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:39,230
You must let it all go to make it yours.

507
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,900
Just wait patiently.

508
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,470
That way, she will open up to you and start talking.

509
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,910
Well...

510
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,039
Father! My gosh.

511
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,610
Did you drink again?

512
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,579
Goodness. Mr. Lofty here does not drink a single drop of alcohol.

513
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:58,120
Stop talking nonsense. Come on.

514
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,120
What? "Lofty"? This punk? My goodness.

515
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,519
Lofty, my foot. He is such a handful!

516
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,399
(Gyesoo Clinic)

517
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,260
Eun Woo!

518
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,590
Eun Woo!

519
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:28,201
My gosh, Eun Woo.

520
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,201
District Governor. What brings you to my humble abode?

521
00:32:33,171 --> 00:32:35,601
Is she your daughter?

522
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:37,840
Yes.

523
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,711
What is wrong with Eun Woo?

524
00:32:41,641 --> 00:32:43,451
Many things. She survived drowning and...

525
00:32:43,451 --> 00:32:45,980
I just had a bad cold.

526
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,221
Right?

527
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:49,820
She turned the corner many times...

528
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,730
She needs in-depth treatment,

529
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,931
but do not worry too much.

530
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,601
A cold, my foot. Your in-laws are to blame.

531
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:06,641
I will not send her back to her in-laws' place.

532
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:07,941
She will stay with me.

533
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,300
Honey.

534
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,710
Would you be able to visit our home to treat her?

535
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,510
Of course, she is the district governor's daughter.

536
00:33:15,311 --> 00:33:17,581
Physician Yoo used to work in the Medical Office.

537
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:21,181
He will visit you every three days to treat her.

538
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:23,420
We will pay you more than your regular rate.

539
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:25,550
Please take good care of her.

540
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:29,960
You must focus on treating Lady Seo.

541
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,090
Visit them every morning to treat her.

542
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,800
Eun Woo is a married woman.

543
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,471
She is not well. We cannot send her back.

544
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,240
You rushed to marry her off a year ago.

545
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:49,081
Look, Eun Woo is a widow now.

546
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,351
Her evil mother-in-law must have been so mean to her.

547
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:57,891
But according to the customs...

548
00:33:57,891 --> 00:34:00,891
What if she falls ill and collapses after we send her back?

549
00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:03,161
Will you be happy?

550
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,231
I will...

551
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:10,831
return to my in-laws'.

552
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,391
Wake up.

553
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,231
Physician Yoo.

554
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,460
Yes.

555
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,170
- Thank you.
- No problem.

556
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,141
Eat a lot of warm food.

557
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,510
Get home safely.

558
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,911
That fool. He cannot even earn his keep.

559
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,481
Move aside!

560
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,451
Hey, Sam Sik. Wait there.

561
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:03,590
Okay.

562
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,121
Granny! Where are you going?

563
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:08,161
We are so busy right now. She drives me crazy.

564
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,731
You have nothing to do, so you should go after her.

565
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,601
Hey, dunce!

566
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:19,371
Remember what I told you yesterday? Do not do anything.

567
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,300
Just wait.

568
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:23,340
Let things be.

569
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:25,170
Then see what happens.

570
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,440
Go, hurry.

571
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:32,751
Poong!

572
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,420
Poong.

573
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,050
Poong!

574
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,231
Gosh.

575
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:58,240
Oh, a rabbit!

576
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,521
Come here!

577
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,641
Flowers?

578
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:11,851
Who might you be?

579
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,751
I should be asking you the same question.

580
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,590
What are you doing in front of my house?

581
00:37:19,721 --> 00:37:23,061
Do you have "Poong" in your name?

582
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:31,130
By any chance, is your mother...

583
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:34,971
She passed away many years ago.

584
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,280
I apologize.

585
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,661
Ledebouriella seseloides alleviates pain.

586
00:37:58,891 --> 00:38:01,061
Codonopsis pilosula boosts energy.

587
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:04,931
I have been staring at them,

588
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:06,871
but they all look the same to me.

589
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:08,940
No! They must not get mixed.

590
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,340
My gosh. Stop bothering him.

591
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,311
Me? What did I do?

592
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:14,641
Just now, you...

593
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,811
Oh, Young Master. Look how Jang Gun...

594
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:21,820
differentiated and organized all the herbs.

595
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,320
My, even the physicians in the Medical Office often get confused.

596
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,820
I am impressed he can differentiate them.

597
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,561
Jang Gun, this is amazing.

598
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:32,530
Indeed. You find this fascinating too, right?

599
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,630
Hey, dunce!

600
00:38:34,931 --> 00:38:37,731
You see, codonopsis pilosula is a lot more expensive.

601
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,331
If they get mixed,

602
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,300
I will add it to your debt.

603
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:44,570
He says that all the time.

604
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:48,041
Poong!

605
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:51,181
Poong.

606
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,380
My Poong. Where were you?

607
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,420
I went to see a friend.

608
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Your friend does not like you, right?

609
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:09,601
Why would Poong's friends not like him?

610
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,400
Because his mother came back alive.

611
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:18,710
She passed away many years ago.

612
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,811
I'm sorry, Poong.

613
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,780
I know you hate your mother, Poong. You are embarrassed of her.

614
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:30,721
No, of course not.

615
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:34,920
Everyone would have been better off without me.

616
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:38,161
They would have been happier.

617
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:42,400
Your wife too.

618
00:39:42,831 --> 00:39:46,630
Make sure you watch over her so that she does not run away.

619
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,530
Why...

620
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:21,431
Why...

621
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:25,001
Why do you keep...

622
00:41:25,931 --> 00:41:29,440
Why do you keep trying to save me?

623
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,510
You cannot die without my permission.

624
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,851
I am a physician...

625
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,851
and I will cure you.

626
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:42,621
But I am not sick.

627
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:45,920
Physically, I am perfectly healthy.

628
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,590
Do I honestly seem sick to you?

629
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,061
If that is the case, what are my symptoms?

630
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,971
How can you possibly treat me when you do not know what they are?

631
00:41:59,431 --> 00:42:03,240
So just leave me alone!

632
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,340
Have you forgotten what you once said to me?

633
00:42:05,471 --> 00:42:08,041
I have no idea what you are talking about!

634
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:09,340
"There are things you can only see,"

635
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,010
"hear,"

636
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:14,351
"and feel when you are alive."

637
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:18,490
You told me to live saying that I must.

638
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:23,221
That is what you said to me.

639
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,960
There are things you can only see,

640
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
hear, and feel when you are alive.

641
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:34,070
Do not break yourself.

642
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,911
You are not one who breaks.

643
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:40,170
Are you not one who saves?

644
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,581
Do not break yourself.

645
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,621
You cannot save my life...

646
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:50,280
and then end up breaking yours.

647
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:06,630
I...

648
00:43:08,101 --> 00:43:10,041
I have nowhere to go.

649
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,840
I will be executed by law if I head back to my parents.

650
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,081
But I am as good as dead if I stay with my in-laws.

651
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,681
This is the only place I could be at.

652
00:43:30,061 --> 00:43:31,630
It is not your fault, my lady.

653
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,731
You are...

654
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:37,331
not to blame.

655
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,240
You once said I would save many lives.

656
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,871
Please allow me the chance to save you.

657
00:43:46,871 --> 00:43:48,610
I will find the answer...

658
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:51,311
that gets you your life back.

659
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:09,931
Granny.

660
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:16,141
Goodness, Poong!

661
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,811
Could you look after Lady Seo tonight?

662
00:44:35,391 --> 00:44:38,061
Of course. It has been rough, has it not?

663
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:45,731
Can you not sleep?

664
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,601
Should I ask Poong...

665
00:44:51,811 --> 00:44:53,440
to perform acupuncture on you?

666
00:44:57,451 --> 00:45:00,951
Do I seem sick to you as well?

667
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:08,121
Where exactly?

668
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:12,690
This is where it hurts.

669
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,601
And this is where you should receive acupuncture.

670
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:21,871
If that nasty lady comes by again,

671
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,800
I will tell her off.

672
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,971
So do not be hurt anymore.

673
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,221
You are a pretty one.

674
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,751
Your husband is one lucky man.

675
00:45:46,731 --> 00:45:47,731
Do you know...

676
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:54,170
when I first saw my husband's face?

677
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:26,971
What?

678
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:30,670
No!

679
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,440
I married a man I had never seen before.

680
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:40,110
The first and last time I saw my husband...

681
00:46:42,221 --> 00:46:44,521
was when he was placed in his casket.

682
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:48,320
And I...

683
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,161
You killed your husband.

684
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,931
It is your fault that my son died!

685
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:57,731
They say letting in the wrong person...

686
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,130
brings a family to its ruin.

687
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,641
This is all your fault!

688
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:05,610
Tears are absent, and food is easily swallowed.

689
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,380
You heartless cow. You just do not care, do you?

690
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,510
It should have been you.

691
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:16,150
You should have died instead!

692
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:32,201
Daughter-in-law, how this ends depends on you.

693
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:34,601
Hang yourself by the neck or slit your wrist.

694
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:38,971
Whatever you choose to do, make sure it is done right.

695
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:41,981
Maybe I am better off dead.

696
00:47:43,081 --> 00:47:46,481
If I can do my family more good by dying,

697
00:47:48,681 --> 00:47:50,780
it may be the better choice.

698
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:55,260
Like you suggested,

699
00:47:57,831 --> 00:48:00,090
would acupuncture to the chest relieve me of this pain?

700
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:06,030
Why is everyone blaming me?

701
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,170
It is because the nasty lady is hurting too.

702
00:48:17,181 --> 00:48:18,981
Not here,

703
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:22,880
but up here in the head.

704
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,851
Right here.

705
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,490
She is hurting.

706
00:49:04,988 --> 00:49:06,927
Is my debt down to two nyang?

707
00:49:08,398 --> 00:49:11,668
It is only natural, as I brought in many more patients.

708
00:49:13,597 --> 00:49:15,168
This is payment for your work.

709
00:49:15,968 --> 00:49:17,508
Now, let me see.

710
00:49:17,508 --> 00:49:21,238
Man Bok eats enough for many more men...

711
00:49:21,238 --> 00:49:24,307
The longer I stay here, the bigger my debt becomes.

712
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:27,778
If I am forced to stay just because of a few nyang,

713
00:49:27,778 --> 00:49:29,447
is that not a slave contract?

714
00:49:32,287 --> 00:49:34,358
Let us be honest.

715
00:49:34,557 --> 00:49:36,287
You cannot use needles.

716
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:39,358
Do you think any other clinic would accept you?

717
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:40,387
As if.

718
00:49:44,128 --> 00:49:46,668
But here, I do not...

719
00:49:46,668 --> 00:49:49,298
force you to use needles, and with just your pretty face...

720
00:49:49,298 --> 00:49:52,907
and gift of gab I still let you see patients.

721
00:49:53,608 --> 00:49:54,938
That is a rare opportunity.

722
00:49:55,778 --> 00:49:58,778
What clinic would hire a dunce of a physician?

723
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:01,947
Who knows?

724
00:50:02,548 --> 00:50:04,517
Your stay here...

725
00:50:05,148 --> 00:50:07,488
might even cure you of your ailment.

726
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:17,767
Young Master. Why the long face?

727
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:20,398
Did Physician Gye upset you again?

728
00:50:20,398 --> 00:50:23,197
Can you just... not eat so much?

729
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:25,307
Rice cakes before breakfast?

730
00:50:28,177 --> 00:50:30,637
Why is he venting at me for what he did wrong?

731
00:50:32,077 --> 00:50:33,977
Rice cakes taste best before breakfast.

732
00:50:39,017 --> 00:50:41,918
Hey. Tomorrow is that day at last.

733
00:50:42,218 --> 00:50:43,918
I live for this day.

734
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:47,128
What day is it?

735
00:50:47,597 --> 00:50:51,097
At night, there will be a market only women can go to.

736
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:53,427
There are so many treats at markets.

737
00:50:55,338 --> 00:50:56,637
Why do they allow just women?

738
00:50:58,068 --> 00:51:01,008
Can you eat something else too? You eat just the onion leaves.

739
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:04,477
That is because it tastes best.

740
00:51:05,447 --> 00:51:08,177
How did you manage to keep him fed?

741
00:51:11,988 --> 00:51:14,758
Hang on. That is perfect.

742
00:51:14,858 --> 00:51:16,988
We will have nothing to do tomorrow evening.

743
00:51:16,988 --> 00:51:21,358
Jang Gun, teach me to distinguish similar-looking medicinal herbs.

744
00:51:22,128 --> 00:51:23,327
It looked cool.

745
00:51:23,628 --> 00:51:25,398
Not everyone has that skill.

746
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:26,497
Hey.

747
00:51:26,597 --> 00:51:28,568
Moktong, Banggi. Danggwi, Gobon.

748
00:51:28,568 --> 00:51:29,767
Banha, Cheonnamseong.

749
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:31,508
(Similar-looking herbs)

750
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:32,637
There are too many.

751
00:51:32,637 --> 00:51:35,137
Come on. Be nice and just teach me, will you?

752
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,148
No. They cannot get mixed.

753
00:51:39,148 --> 00:51:40,947
- Why not?
- Gomchwi, Dongeui.

754
00:51:41,247 --> 00:51:42,617
Bekchul, Nangdanggeun.

755
00:51:42,778 --> 00:51:44,947
People die. Die in pain.

756
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:52,188
If they are mixed up, bad things happen.

757
00:52:02,197 --> 00:52:05,438
Yes. When mixed up, bad things happen.

758
00:52:14,977 --> 00:52:16,577
That is what happened.

759
00:52:36,037 --> 00:52:38,468
I see you are busy, working all alone.

760
00:52:38,468 --> 00:52:41,977
You could do with some help. Where is the young physician?

761
00:52:43,407 --> 00:52:45,648
Did he rush off because he had had enough?

762
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:49,847
That fool is off saving a life on his own.

763
00:52:50,747 --> 00:52:52,017
Or is it two?

764
00:52:54,657 --> 00:52:57,758
How will you harm your daughter-in-law this time?

765
00:52:59,557 --> 00:53:01,197
You and your nonsense, is it?

766
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:10,738
These are Siberian onion leaves.

767
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:14,068
I believe I gave you a batch of pickled ones.

768
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:17,477
Yes. You were very cautious and thorough.

769
00:53:18,108 --> 00:53:21,347
You even gave some for us at the clinic to eat.

770
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:24,048
I enjoyed them enough to almost fall for it.

771
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:32,758
Will you taste these too?

772
00:53:38,197 --> 00:53:40,398
There was nothing wrong with your daughter-in-law's tonic.

773
00:53:41,637 --> 00:53:43,398
The problem was with...

774
00:53:44,037 --> 00:53:46,738
the onion leaves you gave her to eat alone.

775
00:53:47,907 --> 00:53:48,907
This...

776
00:53:51,177 --> 00:53:53,278
is Bakse, not an onion leaf.

777
00:53:54,718 --> 00:53:56,577
It looks just like an onion leaf,

778
00:53:56,577 --> 00:53:59,447
but it is a poisonous plant that kills when eaten enough of.

779
00:54:07,188 --> 00:54:08,227
Look.

780
00:54:08,758 --> 00:54:10,358
It is the plant hunters picked...

781
00:54:10,427 --> 00:54:13,468
to smear on their arrowheads to poison their catches!

782
00:54:14,697 --> 00:54:16,968
You were so meticulous.

783
00:54:19,938 --> 00:54:21,577
What do you want from me?

784
00:54:22,807 --> 00:54:25,177
You chose to come here instead of reporting me.

785
00:54:25,577 --> 00:54:27,447
Is it not because you want something?

786
00:54:28,818 --> 00:54:30,378
Release your daughter-in-law.

787
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:33,648
Consider her dead, as you wish,

788
00:54:34,657 --> 00:54:36,218
and let her go.

789
00:54:39,157 --> 00:54:41,028
Is that it?

790
00:54:42,398 --> 00:54:45,028
You seem to have feelings for her...

791
00:54:45,028 --> 00:54:46,427
What I mean is!

792
00:54:47,767 --> 00:54:50,898
You are not to mention her or say her name again.

793
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:53,708
I collected all the Bakse you had planted around her room.

794
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,407
I can report you to the magistrate at any time.

795
00:54:57,747 --> 00:54:59,077
Be very careful.

796
00:55:01,278 --> 00:55:05,017
Why are you threatening me with groundless accusations?

797
00:55:05,747 --> 00:55:08,657
How would I benefit from killing my daughter-in-law?

798
00:55:08,688 --> 00:55:11,657
You are right. You would not benefit that way.

799
00:55:11,858 --> 00:55:13,958
But you want to revive your household!

800
00:55:14,697 --> 00:55:15,798
What?

801
00:55:16,227 --> 00:55:18,968
How could I revive my household by losing a daughter-in-law?

802
00:55:18,968 --> 00:55:21,097
If your widowed daughter-in-law were to kill herself,

803
00:55:21,097 --> 00:55:23,497
and the government were to praise her for her virtue,

804
00:55:23,497 --> 00:55:26,438
your useless younger son would earn a title. Am I wrong?

805
00:55:27,668 --> 00:55:29,307
That is...

806
00:55:29,307 --> 00:55:31,907
She would be praised if she were to kill herself,

807
00:55:31,907 --> 00:55:34,617
but if her in-laws were found to have killed her,

808
00:55:35,218 --> 00:55:37,148
you would lose everything including honor and respect.

809

What do you say?

810
00:55:40,747 --> 00:55:42,117
Are you all right with that?

811
00:55:44,057 --> 00:55:45,557
There you go.

812
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:47,128

00:56:51,227 --> 00:56:52,657
No, thank you.

827
00:56:52,988 --> 00:56:56,427
No. You must come as well.

828
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:57,758
Why are you so thin?

829
00:58:00,988 --> 00:58:04,227
Next time, I will bring you wild ginseng, not raspberries.

830
00:58:04,227 --> 00:58:07,727
Do not do this anymore. I came here to say this.

831
00:58:10,997 --> 00:58:13,068
That physician told me to tell you myself.

832
00:58:16,738 --> 00:58:20,447
Please tell her to stop coming by.

833
00:58:20,947 --> 00:58:23,247
We considered her dead and gone in the last invasion,

834
00:58:24,378 --> 00:58:26,148
and we are doing fine without her.

835
00:58:30,758 --> 00:58:32,128
Poong.

836
00:58:36,697 --> 00:58:38,227
Do not...

837
00:58:39,427 --> 00:58:40,668
visit me again.

838
00:58:43,097 --> 00:58:44,097
Please.

839
00:58:55,378 --> 00:58:56,378
How much longer...

840
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:05,858
will you let others' opinions control you?

841
00:59:09,028 --> 00:59:11,568
You have never once held her hand.

842
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,798
Must you turn her away like this?

843
00:59:18,537 --> 00:59:20,137
"Live like you are already dead."

844
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,637
"Bury them in your heart even if they are alive."

845
00:59:26,347 --> 00:59:28,017
They cannot protect the country or the people,

846
00:59:28,017 --> 00:59:29,048
yet they force it on us...

847
00:59:29,048 --> 00:59:30,747
for they are cowards.

848
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,617
She is alive.

849
00:59:34,758 --> 00:59:35,758
She survived.

850
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:39,028
She is alive,

851
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,958
and you have missed her.

852
00:59:44,528 --> 00:59:46,727
There are things you have wanted to say to her.

853
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:49,738
They call you a trollop...

854
00:59:50,197 --> 00:59:52,568
and point fingers at me for I am your son.

855
00:59:53,938 --> 00:59:55,878
I am sorry, Poong.

856
00:59:56,338 --> 00:59:59,048
I cannot even hope to have a successful career anymore.

857
00:59:59,878 --> 01:00:01,648
Why did you come back?

858
01:00:01,918 --> 01:00:03,617
I wish you were dead!

859
01:00:20,668 --> 01:00:21,738
Poong!

860
01:00:32,677 --> 01:00:35,418
If you do not like raspberries and wild ginseng,

861
01:00:36,447 --> 01:00:37,617
let me give you this.

862
01:00:38,447 --> 01:00:40,747
I have been carrying it around...

863
01:00:40,747 --> 01:00:42,458
to give it to you on your birthday.

864
01:00:44,117 --> 01:00:45,827
I always felt bad...

865
01:00:46,657 --> 01:00:48,497
that I never once got to dress you...

866
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:50,128
in the clothes I made.

867
01:00:51,727 --> 01:00:52,727
Look.

868
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:56,697
I wanted to give you these when you entered school.

869
01:00:57,367 --> 01:00:59,838
I got this...

870
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:01,878
for your coming-of-age ceremony.

871
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:07,108
Poong, are you married?

872
01:01:13,017 --> 01:01:14,347
Would this fit you?

873
01:01:20,887 --> 01:01:21,898
My gosh.

874
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:23,927
You...

875
01:01:25,168 --> 01:01:27,097
prepared these things every year?

876
01:01:27,927 --> 01:01:28,938
Your mother...

877
01:01:29,938 --> 01:01:32,168
always carried that bundle around wherever she went.

878
01:01:34,668 --> 01:01:36,177
I cannot believe...

879
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:40,577
you prepared these things for me every year.

880
01:01:45,447 --> 01:01:46,447
My sweet child.

881
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:49,517
Do not cry.

882
01:01:50,588 --> 01:01:52,528
I am sorry.

883
01:01:52,688 --> 01:01:55,298
It is all my fault, so do not cry.

884
01:01:55,298 --> 01:01:56,358
No.

885
01:01:57,898 --> 01:01:59,997
I knew that it was not your fault,

886
01:01:59,997 --> 01:02:01,537
but this fool that I am...

887
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:05,338
heartlessly...

888
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:08,907
pushed you away, Mother.

889
01:02:10,407 --> 01:02:11,407
Mother.

890
01:02:12,947 --> 01:02:13,947
Mother...

891
01:02:15,378 --> 01:02:17,117
Please forgive me.

892
01:02:18,517 --> 01:02:19,517
No.

893
01:02:21,188 --> 01:02:24,617
I am sorry for making people call me a trollop.

894
01:02:25,057 --> 01:02:29,327
So please, Poong. Do not cry.

895
01:02:39,468 --> 01:02:40,468
Please...

896
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:44,037
forgive me.

897
01:03:12,307 --> 01:03:14,438
You asked me why I kept trying to save you.

898
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:18,508
Perhaps,

899
01:03:19,648 --> 01:03:22,177
it was because you reminded me of myself.

900
01:03:24,378 --> 01:03:25,447
A year ago,

901
01:03:26,017 --> 01:03:28,517
I was brimming with confidence and thought I could do anything.

902
01:03:29,688 --> 01:03:33,057
However, I lost everything overnight...

903
01:03:34,028 --> 01:03:35,858
and nearly lost my life too.

904
01:03:37,298 --> 01:03:38,298
But...

905
01:03:38,997 --> 01:03:41,068
seeing Granny today taught me...

906
01:03:42,767 --> 01:03:44,838
that I must survive and wait.

907
01:03:48,378 --> 01:03:51,477
If I die like this, I will be remembered...

908
01:03:52,608 --> 01:03:55,077
as a disloyal subject, an unfilial son, a fool,

909
01:03:55,918 --> 01:03:58,048
and a cowardly physician.

910
01:04:03,688 --> 01:04:06,858
What if this was all people remembered of you?

911
01:04:08,327 --> 01:04:10,157
Do you truly not care?

912
01:04:15,568 --> 01:04:16,668
Poong!

913
01:04:19,867 --> 01:04:20,938
I look pretty, right?

914
01:04:24,137 --> 01:04:26,807
Yes, you are even more beautiful than the flower.

915
01:04:31,847 --> 01:04:32,918
Gyesoo Clinic is...

916
01:04:33,488 --> 01:04:36,358
her home now. She considers Physician Gye her son...

917
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:38,488
and her family.

918
01:04:39,157 --> 01:04:40,157
Yes, I suppose.

919
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:42,557
She refused to stay at her son's mansion...

920
01:04:42,898 --> 01:04:44,898
to go back to Gyesoo Clinic.

921
01:04:48,028 --> 01:04:49,537
Poong!

922
01:04:50,867 --> 01:04:52,637
Poong!

923
01:04:53,508 --> 01:04:55,137
Poong!

924
01:04:58,977 --> 01:05:00,148
From now on,

925
01:05:01,108 --> 01:05:02,117
my name is Poong.

926
01:05:03,218 --> 01:05:04,947
I am Yoo Se Poong from now on.

927
01:05:05,918 --> 01:05:08,657
Poong!

928
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:10,958
Poong.

929
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:12,458
A name is just a name after all.

930
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:15,227
If I can be of help to someone,

931
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:17,927
I do not care what people call me.

932
01:05:21,738 --> 01:05:23,568
Poong!

933
01:05:49,398 --> 01:05:51,298
Are you sure you do not want to join me, my lady?

934
01:05:52,968 --> 01:05:55,597
We can pack together when we get back.

935
01:05:56,697 --> 01:05:59,338
You can go straight home from there.

936
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:00,867
I can pack.

937
01:06:01,537 --> 01:06:02,677
But still.

938
01:06:02,778 --> 01:06:03,938
Just do that.

939
01:06:03,938 --> 01:06:06,148
Hurry! We are leaving.

940
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:09,077
Get going.

941
01:06:11,048 --> 01:06:12,887
Well, I will not be long.

942
01:06:29,997 --> 01:06:32,067
Hello, are you there?

943
01:06:45,018 --> 01:06:46,487
- My gosh!
- Look at this!

944
01:06:46,487 --> 01:06:48,317
Look. Oh, my!

945
01:06:48,317 --> 01:06:50,187
- What is that?
- Let us find out.

946
01:06:50,187 --> 01:06:52,088
- Come on, hurry.
- How beautiful!

947
01:06:52,088 --> 01:06:53,987
- My gosh.
- Look at that!

948
01:07:02,598 --> 01:07:05,338
- How beautiful.
- This is amazing.

949
01:07:06,737 --> 01:07:09,537
- Hey!
- Come on, quick.

950
01:07:09,678 --> 01:07:10,678
Look, over there.

951
01:07:16,718 --> 01:07:19,418
Is that truly what all women are like?

952
01:07:19,418 --> 01:07:20,888
- My gosh!
- Pour me some more!

953
01:07:20,888 --> 01:07:22,287
My goodness.

954
01:07:23,258 --> 01:07:26,187
No, not all.

955
01:07:26,428 --> 01:07:28,997
In any case, there are so many people here.

956
01:07:28,997 --> 01:07:30,527
How are we going to find Dan here?

957
01:07:31,397 --> 01:07:32,468
I am not sure.

958
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:33,867
If she has no money on her,

959
01:07:33,867 --> 01:07:35,737
she cannot even buy anything.

960
01:07:37,338 --> 01:07:39,268
I am surprised she forgot to take her money.

961
01:07:40,237 --> 01:07:42,237
Is Lady Seo not going with you?

962
01:07:42,237 --> 01:07:43,537
She wishes to stay and pack.

963
01:07:48,718 --> 01:07:49,718
By any chance,

964
01:07:50,018 --> 01:07:52,287
may I borrow your money pouch?

965
01:07:53,048 --> 01:07:54,187
This? Why?

966
01:07:55,487 --> 01:07:56,487
Oh, be careful.

967
01:07:57,458 --> 01:07:58,458
Let us look for her.

968
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:04,058
(Fortune-teller)

969
01:08:05,867 --> 01:08:08,937
My gosh. Look at you, beautiful ladies.

970
01:08:08,937 --> 01:08:10,867
I should give you a discount.

971
01:08:11,697 --> 01:08:14,008
Who would like to go first?

972
01:08:17,878 --> 01:08:21,407
Oh, my. Thank goodness you are a woman.

973
01:08:21,407 --> 01:08:22,478
If you were born a man,

974
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:25,588
both your career and finances... My goodness.

975
01:08:25,588 --> 01:08:27,918
You would have lost everything this year.

976
01:08:28,247 --> 01:08:31,487
Oh! You will meet your soul mate next year,

977
01:08:31,487 --> 01:08:33,487
get married, and live happily ever after.

978
01:08:33,687 --> 01:08:36,058
Your husband is very handsome.

979
01:08:37,027 --> 01:08:40,668
My lady, you have a great life ahead of you.

980
01:08:45,537 --> 01:08:48,508
Lady Seo, this norigae will look good on you.

981
01:08:50,478 --> 01:08:51,478
What about this binyeo?

982
01:08:52,107 --> 01:08:53,308
The color suits you.

983
01:08:55,647 --> 01:08:58,247
- Have you ever...
- My goodness!

984
01:08:58,247 --> 01:09:01,287
- Let me see.
- I cannot believe this.

985
01:09:01,518 --> 01:09:02,687
Goodness me.

986
01:09:10,157 --> 01:09:11,897
That... That is good.

987
01:09:21,468 --> 01:09:23,508
Let us get on that.

988
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:25,478
The swing?

989
01:09:26,147 --> 01:09:27,647
That is unnecessary...

990
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:29,817
No, I mean me.

991
01:09:30,418 --> 01:09:32,088
I have wanted to be on one, you see.

992
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:35,418
When will I ever get another chance like this?

993
01:09:44,298 --> 01:09:45,697
Why are you just standing there?

994
01:09:47,327 --> 01:09:48,737
Please give me a push.

995
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:51,338
Right.

996
01:09:52,008 --> 01:09:53,037
Good.

997
01:10:02,577 --> 01:10:03,577
Goodness.

998
01:10:31,338 --> 01:10:33,147
I cannot believe that only the ladies...

999
01:10:33,147 --> 01:10:34,878
have been allowed to enjoy what is an absolute joy.

1000
01:11:25,628 --> 01:11:27,728
Do you know how much you have been laughing tonight?

1001
01:11:30,298 --> 01:11:31,497
Please keep on doing so.

1002
01:11:32,407 --> 01:11:35,168
Those who do not smile seem angry at the world.

1003
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:45,348
- Yes!
- Hey, wait for us!

1004
01:11:56,357 --> 01:11:57,428
Eun Woo.

1005
01:12:00,598 --> 01:12:01,968
Sin Woo.

1006
01:12:29,497 --> 01:12:31,058
Find the man named Yoo Se Yeob.

1007
01:12:31,258 --> 01:12:33,598
There is someone you must find. His name is Yoo Se Yeob.

1008
01:12:33,598 --> 01:12:36,168
Why are you wasting time when he only requires acupuncture?

1009
01:12:36,168 --> 01:12:37,237
Move!

1010
01:12:37,897 --> 01:12:40,808
I will gather knowledge from every medical textbook I know...

1011
01:12:40,808 --> 01:12:42,808
and cure all the patients I see.

1012
01:12:42,808 --> 01:12:45,077
Gumiho is rumored to have returned last night,

1013
01:12:45,077 --> 01:12:46,178
so please stay safe.

1014
01:12:46,478 --> 01:12:48,878
Another murder took place.

1015
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:52,247
As a maiden, I used to assist at the Autopsy Office.

1016
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:53,718
You personally examined bodies?

1017
01:12:54,018 --> 01:12:55,987
Does the murder not seem intentional to you?

1018
01:12:59,487 --> 01:13:00,558
Did you hear that?

1019
01:13:02,339 --> 01:13:07,669
Ripped and resynced by YoungJedi
