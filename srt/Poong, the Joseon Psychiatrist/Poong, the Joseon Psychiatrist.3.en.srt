I heard the Second State Councilor adopted you.

What are you doing here?

12

What are you doing out this late?

00:01:35,122 --> 00:01:36,322
And who is he?

14
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:42,363
Oh, he is a village physician.

15
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:43,962
A physician?

16
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:46,803
What is wrong? Are you unwell?

17
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:48,872
I am fine now.

18
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:56,372
She married into the Cheongsong Lee clan.

19
00:01:56,843 --> 00:01:59,182
If someone were to see her out late with a man,

20
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:00,813
she could get into trouble.

21
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,682
So be very cautious.

22
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:07,583
What trouble could come of a physician accompanying a patient?

23
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:10,622
You could cause gossip!

24
00:02:11,393 --> 00:02:13,723
If I were to ignore a patient for fear of gossip,

25
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:15,733
what a dreadful physician I would be.

26
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:25,503
I will get going, then.

27
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:03,543
How do you know the angry nobleman?

28
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:06,682
My father was once his teacher.

29
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:08,983
Were you offended?

30
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:13,722
If he spoke that way for you, out of concern, I do not mind.

31
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:32,996
Did you hear that?

32
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:34,395
Yes.

33
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:36,466
I must check what it was.

34
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:37,936
In person, you mean?

35
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:44,436
Physician Yoo. Did you just see that white thing fly by?

36
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:48,575
I am sure it was a wide animal.

37
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:50,876
It must have been.

38
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:54,885
There used to be white deer and white sable,

39

No, right?

- Gumiho?

77
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:58,936
Gumiho killed someone in Mount Sorak...

78

and took the liver again.

79

The same gumiho from last year?

80
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,176
But I thought they had already caught the culprit.

81
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:07,806
Another murder has occurred.

82
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:10,976
Chil Sung actually stopped by early in the morning...

83
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:13,275
to tell me they needed help with the autopsy.

84
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:16,186
I have to send someone.

85
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:29,025
Yes! You, dunce. You should go.

86
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,825
You cannot even administer acupuncture anyway.

87
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,366
A physician's job differs...

88

from that of a pathologist's and prosecutor's.

89

Why must I go there?

90
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:41,606
They do not send pathologists to a small rural village like this.

91
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:43,606
Local physicians are expected to help out!

92
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:45,116
Yes, I understand.

93
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,116
Lady Seo.

94
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:49,416
Were you working on the farm early in the morning?

95
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,056
My gosh.

96
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:00,595
You are eating faster and more than he is.

97
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:01,825
Oh, this hurts my pride.

98
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:06,195
When it comes to eating, I have never let anyone beat me.

99
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:09,135
When I am thinking about something,

100
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:10,606
I eat nonstop.

101
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:12,275
This is very delicious.

102
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:31,385
Are you still bothered by what you saw in the woods last night?

103
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:35,996
Yes, a similar case took place last year.

104
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:39,866
It was a murder made to look as if a gumiho had killed the victim.

105
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:44,705
But earlier, they said the culprit had already been caught.

106
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,405
Yes, already caught and punished.

107
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:47,905
That is the problem.

108
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:51,046
People might accuse my father of a faulty investigation.

109
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:53,116
I am certain that he will be in a pickle.

110
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:58,556
By the way, how come you know so much about it?

111
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:00,756
Oh.

112
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:05,155
As a maiden, I used to assist at the Autopsy Office.

113
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,496
Is that so? You personally examined bodies?

114
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:13,435
Then please come with me.

115
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:16,966
You must remember the details of the investigation.

116
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:21,206
But if I go to the office,

117
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:23,376
people may gossip.

118
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:28,285
I am certain that it will help the district governor.

119
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:37,756
I am aware that you know a lot about the case,

120
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:40,655
but you cannot be seen here.

121
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:42,626
Take a quick look and leave.

122
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:43,966
Yes.

123
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:46,996
Physician Yoo, you need to see this.

124
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:48,866
Oh, dear.

125
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,135
This is different from last year's case.

126
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:54,476
Both corpses are missing their livers.

127
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,746
But last year, the wound was a straight line.

128
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:59,216
And the cut was not caused by a sharp edge.

129
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:01,045
The culprit was a woodcutter.

130
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:03,246
He used his ax to kill the victim,

131
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:06,086
and the edges looked rugged because of the dull blade.

132
00:10:06,216 --> 00:10:08,555
Then do you think this is another murder...

133
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:09,826
made to look like a gumiho incident?

134
00:10:13,456 --> 00:10:16,025
Yes. This was not done on impulse.

135
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:17,895
I believe it was planned thoroughly in advance.

136
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:21,336
The culprit is highly intelligent and knowledgeable.

137
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:24,866
It must be someone who harbors a grudge against you or the victim.

138
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:28,746
I am truly impressed, Lady Seo.

139
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:31,106
Have you managed to identify the victim yet?

140
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:33,716
There is no identification tag, and the face has been damaged.

141
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,486
I believe it will take some time.

142
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:38,956
The type of knife that butchers use...

143
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:40,486
was found near the body.

144
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:42,385
The constables are searching the village to find the owner.

145
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:46,425
Sir, we have a problem.

146
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:48,696
The royal inspector from Hanyang is here.

147
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:49,925
And...

148
00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:52,366
Commander Im is here too.

149
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:55,805
If Commander Im finds out that you are here,

150
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:57,265
he will not let it slide.

151
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,006
Prepare for a meeting.

152
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,006
Yes, sir.

153
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:04,246
Gosh, seriously! Move!

Governor Seo, are you here?

00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:08,315
I am coming in.

156
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,515
This is where we perform autopsies.

157
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,726
You cannot come in here.

158
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:19,256
Another gumiho incident has occurred.

159
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:22,826
It means that the person you caught was not the real culprit.

160
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:25,496
You did a terrible job with the investigation,

161
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:29,305
so you should not be in charge of this case.

162
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:31,466
Please come in.

163
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:34,876
Sin Woo.

164
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:37,376
How dare you. He is the royal inspector...

165
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:39,415
who is here on His Majesty's orders.

166
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:41,315
Be polite!

167
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:49,326
I am here as a royal inspector.

168
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:52,555
An incident took place before I could formally introduce myself,

169
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:54,155
so let us skip the formalities.

170
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:56,525
Please give me access to all the records.

171
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:58,196
I will.

172
00:11:58,366 --> 00:11:59,736
The corpse is here,

173
00:12:00,196 --> 00:12:01,295
so let us leave this room.

174
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,476
After you.

175
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:25,025
By the way, why did you...

176
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:26,696
hide?

177
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:28,996
I wonder too.

178
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:35,135
Why was the knife left at the scene when it was the murder weapon?

179
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:36,935
Was it a mistake?

180
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:40,876
It is suspicious that the knife looks barely used.

181
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:44,106
How have you been?

182
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,315
My sister-in-law.

183
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,456
What brings you here?

184
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:01,626
Oh, I happened to be just walking by.

185
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,295
My brother's memorial ceremony is around the corner.

186
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:09,765
I suppose you are still not well enough yet.

187
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:14,635
I will explain your situation to Mother.

188
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:18,246
Please focus on your recovery.

189
00:13:20,846 --> 00:13:22,116
I will do my best to treat her.

190
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:24,986
Let us go.

191
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:42,165
How come this is all you have?

192
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:45,606
We lost most of the investigation records in a fire...

193
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:48,175
while transporting them, so that is all we have left.

194
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:49,905
What a mess.

195
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,015
In any case, we have a new case now.

196
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:56,846
Hence, the man you caught last year, Kim Dol Seok,

197
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,515
is innocent. Am I wrong?

198
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:01,685
We cannot assume that this is the same case.

199
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:03,285
We are still investigating it.

200
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,356
Governor, I am appalled...

201
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:08,596
that you did such a clumsy job with the investigation.

202
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:18,035
All is well with the Second State Councilor, right?

203
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:22,376
Wherever I am and whatever I do,

204
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:24,976
I always wish him good fortune.

205
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,946
I need you to visit your hometown for a short while.

206
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:30,385
Is there something you need me to do?

207
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,015
Go there...

208
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:35,185
and find the man named Yoo Se Yeob.

209
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:40,555
Let me know when you find him.

210
00:14:41,226 --> 00:14:42,425
And just watch him.

211
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,635
I need you to find someone for me.

212
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:47,966
Sure thing.

213
00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:50,836
Just tell me who it is. I will go now and...

214
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:51,935
Yoo Se Yeob.

215
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:54,535
Age, 27.

216
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:56,175
A former physician in the Medical Office.

217
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:58,246
People call him the Divine Needle because of his acupuncture skills.

218
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:01,515
Would that be enough for you to find him?

219
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,315
I know this village...

220
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:07,116
like the back of my hand. I even know how many dogs...

221
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,655
each household owns.

222
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,226
I will look into it immediately.

223
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:11,525
The faster, the better.

224
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:12,525
Understood.

225
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,966
Hey, keep to the left!

226
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:20,665
Goodness. I should be riding in a palanquin with gold rims.

227
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:22,366
That would look much better.

228
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:25,006
He is not the Second State Councilor's real son.

229
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:26,935
He is an adopted son,

230
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:28,006
yet he is still so arrogant.

231
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,805
No, I should not say that.

232
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:33,515
If I wish to use this to my advantage,

233
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,145
I should fawn over him.

234
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:39,486
Keep to the right!

235
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:41,515
You fools. Get a grip!

236
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:43,586
My goodness.

237
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:45,826
Take me to Gyesoo Clinic first!

238
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,496
- Gosh.
- What is all this?

239
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:50,496
Hey, move.

240
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:52,395
- Oh, Physician Gye is here.
- My gosh!

241
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:54,565
Everyone, form a line!

242
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:56,535
- Hello, Physician Gye.
- Women on this side.

243
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:58,035
If you are injured, stand over here!

244
00:15:58,035 --> 00:15:59,506
- My gosh.
- Where is everyone?

245
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:01,275
- Jang Gun!
- I am in so much pain.

246
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:02,275
Ip Bun!

247
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:03,805
- My gosh.
- Good grief.

248
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:04,805
My stomach...

249
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:06,645
Oh, gosh.

250
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:16,126
Darn it.

251
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:21,696
What do you think you are doing?

252
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:24,525
I am treating the patient with garlic moxibustion.

253
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,236
As if I did not know that.

254
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:28,535
This treatment takes days...

255
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:30,635
and a number of physicians to complete.

256
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:32,175
We do not have time for this!

257
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:35,175
Anyone persistent enough can manage it alone.

258
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:37,846
That was the first batch. Two more and...

259
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:39,246
Are you willing to stay up all night?

260
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:41,145
Am I supposed to see all those patients myself?

261
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:42,645
Ip Bun, clean this up!

262
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:44,685
Father, Physician Yoo is trying to be helpful...

263
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:46,116
by performing treatments other than acupuncture.

264
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:47,986
We should be supportive.

265
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:51,055
You have both lost your mind.

266
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:54,025
I will treat him with acupuncture, so clean this mess!

267
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:55,726
Like I said, he needs two more batches.

268
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:56,826
Please have patience.

269
00:16:58,326 --> 00:16:59,565
What has gotten into you?

270
00:16:59,836 --> 00:17:03,035
Is this your idea of a rebellion?

271
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,035
All he has is an upset stomach.

272
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:08,006
Why are you wasting time on him when all he needs is acupuncture?

273
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:10,206
As you know, acupuncture is not an option for me.

274
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:13,175
In order to eliminate the cause of his illness,

275
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:15,385
I am meticulously looking into his condition.

276
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:21,856
All right, fine. Say that I agree with you for now.

277
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:24,486
What is with this prescription? This is not the Medical Office.

278
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,256
Our patients are not government officials.

279
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:28,425
Musk, agilawood, burdock, deer antlers,

280
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:30,096
a rhinoceros' horn, among others.

281
00:17:30,826 --> 00:17:33,395
Is this your idea of a joke?

282
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:36,406
These medicinal ingredients and expensive herbs.

283
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:38,166
And loranthaceae is hard to obtain!

284
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,406
Jang Gun and Man Bok went to collect them.

285
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,305
From this moment on, I will gather all I know...

286
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,515
from medical texts and treat my patients.

287
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:47,676
Why you...

288
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,246
Move!

289
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,416
What is this ruckus?

290
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:53,916
Has a fire erupted at this house?

291
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,355
You there. Gye Ji Han.

292
00:17:56,986 --> 00:18:00,125
The crackpot is still in the business of curing the sick.

293
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:01,426
Halt!

294
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,595
How dare you crawl in here.

295
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:05,936
I walked in here rather than crawling.

296
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:08,095
This land of good value...

297
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:10,466
is home to a tattered clinic.

298
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,105
If I was put in charge,

299
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:15,406
I would have built a chateau grander than the one over there.

300
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:18,305
You and your mindless words. Get off the property!

301
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:20,146
Not so fast.

302
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:22,746
I heard that the clinic welcomed a new physician.

303
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:23,815
Is that him?

304
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:26,555
Mind your own business and leave!

305
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:32,125
If you cannot perform acupuncture, be good at bringing in business.

306
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,295
Do something that will benefit the clinic.

307
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:35,926
I will try.

308
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,095
You will try?

309
00:18:37,996 --> 00:18:39,035
Move!

310
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:41,396
- You... Move.
- Father, please.

311
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:43,835
Let go of me, darn it.

312
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,365
Let go!

313
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:47,476
A physician who cannot perform acupuncture?

314
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:51,906
- Move!
- Poong!

315
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:54,075
- You...
- Leave my Poong alone.

316
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:55,916
- Poong?
- Granny!

317
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,785
- Leave my Poong alone.
- Move.

318
00:18:57,785 --> 00:19:00,216
- Stop this.
- This requires more time.

319
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:03,156
- You three...
- I guess it cannot be him.

320
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:06,295
Where did he find a useless dunce like him?

321
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,426
Let go!

322
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,825
Of course everything you do is below average.

323
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,535
- Goodness.
- Ji Han, stop!

324
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:31,216
Why do you think...

325
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:34,386
that Physician Gye seeks out wealthy patients...

326
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,055
and has them pay the full price for their treatments?

327
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:40,496
Well...

328
00:19:41,456 --> 00:19:42,666
Probably to fund his drinking habits.

329
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:48,196
Three napa cabbages, five radishes,

330
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:50,906
two fishes, and one zucchini.

331
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,746
What are these?

332
00:19:57,746 --> 00:19:59,416
This is what he made by seeing patients today...

333
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,916
as there were not any from noble families.

334
00:20:04,716 --> 00:20:08,386
Physician Gye is the Robin Hood of this village.

335
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:13,426
He only receives payment from noble families, you see.

336
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:17,666
Patients left these behind as a token of their appreciation.

337
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,746
What did you tuck away in a hurry?

338
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:38,146
What? Nothing, of course.

339
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:41,386
What do you mean it is nothing?

340
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,355
("Forensic Medicine")

341
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,726
"Forensic Medicine"?

342
00:20:48,025 --> 00:20:49,065
Right.

343
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:53,396
So this book is about...

344
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:17,956
When one is strangled...

345
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:21,325
compared to when one hangs himself,

346
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,865
the mark left on the neck is different.

347
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:27,595
Right, of course.

348
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:30,466
In "Forensic Medicine,"

349
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:33,375
such findings are described in detail.

350
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:39,916
Is it not scary to read this at this late hour?

351
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,285
I am used to it...

352
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:45,115
thanks to the autopsies...

353
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:46,156
I have performed since a young age.

354
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:50,456
I noticed this the other day,

355
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:52,795
but you are not scared easily.

356
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,896
As for me, the sight of dead bodies...

357
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,125
All you have to do is cure the living.

358
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:02,666
I am afraid that has not been a specialty of mine these days.

359
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:10,946
- It is the Gumiho.
- The Gumiho is here.

360
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:13,916
- The Gumiho.
- It is the Gumiho!

361
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,686
- Please.
- Help!

362
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:18,146
- Run!
- Run from the Gumiho.

363
00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:20,456
- Come on.
- Run, everyone!

364
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,186
- Keep going.
- Run.

365
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:24,825
- It is the Gumiho.
- Keep running.

366
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:27,256
- I saw it.
- It killed again.

367
00:22:28,156 --> 00:22:30,896
It is the Gumiho and it has killed yet again.

368
00:22:59,396 --> 00:23:01,256
Who are you? Identify yourself.

369
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,466
After questioning those at the market,

370
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:13,676
we confirmed it with his family.

371
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,305
He has been identified as Deputy Magistrate Choi Yoon.

372
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,275
He was also reported missing.

373
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:23,386
And this man is scholar Min Yu Kyum, one of Choi Yoon's pupils.

374
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:25,146
He frequently came by the clinic.

375
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,416
Here is where I stitched him up last year.

376
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:30,525
The pupil of a deputy magistrate?

377
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:32,525
These killings seem intentional to me.

378
00:23:32,726 --> 00:23:35,226
But the killer was apprehended at the scene.

379
00:23:35,525 --> 00:23:38,896
How could a young girl have killed a man twice her size?

380
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:40,535
Lady Seo is correct.

381
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,166
The girl's name is Yeon Hee,

382
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,406
and she is the daughter of a single father who is a butcher.

383
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:45,906
She has an illness.

384
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:48,506
She does not have it in her to kill anyone.

385
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:50,476
An illness?

386
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:51,845
Yes, sleepwalking.

387
00:23:52,075 --> 00:23:53,615
Those who suffer from it...

388
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:55,345
walk around in their sleep and are unaware of it the next day.

389
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:59,256
Even if what you say is true, the knife found at the scene...

390
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:02,115
is one used by butchers. The evidence says it all.

391
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,926
You yourself said she is the daughter of one.

392
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:16,206
Are you the one known as Gumiho?

393
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:22,335
Why you... How dare you keep silent.

394
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:23,976
Answer him immediately!

395
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:27,916
I... Well, I...

396
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:29,285
Answer me.

397
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,115
Are you the one known as Gumiho?

398
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:35,156
I...

399
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:39,726
Yes, it seems as though I am, my lord.

400
00:24:42,456 --> 00:24:44,396
You will be admitting to murder.

401
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,696
Carefully rethink your answer.

402
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,736
Killing him was not my intention.

403
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:55,775
However,

404
00:24:58,105 --> 00:25:00,275
I think it was I who killed him.

405
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:07,486
With your fragile build?

406
00:25:07,785 --> 00:25:09,956
How could you have killed two men twice your size?

407
00:25:10,486 --> 00:25:14,025
That I do not remember.

408
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:16,365
We have enough witnesses who saw you wandering...

409
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:18,125
around Sorak Pass at night.

410
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:19,835
Speak the truth!

411
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:25,065
This knife.

412
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:29,246
Does it not belong to your father?

413
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:31,146
Speak the truth!

414
00:25:37,815 --> 00:25:38,815
Yeon Hee.

415
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:40,716
How dare she.

416
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:42,285
Please come to.

417
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,625
The commotion outside had her...

418
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,726
asking for you.

419
00:25:53,535 --> 00:25:56,365
Everything is all right now, so please get some sleep.

420
00:25:57,206 --> 00:26:00,476
There was someone. A man.

421
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:05,406
Not anymore. You are safe.

422
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:08,246
Granny, stop gibbering now.

423
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,986
Physician Yoo is here, so please go to bed.

424
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:13,756
Right.

425
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:16,456
I am scared, Poong.

426
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:24,865
Go to sleep.

427
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:27,095
Then...

428
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:29,765
watch Granny for me.

429
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:34,706
For me.

430
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:50,186
Watch out.

431
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:00,236
Written prescriptions. We have 7,870.

432
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,535
Patient records. We have 18,082.

433
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:04,966
Well done.

434
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:07,805
Now let us put them in alphabetical order.

435
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:08,805
Okay.

436
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:11,375
Back when you cared for no one.

437
00:27:11,676 --> 00:27:14,476
I preferred things much better then.

438
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:17,716
Even now, no physician has as much knowledge as I.

439
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,615
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

440
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:24,426
Why are you doing extra work for yourself?

441
00:27:24,886 --> 00:27:28,025
I am testing myself to see if I should remain a physician.

442
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:31,666
It will take you days to read all 18,082 records.

443
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:36,535
Why not just shut your eyes and stab a needle?

444
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:38,506
Would I be doing this if it were that easy?

445
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:39,906
Oh, my gosh.

446
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:42,676
Thank you, Jang Gun.

447
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:49,615
Physician Gye prescribes tonics made with just one ingredient.

448
00:27:49,615 --> 00:27:50,615
Correct.

449
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:54,085
Physician Gye often prescribes a tonic that contains...

450
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:55,815
just one or two herbs.

451
00:27:56,956 --> 00:27:58,686
This will keep you up all night.

452
00:28:01,095 --> 00:28:03,865
Why are you up working so late?

453
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:05,696
Shall I cook you a snack?

454
00:28:09,765 --> 00:28:10,765
Not for us.

455
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:14,335
Oh, dear. We just had a lot of something to eat.

456
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:15,535
So we are full.

457
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:18,575
There was nothing to eat at all. What did you have?

458
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:19,946
We had...

459
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:23,015
- Sweet potatoes.
- Chestnuts.

460
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:29,186
- Chestnuts.
- Sweet...

461
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,226
You can cook...

462
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:37,926
A stupid mosquito does not know when it is not welcome.

463
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:44,406
You had a long day assisting me.

464
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:46,406
You should get some rest.

465
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:51,246
Okay.

466
00:29:02,926 --> 00:29:03,926
Hey, you!

467
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,956
I sent you ahead to look after Granny.

468
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:07,625
What are you wasting your time on now?

469
00:29:09,196 --> 00:29:11,325
You said the girl was your patient.

470
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:12,625
She is a sleepwalker?

471
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:14,565
Yes.

472
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:17,166
She walks about at night because of her illness.

473
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:19,166
And that makes her look guilty.

474
00:29:19,365 --> 00:29:21,506
The investigation is a load of nonsense.

475
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,375
Is there nothing we can do?

476
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,716
We are not utterly out of options.

477
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,801
We might lose her.

478
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:06,291
Yeon Hee.

479
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,430
Yeon Hee.

480
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,981
I must take her to the clinic.

481
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,420
You cannot.

482
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,451
She is a suspect in two murders who was caught red-handed.

483
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:36,890
It is just a symptom of her sleepwalking.

484
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,221
She should be treated,

485
00:31:38,221 --> 00:31:39,590
not framed for murder.

486
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:42,160
You dare try to lecture me when you are...

487
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,430
merely a village physician?

488
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:46,301
I once worked at the Medical Office.

489
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:51,670
Did you not follow her this far because you yourself...

490
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,941
did not believe she could have killed two grown men?

491
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:57,011
However, the law still stands.

492
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:59,680
This girl should be taken back to her cell.

493
00:32:00,811 --> 00:32:03,481
Oh, Royal Inspector, sir!

494
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:09,761
Did this fool cause you trouble?

495
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,590
Revealing the truth is...

496
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,660
Silence.

497
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:18,531
My dunce of an apprentice has no idea how the world works.

498
00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:20,271
That is fine.

499
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,501
You truly are a man of great spirit.

500
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,670
And generous.

501
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:26,640
In that case...

502
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:30,311
If you must lock up Yeon Hee,

503
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:33,080
would you let me visit and treat her sporadically?

504
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,521
I cannot allow a criminal such a luxury.

505
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,150
Do not assume she is a...

506
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,150
Be quiet.

507
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,061
Yes, of course you are right, sir.

508
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,561
However,

509
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,160
based on my past examinations of her,

510
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,201
her heart is weak and liver and bowels stagnated.

511
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:53,771
A change in surroundings will sap her energy,

512
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,900
and it could threaten her life.

513
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,941
If she were to die even before you determined her guilt,

514
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:03,741
would that not make you look so dreadfully bad?

515
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,680
Is her health really that dire?

516
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:10,951
Yes, it is. Please allow me just 15 minutes a day...

517
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,551
to look in on and examine her.

Please save my Yeon Hee.

Get off your knees and sit down.

00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,191
I meant to come and see you.

524

People think she is Gumiho.

525

You must be so flustered.

526
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,561
You said that the way...

527
00:33:55,861 --> 00:33:57,700
she walked about at night...

528
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,870
was because she had a sickness.

529
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,341
Yes. She is sick.

530
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:04,700
She did not commit a crime.

531
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:08,811
Will you please tell the district governor that?

532
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:13,151
How could my Yeon Hee kill two men?

533
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,680
Physician Gye told you many times...

534
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,751
to lock her door at night because of her illness.

535
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,850
Why did you not that night?

536
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,160
That is what is driving me crazy.

537
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:24,760
It just so happened...

that her door got unlocked just that night.

539
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:30,561
It got unlocked just that night?

540
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:35,001
Did you not happen to lose a bleeding knife?

541
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:36,901
No, I did not.

542
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,800
I slaughter pigs for a living.

543
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,311
I could not do my job without my knives.

544
00:34:42,811 --> 00:34:43,811
Okay.

545
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,180
I understand.

546
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:49,211
Do not cause a scene here. Go home.

547
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,151
I will help as best I can.

548
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:52,821
Get up and go home.

549
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,361
Could you speak to Yeon Hee?

550
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,731
She could have seen something.

551
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
You.

552
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,930
Do not try to do anything pointless.

553
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:12,970
Fine. You want me to focus on doing what will make us money.

554
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,571
As if you would do as I say.

555
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:18,041
I will make money as that is my specialty.

556
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,850
Do not disturb me.

557
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:22,580
Find a medical textbook we can use to save Yeon Hee.

558
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:25,780
You are not allowed to do anything else.

559
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:28,890
Fine.

560
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:37,131
Yeon Hee, what did you do after you arrived at the forest?

561
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,501
I do not remember.

562
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,271
You said you saw me leave.

563
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,811
You left and ran toward the mountains.

564
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,280
Do you have no recollection of that either?

565
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,061
Be quiet, will you? My liver nearly popped out of my chest.

566
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,361
Well, if that happens,

567
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:14,830
Gumiho will happily come and collect your liver.

568
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,341
Anyway, why are you chopping firewood? It is not winter now.

569
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:22,981
Well, I am just trying to earn my keep.

570
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:26,180
I am not so shameless after all, you see.

571
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,751
If you want to earn your keep, go cut every tree in Mount Sorak.

572
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:31,720
My gosh!

573
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,321
Look at you two fooling around.

574
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:40,660
Jang Gun! What is the matter?

575
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,660
What is wrong? Are you okay?

576
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,901
Why? Did someone make fun of you again?

577
00:36:44,901 --> 00:36:47,131
Who is it? I will beat them up to a pulp.

578
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:49,470
I will shred them to pieces.

Oh, you poor thing. That is why you are so sad.

He said he would take me there and show me again.

He said we would go see sables together next time.

Is that true?

587

He promised to show you the sables?

588
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,381
He said...

589
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:35,981
we would be able to see sables playing all over the mountain...

590
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,120
if we caught...

but I am so scared.

595

Do not worry. Just sleep.

596
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,751
You took the herbal tonic and received acupuncture too,

597
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:42,910
so you will be fine.

598

Darn it. Maybe the real culprit is someone else.

Yes, it is someone else.

600
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,941
I found out that Deputy Magistrate Choi...

601
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:07,571
was after people...

602
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:10,111
who poached sables and deer that were meant for the King.

603
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,881
I checked the record that he had reported to the royal court.

604
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,680
Then do you know who those people are?

605
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:19,381
No, not yet.

606
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,961
I believe he was murdered right before he could uncover the truth.

607
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:26,760
Oh, dear. They stole such rare animals...

608
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,760
that should have been sent to the palace.

609
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,361
If they sold those, they could easily buy several houses.

610
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:33,271
How brazen.

611
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:36,271
Yes. It was certainly done with bad intentions.

612
00:39:37,171 --> 00:39:38,671
I swear, it was not Yeon Hee.

613

A goblin! I saw a goblin!

- Yeon Hee.
- A goblin!

Yeon Hee, get up.

616
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,350
A goblin holding a knife.

617
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,890
The goblin...

618
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,961
shot a star down from a tree.

619
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,401
I am so scared.

620
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,171
I am terrified.

621
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,441
What does that mean?

622
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,881
Yeon Hee...

623
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:26,921
Yeon Hee must have seen the culprit.

624
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,461
Thank you.

625
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,300
Yeon Hee.

626
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,441
What did the goblin look like?

627
00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:49,211
Apricot blossom.

628
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:54,811
A red apricot flower.

629
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,850
What does that mean?

630
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,021
She definitely saw something.

631
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:03,760
I should visit the scene again.

632
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,091
Okay, hurry.

633
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,731
I will tidy up here.

634
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,271
The corpse was found here.

635
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,941
A goblin shot a star down from a tree?

636
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,890
That tree is too far.

637
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:36,390
I mean, to stab someone.

638
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,910
We were fixated on the knife, and that was a mistake.

639
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,881
The culprit left the knife there on purpose.

640
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,680
The victim was shot with an arrow.

641
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,220
Then there must be traces left on the body.

642
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,191
Yes, you are right.

643
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:13,160
This is it.

644
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:15,660
Right here.

645
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,561
The arrow.

646
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:23,071
It is the willow leaf arrow.

647
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:27,910
The arrowhead hit the bone and broke.

648
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,010
And it was left in the body.

649
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,350
Then someone shot him with an arrow from a tree,

650
00:42:37,481 --> 00:42:39,021
concealed the arrow,

651
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:41,421
and intentionally left the knife at the scene.

652
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:45,760
Correct. Based on the depth of the wound and the distance...

653
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,760
A heavy bow was used.

654
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,030
It was not a hunter.

655
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,001
It is a military test strength bow.

656
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,100
How do you know all this?

657
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:00,271
The patient records.

658
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,541
I must view the patient records.

659
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,151
Here, drink up.

660
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,421
Jang Gun. You remember the day when Yeon Hee was here, right?

661
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,291
Can you find the records of the patients who were here that day?

662
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:19,260
Yes, easy-peasy.

663
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,191
Vomiting and diarrhea, age 17.

664
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,990
Coughing, age 46.

665
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,330
Age 20, fell from a tree. Lumbar pain.

666
00:43:57,461 --> 00:43:59,030
Alcoholic jaundice, age 35.

667
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:03,131
They were all here on the same day.

668
00:44:03,571 --> 00:44:04,841
Jang Gun...

669
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:07,910
picked out these patients because he had memorized all of them?

670
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:09,841
Only Jang Gun can do this.

671
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,780
Thank you.

672
00:44:11,841 --> 00:44:13,910
Jang Gun is even smarter than my young master.

673
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,410
Yeon Hee is not the culprit.

674
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,321
However, the incidents only occurred...

675
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:20,421
on the nights when she was out sleepwalking.

676
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,450
Do you think it was a coincidence?

677
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,490
Do not ask us. Get straight to the point.

678
00:44:24,691 --> 00:44:27,530
Someone who knew that she often sleepwalked...

679
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,731
framed her so they could get away with it.

680
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:32,100
Yes, exactly.

681
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,901
Who knows about her condition?

682
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:37,901
Yeon Hee's father is her only family.

683
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,541
So aside from us, her father is the only person who knows.

684
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:44,180
Then the culprit must be one of the patients...

685
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,240
who were here on the day you treated her.

686
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,680
You have a loud voice, so someone must have heard you.

687
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,280
The door must be locked from the outside. Do you understand?

688
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,591
You are saying something that makes sense, for a change.

689
00:44:59,691 --> 00:45:02,430
My young master is incredibly smart.

690
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:06,970
These are the records of the patients...

691
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,631
who were here on the same day.

692
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:10,470

(Alcoholic jaundice, age 35)

697
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,611
Mr. Lumbar Pain.

698
00:45:19,611 --> 00:45:20,811
He cannot have done it since he can barely move.

699
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,010
(Ruled out)

700
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,080
The one with chest pain is over 70.

701
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,751
He lacks the strength to shoot an arrow.

702
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,720
The other two cannot move without the help of another,

703
00:45:30,921 --> 00:45:32,091
and one is a child.

704
00:45:32,691 --> 00:45:33,691
Then,

705
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,131
that leaves us with one person.

706
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:45,401
He is someone we know.

707
00:45:50,111 --> 00:45:51,111
This man.

708
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,680
A red apricot flower.

709
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:05,620
I will explain your situation to Mother.

710
00:46:05,821 --> 00:46:08,160
- Please focus on your recovery.
- His scar does look...

711
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:11,231
like an apricot flower.

712
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:20,341
District Governor Seo must be frantically searching for evidence.

713
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,811
What if I get caught?

714
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,180
Would I not be served capital punishment?

715
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:30,481
A true man should be more audacious.

716
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:32,521
How else do you expect to be in office?

717
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,191
Do you know who the Second State Councilor is?

718
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:40,490
Even if you were charged with treason and not murder,

719
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,461
he would be able to have you released.

720
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:49,370
In the event that you are caught,

721
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,271
all you need to do is keep your mouth shut.

722
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,041
Do so,

723
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,541
and you will be given a rank, not be painted as a killer.

724
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,640
Yes, my lord.

725
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:08,990
What could this be?

726
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:11,321
It is the piece of evidence...

727
00:47:11,321 --> 00:47:12,961
you have been so afraid of.

728
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:18,061
(Appeal)

729
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:19,901
It is the appeal that would have been served...

730
00:47:19,901 --> 00:47:22,370
by the arrogant Choi Yoon and his pupils.

731
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:23,740
How dare they.

732
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:26,870
Apparently, they had written both our names in there.

733
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:29,740
Sorak Village is in my hands, is it not?

734
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,481
Who cares if I caught a few martens?

735
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:35,280
Anyway, I could not inconvenience the Second State Councilor.

736
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:40,521
Of course, my lord.

737
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,921
What would this mean for my place among the ranks?

738
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:49,061
The Second State Councilor will bestow you with one when he can.

739
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,271
Now, let the appeal burn.

740
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,100
And continue...

741
00:47:57,771 --> 00:48:01,341
to bring me all the martens caught in Sorak Village.

742
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:05,541
I will have them secretly served to the Second State Councilor.

743
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,080
Gosh.

744
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:18,461
How sweet

745
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,390
Our evidence is insufficient.

746
00:48:23,731 --> 00:48:26,100
Yeon Hee's words are not enough to arrest him.

747
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,131
I found that evidence earlier.

748
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,370
The fragment of the arrow found in Deputy Magistrate Choi's body.

749
00:48:31,671 --> 00:48:33,370
All we need is the arrow itself.

750
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:36,071
As if he would still have it lying around.

751
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,640
I hope...

752
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:42,811
you did not do anything that could lead the investigation back to you.

753
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,050
Of course not.

754
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:56,930
My lord,

755
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,001
in order for this deal to be neatly wrapped up,

756
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,100
my sister-in-law must be taken care of.

757
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:06,671
What are you talking about?

758
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,240
She is the one who solved the Gumiho case...

759
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:11,041
last year.

760
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,850
She is highly audacious for a woman of nobility.

761
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:19,220
Even now, she has been digging for evidence regarding the case.

762
00:49:19,981 --> 00:49:22,390
District Governor Seo is your sister-in-law's father.

763
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:25,921
An in-law that is worse than your nemesis.

764
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,631
What do you need me to do?

765
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:03,131
Commander Im.

766
00:50:03,561 --> 00:50:05,001
What is it this time?

767
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,160
I, Im Soon Man,

768
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:08,600
as the commander of the town hall,

769
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:12,341
cannot allow the people to have corrupt morals.

770
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:13,541
What are you speaking of?

771
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:16,841
Your daughter, Lord Seo.

772
00:50:17,941 --> 00:50:20,881
Being a widow is nothing to be proud of.

773
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:23,510
She feigned her illness, left her husband's home,

774
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,080
and has been frolicking with random men.

775
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,251
Our traditions and customs are at risk of demoralization.

776
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:30,890
I apologize.

777
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,720
Once she regains her health...

778
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,530
The one who is currently ill is actually her mother-in-law!

779
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:37,930
Do you not agree?

780
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:40,600
Your daughter only does as she pleases...

781
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,041
because you have adapted the rules for her.

782
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:45,800
On top of that,

783
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:49,071
you failed to solve the Gumiho case in a timely fashion...

784
00:50:49,441 --> 00:50:51,680
which led to the death of two people.

785
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:55,510
If you do not send your daughter back to her mother-in-law,

786
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:58,080
I will report you to the royal court...

787
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,881
for dereliction of duty and corruption of morals.

788
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,821
What will it be?

789
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,361
I will return to my late husband's home,

790
00:51:13,901 --> 00:51:15,231
so please let this rest.

791
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:18,841
Eun Woo.

792
00:51:19,171 --> 00:51:20,171
Look here!

793
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:24,180
How can proper work be done at the office...

794
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:27,280
when you have a woman wandering the grounds?

795
00:51:29,311 --> 00:51:31,720
You ought to behave.

796
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,001
Are you sure you will be all right?

797
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:47,271
I was going to return once I recovered.

798
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:49,300
You are not the reason I am heading back there.

799
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,990
Lady Seo sure is admirable.

800
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:11,120
How could she return to the home of a murderer?

801
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,561
According to your records,

802
00:52:13,561 --> 00:52:15,961
members of her husband's family came by the clinic.

803
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,330
Am I right?

804
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:21,631
Then...

805
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,700
You knew.

806
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:25,441
Know what?

807
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:28,510
Do you go around telling your patients' secrets?

808
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,111
This is not the same.

809
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:31,910
You know how rough Lady Seo's life is.

810
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,381
And you were told to mind your own business.

811
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:37,850
Hastily treating symptoms can worsen patients' conditions.

812
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,321
We must await the right moment.

813
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:04,381
At least for today,

814
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:07,850
you will put in the effort of holding the rite alone.

815
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,180
A woman should have the decency...

816
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:14,350
to mourn for at least three years after her husband passes.

817
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,390
Even the most reckless wife...

818
00:53:17,521 --> 00:53:20,021
should show respect by cooking the food herself!

819
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:25,131
Mother, you should head back inside.

820
00:54:13,611 --> 00:54:15,680
My lady, you have a visitor.

821
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:01,010
Eun Woo.

822
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,170
What are you looking for?

823
00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:24,900
You should get rid of that habit...

824
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,911
of digging into other people's businesses.

825
00:55:30,141 --> 00:55:31,210
So,

826
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:35,751
did you find what you were looking for?

827
00:55:38,451 --> 00:55:39,481
Yes.

828
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,050
I found it.

829
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:46,121
But the truth is, I did not even have to look.

830
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:51,061
I found the deputy magistrate's letter of appeal you had hidden.

831
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,331
It mentions the names of the men who have stolen from the king.

832
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:03,371
Do not lie.

833
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,210
Why do you think I am lying?

834
00:56:07,311 --> 00:56:09,811
Because you destroyed it already? Is that it?

835
00:56:12,021 --> 00:56:14,521
I found an arrow tip in the deputy magistrate's body.

836
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:17,291
I found the corresponding piece in this house.

837
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:23,030
How dare a wench search the shrine?

838
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,840
If you die,

839
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,940
no one will be left to condemn me.

840
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:37,880
You are afraid, are you not?

841
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:40,010
The Ming Code says...

842
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:42,811
punishment for murder is execution at least. Too bad.

843
00:56:42,811 --> 00:56:43,920
You...

844
00:56:48,621 --> 00:56:51,690
I will send you to be with your husband.

845
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:54,661
On her husband's death anniversary,

846
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:57,231
the loyal widow takes her own life.

847
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:00,701
Is that not a beautiful story?

848
00:57:03,871 --> 00:57:05,070
Die.

849
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:13,880
Let go of her!

850
00:57:20,721 --> 00:57:21,820
Eun Woo.

851
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:26,490
Tie him up immediately.

852
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:27,590
Yes, sir.

853
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:43,840
You fool!

854
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,940
To cover up your crimes, you killed honest men...

855
00:57:47,481 --> 00:57:49,550
and almost killed an innocent child.

856
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,880
Why are you blaming me?

857
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,121
This is unfair.

858
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,291
It is unfair?

859
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,791
When we have such clear proof?

860
00:58:02,331 --> 00:58:05,561
You said yourself that you had hidden it in the shrine!

861
00:58:08,371 --> 00:58:09,831
I found an arrow tip.

862
00:58:10,231 --> 00:58:12,701
I found the corresponding piece in this house.

863
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:15,740
How dare a wench search the shrine?

864
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:22,010
You dare trick me?

865
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,221
Do you think I will give in to you?

866
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:25,920
Keep still. You move too much.

867
00:58:27,081 --> 00:58:28,451
Now do you get it?

868
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:31,661
This was a fake.

869
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,030
Everyone focused on the blade.

870
00:58:39,501 --> 00:58:43,030
But the real murder weapon was a bow and arrow.

871
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,300
To use her illness against her,

872
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,340
the victims were lured to the path Yeon Hee took.

873
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,510
But Yeon Hee saw...

874
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:55,280
the arrow take flight from a tree.

875
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:58,650
It reflected the moonlight and looked like a shooting star.

876
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:06,360
She saw the killer take out the liver...

877
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:08,630
to pretend to be Gumiho.

878
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:18,641
Take him away.

879
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,971
Let me do that.

880
00:59:19,971 --> 00:59:21,010
Get up.

881
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:28,751
Mother!

882
00:59:28,751 --> 00:59:30,820
Ho Joon!

883
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,021
Ho Joon!

884
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,090
Ho Joon!

885
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:48,670
You evil wench. You took both my sons from me.

886
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,240
I dedicated my life to preserving the Cheongsong Lee clan.

887
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,641
You ruined it all.

888
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:57,481
How dare you?

889
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:59,510
Why are you still alive?

890
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:01,010
I will just...

891
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:11,161
What a lame, pathetic family yours is.

892
01:00:16,891 --> 01:00:19,931
Your eldest son had stomach cancer.

893
01:00:23,431 --> 01:00:24,541
He shriveled away,

894
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:27,101
because he vomited, could not eat, and had blood in his stools,

895
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:28,911
and yet you ignored the physician's advice...

896
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:30,610
and paid shamans for talismans.

897
01:00:31,081 --> 01:00:32,880
That is why your son died!

898
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:37,181
And you blamed your daughter-in-law and demanded...

899
01:00:37,181 --> 01:00:38,621
she take her own life.

900
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:42,920
Are you not ashamed?

901
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,161
You do not know enough to speak like that.

902
01:00:49,331 --> 01:00:51,431
You are but a lowly physician!

903
01:00:51,431 --> 01:00:53,260
Even a lowly physician...

904
01:00:54,371 --> 01:00:56,501
has the heart to save patients.

905
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,070
If it is to save my patient,

906
01:01:01,471 --> 01:01:02,710
I will do anything.

907
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,891
Where is she going? What will she do?

908
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:16,920
Look at her.

909
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,061
What is she doing?

910
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:24,731
- How dare she...
- A woman...

911
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:28,170
A woman should know better than to bow at a memorial tablet.

912
01:01:46,951 --> 01:01:48,891
What is she going to do?

913
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,121
Should we stop her?

914
01:02:01,231 --> 01:02:04,101
I prayed one last time that my husband would rest in peace.

915
01:02:06,701 --> 01:02:07,911
As of now,

916
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,141
I cut my ties with the Cheongsong Lee clan.

917
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:45,681
Where...

918
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:47,951
How dare...

919
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,751
Where...

920
01:02:59,021 --> 01:03:00,320
I did not know.

921
01:03:02,391 --> 01:03:04,760
I tried to tell myself my husband's death...

922
01:03:06,231 --> 01:03:07,871
was not my fault.

923
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:11,240
But everyone blamed me,

924
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:14,101
and it became a fact.

925
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,740
Eventually, even I...

926
01:03:18,911 --> 01:03:20,641
blamed myself.

927
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,280
Why was that?

928
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:29,190
Why blame me?

929
01:03:30,251 --> 01:03:32,260
I had such a hard time.

930
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:35,331
If I had known,

931
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:38,731
I would not have blamed myself so.

932
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:43,630
It is not your fault.

933
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:48,710
So now, live your own life.

934
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:53,681
They will not be able to interfere with your life.

935
01:03:54,351 --> 01:03:56,280
I will see to that, Eun Woo.

936
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,360
I just blurted that out.

937
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:13,061
I apologize, my lady.

938
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:18,041
No.

939
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,271
Please call me like that. Call me by my first name.

940
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,610
I am done worrying about what others might think.

941
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:30,181
From now on, I wish to live as Eun Woo.

942
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:39,221
Well understood, Eun Woo.

943
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,190
From now on, I wish...

944
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,271
to devote my life to helping others like you are doing.

945
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:52,101
Although I am not sure what exactly I should do.

946
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,240
Then,

947
01:04:55,911 --> 01:04:57,710
how about you stay at Gyesoo Clinic...

948
01:04:57,710 --> 01:04:59,581
and study to be a physician?

949
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:04,081
You have a warm heart.

950
01:05:04,351 --> 01:05:07,521
On top of that, you are brave and quick-witted unlike me.

951
01:05:07,721 --> 01:05:09,650
I am certain that you will be a great physician.

952
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:12,990
Can I...

953
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:15,860
really do that?

954
01:06:43,981 --> 01:06:46,150
You lost another court maid from the Royal Kitchen?

955
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,691
If you make mistakes like this every single time,

956
01:06:49,491 --> 01:06:51,361
just take your own life before me right here and now.

957
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,531
Please forgive me, my lord.

958
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:58,861
Even a year ago,

959
01:06:59,861 --> 01:07:02,601
you nearly ruined my plan. Have you forgotten all about it?

960
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:06,101
I will find that court maid at all costs.

961
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,241
If I make another mistake, I will pay with my life.

962
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:11,241
Hurry.

963
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:13,311
If the King finds her first,

964
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,181
we are all doomed.

965
01:07:33,931 --> 01:07:35,000
- No!
- My lady!

966
01:07:35,401 --> 01:07:36,401
My lady!

967
01:07:39,971 --> 01:07:40,971
What happened?

968
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,340
Wake up. How did this happen?

969
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:44,781
Open your eyes!

970
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:49,510
There is a court maid...

971
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,821
who was involved in the death of the former King.

972
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:11,271
Your Majesty, she is dead.

973
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,080
Cover her.

974
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,050
This must not get out.

975
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,361
Hold a funeral for her in secret...

976
01:08:33,361 --> 01:08:34,891
and move the body to Seobinggo.

977
01:08:35,731 --> 01:08:37,290
I will launch a separate investigation.

978
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:59,321
Yeon Hee was released safe and sound thanks to the two of you.

979
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,050
Is this the grave of Yeon Hee's mother?

980
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:06,920
How did you know?

981
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:10,260
A physician does not only look at ailments.

982
01:09:10,891 --> 01:09:12,260
"Seek, smell, ask, and pulse."

983
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,130
It is also a physician's job...

984
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,200
to observe carefully to figure out the root causes...

985
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,271
of the ailments.

986
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:25,111
Yeon Hee started sleepwalking because she missed her late mother.

987
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:27,111
That is why she has been coming here.

988
01:09:27,241 --> 01:09:28,750
Oh, I see.

989
01:09:29,811 --> 01:09:32,821
I had no idea.

990
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,851
Thank you, Physician Yoo.

991
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,120
I will read every medical textbook that exists...

992
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,290
to cure you.

993
01:09:53,641 --> 01:09:55,840
Physician Yoo made this for you.

994
01:09:56,571 --> 01:09:57,571
My doll!

995
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,481
My gosh, thank you.

996
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:08,891
How did you come up with the idea of making a doll for her?

997
01:10:10,151 --> 01:10:12,590
Yeon Hee's mother made a doll for her before she passed away.

998
01:10:13,021 --> 01:10:14,891
But her father burned it by mistake.

999
01:10:16,361 --> 01:10:18,300
Oh, no.

1000
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,500
That was when the sleepwalking began.

1001
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,200
You are very sweet.

1002
01:10:27,101 --> 01:10:29,670
But how come you were hesitant to give it to her yourself?

1003
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:32,181
In the past,

1004
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,111
I could have used acupuncture to treat her.

1005
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:37,781
So I felt bad that the only thing I could do was give her a doll.

1006
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,721
Acupuncture uses a needle too.

1007
01:10:42,721 --> 01:10:45,960
So in a way, we could say that you used acupuncture to treat her.

1008
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:48,760
Yes, I suppose.

1009
01:10:57,071 --> 01:10:59,271
Were you behind the "gumiho" incidents...

1010
01:10:59,271 --> 01:11:00,471
that killed Choi Yoon and Min Yu Kyum?

1011
01:11:05,481 --> 01:11:06,781
No.

1012
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:11,721
Are you telling me the truth?

1013
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:18,090
Of course, sir. How could you doubt my word?

1014
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:23,590
For a moment, I wondered if you had cooked up such a ruse...

1015
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:25,861
to impress the Second State Councilor.

1016
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,401
I did suspect you for a moment.

1017
01:11:30,401 --> 01:11:32,941
However, you clearly know how to flatter others and pull strings.

1018
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,410
Knowing that I am the Second State Councilor's adopted son,

1019
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,781
you would not have taken lives without consulting me first.

1020
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:44,620
That is the conclusion I have reached.

1021
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:47,550
Yes, of course.

1022
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,991
Well...

1023
01:11:51,021 --> 01:11:54,521
How could I do such a thing?

1024
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,090
Gosh. Darn it.

1025
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,500
Oh, right.

1026
01:12:02,231 --> 01:12:04,971
About the arrogant young physician at Gyesoo Clinic.

1027
01:12:05,971 --> 01:12:08,811
I heard he used to work in the Medical Office.

1028
01:12:10,241 --> 01:12:12,010
Could he be Yoo Se Yeob?

1029
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:14,210
Well, I am not sure.

1030
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:19,550
I heard his name was Poong.

1031
01:12:21,891 --> 01:12:22,891
Poong?

1032
01:12:22,991 --> 01:12:25,090
Yes, Poong.

1033
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:27,420
Poong...

1034
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:38,471
Hurry.

1035
01:12:44,241 --> 01:12:45,441
Is this from the Second State Councilor?

1036
01:12:45,781 --> 01:12:47,910
I cannot read.

1037
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:52,781
Bring me all the letters...

1038
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:55,891
that were sent to the royal inspector.

1039
01:12:56,151 --> 01:12:57,151
Do you understand?

1040
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,260
Yes, my lord.

1041
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:02,790
You may leave.

1042
01:13:07,101 --> 01:13:08,870
There is definitely something else.

1043
01:13:09,471 --> 01:13:12,741
Why would he come all the way here to find a physician?

1044
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,471
He is the Second State Councilor's son after all.

1045
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:30,210
I will grant you the opportunity to serve me.

1046
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,050
Why would I agree to that?

1047
01:14:42,361 --> 01:14:43,491
Why?

1048
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:46,731
Because...

1049
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,731
your name is Yoo Se Yeob.

1050
01:14:52,471 --> 01:14:53,571
That is who you are.

1051
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,681
From what I hear, you murdered the late King.

1052
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:32,241
You are in need of someone high up to look out for you.

1053
01:15:32,311 --> 01:15:33,510
What are you doing here?

1054
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:34,950
You cannot.

1055
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:37,111
Only a husband should be able to grab a lady's hand.

1056
01:15:37,111 --> 01:15:38,681
I did not kill anyone.

1057
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,321
Do not falsely admit to committing the crime...

1058
01:15:40,321 --> 01:15:41,790
just to break free from the torture.

1059
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:42,821
I will not Young Master.

1060
01:15:42,821 --> 01:15:45,391
All the evidence points to Man Bok as the culprit.

1061
01:15:45,391 --> 01:15:47,021
In order to prove Man Bok's innocence,

1062
01:15:47,021 --> 01:15:49,531
I must become a master physician.

1063
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:51,031
Let us catch the real culprit.

1064
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:53,561
I will do whatever I can to find the evidence we need.

1065
01:15:54,231 --> 01:15:55,531
The law is the law.

1066
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:57,370
I will follow the legal process.

1067
01:15:58,401 --> 01:16:00,441
A man's life is at stake!

1068
01:16:00,441 --> 01:16:02,040
And I refuse to give up.

1069
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:07,275
