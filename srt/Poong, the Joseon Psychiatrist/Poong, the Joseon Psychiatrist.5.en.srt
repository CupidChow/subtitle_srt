4
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:47,774
If you are going to delay it, you might as well delay it longer.

5
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:51,060
Just a little delay is more than I owe you.

6
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:53,120
Leave the ten nyang and go.

7
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,200
Double the delay.

8
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,160
Get out of the way!

9
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,390
Make way!

10
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,059
- No... I did not... - Oh, dear.

11
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:38,240
Halt!

12
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,750
Stop!

13
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,839
Young Master! Save me!

14
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:35,259
Oh, dear.

15
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,630
Forgive me.

16
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,569
No, wait, please...

17
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,060
Get out of our way!

18
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:15,970
None of this...

19
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,739
was your fault, my lady.

20
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,280
It was all his doing.

21
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,819
Yes. You can change it all by making up your own mind.

22
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,000
Be quiet.

23
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,699
I am the only one who can protect her.

24
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,269
I am sorry.

25
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,000
I am sorry. I really am.

26
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:36,549
No.

27
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,720
I paid you thrice.

28
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,960
No.

29
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,799
Young Master!

30
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,809
Stop!

31
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,720
I brought the real killer.

32
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,760
He is the actual murderer.

33
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,070
I was...

34
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,039
only heading off on a cruise with my dear love.

35
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,280
For what reason do you call me a murderer?

36
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,080
The clear proof you spoke of.

37
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,220
Did you find it?

38
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,220
We brought you a witness.

39
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,530
- Who is that? - She is a witness?

40
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,640
I saw it...

41
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:11,109
for myself and clearly too.

42
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:19,080
He strangled Gae Ban.

43
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:24,059
Then killed him.

44
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,559
- What? - What an evil thing to do.

45
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,830
- He did it? - Oh, dear.

46
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,160
- He must be the killer. - Really?

47
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,770
It all began...

48
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,070
when he forced me to stop playing my geomungo.

49
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,470
I warned you.

50
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,939
Do not play the geomungo anymore.

51
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,080
Any man who hears it will flock to you.

52
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,650
If you will not do as I say, break off our engagement.

53
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,220
But if you do that,

54
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,150
you will have to pay me back for the dowry...

55
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,390
and your father's debts that I paid for.

56
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,489
Because that is how the world works.

57
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
But...

58
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,729
I kept on playing in secret.

59
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,799
Because I wanted, needed to breathe.

60
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:17,239
Ban enjoyed my music.

61
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,039
He even carved me a suldae.

62
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,749
(Suldae: A stick used to play the geomungo.)

63
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,189
No.

64
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,450
My lady. Run.

65
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,129
My lady.

66
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,970
You need to get up! Do you wish to die?

67
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,200
Wait.

68
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,679
We must see the magistrate before the physician.

69
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,540
Gae Ban, run!

70
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,430
That scumbag must be punished!

71
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,440
Chop him to pieces!

72
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,139
- That piece of... - Stop.

73
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,409
Listen up! Release this man at once...

74
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,680
and imprison Lee Gil Soo!

75
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:33,909
- Yes, sir! - My goodness.

76
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,950
- Oh, dear. - That scoundrel!

77
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,320
- Punish him! - Yes!

78
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Young Master.

79
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,899
- Man Bok. - Yes, Young Master.

80
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,369
Please untie me.

81
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,570
Okay.

82
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,070
Were you worried about me? I am okay.

83
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,879
Young Master...

84
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:17,659
Thank goodness.

85
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,269
The energy blockage has been removed.

86
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,330
Her blood circulation and energy flow have improved.

87
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,940
Correct.

88
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:34,170
Her condition will continue to improve.

89
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,940
If it were not for me,

90
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,680
Ban would still be alive.

91
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,649
I should have protected him.

92
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,779
No, my lady.

93
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,619
Why do you think that it is your fault?

94
00:10:58,859 --> 00:10:59,930
Your hand tremors...

95
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,529
were caused by a weakened heart and mind...

96
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,070
as stated in "Dongui Bogam."

97
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,239
However, you did not get nervous in such a stressful situation...

98
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,769
and taught him a lesson,

99
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,680
which tells me that you have overcome your condition.

100
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,210
However, emotional devastation causes your energy...

101
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,779
to travel downward and become stagnant,

102
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,119
so I suggest you focus on preventing that for the time being.

103
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,619
To be more specific,

104
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,290
do not hold in farts and keep your intestines moist.

105
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
That will help you...

106
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:32,899
- It will... - Well...

107
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,830
What Physician Yoo is trying to say...

108
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,639
is that he is truly impressed...

109
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,300
by how you managed to overcome your hand tremors all on your own.

110
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,310
Right, Physician Yoo?

111
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,710
Yes.

112
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,210
Thank you.

113
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,680
I owe it all to the two of you.

114
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,479
You were brave enough to uncover the truth,

115
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,779
so I am certain that you can protect yourself from now on.

116
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,350
You think so?

117
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:58,889
Yes, I am sure of it.

118
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,460
Do not hold yourself back and do the things you want to do.

119
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,340
Boar is back!

120
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,340
Do not ask me any questions from now on.

121
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,779
Do you know how much he resented me?

122
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,920
Eat all of this. And do not worry us again.

123
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,379
You are a big guy, but you are of no use.

124
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,119
Eat up.

125
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:33,460
You were all worried about me?

126
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,259
You were this worried?

127
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
No, we were not.

128
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:43,129
They say you must not smile right after crying.

129
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,369
Just eat your food.

130
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:49,840
Thank you for the food.

131
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,560
This is so good!

132
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,399
It is absolutely delicious.

133
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,769
Eat slowly.

134
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,369
This is my favourite dish!

135
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:33,019
Hey! Stop talking nonsense.

136
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,619
If the deceased King died from poisoning,

137
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,960
why would His Majesty sit back and do nothing about it?

138
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,930
He cannot do anything...

139
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,790
for the Second State Councillor outpowers him.

140
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,800
I heard His Majesty was investigating it in secret.

141
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,800
The royal taster tastes everything first with a silver spoon.

142
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,970
It makes no sense.

143
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,239
I heard the poison was an extremely rare one.

144
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,540
I heard it with my own ears when I was delivering some merchandise.

145
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,550
Is that so?

146
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,790
I know nothing.

147
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,389
Why are you doing this to me?

148
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:19,399
Tell us the source of the groundless rumours you have been spreading.

149
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,269
We have all the witnesses in our custody now.

150
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,830
Will you confess after you are beheaded?

151
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:26,739
I...

152
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:28,369
All I did was...

153
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,810
meet Commissioner Yoo Hoo Myung...

154
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,639
when he came to see me.

155
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,649
Yoo Hoo Myung?

156
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,519
What are you scheming with Yoo Hoo Myung?

157
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,119
My gosh. Scheming? No!

158
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:48,389
Commissioner Yoo was looking for a rare medicinal herb...

159
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,830
I had never seen before.

160
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,830
A medicinal herb?

161
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:55,470
Did he leave it with you?

162
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,430
No, of course not!

163
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,269
I have never seen anything like this before.

164
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:01,269
I only saw it for a moment.

165
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,670
It was wrapped in silk.

166
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,379
He showed it to me briefly and left.

167
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:13,320
Yoo Hoo Myung...

168
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,350
got his hands on dansacho?

169
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,259
But how?

170
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,629
If someone wishes...

171
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,359
to uncover the truth behind the former King's death...

172
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,269
And if that is the King, then what will you do?

173
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,940
We must kill Yoo Se Yeob at once.

174
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,909
Even if Yoo Hoo Myung knew something,

175
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:40,080
we killed him before he could say anything to the King.

176
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,810
So if we kill his son, we have nothing to worry about.

177
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,720
It is easier said than done.

178
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:47,420
All you do is talk when you cannot do anything right!

179
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
We should have...

180
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,560
killed him long ago anyway.

181
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,229
There is nothing you cannot do. Why are you hesitant?

182
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,739
I will deal with the physician myself.

183
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:11,379
You must find the court maid from the Royal Kitchen...

184
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:12,909
and get rid of her at all costs.

185
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:15,749
Yes, my lord.

186
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,649
If we get rid of Yoo Se Yeob,

187
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,389
no one else will know about the secret behind dansacho.

188
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,159
Once that gets out,

189
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,590
you and I are both doomed.

190
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,499
I am aware, my lord.

191
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,769
We burned "Haedongboncho" to ashes...

192
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:38,399
and killed anyone and everyone related to Jeon Kyu Hyung.

193
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,149
What is this?

194
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,090
Oh, boy.

195
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:46,800

197
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,810
I thought I had read every medical textbook in Joseon.

("Haedongboncho")

204
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,240
Would these be too complex for Lady Eun Woo?

You seem as though...

00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,478
you are lost in the cold.

210
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:37,548
That is how I would describe being locked up in a cell.

211
00:19:37,548 --> 00:19:39,079
Must you say something that creepy...

212
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,919
when you have a knack for foreseeing the future?

213
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:43,788
From what I hear,

214
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:46,419
you are quite the fortune-teller.

215
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,359
Is there anything you see in mine?

216
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,488
Here.

217
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,869
Could I be seen at a nice banquet or feast?

218
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,768
How can you see the future?

219
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,069
Lady Namhae!

220
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,708
Will it rain on the 3rd day of the 3rd lunar month?

221
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:04,069
It will pour,

222
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,978
so pick edible flowers and mugwort while you can.

223
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:09,248
I should have asked you sooner.

224
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:10,849
- Thank you. - Have a good one.

225
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:21,159
The scorched rice is mine!

226
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,829
Have you moved on to stealing Jang Gun's scorched rice?

227
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,258
You are unbelievable.

228
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:27,998
No, of course not.

229
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:31,698
I thought it was for everyone being out in the open and all.

230
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,369
It is mine. Stay away!

231
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:36,409
Jang Gun, what is delicious...

232
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:39,879
should be shared.

233
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,948
My gosh.

234
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:45,149
I am sorry!

235
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,579
- It was my fault. - Goodness.

236
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:48,919
Jang Gun!

237
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:50,919
It was my fault.

238
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,119
- I am sorry. - My gosh.

239
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,558
Jang Gun, here you go. Everything is all right.

240
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:00,129
Did you have to scare him like that?

241
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,429
Unbelievable.

242
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:04,669
What was that all about?

243
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,238
I did not mean any harm.

244
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:10,708
Physician Gye is the only one he shares his scorched rice with.

245
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:15,579
Hold on. Where did Father go so early in the morning?

246
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:25,419
Who is there?

247
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,339
- Goodness. - It's food and firewood.

248
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,139
Who could have left these here?

249
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,308
My gosh.

250
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:45,939
How exhausting.

251
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,939
I was almost caught just now.

252
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:53,379
What?

253
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,349
Physician Gye.

254
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:58,189
Goodness, Madam Jeodonggung. Is that you?

255
00:21:58,189 --> 00:22:00,319
What brings you here at this early hour?

256
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,689
Quickly. Please examine this boy.

257
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:05,399
What happened?

258
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,958
Since the crack of dawn, he has been hallucinating...

259
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:10,968
and talking gibberish as if he had seen a ghost.

260
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:13,839
Allow me to examine him inside. This way.

261
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,169
You two, bring me my needles.

262
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:20,008
- In here. - Goodness.

263
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,718
What is this about?

264
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:35,988
Carefully, please.

265
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,869
How is he?

266
00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:54,208
His pulse is thready.

267
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:57,179
Are you saying he cannot be saved?

268
00:22:57,548 --> 00:22:58,919
Of course not.

269
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:01,849
A needle to the Gugeub will bring him back.

270
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,718
You said that he hallucinated. Has it occurred before?

271
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:08,488
I am not sure...

272
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:12,258
for I do not spend every waking hour with him.

273
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:16,198
If he hallucinated during the day, we could eliminate sleepwalking.

274
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,399
I hear it normally happens at night.

275
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,808
Could he be possessed by a spirit?

276
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:24,508
Let us treat him with moxibustion.

277
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:31,308
I will begin the treatment to the Seokmun.

278
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:56,339
His pulse may be thready...

279
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,708
but not thready enough to make him hallucinate...

280
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:00,379
which is odd.

281
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:04,048
I do not think I was aware...

282
00:24:04,048 --> 00:24:06,218
of such a young boy being in your family.

283
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,159
I heard that the son of a concubine was adopted.

284
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,558
Maybe that is him.

285
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,359
Are you saying she is not his birth mother?

286
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:19,498
She seems to care immensely though.

287
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:21,968
It goes to show the madam's grace.

288
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:23,429
She thinks of him as her own.

289
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:26,339
Who cares?

290
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,468
Is it not something everyone will know about?

291
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,109
Those who talk behind others' backs should die.

292
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,619
Her mind seems oddly clear at times.

293
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,718
That is correct. He is...

294
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:45,058
In internal medicine, it is said that...

295
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:47,419
women cease to menstruate at the age of 49...

296
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,359
which prevents them from reproducing.

297
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,429
Judging by how dry your skin is,

298
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:54,829
he could not have been conceived...

299
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:57,599
during the period in which you menstruated.

300
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,599
(Cheongye: menstruation)

301
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,298
Therefore, he must be the son of a concubine.

302
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:04,169
What are you...

303
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,839
Also, you do not seem to know the boy very well...

304
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,649
which implies that he has only recently moved in.

305
00:25:13,018 --> 00:25:14,248
You dunce!

306
00:25:15,218 --> 00:25:16,748
My apologies.

307
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:19,258
He spends his days buried in books...

308
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:21,558
which did not allow for him to learn basic manners.

309
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,429
Madam, he did not mean to insult you.

310
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,159
That is not how you speak to a devoted wife.

311
00:25:27,698 --> 00:25:28,768
Do not apologize...

312
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,329
for he is correct.

313
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:35,468
He is an illegitimate son.

314
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:38,238
Maybe I should have told them about the boy's illegitimacy.

315
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:40,038
One would have to be daft...

316
00:25:40,478 --> 00:25:43,508
to actually say that in front of her, right?

317
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:45,948
That is exactly what Young Master would do.

318
00:25:49,218 --> 00:25:50,448
Oh, dear.

319
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:59,659
Let us begin treatment on his back.

320
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:00,758
Wait!

321
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:04,968
Madam, you may leave me with him.

322
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:07,069
Should you not return home before breakfast?

323
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:09,909
Right, of course.

324
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:13,939
Please take good care of him.

325
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:16,778
Could you send him home as soon as he wakes up?

326
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:19,919
Of course. He is in good hands, so do not worry.

327
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,218
Take good care of him.

328
00:26:22,218 --> 00:26:24,189
Shall we?

329
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:47,109
Who did this to him?

330
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:52,579
I will be in trouble if I tell you.

331
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,548
His stomach and back.

332
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:56,319
Even his arms are covered in bruises.

333
00:26:58,089 --> 00:26:59,458

Who did the beating?

336
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,069
Was it Madam Jeodonggung?

337

I do not know who it was.

338

- But... - Madam!

339
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,349
Do not just stand there. Stop him!

340
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:27,748
- Madam, I must ask something. - No, you cannot.

341
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:31,048
Madam!

342

You said to stop him.

344
00:27:39,998 --> 00:27:41,258
Young Master?

345
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:43,768
- Poong. - Young Master?

346
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:46,939
- Poong! - Oh, no.

Yes.

that you all tiptoe around her?

354
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,589
Her mother is one of the late king's daughters.

355
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:12,829
She is a king's granddaughter and has royal blood.

356
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,798
She is the most influential person we could ever look after.

357

So act smart.

358
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:20,698
Her husband was demoted to the countryside,

359
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,738
but he will soon go back to being a minister or lord.

360

She is not that kind of person.

She gives out grain to the poor.

was beaten by the other mistress who looked after him.

She beat him so much which is why...

372

he ended up with his father.

373

I am sure the madam will look after him now.

You are so naive.

Do you think you will be different?

466
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:25,228
Yes. I would rather not get married at all.

467

If and when I do, I will love only one wife.

Anyway, Seok Cheol's illness is not a simple one.

I think someone is harassing him in secret.

Yes.

Right.

The bruises and wounds on his body.

485
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,489
They were caused at different times.

486
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:28,859
He was beaten for a while.

487
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:30,728
I cannot let him be.

488
00:36:31,228 --> 00:36:32,899
I cannot let things continue.

They are fresh.

I cannot take anything less than two nyang.

He almost died trying to keep his share.

493
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:48,439
Still, Madam Jeodonggung must have paid you handsomely.

494

- Give me a discount. - I cannot.

495

That family is even worse these days.

496
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:55,348
You can ask anyone who supplies them.

497
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:58,049
They got stingy. Something is off.

498
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:03,529
- Let us have fish for dinner! - Granny!

499
00:37:03,828 --> 00:37:04,888

500
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,359
You cannot touch what we did not buy!

501
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,859
Give me what she just took.

502
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,629
And these too.

503
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:15,439
Since when were they like that?

504
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:16,969
Who was?

505
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:18,669
Madam Jeodonggung.

506
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:22,038
I thought they had enough money to last a lifetime.

507
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:24,279
When did they turn so stingy?

508
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,978
Around this time two years ago.

509
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:29,219
Two years ago?

510
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:52,109
I did not tell anyone.

511
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:55,239
I kept my promise.

512
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:28,509
The sun will come up at this rate.

513
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:31,208
Goodness. Young Master cannot take a hint.

514
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:32,649
Look.

515
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:36,248
Let us stop here.

516
00:38:37,018 --> 00:38:38,719
- Sure. - I will put these away.

517
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,419
We have lots of time.

518
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:43,629
Codonopsis pilosula and cortex fraxini.

519
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:46,699
All right.

520
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:49,569
My gosh. You scared me.

521
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,098
Hey, you are that kid we saw earlier. Right?

522
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:56,609
Young Master.

523
00:38:57,609 --> 00:38:59,138
Why did you come all the way here barefoot?

524
00:39:04,908 --> 00:39:07,518
Mom, I am cold.

525
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:09,888
I am thirsty.

526
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:12,149
What?

527
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:15,828
We should take him inside.

528
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:18,458
I cannot hear you.

529
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:22,969
I cannot hear anything.

530
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:32,538
Here.

531
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:50,189
Who did this to him?

532
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,699
Why? And how?

533
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:56,629
Hello, anybody here? Physician Yoo!

534
00:40:06,478 --> 00:40:08,449
I looked for him for hours.

535
00:40:09,248 --> 00:40:10,719
I did not know he was here.

536
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:14,918
Who is hitting Seok Cheol?

537
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:22,359
Lord Cho is very strict,

538
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,498
and since Seok Cheol is a mistress' son,

539
00:40:26,498 --> 00:40:27,768
Madam Jeodonggung is also...

540
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:31,538
All we can do...

541
00:40:31,538 --> 00:40:33,969
is live quietly as if we do not exist.

542
00:40:35,438 --> 00:40:39,478
Do they not let him eat or drink water?

543
00:40:44,748 --> 00:40:47,188
I should have paid more attention to him.

544
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:51,518
Is he in critical condition?

545
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:53,259
If we do not return home now,

546
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:56,029
both Seok Cheol and I may get kicked out.

547
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,299
You are pregnant,

548
00:41:00,998 --> 00:41:03,069
so emotional distress will not do you any good.

549
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:07,109
Go home and get some rest.

550
00:41:07,438 --> 00:41:09,879
We will take him home once he is treated.

551
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:28,228
We cannot send Seok Cheol home.

552
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:33,199
Giving up and sending him home...

553
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:35,629
is no better than killing him.

554
00:41:37,138 --> 00:41:39,199
But I know that you will not give up.

555
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,938
I have an idea.

556
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:08,969
Physician Gye.

557
00:42:16,509 --> 00:42:17,739
(Local Office)

558
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:23,549
I clearly told you to stay away from that physician.

559
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:27,819
But I feel so bad for the boy. He has bruises all over.

560
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:29,859
- If you meet him, I am sure... - What are you sure of?

561
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:33,259
That I will pity him because of my own unfortunate childhood?

562
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:36,058
No, that is not what I meant.

563
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,129
Your story is different. There were people who saved you,

564
00:42:39,129 --> 00:42:41,569
and the Second State Councillor took you in.

565
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:46,538
You were the one who saved me.

566
00:42:48,038 --> 00:42:49,879
Because you took me to your father,

567
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:51,909
I could learn martial arts and gain hope to live on.

568
00:42:57,848 --> 00:43:01,649
How come you rarely visit my father these days?

569
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:07,228
It is because of you.

570
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:09,388
What?

571
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,199
He married you off to that strange family and made you suffer.

572
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:18,339
That was the reason?

573
00:43:22,138 --> 00:43:23,779
I cannot let her go like this.

574
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:25,679
Please give me a little more time.

575
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:27,049
I have already decided...

576
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:29,248
to marry Eun Woo off to the Cheongsong Lee clan.

577
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:33,989
How...

578
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:38,188
How could you do this?

579
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:41,328
You know how I feel about her.

580
00:43:46,328 --> 00:43:48,768
Is it because I am not from a prestigious family?

581
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:53,768
You are just like them.

582
00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:03,348
I have to visit Lord Cho soon anyway.

583
00:44:03,618 --> 00:44:05,018
You can come with me then.

584
00:44:05,649 --> 00:44:07,888
Really? Thank you.

585
00:44:08,118 --> 00:44:09,149
Let us go now.

586
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:10,188
Another time.

587
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:12,089
I must go to Hanyang now.

588
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,388
Oh, I see.

589
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:16,799
To visit the Second State Councillor, right?

590
00:44:17,228 --> 00:44:20,598
Of course. You and your father are very close.

591
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:22,799
Then let me know when you are back.

592
00:44:23,368 --> 00:44:24,399
I will.

593
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:30,679
Did you find Yoo Se Yeob?

594
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:34,308
Yes.

595
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:39,679
Kill him.

596
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:48,589
Is it hard to do?

597
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:51,458
No, it is not.

598
00:44:52,129 --> 00:44:53,529
You told me to just keep an eye on him.

599
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:01,438
If it must be done urgently, I will kill him tonight.

600
00:45:10,078 --> 00:45:11,649
I like that spirit.

601
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:14,348
Everyone else...

602
00:45:14,348 --> 00:45:17,018
who wanted to be my adoptive son...

603
00:45:17,388 --> 00:45:19,418
put up a fake front to fawn over me.

604
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:22,489
But with you, I could never figure out...

605
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:23,629
what you were truly thinking.

606
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:30,299
You have what it takes to keep your position for years to come.

607
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:34,638
However,

608
00:45:35,668 --> 00:45:38,538
it also means you have what it takes to stab me in the back.

609
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:45,149
Hence, I need you to dirty your hands with blood...

610
00:45:46,819 --> 00:45:49,188
to prove your loyalty to me.

611
00:46:02,668 --> 00:46:05,239
You are a glutton.

612
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:09,739
Oh, are you not eating because of me?

613
00:46:10,438 --> 00:46:12,779
No, do not worry! I eat well every day.

614
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:14,379
Really?

615
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:19,578
I wish to live here too.

616
00:46:21,649 --> 00:46:22,719
Hey.

617
00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:25,388
Do you want some crunchy rice?

618
00:46:30,899 --> 00:46:32,659
Here. Have some.

619
00:46:33,368 --> 00:46:34,799
Out of everyone I know,

620
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:36,129
you enjoy your food the most.

621
00:46:46,279 --> 00:46:47,879
Coat it in this too.

622
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:00,259
Why did you do that?

623
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:02,558
You ruined our precious sugar.

624
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,098
I am sorry.

625
00:47:05,399 --> 00:47:06,529
I did not know.

626
00:47:25,848 --> 00:47:26,848
Is it not sweet?

627
00:47:27,248 --> 00:47:28,819
Yes, it is scrumptious.

628
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:30,888
Here you go.

629
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:35,589
Is it not delicious?

630
00:47:49,268 --> 00:47:50,279
You look beautiful.

631
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,049
All women look beautiful when dolled up.

632
00:47:55,009 --> 00:47:58,118
Actually, you have always looked pretty.

633
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:02,089
You should always dress this way.

634
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:04,558
How can I?

635
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:07,228
Why can you not? Being a widow is not a sin.

636
00:48:10,828 --> 00:48:13,668
Madam Jeodonggung is a member of my mother's tea party.

637
00:48:13,668 --> 00:48:15,799
I will go to her and try to hear the full story.

638
00:48:16,638 --> 00:48:17,638
Young Master.

639
00:48:18,168 --> 00:48:19,168
Should we accompany her?

640
00:48:21,038 --> 00:48:22,638
Says the man who is still seated.

641
00:48:25,938 --> 00:48:26,949
Put on the gold binyeo.

642
00:48:27,808 --> 00:48:28,879
This is prettier.

643
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:33,248
Granny, that is not a gold binyeo. Get over here and have your meal.

644
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:35,918
Where on earth did you even get that?

645
00:48:36,118 --> 00:48:37,118
Ugly girl.

646
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:38,659
You get a wooden binyeo.

647
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:39,989
- What? - Stop that.

648
00:48:41,688 --> 00:48:42,688
Goodness me.

649
00:48:42,888 --> 00:48:45,558
I did not recognize you dressed like that, Lady Seo.

650
00:48:46,629 --> 00:48:47,899
Please do not forget...

651
00:48:47,899 --> 00:48:50,668
to tell the ladies about our clinic at the tea party.

652
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:54,708
You.

653
00:48:55,339 --> 00:48:57,279
Take the young master home safely...

654
00:48:57,279 --> 00:48:58,909
and accept whatever it is they give you.

655
00:48:59,438 --> 00:49:00,449
Sure.

656
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:01,679
All right.

657
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:04,319
Master Seok Cheol, have a safe trip home.

658
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:06,719
We will not see you out.

659
00:49:07,688 --> 00:49:09,348
- Have a safe trip. - See you later.

660
00:49:09,348 --> 00:49:12,888
All right.

661
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:18,699
We must save Seok Cheol.

662
00:49:19,328 --> 00:49:20,868
Seok Cheol who loves scorched rice.

663
00:49:26,038 --> 00:49:30,308
Are you saying you wish to give him all your scorched rice,

664
00:49:30,308 --> 00:49:31,808
dig up twice the amount of herbs,

665
00:49:31,808 --> 00:49:33,208
and do twice the work?

666
00:49:34,879 --> 00:49:38,348
We can share the scorched rice.

667
00:49:38,478 --> 00:49:39,679
See?

668
00:49:40,118 --> 00:49:41,688
Hold back the nonsense...

669
00:49:42,288 --> 00:49:43,659
and have your breakfast.

670
00:49:47,888 --> 00:49:48,888
What?

671
00:49:51,129 --> 00:49:52,129
Jang Gun.

672
00:49:53,129 --> 00:49:54,129
Unbelievable.

673
00:50:03,438 --> 00:50:04,438
Master Seok Cheol.

674
00:50:05,578 --> 00:50:06,909
How is he feeling?

675
00:50:07,248 --> 00:50:09,409
He is doing better, but he has not fully recovered.

676
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:11,779
Please take us to his room.

677
00:50:12,078 --> 00:50:13,078
It is this way.

678
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:33,199
Who hurt you?

679
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:37,138
You may be honest with me.

680
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:41,679
Physician.

681
00:50:45,819 --> 00:50:47,788
It is time for Seok Cheol to go to school.

682
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:52,918
How can he go to school in this physical state?

683
00:50:53,118 --> 00:50:54,788
- Skipping a class... - My apologies,

684
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:56,529
but skipping classes...

685
00:50:56,529 --> 00:50:58,558
will not sit right with his father.

686
00:51:24,388 --> 00:51:26,589
The tea will be even more fragrant.

687
00:51:26,589 --> 00:51:27,589
Please take a sip.

688
00:51:27,828 --> 00:51:28,828
Sure.

689
00:51:29,259 --> 00:51:30,929
My daughter told me...

690
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:32,929
how she wanted to join me at your tea party.

691
00:51:32,929 --> 00:51:34,399
You should have brought her today.

692
00:51:34,399 --> 00:51:36,168
How old is she?

693
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:37,799
She is five.

694
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:40,409
Five?

695
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:46,438
As if you can ever be on our level.

696
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:49,049
You lowly boy. Leave our family!

697
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:51,679
What do you think you are doing?

698
00:51:56,049 --> 00:51:57,058
We should go.

699
00:51:58,159 --> 00:51:59,288
What an eyesore.

700
00:52:07,299 --> 00:52:08,299
Let us go back.

701
00:52:09,228 --> 00:52:10,998
How could you possibly go to school like this?

702
00:52:14,768 --> 00:52:17,078
Are you saying you wish to go?

703
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,049
It is not like I have anywhere better to go.

704
00:52:57,578 --> 00:52:58,719
Over here!

705
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:15,259
One might think you are searching for a romance novel.

706
00:54:15,759 --> 00:54:16,998
Physician Yoo.

707
00:54:18,058 --> 00:54:19,399
You may put down that medical text.

708
00:54:19,899 --> 00:54:21,899
I have sorted out my books for you to read in order.

709
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:25,699
It seems to me that you can be impatient.

710
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:29,409
I spend my days learning what you teach me.

711
00:54:29,668 --> 00:54:33,649
It is my desire to quickly be of help to you in any way.

712
00:54:34,779 --> 00:54:35,848
I understand,

713
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:37,418
but there is not a medical text in Joseon.

714
00:54:37,418 --> 00:54:39,149
that I have not read.

715
00:54:40,848 --> 00:54:41,848
I see.

716
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:44,458
Now that I think about it,

717
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:48,589
you can be quite full of yourself at times.

718
00:54:56,569 --> 00:54:57,569
I was not bragging.

719
00:54:58,538 --> 00:54:59,538
I was not.

720
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:02,009
It is the truth.

721
00:55:02,368 --> 00:55:05,179
Was the tea party productive for us?

722
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:09,208
Yes, Madam Jeodonggung invited me to take her pulse tomorrow.

723
00:55:10,279 --> 00:55:12,018
She seemed...

724
00:55:12,578 --> 00:55:14,489
heavily concerned.

725
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:16,188
How was your day today?

726
00:55:16,589 --> 00:55:17,589
Well...

727
00:55:18,788 --> 00:55:21,958
Are you supposed to be beaten up by older siblings?

728
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:24,399
You must be referring to Seok Cheol.

729
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:29,699
Suddenly gaining a stepbrother...

730
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:31,638
must have made them uncomfortable.

731
00:55:32,498 --> 00:55:35,438
They probably need time to form a familial bond.

732
00:55:35,668 --> 00:55:38,208
Are they his family or his assailants?

733
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:40,409
I do not know the answer to that.

734
00:55:41,478 --> 00:55:43,049
After saving him from his brothers,

735
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:44,679
I told him not to go to school.

736
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:47,618
He replied that he had nowhere better to go.

737
00:55:48,688 --> 00:55:49,688
I felt bad.

738
00:55:51,058 --> 00:55:53,659
Maybe you can bring it up with Madam Jeodonggung tomorrow.

739
00:55:54,728 --> 00:55:55,728
Sure.

740
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:57,558
Would I be able to do a good job?

741
00:55:57,929 --> 00:55:58,929
Of course.

742
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:02,069
When I was young,

743
00:56:02,328 --> 00:56:04,969
my mother told me that worrying was the key to success.

744
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:09,569
That bad luck finds those who live too carelessly.

745
00:56:11,009 --> 00:56:12,478
While I was academically gifted,

746
00:56:12,879 --> 00:56:14,478
I was also too shy and timid.

747
00:56:14,748 --> 00:56:17,578
Your mother sounds like a wise woman.

748
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:20,319
I am sure she was admirable as well.

749
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:28,659
You are not crying, are you?

750
00:56:30,998 --> 00:56:32,728
What do you prescribe for a runny nose?

751
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:35,429
Socheongryongtang.

752
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:38,938
I believe you are a genius.

753
00:56:41,668 --> 00:56:42,909
Socheongryongtang.

754
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:54,719
Yoo Se Yeob is the King's childhood friend.

755
00:56:55,518 --> 00:56:58,319
He is waiting for the right time to summon him back.

756
00:56:59,388 --> 00:57:01,058
So do not rush it.

757
00:57:02,029 --> 00:57:04,558
You must get rid of him in a way that cannot be traced.

758
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,978
("Dongui Bogam 1")

759
00:57:21,848 --> 00:57:25,179
Would "Dongui Bogam" be too difficult for her yet?

760
00:57:31,558 --> 00:57:35,788
("Dongui Bogam")

761
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:01,989
("Dongui Bogam 2")

762
00:58:01,989 --> 00:58:02,989
("Dongui Bogam 3")

763
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:06,259
("Dongui Bogam 4")

764
00:58:18,368 --> 00:58:19,438
Oh, right.

765
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:29,279
Eun Woo.

766
00:58:31,649 --> 00:58:32,719
Eun Woo.

767
00:58:39,089 --> 00:58:40,659
Were you reading a book?

768
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:43,589
I thought so.

769
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:47,868
Here.

770
00:58:49,629 --> 00:58:51,469
Oh. Thank you.

771
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:53,538
(Gugeubyangbang)

772
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:56,109
If you will read all night, I will take them back.

773
00:58:56,368 --> 00:58:58,339
No. I will not do that.

774
00:59:01,009 --> 00:59:03,449
I will assist you tomorrow.

775
00:59:03,779 --> 00:59:05,418
Treat the madam with acupuncture.

776
00:59:07,518 --> 00:59:08,549
Already?

777
00:59:09,888 --> 00:59:10,958
Yes.

778
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:17,699
Here.

779
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:25,598
It is a gift for your first treatment.

780
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:32,609
I cannot take it. It is yours.

781
00:59:32,609 --> 00:59:35,179
You need it for when you can treat people again.

782
00:59:40,649 --> 00:59:44,518
Until then, could you be my hands?

783
00:59:46,118 --> 00:59:47,529
Could you do that for me?

784
01:00:01,538 --> 01:00:02,868
Until then.

785
01:00:06,009 --> 01:00:07,308
When the time comes.

786
01:00:10,109 --> 01:00:11,179
Yes.

787
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:13,618
When the time comes,

788
01:00:14,688 --> 01:00:15,848
return it then.

789
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:25,299
Yes. I will do that.

790
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:01,868
Is there a medicinal herb that will change the colour of metal?

791
01:01:01,868 --> 01:01:03,899
It must be done without fail this time.

792
01:01:04,839 --> 01:01:07,509
Were you nervous at first too?

793
01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:09,038
Your hands are better than mine.

794
01:01:09,038 --> 01:01:11,909
One day, you will believe that.

795
01:01:12,078 --> 01:01:13,779
Do you call this studying?

796
01:01:13,779 --> 01:01:15,848
- Be quiet. - Lord Cho's right index finger.

797
01:01:15,848 --> 01:01:17,978
There is a wound you get from using a whip often.

798
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:20,179
Physician Gye! Are you in?

799
01:01:20,379 --> 01:01:23,489
When someone curses someone else, you report that to the authorities.

800
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:25,759
Bring me a fail-proof plan.

801
01:01:25,759 --> 01:01:27,659
He is dead already.

802
01:01:27,859 --> 01:01:29,989
We might be able to save him.

803
01:01:30,129 --> 01:01:31,498
I cannot do it.

804
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:33,058
You must do it.
