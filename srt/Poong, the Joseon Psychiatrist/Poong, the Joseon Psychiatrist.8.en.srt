In that case, was the stiletto needle...

00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,055
Was Yoo Se Yeob the one who used it?

00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,026
What is the matter?

5
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:41,166
Sin Woo?

6
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,346
I will come by again.

7
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:13,696
Why did Yoo Hoo Myung...

8
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,109
hold onto the needle that caused...

the former king's death until the moment he died?

(Strike)

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,116
The wound on Yoo Hoo Myung's head.

12
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,916
It was not caused by a fall from a horse.

13
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,196
Was it not an accident but murder?

14
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,965
- There are plants! - Get them all.

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,675
- Come on. - Hurry up.

16
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,075
There are so many.

17
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,746
What is that?

18
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,870
Boys, look at this. I found honey.

19
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,596
- Wow, it looks tasty. - It looks nice.

20

Well?

What patient calls a physician to a gisaeng's house?

25
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:47,966
A physician should come to wherever the patient calls.

26
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:50,025
You complain too much for your status.

You arrogant punk.

28
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,765
You humiliated me...

in Gye Ji Han's presence.

Unless you want to watch your back for the rest of your life,

you should do as I say.

No.

33
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:14,525
What is wrong with you?

34
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:17,226
Are you really a dunce?

Or are you actually being loyal?

Do you know what the Gye Ji Han you trust so much is like?

37

I do.

38
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,235
He loves his drink and money even more so.

39
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:32,436
That is what you could call "cute."

40
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:35,145
He was called "Mad Murderer."

41
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,316
He cut someone open during the war.

42
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,075
He even fed someone a poisonous herb.

43
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,585
You speak the truth so well.

44
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:47,015
Gye Ji Han is out of his mind.

45
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:50,525
He cares nothing for a human life.

46
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,856
Gye Ji Han. Get rid of him...

47
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,925
and take over the clinic.

48
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,636
Do that, and I will be your benefactor.

49
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,910
I do not want to take over Gyesoo Clinic,

50
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:03,606
nor do I need a benefactor.

51

Why you... Do you know how valuable that plot of land is?

52
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:13,316
It is a waste for a clinic.

53
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:15,949
Gye Ji Han is a lost cause,

54
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,755
but should not you at least keep your head on straight?

55
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,795
He has made up his mind.

56
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,039
He fed someone a poisonous herb? That is nonsense.

What is the matter? Is he mentally unstable?

It is the plague.

66
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:56,430
We lost our children to it,

How could you buy all the medicinal herbs in this situation?

Sure, fine.

Hence, we will go...

168
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:27,915
to Im Soon Man's storage tonight and get all the medicinal herbs.

169
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,015
Jang Gun.

170
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,655
Hide the land certificate.

171
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,326
Will you hand the clinic over to Im Soon Man?

172
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,490
You cannot do that! I will not allow it!

173
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:38,726
We will have nowhere to go!

174
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:42,125
Who said I would hand the clinic over? Not a chance.

175
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,796
We will just get the medicinal herbs.

176
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,395
Father, have you lost your mind? Are you running a fever?

177
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,769
Do you not know what he is capable of? He will not hand them over.

178
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,779
Physician Gye, did you not have enough of his antics?

179
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,309
Come to your senses.

180
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,909
I must say, you are a lot more naive...

181
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,216
than you seem.

182
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:01,216
Let us rob his storage!

183
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:04,785
Let us go clear out his storage.

184
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,025
Jang Gun can do it too.

185
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,525
I am in!

186
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,260
No way.

187
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:14,356
Right?

188
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,145
We will go there and get everything in his storage.

189
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:33,946
Tonight!

190
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:40,919
Hangover soup!

191
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,929
That scoundrel likes to drink.

192
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,630
Every night, when the curfew bell rings,

193
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,159
he gets a bottle of liquor and hangover soup delivered to him.

194
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,495
Hangover soup!

195
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,635
That is when we will raid his storage.

196
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,535
(Liquor)

197
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:57,966
What is it?

198
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:04,576
Hangover soup.

199
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:11,316
It is the soup from Namhansanseong.

200
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,086
Oh, for Lord Im?

201
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,915
Take it to the kitchen.

202
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,796
It smells delicious.

203
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,066
Is this expensive?

204
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:28,035
Of course, it is. It has abalone in it.

205
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:31,005
I will give you a bowl each.

206
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,076
Would you spread the good word about it?

207
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,505
Sure thing!

208
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:37,106
Here.

209
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,875
Let me pour you some rice wine first.

210
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,985
- What? Rice wine? - Rice wine? Oh, my.

211
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,635
We had a break-in!

212
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:10,076
The storage is empty!

213
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,745
We got everything stolen!

214
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:15,346
Thieves!

215
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:16,590
Catch the thieves!

216
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:18,485
- Catch the thieves! - Oh, dear. Hurry and get them!

217
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:24,086
Thieves!

218
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,655
Catch the thieves!

219
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,255
What?

220
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,635
What happened?

221
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,415
My herbs.

222
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,785
My medicinal herbs. Where did it all go?

223
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,515
I had to jump through hoops to get them!

224
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:56,655
These rats.

225
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,426
These darned thieves!

226
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:03,296
The thieves ran away.

227
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:06,436
You fool. You do not have time to waste your breath!

228
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,966
Go after them!

229
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:18,576
Come on.

230
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,485
Oh, okay.

231
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:52,750
- Stop! - Get them!

232
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,846
- Stop right there! - Stop!

233
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,120
- Go after them! - Get them!

234
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,789
- Go after them! - Go!

235
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,960
You must catch the thieves no matter what!

236
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:01,590
- Do you understand? - Yes, my lord. Oh, dear.

237
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:03,059
Hurry!

238
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,226
- Move it! - Yes, my lord.

239
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,495
Go after them!

240
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,370
We got everything.

241
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:17,466
Okay, good.

242
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,635
All right.

243
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,546
I am paying him more than the market price.

244
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:29,946
Let us go!

245
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,556
Eun Woo.

246
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,559
- Stop! - Get them!

247
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,630
- Catch the thieves! - Hurry!

248
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:43,726
Hey, come on.

249
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,850
Careful. Make sure they do not get mixed up.

250
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:04,945
Yes, my lord.

251
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,415
Hurry.

252
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,130
We are back.

253
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:14,955
Oh, hey!

254
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,129
Did anything bad happen?

255
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,096
He can be brutal regarding his possessions.

256
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:20,165
It sounds like you were worried about me.

257
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:24,306
As if I would ever be worried about you.

258
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,536
Look at this.

259
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:29,776
He had this in storage.

260
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:32,246
Is this not...

261
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,385
hangsacho?

262
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:38,089
Correct. It is a rare herb,

263
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,286
but he managed to have some in storage.

264
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,685
It will work wonders on measles.

265
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,026
Let us render them into pills to give out tomorrow.

266
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,455
Sure.

267
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,846
Chin up.

268
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,076
Here you go.

269
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,695
You thieves.

270
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,925
I am sure you stole my herbs.

271
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,635
We do not appreciate nonsense so early in the morning.

272
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:29,566
Just look at yourself.

273
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,566
Are you that scared of the plague?

274
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,736
Get in line and receive a pill, then.

275
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,006
Pay more for the herbs!

276
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:40,346
I have the faintest idea as to what you are saying,

277
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:43,945
but maybe I should file a report on your behalf...

278
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,359
regarding the hoarded herbs that were stolen.

279
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,415
Or maybe I should write an appeal to His Majesty.

280
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,589
Why you... Darn it!

281
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,756
Get away from me.

282
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:54,556
Shoo!

283
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,670
I will soon have you removed from this village.

284
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,766
You wait and see.

285
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,566
Good grief.

286
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,875
Not even a tiger would be bothered to eat him.

287
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,776
Is this all we have?

288
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,220
Out of the herbs we have,

289
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,885
we made 4-Geun worth of pills, so we will have 2 nyang more.

290
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:22,026
I hope this works for now.

291
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,730
Good job, both of you.

292
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:25,826
Right.

293
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,556
Goodness.

294
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:34,365
Give it here. You already had one.

295
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,306
Darn.

296
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,846
Unbelievable.

297
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,475
Having more will not make you any better.

298
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:49,215
How are your blisters?

299
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,826
Physician Gye, you must see this.

300
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,996
The pills seem to be working.

301
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,036
We should find more hangsacho.

302
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:09,566
I see. His blisters have weakened in colour.

303
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:18,276
If this is measles, scabs should be forming by now.

304
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,276
But those purple blisters...

305
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:24,486
No, it cannot be. This has to be a coincidence.

306
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:27,086
All the dansacho was burned years ago.

307
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:35,059
Please help.

308
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,766
Please do not let my brother die.

309
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,236
Please help him.

310
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,606
Here. Let me see him.

311
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:51,705
Let me see.

312
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:58,185
Young girl, were you with him all this time?

313
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:03,385
And you are not sick?

314
00:21:08,431 --> 00:21:11,125
The disease did not spread to someone in close proximity?

315
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,796
Then...

316
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:19,606
We must move the sick to the mountain hut right away.

317
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:24,375
Hesitating increases the chance of the disease reaching Hanyang.

318
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,516
You will be held accountable.

319
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:29,420
It is why the sick are currently in quarantine.

320
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,789
We are not certain of the disease...

321
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,589
or if it is one that can cause an epidemic.

322
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,260
The medicine we are administering is effective.

323
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:36,730
We need time in order to have answers.

324
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:39,900
The sick are worried about being abandoned in the woods.

325
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:42,569
Are you suggesting we let them live among us...

326
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,326
and bring on a mass death?

327
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:48,665
Around 8 or 9 out of 10 will die once they catch the disease.

328
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:50,569
Whether they die here or at the mountain hut...

329
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,010
is no different.

330
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,776
We should at least keep the healthy safe.

331
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:57,606
Physician Gye, what are your thoughts?

332
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:01,675

Why are you running away? I will not harm you.

498
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,976
Let me go. I am not sick.

499
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,146
You must be hungry.

500
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,945
Eat this.

501
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:19,015
Are you the only one who is not sick in Surit Village?

502
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:24,325
What did you and others eat before everyone fell ill?

503
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,269
Medicinal herbs and seasoned vegetables...

504
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,765
Right, we also harvested honey and sold it to other villages.

505
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:32,836
Honey?

506
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:36,280
Do you have more of those cookies?

507
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:38,235
I will give you some honey. Let us exchange them.

508
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:56,186
Physician Gye.

509
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:58,026
Lady Seo.

510
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,669
The infected have been put under quarantine.

511
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,195
How come more people are getting infected?

512
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,035
I do not understand either.

513
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,079
I visited Surit Village earlier in the day.

514
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,106
Do you happen to recognize this flower?

515
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:20,749
A boy gave me honey made with pollen from that flower,

516
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,186
so I had some.

517
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:28,985
But I have a mild headache now.

518
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:46,276
Lady Seo, take some hyangsosan at once.

519
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,246
Why...

520
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,945
What is the matter?

521
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,026
Physician Yoo.

522
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:13,606
Excuse me. Are you all right?

523
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,555
We will all die.

524
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,959
We are all going to die! We are dying.

525
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,200
You fool. Shut your mouth!

526
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:38,396
You piece of...

527
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,566
Stop.

528
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:47,465
Break it up!

529
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,809
Come on. Stop.

530
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:50,936
This is...

531
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,226
You lunatic.

532
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,626
You talked as though you would save everyone in the world.

533
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:13,996
Is this all you can do? Come on!

534
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,566
How did you get in here?

535
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,539
I am not a fool like you.

536
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,135
I can come in here if I want to.

537
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:28,575
Why are you in such a daze when you should be treating the sick?

538
00:39:28,611 --> 00:39:30,146
How could you call yourself a physician?

539
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,575
There is nothing I can do.

540
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:36,345
I am treating them with medicine, but it is progressing rapidly.

541
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,215
Get your act together!

542
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,126
I thought you were a skilled physician. Is this all you can do?

543
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,059
You went out to look for strange herbs when I told you not to.

544
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,666
You were so full of yourself.

545
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,265
Yet you are not doing anything when your skills are needed?

546
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:52,595
You are clearly a dunce.

547
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:56,876
You must save them.

548
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:58,439
Do not give up. You must find a cure!

549
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,979
If it were something I could find,

550
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,246
I would even cross the fiery pit of death.

551
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,419
The moment you give up, you lose your patients.

552
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,015
You must believe that they can be cured for them to get better.

553
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:16,695
Lady Seo now has those blisters too.

554
00:40:22,401 --> 00:40:23,695
Are you sure?

555
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:26,135
When did it happen?

556
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,265
Today.

557
00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:34,675
You said you would even cross the fiery pit of death.

558
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:36,276
Did you really mean it?

559
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:38,615
Yes, of course.

560
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,816
Is there something you know?

561
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:46,215
Please tell me.

562
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,055
I have seen the same symptoms before.

563
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,296
Is it true?

564
00:40:55,531 --> 00:40:57,936
Then how come you have not said anything all this time?

565
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,805
If it is the same disease, those infected are bound to die.

566
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,405
How come? Is there no cure?

567
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,450
There is, but it is practically useless.

568
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:09,606
Why?

569
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,785
It is an herb called samaecho, but it is extremely poisonous.

570
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:16,285
It is so deadly that it could kill you.

571
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,416
"Haedongboncho."

572
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:27,229
(It does not grow well in Joseon's soil.)

573
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,496
Samaecho.

574
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,700
"It does not grow well in Joseon's soil."

575
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:32,470
"It died a month after it sprouted."

576
00:41:32,471 --> 00:41:35,936
(It died a month after it sprouted.)

577
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:40,575
Did you read "Haedongboncho?"

578
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,445
I found a medical textbook I had not seen before, so I read it.

579
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,215
Also, it is the link between you and my father.

580
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,916
There is no way he knows how it is connected to dansacho.

581
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:57,756
If samaecho can cure this disease,

582
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,256
I will find it.

583
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:01,825
It does not grow in Joseon.

584
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:05,195
You are wrong. There is something you missed.

585
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,340
Look. "We turned the soil over."

586
00:42:09,341 --> 00:42:12,079
"We found a cool, moist, and windy spot..."

587
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,546
"that fits all the conditions that it likes and planted it again."

588
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,916
That means...

589
00:42:22,051 --> 00:42:24,885
they grew the plant somewhere.

590
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:31,695
(Samaecho)

591
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,086
I do not know what it was about,

592
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,316
but there was a map hidden inside the book.

593
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,925
There was a hidden map?

594
00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:03,655
Yes.

595
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,526
I will find it no matter what.

596
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:09,425
I will find it and save people.

597
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:31,416
A high altitude.

598
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:40,996
Where cool, dry winds blow.

599
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,606
I will find it no matter what.

600
00:44:12,031 --> 00:44:14,865
I have been ordered to burn down the huts along with Yoo Se Yeob.

601
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:05,476
We are ready. We await your orders, sir.

602
00:45:06,651 --> 00:45:07,816
Okay.

603
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,155
Eun Woo.

604
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,465
You cannot enter this place.

605
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,166
I told you to stay away.

606
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,265
What are you trying to do here?

607
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:30,376
Do not tell me that you will burn this place down.

608
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,146
It is none of your business.

609
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,376
Return to the clinic at once.

610
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,345
I have contracted the plague too.

611
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,155
What?

612
00:45:47,131 --> 00:45:48,526
Is it true?

613
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:51,925
So I will go in there with the others who are also sick.

614
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:55,496
If you set the place on fire, you will kill me as well.

615
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:59,066
No, Eun Woo. I cannot let you enter this place.

616
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,965
Return to the clinic at once to receive treatment.

617
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:03,206
Leave now!

618
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:07,006
What is going on here?

619
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,086
Why are you here? Where is Physician Yoo?

620
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:19,086
He is a useless physician who cannot even perform acupuncture.

621
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:21,430
It is why I sent him out to find the herb...

622
00:46:21,431 --> 00:46:22,726
that would cure this illness.

623
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:26,726
How dare you violate a national command.

624
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,666
Anyone who disobeys my orders...

625
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:39,235
will be beheaded.

626
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:43,546
Await further instructions.

627
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,526
This is the final location.

628
00:47:03,531 --> 00:47:05,666
Please...

629
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,635
Please.

630
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:23,215
All hope is lost.

631
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,485
Where did you go leaving the sick behind?

632
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,626
I did not abandon anyone.

633
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:53,135
I am returning from my search to find the cure.

634
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,635
Did I not warn you that you could only leave the hut in death?

635
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,546
Defiance will not be tolerated.

636
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,115
I can cure the sick.

637
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,345
If you are to off me,

638
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,385
do so after I render these herbs.

639
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:16,425
I beg of you.

640
00:50:20,301 --> 00:50:21,965
The herbs will be delivered.

641
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:27,566
However, this is where your body will lie.

642
00:50:34,529 --> 00:50:35,624
Why?

643
00:50:36,529 --> 00:50:38,195
Why is this necessary?

644
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:46,235
It is not because I disobeyed your order.

645
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:52,774
Is there another reason as to why you must kill me?

646
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:57,715
This is not personal.

647
00:50:58,819 --> 00:51:00,515
You must die...

648
00:51:01,489 --> 00:51:02,985
for the stability of this nation...

649
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:05,885
and the royal family.

650
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,524
Do you not hear how preposterous that is?

651
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:10,124
What am I, anyway?

652
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:14,965
I am sorry.

653
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,385
You have a fever.

654
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,285
And blisters have formed.

655
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,754
Such nonsense...

656
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,195
You have the plague.

657
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,735
Royal Inspector Cho.

658
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:55,934
Royal Inspector Cho!

659
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,555
The mountain hut will be burned down!

660
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:20,995
The mountain hut will be burned down!

661
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,175
Reckless, I see.

662
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:32,974
I am carrying out a royal command,

663
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:34,644
so step aside!

664
00:52:34,949 --> 00:52:36,778
Are you saying that His Majesty...

665
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,889
ordered the sick to be locked in a hut...

666
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:41,015
and burned with the illness?

667
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,354
That is utter nonsense.

668
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:45,084
Utter nonsense?

669
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:49,124
Imprison those who defy.

670
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,495
Starting with him.

671
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,894
I will not treat and protect...

672
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,965
the patients who seek me out.

673
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,805
Harm them in any way,

674
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,735
and I will shed blood.

675
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,535
You will die with us all!

676
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,175
Devoted, I see.

677
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:10,414
Are you that willing to die?

678
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,445
Sure. Kill me already!

679
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,615
No, do not harm my father.

680
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,655
Such morons.

681
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:24,925
Arrest them all!

682
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,265
Lock arms.

683
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,495
Do not dare.

684
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,235
Hold your ground.

685
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,968
Let go of me!

686
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:35,979
- Do not waste time. - You...

687
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,075
Darn you all!

688
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,750
Fine.

689
00:53:38,751 --> 00:53:41,015
- Hold your ground. - I will burn the place down myself.

690
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:43,374
Move!

691
00:53:44,049 --> 00:53:45,144
Stop!

692
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,414
Stop what you are doing.

693
00:53:51,029 --> 00:53:52,124
Dunce, is that you?

694
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:56,155
I have the cure. We can save everyone.

695
00:53:58,029 --> 00:53:59,124
Royal Inspector Cho?

696
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,334
Explain yourself!

697
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,664
The royal inspector is also sick.

698
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,035
Move him inside so that he can be treated.

699
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:11,945
You... How dare you.

700
00:54:12,509 --> 00:54:13,604
You...

701
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,115
Are we good?

702
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:21,515
Again with the gloating. Head on, then.

703
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,425
Physician Gye.

704
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:30,099
Father, this is the cure.

705
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,669
We can save everyone!

706
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,024
Do not touch that.

707
00:54:34,299 --> 00:54:37,834
No one is to touch the herb until instructed.

708
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,814
Lady Eun Woo?

709
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:18,175
Now tell me.

710
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,974
How is that plant used?

711
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:23,774
It is not a plague.

712
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:29,854
This illness. Is it caused by the herb called dansacho?

713
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:34,394
Its antidote is samaecho,

714
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,925
and the symptoms of the current plague.

715
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,024
Dansacho could be the only cause.

716
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,765
Am I right?

717
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:02,914
Yes.

718
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:08,524
It is poisonous,

719
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,965
but it is also the only cure for leprosy.

720
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,039
Dansacho got mixed in...

721
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,974
with the vegetables and honey the children gathered.

722
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,309
That is how they all got sick.

723
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,644
Thank you.

724
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,684
My old master used to live in Surit Village.

725
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,985
That is where we studied dansacho,

726
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,584
and where my master completed writing "Haedongboncho."

727
00:56:40,089 --> 00:56:44,524
Did you find out how much samaecho is needed to cure the sick?

728
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:49,164
My master...

729
00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:53,535
was murdered by someone.

730
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:58,245
I survived because I was a coward and hid behind a tree.

731
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:05,414
My excuse...

732
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,854
was that...

733
00:57:09,089 --> 00:57:11,985
I needed to survive to spread my master's knowledge.

734
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:17,325
That is why...

735
00:57:18,929 --> 00:57:20,825
I can do nothing but drink now.

736
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:28,805
They are scary people. Do you understand?

737
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,345
One wrong move and we all die.

738
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:35,115
Who did such a thing?

739
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,885
I will tell you if we get out alive.

740
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:41,555
That is why...

741
00:57:42,089 --> 00:57:44,655
you must never mention dansacho.

742
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:48,254
Just pretend samaecho is the cure to the plague.

743
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:53,325
Very well. Tell me what must be done and how much we must use.

744
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,834
Eun Woo is very ill.

745
00:57:57,569 --> 00:58:00,405
The only way to know is to test it on people.

746
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:19,754
You...

747
00:58:20,359 --> 00:58:22,595
Spit it out. Even a small amount can be deadly.

748
00:58:26,629 --> 00:58:29,664
Dansacho is more deadly when dried than when freshly picked,

749
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,704
and samaecho works as a cure once blisters have formed.

750
00:58:34,109 --> 00:58:35,504
You crazy...

751
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,655
Here. Eat this, quick!

752
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,874
Stay with me. Yoo Se Yeob!

753
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:17,345
Yoo Se Yeob, snap out of it!

754
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,115
Yoo Se Yeob.

755
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,754
Yoo Se Yeob! Wake up!

756
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:49,814
Young Master. You are awake.

757
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:57,119
Man Bok. What happened?

758
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,425
Stay still.

759
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,899
Good. This is good.

760
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,599
How is this good?

761
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,894
You had a fever all night.

762
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,834
My gosh.

763
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,579
Your blisters had gone,

764
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,305
but you did not wake up.

765
01:00:17,879 --> 01:00:20,874
I thought you would not wake for good and...

766
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:23,615
Eun Woo. How is she?

767
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:25,144
Well, she...

768
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,454
Young Ma...

769
01:00:36,129 --> 01:00:37,294
Eun Woo.

770
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:43,564
Physician Yoo.

771
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,144
Eun Woo.

772
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,655
Are you all right?

773
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,485
Can you speak and see?

774
01:01:05,759 --> 01:01:07,254
Are you okay?

775
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,294
You look worse than she does.

776
01:01:12,429 --> 01:01:13,925
You are worried about her?

777
01:01:15,069 --> 01:01:16,265
Yes.

778
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,805
The plant you brought back cured me.

779
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:22,274
I can see,

780
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,675
and I feel better.

781
01:01:25,779 --> 01:01:29,044
Why did you do something so rash?

782
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,555
You could die. I had no time to think.

783
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:19,024
Why did you save me?

784
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:22,834
When I tried to kill you.

785
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,235
Because you are my patient.

786
01:02:34,279 --> 01:02:35,974
I would like you to...

787
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:38,785
write a report...

788
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:42,055
saying it is not a plague but a sickness that does not spread.

789
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:48,595
If you say it is a plague, they will command you to burn the huts.

790
01:02:50,659 --> 01:02:52,724
Save the villagers.

791
01:02:54,429 --> 01:02:56,164
Why must we give up on them...

792
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,405
when they can be cured?

793
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,914
If I eat this, will it make me better?

794
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:19,325
This is what I ate to get better.

795
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:24,394
I heard you went to some island to find this.

796
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:27,195
Is that true?

797
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,095
Yes.

798
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:32,365
I brought back enough, so do not worry.

799
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:35,175
This was...

800
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,474
all it took to save us?

801
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:45,845
My gosh...

802
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,015
My goodness...

803
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,555
My poor babies who died...

804
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,954
If we had had this,

805
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,495
if there had been someone like you then,

806
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,934
they would not have died like that.

807
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:14,845
I am sorry.

808
01:04:15,949 --> 01:04:19,745
Oh, dear...

809
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,805
Sorak Village's plague...

810
01:04:49,949 --> 01:04:51,445
Am I right?

811
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:53,615
Yes.

812
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,689
Dansacho got mixed in with the vegetables...

813
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:58,555
and honey the children gathered.

814
01:04:59,089 --> 01:05:00,925
That is how they all got sick.

815
01:05:15,609 --> 01:05:17,535
It is an unidentified disease that is not infectious.

816
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,479
The medicine I gave right before we burned down the huts...

817
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,745
took effect right away,

818
01:05:24,179 --> 01:05:26,885
so the disease is now gone from Sorak Village.

819
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:29,015
As for Physician Yoo Se Yeob,

820
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,454
I will take care of him as per your order,

821
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:33,024
so do not be concerned.

822
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:40,894
One says it was an unidentified disease,

823
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:46,004
and the other one says it was caused by dansacho.

824
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,604
Who should I believe?

825
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,804
Why did you try to kill me?

826
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:30,849
The late King passed away because of my foolish mistake.

827
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:34,214
I am a mere physician who was banished from the Palace.

828
01:06:34,589 --> 01:06:35,684
So why?

829
01:06:35,919 --> 01:06:38,628
Your father is the powerful Second State Councillor.

830
01:06:38,629 --> 01:06:41,384
I do not understand why you tried to take my life.

831
01:06:43,329 --> 01:06:44,455
Why?

832
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,394
Tell me.

833
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:55,174
Was it...

834
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:58,905
the Second State Councillor?

835
01:07:06,049 --> 01:07:07,144
You did...

836
01:07:07,789 --> 01:07:09,184
unsheathe your sword...

837
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:12,354
but could not actually do it.

838
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,695
Now,

839
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,195
are you going to kill me?

840
01:07:42,589 --> 01:07:44,319
- Do you know this medicinal herb? - This is...

841
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,889
If someone poisoned the late King with dansacho,

842
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:48,159
I must uncover the truth!

843
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,659
This is not just about you. Everyone at the clinic...

844
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:52,495
No. Everyone in Sorak Village will be put in danger!

845
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,695
Was it a coincidence that Eun Woo got hurt?

846
01:07:55,999 --> 01:07:58,269
It is possible that they sent another assassin.

847
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:00,769
It is my fault. I should have followed her.

848
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:01,838
You? Why?

849
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:04,809
The tiger cub got his hands on the crucial evidence...

850
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,409
that the late King was killed by poison?

851
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:08,415
I will not forgive anyone...

852
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,678
who hurts Eun Woo.

853
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:12,115
Likewise.
