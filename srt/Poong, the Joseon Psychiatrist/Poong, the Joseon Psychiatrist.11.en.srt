Wol.

5
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:46,126
- No, Physician Yoo.
- Wol is dead.

6
00:01:46,596 --> 00:01:48,195
Even so, Physician Yoo!

7
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:55,635
Even so,

8
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:58,676
if they were to kill you as well,

9
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:02,146
there will be no one left to tell her story.

10
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,775
But...

11
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:07,176
Do not go.

12
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:12,585
Where have you been?

13
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:19,696
A fool dared to...

14
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:23,266
stab a member of our clan.

15
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:26,766
That is why I was late.

16
00:02:29,606 --> 00:02:31,375
Please spare me, my lord.

17
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:35,146
You know I did so out of loyalty, my lord!

18
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:57,796
Pull yourself together, Physician Yoo.

19
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:00,965
We must get away from here. Stay strong.

20
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:24,595
Darn you.

21
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,926
He told me to kill the brat.

22
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:28,896
What are they up to now?

23
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:35,805
Why did you not kill him?

24
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:42,176
I asked why you have not gotten rid of Yoo Se Yeob yet!

25
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:44,245
Give me one more chance, Father.

26
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:46,845
Please.

27
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:53,555
Prove to me...

28
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:57,486
that you are not weak.

29
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:00,055
I will.

30
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,396
I will take care of Yoo Se Yeob...

31
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:07,965
and retrieve the stiletto needle at all costs.

32
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:23,945
There is something you two must finish.

33
00:04:39,836 --> 00:04:41,466
Are you all right?

34
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,805
The blade went in pretty deep.

35
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:58,185
If you were to cut me down now,

36
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:01,526
would your father not suspect you?

37
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,955
That you killed me because of a guilty conscience?

38
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,666
What you took from me.

39
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:15,565
Hand it over.

40
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:23,075
I have no idea what you mean.

41
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:37,695
You just as good as showed me your hand.

42
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:42,265
That object you speak of. It must be very important.

43
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:51,106
You must hurry with the task your father gave you.

44
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,606
The harvest is fast approaching.

45
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,776
I will need your help...

46
00:05:56,945 --> 00:05:59,546

You cannot go further like this.

Physician Yoo.

I keep...

52
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:24,866
failing to protect those close to me.

53
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:32,276
You could not have prevented it.

54
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:34,846
Even I did not think...

55
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,375
Sin Woo would do such a thing.

56
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:41,716
I was...

57
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:44,315
too foolish.

58
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:54,395
Do not beat yourself up.

59
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:57,296
Please do not do that.

60
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,695
You are...

61
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,435
the biggest victim.

62
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,176
Punishment is...

63
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:08,046
for those who have sinned.

64
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:43,576
Oh, dear.

65
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:47,476
What if something bad happened to my young master?

66
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,545
Do not cry.

67
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:51,915
Stop whining, will you?

68
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:54,586
Here. You should eat something and cheer up.

69
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:57,025
I do not want any.

70
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,395
Just eat this!

71
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:05,365
My gosh. Do not worry. They are both incredibly clever.

72
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:07,135
And Wol can talk now,

73
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:10,134
so she just needs to return home safely now.

74
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:11,135
Oh, boy.

75
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:14,505
Should we reach out to His Majesty for help?

76
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:16,545
Who knows what else could happen?

77
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:18,615
Father, go to Hanyang at once...

78
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:20,346
- and speak with His Majesty.
- Yes.

79
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:22,245
Do I have a title?

80
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:23,715
I have no connections now.

81
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:25,086
How could I meet the King?

82
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:26,586
Oh, dear.

83
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:28,056
Then shall I go instead?

84
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:30,785
I will just pretend to be the Queen.

85
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:33,456
You should pretend to be the Queen Mother.

86
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:36,425
I am too young for that!

87
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:40,165
You were born in the Year of the Black Horse.

88
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:43,005
You are 40 years older than His Majesty!

89
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:44,206
What are you talking about?

90
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:45,236
It is true...

91
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:48,004
I am 19 this year.

92
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,005
My gosh!

93
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:54,116
- Young Master!
- Lady Seo.

94
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:55,785
My gosh!

95
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:56,785
My lady.

96
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:59,616
Thank goodness.

97
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:03,486
Where is Wol?

98
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:15,706
Wol is...

99
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:20,576
dead.

100
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:25,675
What?

101
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:27,875
- No...
- What?

102
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:29,545
What do you mean?

103
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:31,755
Why did she suddenly die?

104
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:33,956
What happened?

105
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:40,625
- My lady.
- Wol...

106
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:42,726
- No!
- My gosh.

107
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:45,366
- Wol...
- My pretty Wol. That sweet child.

108
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:48,966
- Wol...
- No! She is so young!

109
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:51,606
- What do we do?
- Wol...

110
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,076
- Oh, dear.
- Wol...

111
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,375
Wol...

112
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,874
Wol... No...

113
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,675
Wol...

114
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:03,414
- No.
- That beautiful child.

115
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:04,985
- Please, no...
- Poor child...

116
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:06,455
- Calm down.
- No...

117
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:07,856
That poor child.

118
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:10,525
Wol...

119
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,175
So? What will you do now?

120
00:11:30,145 --> 00:11:31,306
Get me a horse.

121
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:32,946
I must go to Hanyang.

122
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:36,216
You cannot go anywhere in that state.

123
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:38,686
You must be devastated too.

124
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:40,655
I must...

125
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:42,826
inform His Majesty.

126
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,525
The Second State Councilor was clearly involved in this.

127
00:11:45,925 --> 00:11:47,155
He must be punished.

128
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:49,565
Wol, the sole witness, is gone now.

129
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:51,466
What will you do in Hanyang?

130
00:11:58,306 --> 00:11:59,505
I will go with you.

131
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:04,846
No.

132
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:06,946
- You absolutely cannot...
- Since you have been banished,

133
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:09,245
you cannot even pass the gates on your own.

134
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:13,316
I have a visitor's pass issued by His Majesty,

135
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:14,785
so do not worry.

136
00:12:15,326 --> 00:12:17,524
The Second State Councilor must still be looking for you,

137
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:19,125
so you should not use that pass.

138
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,226
I have an idea, so please let me go with you.

139
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:26,336
Okay.

140
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:32,106
Do as she says.

141
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,645
Is there anything I can do to help you?

142
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:40,716
Stay here...

143
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:43,086
and find out what Commander Im is up to.

144
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:45,216
Im Soon Man?

145
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,556
Yes. He is conspiring with the Second State Councilor.

146
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:50,425
Tail him and find out what he is up to.

147
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:54,025
Okay, I will.

148
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:19,055
Do not leave me alone. You cannot leave.

149
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:20,316
I will find you.

150
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:23,185
- I will drag you back here!
- Please, do not abandon me.

151
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:24,794
- Do not leave!
- How dare you...

152
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:26,596
- Do not abandon us!
- sell your own children?

153
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:28,125
Just for that?

154
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:29,826
Die!

155
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:57,524
What is he doing?

156
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:58,655
Father, come out at once!

157
00:13:58,925 --> 00:13:59,925
Hey, you!

158
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:05,366
I...

159
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:08,436
I am sorry for everything.

160
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:13,535
No!

161
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,775
It was not my fault.

162
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,545
What happened was...

163
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:20,346
They put that in there.

164
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:22,015
That is why there was not enough.

165
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:25,285
- It is okay, Jang Gun.
- Please spare me.

166
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:27,616
Please do not hit me.

167
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:34,295
Darn it. Not a day goes by quietly here.

168
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,466
Does he have a mental illness?

169
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:39,436
What is that? He keeps talking nonsense.

170
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,134
It is like being sick in the head.

171
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:43,806
People often say they are possessed.

172
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:47,375
Your master specializes in treating people like him.

173
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:49,645
He had to show up when that dunce was not here.

174
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,885
Are you two married?

175
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:58,015
We got married two years ago.

176
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:01,415
My husband and I wish to start a business in Hanyang.

177
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:02,785
I see.

178
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,285
Pass.

179
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,495
Eun Woo. Without the pass, I am afraid we cannot...

180
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,106
Just a moment.

181
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:26,875
Your name is Yoo Se...

182
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:30,316
Poong?

183
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:36,226
Where are you from?

184
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:42,066
Cheongju. Sorak...

185
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:46,295
We are...

186
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:48,135
from Sorak Village.

187
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:51,265
(Yoo Se Poong)

188
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,035
Pass.

189
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:57,505
Wait, you.

190
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:06,616
You two.

191
00:16:07,915 --> 00:16:09,885
What brings you to Hanyang?

192
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,596
Oh.

193
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:15,596
That is...

194
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:19,236
My husband and I wish to get a house in Hanyang.

195
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:28,744
We got married a year ago.

196
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,505
He is planning to take the civil service examination.

197
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:36,186
You may go.

198
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:58,706
Eun Woo.

199
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:00,236
Yes?

200
00:17:00,905 --> 00:17:03,045
Thank you for coming with me.

201
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:06,246
However,

202
00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:09,945
you will not get involved in anything dangerous. Promise me.

203
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:15,455
Yes. As I promised, I will only help you with my cleverness.

204
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,796
The bugs...

205
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,165
are gnawing away at my flesh.

206
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:31,366
Please save me.

207
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:34,135
You are not dying! Do not be such a crybaby!

208
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:37,445
I can see that his energy and blood flow is slightly disrupted.

209
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:40,116
So what could be causing his pain?

210
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:45,954
- My gosh.
- Is that the best you can do?

211
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:48,385
All I did was touch his arm.

212
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,225
Jang Gun, it seems as though he needs anshintang.

213
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:55,366
But we are out of wild jujube seeds and sweet flag.

214
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,895
What the...

215
00:17:57,965 --> 00:17:59,694
Get ready to go to the market, then.

216
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:02,606
When it is almost time for our next meal?

217
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:05,276
Would you prefer it to be your last meal?

218
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:08,945
I am ready and will head out.

219
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:10,375
Off I go.

220
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:16,286
Why do you not have wild jujube seeds or sweet flag?

221
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:20,316
They have been in high demand lately.

222
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:22,525
Has there been an increase in patients with mental disorders?

223
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:23,684
Tell me about it.

224
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,955
Maybe it is the aftermath of the plague.

225
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,066
Get out, I told you!

226
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:34,195
I will sell my wife if I must to make good on the money.

227
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:37,205
All I ask for is one smoke worth of opium.

228
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,836
The pain is too much to bear.

229
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:44,506
Whenever the wind blows, it cuts into my skin.

230
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:48,746
If you are that desperate, sell your wife for the money first.

231
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:50,415
Get lost!

232
00:19:02,996 --> 00:19:05,836
Confucian classics are over there, others are over here.

233
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:07,735
It is two nyang per book.

234
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:10,806
You are not someone I recognize.

235
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,106
When did you open this new bookstore?

236
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:17,704
Why do you ask? Must one ask for your permission...

237
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:19,776
in order to do business here?

238
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:23,616
Forget about the books.

239
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:26,385
How about some opium?

240
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,026
Show me that you can pay first.

241
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:47,576
Is this a joke?

242
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,905
This is not enough for even a single smoke.

243
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,215
Run along, then.

244
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:55,786
Is it that expensive?

245
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,016
Well...

246
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:02,086
What I sell is nothing like the usual opium you will find.

247
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:05,755
Let me see your product, then.

248
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:08,296
I will have him bring the rest of the money.

249
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:21,875
Take a look.

250
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:25,215
The color of it is nothing like what you have seen before.

251
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:35,786
But... This must have been dissolved in water once.

252
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:37,985
That is why it is killer!

253
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:39,955
Do you have a pipe?

254
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:43,425
How dare you sell this wicked powder.

255
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:46,465
You made this? Name your manufacturer!

256
00:20:48,235 --> 00:20:49,704
Dong Pal!

257
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:51,735
Yes? Did you summon me, my lord?

258
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,475
- Get them out of my face.
- Yes, my lord.

259
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:00,346
Why you...

260
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:07,856
You must go through me first in order to reach him.

261
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:12,195
Tell me. Do you wish for a broken bone?

262
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:16,665
Emotionally, it has been a depressing day for me.

263
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:20,336
Just know that breaking a bone in my body...

264
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:23,165
will cost you one of yours as well.

265
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:27,675
You little punk.

266
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:31,705
Gosh, that must hurt.

267
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,485
My gosh!

268
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:38,915
Goodness me.

269
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:44,356
This is the last time I will ask nicely.

270
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:46,326
Who made this?

271
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,326
Who?

272
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:06,776
Follow me.

273
00:22:38,246 --> 00:22:39,316
Your Majesty.

274
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:43,816
Se Yeob.

275
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:51,925
Who is this young lady?

276
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:54,256
She is a physician at Gyesoo Clinic.

277
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:56,026
She is here to aid me.

278
00:22:57,665 --> 00:22:58,695
I see.

279
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:03,165
Tell me about Wol. Has her condition improved?

280
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:09,506
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

281
00:23:12,116 --> 00:23:13,316
I failed...

282
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:16,945
to protect Wol.

283
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:24,586
Do not forgive your foolish subject...

284
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:27,796
who failed you.

285
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:45,145
The body was kept in Seobinggo.

286
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:51,745
She is the royal court taster...

287
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:53,715
who risked her life trying to inform me of the truth.

288
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:56,325
I cannot trust those at the Medical Office...

289
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:58,026
which is why you must do the autopsy yourself.

290
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:06,895
- My lady!
- What on earth?

291
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:09,965
What happened to you? Please wake up!

292
00:24:10,506 --> 00:24:13,506
There is a court maid who was involved...

293
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:19,816
in the death of the former King.

294
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,627
It is the same discoloration found in dansacho poisoning.

295
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,327
Then...

296
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,367
Are you saying traces of dansacho lie within her blood?

297
00:25:53,698 --> 00:25:54,728
Yes.

298
00:25:55,228 --> 00:25:56,896
Those who murdered the royal food taster...

299
00:25:56,897 --> 00:25:58,768
poisoned the former King with dansacho as well.

300
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:01,337
The stiletto needle is proof of that.

301
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:04,307
The color of the boils on the court lady's skin...

302
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:06,147
is like that of the boils we had during the plague.

303
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:10,217
That is correct. I am afraid...

304
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:13,188
Then the disease that ripped through the village...

305
00:26:14,018 --> 00:26:15,557
The one I suffered from.

306
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:18,157
It wasn't the plague.

307
00:26:24,627 --> 00:26:26,667
Do you have an answer for me?

308
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:31,438
You must know by now...

309
00:26:32,438 --> 00:26:33,667
what this is.

310
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:39,778
This is given to the best physician in the Medical Office.

311
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:41,278
The pattern tells me...

312
00:26:41,778 --> 00:26:43,617
it is most definitely from the royal family.

313
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:46,688
Is that so?

314
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,887
Why is it discolored?

315
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:53,057
Look only.

316
00:26:56,897 --> 00:26:59,768
It seems to have been exposed to a very rare and deadly poison.

317
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,228
A poison?

318
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,468
Have you heard anything about how the former king died?

319
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:14,178
There is a rumor...

320
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,978
that he was poisoned.

321
00:27:18,548 --> 00:27:19,548
Poisoned?

322
00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:31,998
On this prime plot of land,

323
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:34,727
there is nothing but a crumbling clinic.

324
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:36,336
If I were in charge,

325
00:27:36,337 --> 00:27:39,606
I would have built it up to be grander than the grandest pavilion.

326
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:41,438
Hand over Gyesoo Clinic.

327
00:27:42,637 --> 00:27:45,508
The reason he kept wanting to take over the clinic.

328
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:48,678
If it were because he needed land to grow opium poppy...

329
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:52,948
The Gumiho case blocked his route to steal tributes from the King,

330
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:56,316
so he tried to take over the clinic to distribute opium.

331
00:27:56,317 --> 00:27:57,657
When that did not work,

332
00:27:58,117 --> 00:28:00,827
he sold opium through the bookstore?

333
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:04,097
I will sell my wife if I must to make good on the money.

334
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:07,268
All I ask for is one smoke worth of opium.

335
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:11,038
Im Soon Man has sided with the Second State Councilor.

336
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:14,106
If I find proof he is distributing opium...

337
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:15,238
to bribe the Councilor,

338
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:17,978
it will help build a case against him.

339
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:33,127
Starting today, harvest three times as much.

340
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:35,288
So we will be done in ten days.

341
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:37,327
That could get us caught.

342
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,167
I have someone watching my back.

343
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:44,198
I will send this all over Joseon...

344
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:46,837
and turn my life around.

345
00:28:49,807 --> 00:28:51,678
Quit slacking off and get moving!

346
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:53,048
Okay?

347
00:28:57,617 --> 00:29:01,018
Im Soon Man is selling opium that can be smoked.

348
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:03,617
Opium for smoking?

349
00:29:04,357 --> 00:29:05,728
The commander...

350
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:08,688
is making his own people sick and some even die.

351
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:10,758
You must arrest him immediately.

352
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,998
How did you find out?

353
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:17,468
I confirmed the new bookstore owner is selling it in secret.

354
00:29:17,897 --> 00:29:20,337
Then the first step is to bring him in for questioning.

355
00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:22,607
Im Soon Man is a crafty schemer.

356
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,837
He might find a way out.

357
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,907
I cannot go after the commander first without proof.

358
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:45,127
I have bad news.

359
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:47,268
The magistrate will arrest you soon.

360
00:29:47,528 --> 00:29:50,167
What? What right does that fool have?

361
00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:52,268
What is it about?

362
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:55,038
The Gyesoo physician happened to catch the new bookstore owner.

363
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:57,178
That darn Gye Ji Han.

364
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:00,948
He upset my table again?

365
00:30:01,678 --> 00:30:02,678
Get my litter.

366
00:30:02,847 --> 00:30:03,847
We must hurry.

367
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:05,577
- My litter!
- What?

368
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,287
You fool. Hurry, get me a horse.

369
00:30:09,288 --> 00:30:10,288
- Now!
- Okay.

(Do not pass)

371
00:30:22,097 --> 00:30:25,238
We must spend the night here.

372

Where are we?

373
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:34,048
This is...

374
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,218
my home.

375
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:40,317
It is the home of a criminal,

376
00:30:40,617 --> 00:30:41,817
so it is rundown and a mess.

377
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,458
No.

378
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:47,688
It is grand.

379
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:53,627

381
00:31:20,428 --> 00:31:23,458
This house is like you.

382
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:29,538
Is it because I was born and raised here?

383
00:31:33,837 --> 00:31:35,837
Where are you going dressed like that?

384
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:37,738
I was summoned to the Palace. I must hurry.

385
00:31:37,907 --> 00:31:39,038
No, wait.

386
00:31:40,077 --> 00:31:41,647
I said I was in a hurry.

387
00:31:48,988 --> 00:31:49,988
It was here...

388
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,317
where I lost my mother.

389
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:57,298
I swore never to lose anyone else,

390
00:31:58,298 --> 00:32:00,498
and that is why I became a physician.

391
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:03,667
Yet again,

392
00:32:05,597 --> 00:32:06,938
I lost my father.

393
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:12,008
I lost too many people.

394
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:19,518
Physician Yoo. Give me your hand.

395
00:32:34,498 --> 00:32:35,498
Simmun.

396
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:40,137
Sobu.

397
00:32:44,137 --> 00:32:46,708
Do you not feel more relaxed?

398
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:52,278
You used the pressure points that help control the heart.

399
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:54,188
You are smarter than I am.

400

You agitate Simmun when you are upset, like now,

401
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:06,198
and when one is possessed by spirits. Correct?

402
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,497
Yes. Well done.

403
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,147
Controlling the mind...

404
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:23,377
My lord!

405
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:31,488
My lord.

406
00:33:32,258 --> 00:33:34,028
I need you to help me out.

How dare you come here?

408
00:33:38,298 --> 00:33:39,298
Throw him out.

409
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:40,567
My lord.

410
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:44,198
I have the stiletto needle.

411
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,897
Do you know?

412
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:51,278
The stiletto needle that was used on the former king...

413
00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:54,848
is discolored because it was exposed to poison.

414
00:33:55,477 --> 00:33:56,477
And...

415
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:58,977
you want the physician who used that needle dead,

416
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:01,787
and also a court maid who worked at the Royal Kitchen.

417
00:34:04,587 --> 00:34:09,727
I smell something almost like treason, my lord.

418
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,448
My lord.

419
00:34:36,218 --> 00:34:37,758
If you kill me now,

420
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:39,787
the stiletto needle...

421
00:34:40,428 --> 00:34:42,957
will be delivered to His Majesty.

422
00:34:43,897 --> 00:34:45,028
Do you not care?

423
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:51,098
Why would you ask me that?

424
00:34:54,037 --> 00:34:55,037
What?

425
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,837
Is there a reason...

426
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,448
the King should not see that needle?

427
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:03,647
Well...

428
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:14,158
It is of no concern to me.

429
00:35:15,457 --> 00:35:16,528
Do whatever you wish.

430
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:27,968
Save me, my lord.

431

All I want...

432
00:35:31,278 --> 00:35:33,948
is to be in the same boat as you.

433
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:36,348
Would I dare...

434
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:39,488
offer up that stiletto needle?

435
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:51,397
So,

436
00:35:52,897 --> 00:35:54,497
what is it you want?

437
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:59,037
Stop Sorak Village's district governor...

438
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:01,037
from destroying the opium farm.

439
00:36:01,437 --> 00:36:04,437
I just need you to write a letter.

440
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:07,848
Now, I serve...

441
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:10,477
no one but you.

442
00:36:11,178 --> 00:36:13,047
Once the opium is harvested,

443
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:16,048
I will give you the stiletto needle too.

444
00:37:04,468 --> 00:37:06,868
Your father was found...

445
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:10,138
with a discolored stiletto needle in his hand.

446
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:17,517
The man who stabbed me probably took the needle.

447
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:23,457
Your father was murdered.

448
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:48,008

- Do not worry.

Did you work for Commander Im?

501
00:41:59,508 --> 00:42:01,449
No, I did not.

502
00:42:01,548 --> 00:42:04,619
My lord, please do not hit me.

503
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:08,119
Could you tell us what happened?

504
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:20,098
Stop.

505
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,969
I should just die.

506
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:23,738
I...

507
00:42:25,068 --> 00:42:29,979
I sold my own family off...

508
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,608
Because of opium!

509
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:39,179
Stop, please. Stop hurting yourself.

510
00:42:41,488 --> 00:42:44,659
You said you sold your family. Where did you take them?

511
00:42:45,488 --> 00:42:46,789
Tell us.

512
00:42:47,389 --> 00:42:49,028
I do not know.

513
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:52,858
My lord, please help me.

514
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:55,298
Please save my children.

515
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:57,298
The people from the clinic must be there too.

516
00:42:58,139 --> 00:42:59,639
They are like our family.

517
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,479
I beg of you. Please tell us.

518
00:43:03,738 --> 00:43:06,079
You cannot run away from them for the rest of your life.

519
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:08,749
You must tell us where it is. Only then can we punish him.

520
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:11,148
Tell us. Where is it?

521
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:15,148
I do not know.

522
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:16,858
I know nothing!

523
00:43:27,298 --> 00:43:28,429
The dark land.

524
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:33,769
The blackened land.

525
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:40,108
And once night falls...

526
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:42,849
You hear those darn ghosts!

527
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:46,988
I am scared. I am terrified!

528
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:49,418
I told you.

529
00:43:50,389 --> 00:43:52,659
You must never follow them.

530
00:43:54,028 --> 00:43:55,559
It is a scary place.

531
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:00,668
Granny, do you know the place he is talking about?

532
00:44:01,168 --> 00:44:02,369
Why is it scary?

533
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:04,699
It is terrifying.

534
00:44:05,668 --> 00:44:08,108
The barbarians will kill us all.

535
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:13,449
I told you that they left our soil in the Year of the Red Ox.

536
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:17,378
Before they leave,

537
00:44:18,048 --> 00:44:20,318
they will kill everyone.

538
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:22,949
They will drag us away.

539
00:44:29,758 --> 00:44:31,099
What is it?

540
00:44:31,528 --> 00:44:32,829
Have you figured it out?

541
00:44:37,438 --> 00:44:38,499
Physician Yoo.

542
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,179
Physician Yoo.

543
00:44:55,949 --> 00:44:57,918
You can put it in here. I brought limewater.

544
00:44:58,488 --> 00:44:59,558
I am boiling sumac, ginkgo,

545
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:00,829
monkshood roots, and aconiti tuber together.

546
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:03,059
It smells awful.

547
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:04,898
The more it stinks, the better.

548
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:08,898
Although the books said to use caper spurge too, a poisonous herb.

549
00:45:08,969 --> 00:45:10,938
We do not have time, so this will do.

550
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:12,869
Caper spurge?

551
00:45:15,008 --> 00:45:17,409
This is it here.

552
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:20,608
I will put in some of this too.

553
00:45:36,798 --> 00:45:38,929
How dare you sleep on the job.

554
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:40,469
Strike him!

555
00:45:43,798 --> 00:45:46,369
Move your behinds and get to work.

556
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:21,208
What on earth are these things?

557
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:27,778
Is this not the herb that is highly addictive?

558
00:46:28,508 --> 00:46:29,949
The one that Father does not brew.

559
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:31,918
Why does one need...

560
00:46:32,548 --> 00:46:33,619
so many herbs?

561
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:36,118
Opium poppy. Six times more lethal.

562
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,257
- Lethal.
- Jang Gun.

563
00:46:37,258 --> 00:46:38,587
- Jang Gun, please calm down.
- Opium poppy.

564
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:39,588
- Jang Gun...
- It is...

565
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:40,928
- Quiet!
- Opium poppy.

566
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:42,128
A lethal herb.

567
00:46:42,588 --> 00:46:44,329
- It should not be allowed.
- Why you...

568
00:46:44,898 --> 00:46:46,099
- No!
- Wait!

569
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:51,868
Like I said, be quiet.

570
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:52,869
Ip Bun?

571
00:46:53,068 --> 00:46:54,468
- Ip Bun?
- Ip Bun.

572
00:46:54,469 --> 00:46:55,969
- Ip Bun!
- Ip Bun!

573
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:05,179
Goodness, I smell money in the air.

574
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:06,519
How fragrant.

575
00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:11,458
Stop dawdling and get to work.

576
00:47:16,929 --> 00:47:17,929
Is this what you have been up to?

577
00:47:18,858 --> 00:47:21,729
A worthless lowlife like you should not get in my way.

578
00:47:22,068 --> 00:47:23,599
I will not allow it this time.

579
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:26,298
This is way above anything you can handle.

580
00:47:26,738 --> 00:47:28,469
How could you have caused such chaos?

581
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:29,769
Why you...

582
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:32,679
Should you not be more worried about yourself?

583
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,849
Because of you, I almost had...

584
00:47:36,048 --> 00:47:38,148
to torch the field before harvesting them.

585
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:39,619
All because you got nosy.

586
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:44,188
Have you not once considered living a respectable life?

587
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,729
That is rich coming from the quack of a physician...

588
00:47:48,088 --> 00:47:49,988
who is also a murderer.

589
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:54,869
Having money and power gives you a respectable life.

590
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,099
There is no honor in being broke and letting your family starve.

591
00:47:58,269 --> 00:47:59,568
Where is my family?

592
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:01,909
Do not fret.

593
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:04,837
I will treat them like royalty...

594
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:06,909
on their way across the River Styx.

595
00:48:07,778 --> 00:48:08,778
Why you...

596
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:12,818
You will need to work harder in order to break free from that.

597
00:48:14,188 --> 00:48:16,548
Off you go

598
00:48:16,648 --> 00:48:19,458
Across the River Styx

599
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:37,008
This seems like a path unknown to most people.

600
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,438
I did not realize there was such a place.

601
00:48:40,108 --> 00:48:41,208
As a child,

602
00:48:41,378 --> 00:48:43,849
I heard stories about a blackened land that is home to ghosts.

603
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:46,548
Are you saying that such a place exists?

604
00:48:47,088 --> 00:48:48,148
Granny was right.

605
00:48:48,548 --> 00:48:50,817
During the war, the barbarians murdered the refugees...

606
00:48:50,818 --> 00:48:52,818
who had fled deep into the woods.

607
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:56,158
Ever since then, people stopped coming here afraid of the ghosts.

608
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:57,199
That is why there is no tidied path.

609
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:00,499
It is actually my first time up here.

610
00:49:28,329 --> 00:49:29,329
Black soil.

611
00:49:31,258 --> 00:49:33,159
The dead bodies of the innocent...

612
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:35,769
fertilized the land making it black.

613
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,539
Could it be any sadder?

614
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:42,809
He is endangering the people...

615
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:45,608
by utilizing this land to grow opium poppy.

616
00:49:46,508 --> 00:49:48,749
I cannot forgive him for this. We must find him.

617
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:50,519
Of course.

618
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:21,909
We must get out of here.

619
00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:23,377
Or Ip Bun will die.

620
00:50:23,378 --> 00:50:25,417
- Jang Gun...
- We must get out of here.

621
00:50:25,418 --> 00:50:27,147
- Calm down.
- I cannot!

622
00:50:27,148 --> 00:50:29,218
Jang Gun, look at me and calm down.

623
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:30,219
Ip Bun!

624
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:32,858
Do not lose consciousness. Stay awake!

625
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:34,627
We must get out of here.

626
00:50:34,628 --> 00:50:36,429
- We must leave.
- I will not die.

627
00:50:37,628 --> 00:50:39,998
We must get out of here.

628
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,167
Or Ip Bun will die.

629
00:50:41,168 --> 00:50:42,229
We must leave.

630
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:43,668
We cannot stay.

631
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:45,139
Darn it!

632
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:55,878
There are fewer people here than I expected.

633
00:50:56,749 --> 00:50:58,219
Yes, that I am glad of.

634
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:05,519
Where could our family be?

635
00:51:08,628 --> 00:51:10,499
In there perhaps.

636
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,079
What the...

637
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:32,547
What is this?

638
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,349
What on earth is this?

639
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:35,849
The smell!

640
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:39,289
What is this?

641
00:51:45,229 --> 00:51:46,758
- Lady Eun Woo?
- Lady Eun Woo!

642
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:47,869
Ip Bun!

643
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:49,469
What on earth happened?

644
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,369
How did you know to come here?

645
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:54,338
Let us leave first.

646
00:51:55,539 --> 00:51:56,539
Lady Eun Woo is here.

647
00:51:58,309 --> 00:51:59,309
We must leave.

648
00:51:59,778 --> 00:52:01,048
Ip Bun, wake up.

649
00:52:01,148 --> 00:52:02,148
Ip Bun?

650
00:52:02,149 --> 00:52:03,548
Ip Bun, my gosh.

651
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:05,878
Let us get you on your feet.

652
00:52:07,488 --> 00:52:10,119
We must leave or Ip Bun will die.

653
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:14,229
Can you walk?

654
00:52:14,429 --> 00:52:15,957
- I will hold you.
- Me too.

655
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:17,829
- Right.
- Slowly.

656
00:52:18,729 --> 00:52:19,729
Slowly.

657
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:21,369
Slowly.

658
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,599
Jang Gun, come.

659
00:52:30,778 --> 00:52:31,778
How did you know to come here?

660
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:33,237
Let us leave first.

661
00:52:33,238 --> 00:52:34,249
Who is there?

662
00:52:35,309 --> 00:52:37,008
Do not move. Stay right there.

663
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:44,719
I see that the dunce is still alive.

664
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:47,559
The Second State Councilor has been wanting you dead.

665
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:50,188
And you came to me on your own accord.

666
00:52:51,028 --> 00:52:53,528
It is why I offered you to stand by our side.

667
00:52:54,229 --> 00:52:57,168
Let the people go and burn the opium poppy.

668
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:00,139
Hold on a second. Are you here...

669
00:53:00,608 --> 00:53:02,238
for the stiletto needle?

670
00:53:03,769 --> 00:53:06,409
You must not be aware that it is in my possession.

671
00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:10,818
The stiletto needle is sure in high demand.

672
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,548
Maybe I should bury it with you when you die.

673
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:18,889
What?

674
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:20,258
Go after them!

675
00:53:20,758 --> 00:53:22,488
If you lose any of them...

676
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:26,699
You two, kneel. Kneel!

677
00:53:28,068 --> 00:53:29,269
Let this be as far as you go.

678
00:53:30,568 --> 00:53:32,338
Shut it, you persistent snob.

679
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,668
You will die in my hands today.

680
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:36,708
This will only lead to your own death.

681
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:38,378
Are you sure you can trust the Second State Councilor?

682
00:53:42,479 --> 00:53:44,179
This is your last chance to do what is right.

683
00:53:49,588 --> 00:53:50,619
Such idiocy.

684
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:53,559
Do not just stand there.

685
00:53:53,889 --> 00:53:54,889
Slay them!

686
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:56,358
Yes, my lord.

687
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:58,659
Heed the royal command!

688
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:00,829
What?

689
00:54:03,429 --> 00:54:04,438
Burn them!

690
00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:08,769
My goodness.

691
00:54:11,909 --> 00:54:13,309
Let us go.

692
00:54:17,749 --> 00:54:19,249
Darn it.

693
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:21,519
Darn!

694
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:27,488
He went that way!

695
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:33,969
Darn it.

696
00:55:06,729 --> 00:55:07,729
Do not come any closer!

697
00:55:15,168 --> 00:55:16,168
Come any closer,

698
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:17,809
and this stiletto needle will be tossed into the fire.

699
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:23,909
This...

700
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:27,818
is important to you, is it not?

701
00:55:29,548 --> 00:55:30,688
This stiletto needle...

702
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:34,429
will clear your name regarding all you were framed for.

703
00:55:38,999 --> 00:55:42,329
I will give you this if you let me go once.

704
00:55:47,068 --> 00:55:48,508
It was mine to begin with.

705
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:53,409
So I will give it to you. So...

706
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:56,979
let me off this once, Se Poong.

707
00:56:00,949 --> 00:56:01,988
Hand it over.

708
00:56:03,789 --> 00:56:04,789
Okay.

709
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:21,639
Darn!

710
00:56:29,479 --> 00:56:30,548
How...

711
00:56:31,648 --> 00:56:33,179
could you live like this?

712
00:56:47,668 --> 00:56:50,898
You fools! Do you know who I am?

713
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,039
I am under the protection of the Second State Councilor.

714
00:56:54,409 --> 00:56:56,508
You can take me away tonight,

715
00:56:56,769 --> 00:56:59,309
but I will be released tomorrow.

716
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:02,979
You forced civilians to work for you...

717
00:57:03,148 --> 00:57:05,818
and got them addicted to a drug that ruins their bodies and minds.

718
00:57:06,278 --> 00:57:08,749
The people will prove your crimes.

719
00:57:08,849 --> 00:57:12,258
Let us see if the Second State Councilor truly protects you.

720
00:57:15,528 --> 00:57:17,289
No, wait!

721
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:19,858
Fine.

722
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:27,869
I am sorry. I did wrong.

723
00:57:28,568 --> 00:57:32,409
But I did it because the Second State Councilor told me to.

724
00:57:33,778 --> 00:57:36,309
I had no choice. That is the truth.

725
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:39,949
It is time...

726
00:57:40,818 --> 00:57:42,988
to reveal the truth clearly.

727
00:57:44,258 --> 00:57:46,418
What command you were given,

728
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:48,757
and what evil you did...

729
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:50,488
to bribe the Second State Councilor!

730
00:57:51,699 --> 00:57:53,499
Yes. Of course.

731
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,929
I will tell you everything.

732
00:57:56,568 --> 00:57:57,599
Will you...

733
00:57:59,469 --> 00:58:02,168
help me get out of this alive?

734
00:58:03,668 --> 00:58:04,809
Yoo Se Poong.

735
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:08,508
No. Yoo Se Yeob, sir.

736
00:58:17,688 --> 00:58:21,188
What the Second State Councilor made me do and took,

737
00:58:21,258 --> 00:58:23,789
I will tell you everything.

738
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:25,258
Believe me.

739
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:28,829
I, Im Soon Man,

740
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:32,298
will expose the Second State Councilor's corruption!

741
00:59:04,168 --> 00:59:07,909
The Second State Councilor gave dansacho to the former king.

742
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:10,639
That ledger. I found it.

743
00:59:11,278 --> 00:59:12,778
What does this mark mean?

744
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:15,548
Did you think you could live...

745
00:59:15,809 --> 00:59:18,719
as if nothing happened when you poisoned a king?

746
00:59:18,818 --> 00:59:22,619
I must look into who is behind it.

747
00:59:22,749 --> 00:59:24,588
The stiletto needle and Yoo Se Yeob.

748
00:59:24,688 --> 00:59:26,688
Neither can be allowed to exist.

749
00:59:26,858 --> 00:59:27,958
I will do that.

750
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:31,898
I will condemn them all...

751
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:34,469
and correct everything.

752
