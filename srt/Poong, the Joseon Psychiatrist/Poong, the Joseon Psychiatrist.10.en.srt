1
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:41,272
With my hands, I caused the former king to die.

2
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,382
That is why...

3
00:00:50,382 --> 00:00:51,851
I was banished from the Palace...

4
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:54,351
and unable to use needles.

5
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:56,221
And also,

6
00:00:57,251 --> 00:01:00,022
someone is still threatening me over that incident.

7
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:06,332
I do not wish to leave.

8
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:08,662
However...

9
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:11,732
I must discover the truth.

10
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,071
Will you still...

11
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:19,711
wait for me?

12
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:30,222
No.

13
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:37,261
Take the path you see fit.

14
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:42,302
And uncover the truth.

15
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,442
I will not just sit and do nothing.

16
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,371
I will find my own way.

17
00:01:52,642 --> 00:01:55,442
Together, just like now.

18
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,632
Did the Second State Councillor send you?

19
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:46,492
Does your side sting?

20
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,571
You lacked the skill and could have died.

21
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:57,711
Thank me for saving you.

22
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:00,272
Darn!

23
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:08,681
Run, but you cannot hide from me.

24
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:11,322
You had it coming, you punk.

25
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,691
Goodness.

26
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:35,482
This came into my possession?

27
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,441
(Dansacho)

28
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:38,641
(Jeon Kyu Hyung, Gye Ji Han, Shin Gui Soo)

29
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,751
Who used dansacho and how, when there were guards...

30
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:47,782
and tasters and testers?

31
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:51,621
Why did the royal investigator come to Sorak Village?

32
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:53,521
To kill me?

33
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:55,261
To find evidence?

34
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:07,102
Physician Yoo, may I come in for a moment?

35
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:37,061
(Cho Sin Woo, Cho Tae Hak)

36
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:44,672
Sin Woo must be involved in it too.

37
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:49,212
At the moment, it is only speculation.

38
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:52,412
Do you think the Second State Councillor sent this?

39
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:57,251
This...

40
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,621
belongs to Physician Yoo?

41
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,662
Does this needle box have something to do with the incident too?

42
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:07,362
Did something happen?

43
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:11,571
The other night, when Sin Woo heard that this belonged to you,

44
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:13,631
he seemed very flustered.

45
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:18,212
Sin Woo might already know...

46
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:20,871
what you are after.

47
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:30,081
I should ask him directly.

48
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,792
(Episode 10)

49
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:38,592
What do you mean Sin Woo left?

50
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:41,102
He was transferred to the State Tribunal last night.

51
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,661
And he was nowhere to be seen this morning.

52
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:46,102
He must have had to leave in a rush to start his new job.

53
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:50,542
Goodness. He should have at least told us before he left, right?

54
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,681
He would not leave without even saying goodbye.

55
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:56,982
I wonder what happened.

56
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:00,652
But those who are after you are like wild beasts.

57
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:03,620
They will only stop when they rip the throat of their prey.

58
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:04,951
They are cruel beings.

59
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:08,321
He might be in danger.

60
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:11,061
Where are you going?

61
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:16,201
You must walk along this trail to get there.

62
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:22,102
Look.

63
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:30,511
It is blood.

64
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:51,732
Royal Inspector Cho!

65
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,742
Royal Inspector Cho, wake up.

66
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:01,011
I must take you to the clinic. Hold my hand.

67
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:03,112
No.

68
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:06,852
No one can know...

69
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:09,581
that I am still alive.

70
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,261
Royal Inspector Cho.

71
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:18,232
Royal Inspector Cho!

72
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:36,782
Who did this?

73
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,482
The Second State Councillor’s son was attacked before he could slay me.

74
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,821
Who attacked him? And why?

75
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:48,362
Please wake up.

76
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,492
I cannot let you die like this.

77
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:04,511
It has been taken care of, my lord.

78
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:13,551
That weak fool.

79
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:22,391
Your Majesty, you have been avoiding governmental affairs for days,

80
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,761
and you would not even let us see you.

81
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:28,031
Please try to understand our situation, Your Majesty.

82
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:30,761
The rash on my leg has worsened.

83
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:33,932
It is hard for me to even stay seated for a moment.

84
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:37,671
- Oh, no. - My goodness.

85
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:39,312
Hence,

86
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:43,712
I wish to visit the hot spring in Onyang.

87
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,751
However, you are not well enough...

88
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:48,952
for such a long trip.

89
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,651
It could worsen the rash.

90
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:57,121
Like the former kings,

91
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:00,062
I wish to be treated in Onyang.

92
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:02,702
I hope you all understand.

93
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,332
Yes, Your Majesty.

94
00:10:07,102 --> 00:10:10,671
You must regain your health for our country to be strong.

95
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:13,141
We will thoroughly prepare everything.

96
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:15,112
My rash is worsening by the day,

97
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:17,541
so make sure I can leave immediately.

98
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,051
Yes. Well understood, Your Majesty.

99
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:28,091
It has only been a little while since he ascended the throne.

100
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:29,562
He already wants to go stay in Onyang?

101
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:31,732
He is ill.

102
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:36,401
He suddenly wants to go to the palace in Onyang?

103
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:40,102
Lord Cho!

104
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:41,472
Lord Cho.

105
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:43,801
I found the court maid.

106
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:46,371
However,

107
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:49,212
His Majesty is...

108
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,082
What?

109
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,062
Now, I see what is going on.

110
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:07,561
Bring Im Soon Man to me.

111
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:08,562
Yes, my lord.

112
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,612
What happened?

113
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,982
Who tried to kill you?

114
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,682
Take Eun Woo and leave at once.

115
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:31,822
If you stay here with me, you will be put in danger too.

116
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:33,421
Royal Inspector Cho.

117
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:38,161
You saved my life yet again.

118
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:44,301
Is there anything you know about that needle box?

119
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:48,541
If it is something related to my father, please tell me.

120
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:52,812
Are you telling me to repay my debt?

121
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:02,182
Your father was found...

122
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:05,822
with a discoloured stiletto needle in his hand.

123
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:11,891
And I was investigating the case.

124
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,901
However,

125
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:20,031
I no longer have that stiletto needle.

126
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,742
The man...

127
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,842
who stabbed me probably took the needle.

128
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:31,551
Who was it?

129
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:43,222
All right. One for you, Jang Gun.

130
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:47,192
I get two.

131
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:48,962
- Hey! - Come on.

132
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:53,202
- This is delicious. - By the way,

133
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:55,400
Physician Yoo was acting so strange today.

134
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:58,511
My young master is always weird.

135
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,841
I saw him sneaking out...

136
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:03,341
- with tons of food. - What?

137
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:04,442
Lady Seo was acting weird too.

138
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:06,251
She left the house with some food.

139
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:09,150
She took my crunchy rice too.

140
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:12,492
I see. If she even took Jang Gun's crunchy rice...

141
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:15,592
I know what is going on.

142
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:17,161
- What? - What is going on?

143
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:22,631
Those two...

144
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,201
are in love!

145
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:29,202
What?

146
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,771
They are?

147
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:33,270
- They are in love! - They are in love!

148
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,611
Finally, this happened.

149
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:37,410
What? What do you think happened?

150
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:39,650
They secretly...

151
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:40,651
Yes.

152
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:42,421
They moved in together in secret!

153
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,021
- What? - What?

154
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:45,692
They will get in trouble, will they not?

155
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:48,491
They cannot get married.

156
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,020
Do not worry. That is simply impossible.

157
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:53,061
My young master has been single all his life,

158
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:55,400
so he cannot even think of doing such a thing.

159
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,432
You never know what can happen between a man and a woman.

160
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:03,540
Let us go check out Poong's new house!

161
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,040
- Okay! - No.

162
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,942
- No, wait. - No.

163
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,640
- Get back here! - Hey.

164
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:09,741
Jang Gun, hold on.

165
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:11,312
- No. - Come on!

166
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:15,651
- They are in love! - Quiet.

167
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:23,692
Well...

168
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:28,702
Did you have dinner?

169
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:34,702
Yes, I ate.

170
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:37,001
Oh, where?

171
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,111
Would you like some yakgwa?

172
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:43,112
You two...

173
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,182
can share one.

174
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:49,621
They are beginning to look alike.

175
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:20,852
Where did Royal Inspector Cho go when he is still unwell?

176
00:15:21,082 --> 00:15:22,881
His wounds will reopen if he moves.

177
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:24,821
I am sure he did not make it far.

178
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:25,952
Let us find him.

179
00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:43,141
The royal inspector...

180
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:46,171
asked about the needle...

181
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:48,212
that had changed in colour.

182
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:50,312
Yes, that is right.

183
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:58,291
This is the needle he probably showed you.

184
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:00,822
What am I looking at?

185
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,562
Have you figured it out?

186
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,092
I kept mum not wanting to be dragged away by authorities.

187
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:11,972
However, this is no ordinary needle.

188
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:15,501
It is a stiletto needle used to cut boils.

189
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:17,501
I see.

190
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,671
It is called a stiletto needle?

191
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:22,111
That is right.

192
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:24,541
It seems to have come from someone of authority too.

193
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:29,251
That much is true.

194
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:34,092
Anyway, bring me more answers as soon as possible.

195
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:37,222
I need not remind you that you must keep quiet.

196
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:40,631
Absolutely. You need not worry.

197
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,261
Now, let us move on.

198
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,801
Do you have what I requested?

199
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:50,001
Of course. Here you go.

200
00:16:50,371 --> 00:16:53,641
Right. Let me see.

201
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,212
Goodness.

202
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:04,781
Splendid.

203
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,072
That dunce. If he blindly seeks the truth in Hanyang...

204
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:24,401
The Minister of Personnel died while looking into this herb.

205
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:25,841
If you value your life,

206
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:28,311
you will leave immediately.

207
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:34,011
However, it is not something I can keep hidden forever.

208
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:37,281
I am afraid we are closed. Please come by tomorrow.

209
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:45,732
Who on earth interrupts our peace at this hour?

210
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,511
Are you the physician here?

211
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,111
You are in the presence of...

212
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:08,820
I heard about...

213
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,622
the young gifted physician who works here.

214
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:13,452
Where can I find him?

215
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:16,722
The young physician?

216
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:21,090
That is right. I wish to be seen by the one...

217
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,331
who is from the Medical Office.

218
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:26,731
I wonder how such news travelled outside this village.

219
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:29,372
On my way to Hanyang for the state exam,

220
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:31,571
I asked around hoping to have my condition treated.

221
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:36,041
Even from the village entrance, I heard villagers gushing over him.

222
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,111
Like I said, it is after hours.

223
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:43,081
Exactly. You should head back tonight.

224
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,891
No matter what you offer me,

225
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:57,031
it will not have me reopen the clinic.

226
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:10,341
If it is that urgent, we do offer after-hours service.

227
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:13,050
What nonsense are you spewing? Since when did we...

228
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,051
Head inside!

229
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,820
The later the night, the steeper the price.

230
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:21,492
But treating illnesses comes before money.

231
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:26,331
Steeper as in twice the amount we just offered?

232
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,800
Let me escort you inside.

233
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,361
This way, please. Go on.

234
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,672
This way.

235
00:19:36,872 --> 00:19:37,972
Not a word!

236
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,672
Does the young physician not see patients?

237
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,212
He is merely my assistant, and I sent him on an errand.

238
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,212
Allow me to check your pulse while you await.

239
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,081
Goodness.

240
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,850
Judging by your bloodshot eyes and canker sores on your tongue,

241
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:26,652
you have heat trapped in your chest area.

242
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:30,462
One might guess that you have never been at ease.

243
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:31,932
You are right.

244
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:35,030
Due to being sick on a daily basis,

245
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:37,001
I see physicians almost every day.

246
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,271
Your manservant is as thin as a chopstick,

247
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,371
but your tummy is fully greased up.

248
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:44,141
No wonder your energy is blocked.

249
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,011
You brought this on yourself.

250
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:54,652
What do you suggest that I do?

251
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:58,621
Rather than physicians who only seek money and fame,

252
00:20:58,622 --> 00:21:00,821
be treated by those who can actually make you better.

253
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,992
When choosing your physician,

254
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:06,632
see his talent and personality.

255
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:21,571
We will look for him again when the day breaks.

256
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:28,311
Where on earth have you been wandering all day?

257
00:21:28,682 --> 00:21:30,251
I bet he was out doing no good.

258
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:33,821
Is someone here at this hour?

259
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:37,161
A young scholar from a wealthy family...

260
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,491
on his way to take the state exam.

261
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:40,060
He seemed suspicious at first,

262
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:43,202
but one could not have asked for a better patient.

263
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:45,202
I wonder who it is.

264
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:48,702
Make sure he does not leave while I bring his medicinal herbs.

265
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:04,652
Your Majesty.

266
00:22:04,821 --> 00:22:06,922
Hush. Not so loud.

267
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:10,091
Se Yeob.

268
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:12,091
I hope you have been well.

269
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:15,031
You seem drawn.

270
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,601
It must not have been easy for you.

271
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:19,601
Your Majesty.

272
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:21,402
Lift your chin up.

273
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:23,742
I am here to see my old friend today.

274
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:25,742
But...

275
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:30,212
We only offer the best herbs...

276
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,111
What are you doing?

277
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:35,182
All right.

278
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:38,521
Goodness.

279
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:43,020
You have been chasing skirts most of your waking hours.

280
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:45,462
That much is quite obvious to me.

281
00:22:46,392 --> 00:22:48,232
Anyway, these herbs...

282
00:22:48,392 --> 00:22:50,231
will clear your bloodshot eyes...

283
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:53,932
and lower the heat trapped in your chest.

284
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:58,271
Physician Gye, you must be suffering from stiffness in your muscles.

285
00:22:58,341 --> 00:23:00,611
Why you... Is it not obvious to you?

286
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,741
Someone so young has that much fat around his belly.

287
00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:05,452
At this rate, he will be a goner in a few years.

288
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:07,381
Do not come to me when you are dying...

289
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:10,021
and take this medicine to...

290
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:12,891
- You should turn in for the night. - What...

291
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,790
- What is going on? - I will explain later.

292
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,591
Please turn in for the night, Physician Gye.

293
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:18,462
Make sure he pays a hefty amount.

294
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:28,372
My apologies, Your Majesty. He is not all that bad.

295
00:23:28,571 --> 00:23:30,000
He is actually a talented physician...

296
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,642
who once worked at the Medical Office.

297
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,442
The Medical Office?

298
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,482
No wonder.

299
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:40,011
He was not all that wrong.

300
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:44,222
One must ask what brings you to this remote village.

301
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:47,392
Did you come all this way to see your disloyal subject?

302
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,162
I had a favour to ask.

303
00:23:54,992 --> 00:23:57,501
A court maid from the Royal Kitchen is being brought here.

304
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:59,132
I need you to treat her.

305
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:03,301
A court maid from the Royal Kitchen?

306
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:07,771
The royal food taster gave her life trying to tell me to find this girl.

307
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,311
There is quite a lot that I must tell you.

308
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:15,482
Take your seat.

309
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,690
Then my father...

310
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:40,361
was looking into the stiletto needle and the former king's death?

311
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,930
The court maid who is on the way...

312
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:47,071
will know something about it.

313
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:49,071
I need you...

314
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,311
to cure her.

315
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,780
I will.

316
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:57,980
But what with and how is that court maid ailing?

317
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,790
What is it?

318
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:26,641
Are you all right?

319
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:29,851
Wake up.

320
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,950
I must return.

321
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,331
Take care of it for me.

322
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:45,030
Yes, Your Majesty. I will do my best.

323
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,071
- What happened? - I apologize, Your Majesty.

324
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,371
She was overcome with fear and fled.

325
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:01,411
She fainted with fear is all, Your Majesty.

326
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,450
I need you to cure her. You must.

327
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,851
You must uncover the truth.

328
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,450
Yes, Your Majesty.

329
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,490
(Gyesoo Clinic)

330
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:30,341
Who is this girl?

331
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,940
Did you...

332
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,180
Can you not cause a fuss?

333
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,280
His Majesty asked I treat her.

334
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:41,621
What are you on about? "His Majesty?"

335
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:55,061
- His Majesty? - His Majesty?

336
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,039
You crazy man.

337
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,340
You tried to con the King into paying a fortune?

338
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:04,539
He did not just take his money.

339
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,580
I heard he even said a whole load of nasty things.

340
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:08,980
You have enough courage to be a commander of the army.

341
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:12,880
He pointed at His Majesty with his finger like this...

342
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,051
and criticized him and called him names too.

343
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:20,121
"Someone so young has that much fat around his belly."

344
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,591
Is what he said.

345
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,801
You have enough courage to be a commander of the army.

346
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:32,269
If he did and said all that to the King,

347
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,140
will we all just...

348
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:35,611
We all just what?

349
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:38,911
Get dragged off to be hung, drawn, and quartered?

350
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,550
We will be flogged and whipped before that.

351
00:27:42,551 --> 00:27:46,581
Gye Ji Han. You are crazy. Crazy.

352
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:48,620
- You are crazy. - Oh, dear.

353
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:50,350
I should open a tavern here.

354
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:53,190
Yes, you do that. This place...

355
00:27:53,561 --> 00:27:55,960
It is no place for a clinic.

356
00:27:56,891 --> 00:27:57,891
Oh, dear...

357
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,101
She is awake.

358
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:09,571
My gosh. I got scared, thinking you were dead.

359
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:11,841
You scared me.

360
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,381
What is your name?

361
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:25,321
Do you not know your name or age?

362
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,821
Do not scare her.

363
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:32,760
Where are you from? Have you eaten?

364
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:35,900
Why ask questions when she cannot speak?

365
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:38,269
That must be it. She cannot speak.

366
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,270
I see.

367
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,470
Now that you are awake, you should eat.

368
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:42,811
I will bring some porridge.

369
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,311
You woke up.

370
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:55,551
Good.

371
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,561
It is okay. This is a safe place.

372
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:05,131
They will all protect you.

373
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:11,470
You can trust us.

374
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:17,269
My lord. You asked to see me again.

375
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,581
I am eternally grateful.

376
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:25,611
My lord. Just give a command.

377
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:29,621
I serve you and you alone now.

378
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,590
A young girl will go to Sorak Village...

379
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:38,091
and look for Yoo Se Yeob.

380
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,831
Contact me as soon as it is confirmed,

381
00:29:41,331 --> 00:29:43,331
and find out where she is taken.

382
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,841
I will come myself.

383
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,470
I will do that. Do not worry.

384
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:53,841
Last time, with my cunning, the royal investigator incident...

385
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,550
got taken care of. You know, right?

386
00:29:56,551 --> 00:29:58,280
Do not dare take this lightly!

387
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,790
I brought something that I would like to offer up.

388
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:21,970
What is this?

389
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:26,540
It is a sweet drug that confuses the mind.

390
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:29,280
Once you take this,

391
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:32,280
you travel to and from paradise to purgatory.

392
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,750
You keep wanting more,

393
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:37,921
until later on, you sell your house and cattle.

394
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,020
Eventually, you give up your life.

395
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:42,990
That is what it is like.

396
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,690
It is evil.

397
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,901
The profit from this amount...

398
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:50,930
is much more than the profit from selling a crate of tobacco.

399
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:52,671
Much more.

400
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:55,641
If you so wish,

401
00:30:56,111 --> 00:31:00,280
this could give you the nation.

402
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:06,051
Do you think it would be that easy?

403
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,151
You cannot cover the sky with one hand.

404
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:12,621
But my sky is you and only you.

405
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,030
Why can you not become the sky that lords over us all?

406
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:22,631
That is dangerous chatter.

407
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:43,551
I am so glad I did not use this yet.

408
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,621
At a more crucial time,

409
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:47,921
I will use you then.

410
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,230
I am a true master of scheming.

411
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,641
She will not speak.

412
00:32:02,071 --> 00:32:04,039
The extreme shock and fear...

413
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,411
blocked her heart and mind.

414
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:08,841
We should try using wonjihan and bokshinsan.

415
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,921
Okay. I will use acupuncture on Jinjeong to help her relax.

416
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,161
You must get better.

417
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,770
I am doing this to treat you.

418
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:34,641
You are too afraid.

419
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,540
Acupuncture is out of the question.

420
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
Yes.

421
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,780
Time flies.

422
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:56,331
That punk.

423
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,430
What?

424
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,180
You crazy old hag! Do you know how much this costs?

425
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,880
Why are you back?

426
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:18,811
All you do is cause a ruckus.

427
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:20,580
Is that how you speak to adults?

428
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,479
You, teach her some manners.

429
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,490
You, you will pay.

430
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,491
You! What are you here for?

431
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,860
From now on, each time you step foot in our yard,

432
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:34,861
pay a fee.

433
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:37,531
You lot.

434
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,440
When a guest comes by, you should escort them inside.

435
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,639
I am here to get treated and to pay for it.

436
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,840
Unless it is terminal, get lost.

437
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:49,880
I am extremely busy, okay?

438
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:54,380
Yes, and I want to go inside and get a thorough check-up.

439
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:56,091
Hey! You scoundrel.

440
00:33:56,921 --> 00:33:58,190
Move aside. Let me go in!

441
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:11,599
I washed the dirty rag! It is clean now.

442
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,341
Well done, Granny!

443
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,810
Hey, get lost.

444
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,979
What is so important about that wench?

445
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,241
What is with this hide-and-seek?

446
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:24,011
Well, it is none of my business.

447
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:29,451
Gyesoo Clinic is all I care about.

448
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,221
Very soon, it will be mine.

449
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:45,370
I am curious about what made you shut yourself off from others.

450
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,410
If there is anything you would like to tell me, write it down.

451
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,620
Here.

452
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,480
It is okay. Do not worry.

453
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,310
You do not have to write it in words.

454
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,261
There must be a reason Im Soon Man was here. It concerns me.

455
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,171
I will find a place for her to stay and move her there tomorrow.

456
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,471
Okay.

457
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:07,181
What should I do?

458
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,550
The Ojisangseung Therapy states...

459
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:15,761
that anxiety can only be overcome with joy.

460
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:19,761
Man Bok.

461
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:23,270
What would give her the most joy?

462
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,270
I heard many court maids feigned illness...

463
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:32,471
to visit their families.

464
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:35,881
She would be very happy if she could visit her family.

465
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:02,910
What is this?

466
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,181
Here, drink this.

467
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:24,690
Wait!

468
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,301
Wol!

469
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,701
Go away!

470
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,710
Wol!

471
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,451
- We should take her inside. - Okay.

472
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,971
Is she not breathing?

473
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,241
She is. She may look like she is not breathing, but she is alive.

474
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,139
Eun Woo, administer acupuncture on Cheondol, Hwagae, and Okdang.

475
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,140
Okay.

476
00:38:27,321 --> 00:38:28,361
You are...

477
00:38:29,261 --> 00:38:31,761
The acupuncture points are Cheondol, Hwagae, Okdang.

478
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,761
You are that girl.

479
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,830
"That girl?"

480
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,020
One, two, three.

481
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:03,160
She has epilepsy.

482
00:39:03,631 --> 00:39:04,860
She has turned the corner.

483
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:06,500
Use acupuncture on Geogweol, and she will wake up.

484
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,631
Okay.

485
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,571
Do you know her?

486
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,881
Yes, I recognized her...

487
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:23,750
when I saw the moles on her chest.

488
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:30,551
"Moles on her chest?"

489
00:39:31,421 --> 00:39:32,451
Yes.

490
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,689
They form a triangle.

491
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,690
Even back then, I thought it was unusual.

492
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,730
Physician Yoo, were you a playboy in the Palace?

493
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:49,301
What?

494
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,181
You were. Of course, with that handsome face.

495
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,310
I knew it.

496
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,011
Gosh.

497
00:39:57,951 --> 00:39:59,611
What? What are you saying, all of a sudden...

498
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,761
No. I swear, we did not have that kind of relationship.

499
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:21,401
Do not get the wrong idea.

500
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:23,471
Oh, dear.

501
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,480
That court maid is with Yoo Se Yeob now.

502
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,781
I told you to keep tabs on them.

503
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,290
Sure thing, my lord.

504
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:38,991
My servants are watching them...

505
00:40:39,091 --> 00:40:42,790
with their eyes peeled all day and all night.

506
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,801
Lead the way.

507
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:53,241
I will finish her off with my own two hands.

508
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:08,421
It is okay. Relax.

509
00:41:12,991 --> 00:41:14,160
You...

510
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:17,330
must remember me.

511
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,841
Take your time.

512
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,870
You can tell me when you are ready and want to talk.

513
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:38,381
Do you not want to visit your family back home?

514
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:40,580
You must miss your family.

515
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,500
Do not worry. I will go with you.

516
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:06,741
- What is going on? - You little...

517
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:09,579
Who made this beautiful young lady cry?

518
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,249
- What happened? - Why did you make her cry?

519
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,320
Physician Yoo, what is with you? Stop making women cry.

520
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:16,991
Young Master, can you explain what is going on?

521
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:18,689
It is not because of me.

522
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,421
She started crying when I brought up her family.

523
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:24,960
Oh, dear. What is the matter?

524
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:27,960
Do not cry.

525
00:42:29,361 --> 00:42:30,971
It is okay.

526
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,071
It is okay.

527
00:42:34,901 --> 00:42:36,000
My gosh.

528
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,140
Oh, dear.

529
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,540
I did not make her cry.

530
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:43,551
- My gosh. - You poor thing.

531
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:50,020
That poor thing. What happened that she is such a wreck now?

532
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:54,960
Something must have happened to her family.

533
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,890
Oh, boy.

534
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,559
Was that why she had a seizure...

535
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,000
and fainted?

536
00:43:02,401 --> 00:43:05,431
She must have gone home as soon as she ran away from the Palace.

537
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,801
But she will not even say a word, so...

538
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:20,551
She must have experienced something she could not handle.

539
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,520
So I would like to visit her family's home.

540
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:32,560
Would it not make the situation worse?

541
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,230
It is still her home.

542
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,770
The place where she was born and raised,

543
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:38,870
filled with good memories.

544
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:43,511
Bringing back the good memories will help her recover.

545
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,111
Oh, dear.

546
00:43:57,721 --> 00:43:58,721
You must...

547
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,560
be overwhelmed with emotions,

548
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,890
which is why you cannot speak.

549
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,500
Even if that is true, do not let it wear you down.

550
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:14,571
Do not try to hide.

551
00:44:16,471 --> 00:44:17,870
Even amid all that confusion,

552
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,480
there must still be memories that you cherish.

553
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:31,151
I would like to take you to your home...

554
00:44:32,151 --> 00:44:33,960
and help you recall those memories.

555
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,660
Do you not wish to go?

556
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,071
If that is the case,

557
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:47,901
shake your head.

558
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:52,440
What do you say? Are you not up for it?

559
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:58,080
If you wish to go,

560
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,620
the people at the clinic will escort you there.

561
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,350
You are not alone anymore.

562
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,701
Look over there.

563
00:45:21,671 --> 00:45:22,671
No way.

564
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,611
This is my first time leaving Sorak Village.

565
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:27,511
What a delight.

566
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,551
Pretty, is it not?

567
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,080
What about me?

568
00:45:35,221 --> 00:45:36,221
This is unexpected.

569
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,560
Royal Inspector Cho is still suffering from his wounds.

570
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:46,091
I wonder where he could have gone.

571
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,901
I am worried that he will harm himself some more.

572
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,729
Do not worry too much.

573
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,571
Sin Woo is strong and is a gifted swordsman.

574
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,511
I see you trust him.

575
00:45:59,471 --> 00:46:01,040
I have known him since childhood.

576
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,181
You two must share a lot of memories.

577
00:46:06,551 --> 00:46:07,850
I guess we do.

578
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,451
But...

579
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:13,890
my current life means more to me right now.

580
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:25,330
Come on. Seriously?

581
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,341
Please give me one.

582
00:46:45,591 --> 00:46:46,591
Let us unpack.

583
00:46:46,761 --> 00:46:47,761
Sure.

584
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:52,160
Jang Gun, you should stay back with Lady Eun Woo and Wol.

585
00:46:55,861 --> 00:46:56,870
Let us...

586
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,241
wait over there.

587
00:47:19,147 --> 00:47:20,218
Goodness me.

588
00:47:22,687 --> 00:47:24,687
Such barbarians!

589
00:47:29,457 --> 00:47:30,468
I knew it.

590
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:32,897
Ip Bun, take Granny to get us some water.

591
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:35,537
Man Bok, follow me.

592
00:47:35,798 --> 00:47:37,307
Let us clean up the mess.

593
00:48:16,008 --> 00:48:18,247
The house looks warm and welcoming.

594
00:48:28,287 --> 00:48:29,417
- Here. - Ta-Da.

595
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:53,948
Goodness, I must starve to death.

596
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:56,548
Is eating all you care about?

597
00:48:58,017 --> 00:48:59,448
Absolutely.

598
00:49:00,048 --> 00:49:02,858
You can throw scholars at me, but all I will care about is food.

599
00:49:03,727 --> 00:49:04,727
Wol,

600
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:07,097
let me know what you wish to eat.

601
00:49:07,557 --> 00:49:09,097
I will make it all.

602
00:49:09,758 --> 00:49:12,127
Goodness, is that so? If that is the case,

603
00:49:12,428 --> 00:49:13,937
we should have beef.

604
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:15,298
Right,

605
00:49:15,897 --> 00:49:16,908
Wol?

606
00:49:18,568 --> 00:49:19,568
Beef.

607
00:50:17,198 --> 00:50:18,568
Here.

608
00:50:20,368 --> 00:50:21,698
What is this, Father?

609
00:50:33,077 --> 00:50:34,747
Do you want us to talk through your drawings?

610
00:51:01,707 --> 00:51:03,238
Is this a brazier?

611
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:30,068
Young Master.

612
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:32,407
I am off to collect some greens.

613
00:51:32,408 --> 00:51:33,408
Sure.

614
00:51:37,377 --> 00:51:40,847
Jang Gun, can you get me some more banggi and jihwang?

615
00:51:40,948 --> 00:51:41,948
Sure.

616
00:52:29,428 --> 00:52:30,428
You must...

617
00:52:32,597 --> 00:52:33,738
be longing to see him.

618
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:38,868
I lost the only family member I had.

619
00:52:40,338 --> 00:52:41,707
My father passed away.

620
00:52:43,638 --> 00:52:44,647
You might...

621
00:52:45,678 --> 00:52:47,318
also know of him.

622
00:52:49,517 --> 00:52:52,048
Do you remember Supreme Commissioner Yoo Hoo Myung?

623
00:52:55,118 --> 00:52:56,287
If, back then,

624
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:01,127
had I not treated the former king, would it have been okay?

625
00:53:04,068 --> 00:53:05,167
If, back then,

626
00:53:07,238 --> 00:53:08,838
I were not so arrogant,

627
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:12,437
then perhaps...

628
00:53:15,238 --> 00:53:17,377
my father would still be alive.

629
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:22,577
Such thoughts...

630
00:53:26,048 --> 00:53:28,118
prevent me from sleeping at night.

631
00:53:35,457 --> 00:53:36,627
I wish to...

632
00:53:38,267 --> 00:53:39,428
apologize to you too.

633
00:53:41,568 --> 00:53:42,798
It is possible...

634
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:47,537
that the torment you are suffering...

635
00:53:49,408 --> 00:53:50,948
is because of me.

636
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:56,678
So do not be too harsh on yourself,

637
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:00,957
or take it hard.

638
00:54:04,428 --> 00:54:05,488
Because it is...

639
00:54:07,997 --> 00:54:09,597
all my fault.

640
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:31,417
What are you doing, Jang Gun?

641
00:54:41,897 --> 00:54:42,928
Butterfly.

642
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:54,608
Physician Yoo. It is a butterfly.

643
00:54:55,108 --> 00:54:56,477
She drew a butterfly.

644
00:55:00,778 --> 00:55:04,488
Then it was not the needles. It was the butterfly fastening.

645
00:55:08,858 --> 00:55:10,887
It is okay. It is fine.

646
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:13,287
It is a drawing of a butterfly and nothing else.

647
00:55:18,368 --> 00:55:21,238
Were you trying to say something?

648
00:55:23,568 --> 00:55:25,108
Is that why you drew?

649
00:55:32,048 --> 00:55:34,548
Okay. Say whatever it is you want to say.

650
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:36,718
I will listen.

651
00:55:58,468 --> 00:55:59,707
Physician Yoo.

652
00:56:06,778 --> 00:56:07,917
It is...

653
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:12,517
not your fault.

654
00:56:18,258 --> 00:56:20,057
Your father...

655
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:25,997
was murdered.

656
00:56:34,477 --> 00:56:35,537
What...

657
00:56:37,548 --> 00:56:39,247
do you mean?

658
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:44,488
A man with a black jade butterfly ornament.

659
00:56:46,347 --> 00:56:47,687
Commissioner Yoo...

660
00:56:48,687 --> 00:56:50,517
was killed by that man.

661
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:16,948
You must die.

662
00:57:18,448 --> 00:57:22,017
Was the royal inspector told to kill both my father and me?

663
00:57:22,517 --> 00:57:24,258
I cannot disobey the order...

664
00:57:24,627 --> 00:57:26,428
or kill the one who saved me.

665
00:57:27,997 --> 00:57:30,827
You must leave and never show yourself again.

666
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:35,037
But he failed to kill me. Why?

667
00:57:38,307 --> 00:57:40,608
There must be others with the same ornament.

668
00:57:42,178 --> 00:57:43,738
It will not be Sin Woo.

669
00:57:44,448 --> 00:57:47,147
We must find out who did it.

670
00:57:53,048 --> 00:57:55,557
The girl's luck ran out...

671
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:58,727
when persistent little me caught on to her.

672
00:58:09,868 --> 00:58:10,968
Oh, no.

673
00:58:14,377 --> 00:58:16,807
Young Master!

674
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:21,948
I have bad news. Right now...

675
00:58:22,618 --> 00:58:25,187
Im Soon Man is up to something.

676
00:58:25,347 --> 00:58:28,088
He is coming this way with soldiers.

677
00:58:31,488 --> 00:58:34,028
It is Wol and me they are after.

678
00:58:37,057 --> 00:58:38,097
Why?

679
00:58:39,528 --> 00:58:42,138
I will take Wol and escape.

680
00:58:42,537 --> 00:58:45,638
Take the others and go to the crowded village center.

681
00:58:46,508 --> 00:58:49,277
No. What if you get in danger?

682
00:58:49,278 --> 00:58:50,608
Come with us.

683
00:58:50,977 --> 00:58:53,048
It is us two they want.

684
00:58:53,207 --> 00:58:55,178
I cannot put the rest of you in danger.

685
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:59,318
The market is close by, so they will not attack.

686
00:58:59,687 --> 00:59:00,988
But still...

687
00:59:01,957 --> 00:59:03,158
Oh, dear...

688
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:08,057
Take care.

689
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,638
We will be safe.

690
00:59:37,787 --> 00:59:39,827
We must go. We must live.

691
01:00:01,218 --> 01:00:04,118
Do not be afraid. I said I would protect you.

692
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,457
I will lead them that way. Stay here and hide.

693
01:00:10,388 --> 01:00:12,758
You cannot do that. You might...

694
01:00:12,858 --> 01:00:13,988
It is the King's command.

695
01:00:15,397 --> 01:00:18,667
You must live, and I must keep you alive.

696
01:00:21,897 --> 01:00:22,897
So live.

697
01:00:44,687 --> 01:00:46,028
- Find her. - Yes, my lord.

698
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:47,597
- Search. - Yes, sir.

699
01:01:01,207 --> 01:01:02,678
- Go after her. - Yes, my lord.

700
01:01:03,037 --> 01:01:05,048
- Go after her. Now. - Yes, sir.

701
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:13,347
My lady. You said we must go.

702
01:01:18,858 --> 01:01:21,627
Stay on this path and go straight to Gyesoo Clinic.

703
01:01:21,827 --> 01:01:23,457
Stick to crowded roads.

704
01:01:23,798 --> 01:01:24,868
Where are you going?

705
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:26,827
I will come too.

706
01:01:28,238 --> 01:01:29,298
You must...

707
01:01:30,068 --> 01:01:32,738
get the others safely back to Gyesoo Village.

708
01:01:33,508 --> 01:01:35,077
I will get Physician Yoo.

709
01:01:39,508 --> 01:01:41,017
- Go. - My lady.

710
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,048
- Go on. - My lady.

711
01:02:16,948 --> 01:02:17,948
Wol.

712
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:20,247
Wol.

713
01:02:33,698 --> 01:02:34,738
Physician Yoo.

714
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:37,707
What happened? Why are you alone?

715
01:02:39,138 --> 01:02:41,908
I told Wol to hide, but she is gone.

716
01:02:45,108 --> 01:02:47,377
Either she returned home to escape the men...

717
01:02:57,358 --> 01:02:58,358
Lord Cho.

718
01:02:58,988 --> 01:03:02,858
They must be hiding in the woods.

719
01:03:03,597 --> 01:03:06,267
I will find them quickly and bring them to you.

720
01:04:10,858 --> 01:04:11,868
Wol.

721
01:04:20,108 --> 01:04:21,108
Wol.

722
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:11,888
I will take care of Yoo Se Yeob...

723
01:05:12,088 --> 01:05:14,057
and retrieve the stiletto needle at all costs.

724
01:05:14,258 --> 01:05:16,258
What will you do in Hanyang?

725
01:05:16,528 --> 01:05:17,627
I will go with you.

726
01:05:18,468 --> 01:05:19,727
Please spare me.

727
01:05:20,068 --> 01:05:22,738
That is all. Please...

728
01:05:23,198 --> 01:05:24,198
Hey!

729
01:05:24,537 --> 01:05:26,638
How dare you sell such a thing?

730
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:28,637
- Arrest them all! - Let go!

731
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:31,107
The Second State Councillor was deeply involved in it.

732
01:05:31,108 --> 01:05:32,678
You must be very careful.

733
01:05:32,977 --> 01:05:34,678
We brought the body from Seobinggo.

734
01:05:34,917 --> 01:05:36,047
Dansacho was found in the blood of the court lady...

735
01:05:36,048 --> 01:05:37,048
who tasted the King's food.

736
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:40,118
You will not get involved in anything dangerous.

737
01:05:40,548 --> 01:05:41,557
Promise me.
