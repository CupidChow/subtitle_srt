1
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:36,877
Was it...

2
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:40,386
the Second State Councillor...

3
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:43,316
who wanted me dead?

4
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:49,156
Now,

5
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:52,326
are you going to kill me?

6
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:03,307
Yes.

7
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:05,907
But not today.

8
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:10,216
Leave Gyesoo Clinic immediately.

9
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,347
I cannot disobey the order...

10
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,587
or kill the one who saved me.

11
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,186
You must leave and never show yourself again.

12
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:23,396
No. I cannot do that.

13
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:25,726
You are a great physician.

14
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:29,696
You saved many lives and will in the future.

15
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,006
But those who are after you are like wild beasts.

16
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:37,276
They will only stop when they rip the throat of their prey.

17
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:39,907
They are cruel beings.

18
00:01:41,316 --> 00:01:45,146
When faced with a wild beast, you must not show your back.

19
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:48,556
You must look it in the eyes...

20
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:51,357
and shout loudly so as to not become prey.

21
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:53,327
Who knows?

22
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:55,997
I could be that wild beast's natural enemy.

23
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:00,597
So...

24
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:05,237
you will not leave, is that it?

25
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:09,607
I have reached a place where there is no turning back.

26
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:12,646
Do not hesitate because you owe me your life.

27
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,676
Do your duty.

28
00:02:14,877 --> 00:02:17,517
And I will also do mine.

29
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,276
Who did such a thing?

30
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:45,406
This needle. Tell me why you think the colour changed.

31
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:47,946
(Dansacho)

32
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:49,375
They were taught by...

33
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:51,546
Jeon Kyu Hyung, author of "Haedongboncho."

34
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:52,616
(Dansacho)

35
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:01,996
Now tell me about the secret of dansacho.

36
00:03:03,757 --> 00:03:05,925
I told you not to bring it up again.

37
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:07,297
The symptoms of dansacho poisoning...

38
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,396
were exactly the same as the King's before he died.

39
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:13,236
If someone used dansacho in the Palace...

40
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:14,607
Do not say something so dangerous.

41
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:18,746
He died because of your arrogance.

42
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:22,317
Are you trying to blame someone else and run away?

43
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:27,616
I cannot ignore the truth.

44
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:30,715
If someone poisoned the late King with dansacho,

45
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:31,886
I must uncover the truth!

46
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,586
If you try to look into that,

47
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:36,126
you could get killed without a trace.

48
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:38,596
This is not just about you. Everyone at the clinic... No.

49
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:41,237
Everyone in Sorak Village will be put in danger!

50
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:46,507
The Second State Councillor is already trying to kill me.

51
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:51,776
Now is not the time to run but to fight.

52
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:53,806
You have a grudge to pay back, do you not?

53
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,216
Help me.

54
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:12,026
Your father, me, and Shin Gui Soo.

55
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:16,567
We studied under Jeon Kyu Hyung who wrote that book.

56
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:25,107
What are you doing?

57
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:27,346
Forgive me, master.

58
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:29,547
Shin Gui Soo...

59
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:32,486
would do anything to appeal to the powerful...

60
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:33,916
Second State Councillor.

61
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:41,957
He killed...

62
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:44,396
his own teacher?

63
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:49,267
To turn dansacho into a weapon, to earn power,

64
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:52,606
they burned all the books and killed all those involved.

65
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:56,437
I barely managed to get away,

66
00:04:56,877 --> 00:04:58,177
but I lost everything.

67
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:04,145
If the Second State Councillor is after you, you must run away.

68
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:07,046
They will kill you.

69
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:12,586
No.

70
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,427
I will go to Hanyang and reveal the truth.

71
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:21,866
First, you must find clear evidence they cannot deny.

72
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,466
Not go to Hanyang.

73
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,137
The evidence will be in Hanyang where it all went down.

74
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:28,507
I must go to Hanyang.

75
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:33,546
(Episode 9)

76
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,786
What kind of nonsense is this?

77
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:45,856
I just cannot tell what he is thinking.

78
00:05:46,786 --> 00:05:49,457
Is something wrong?

79
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,427
No.

80
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:01,937
My lady. I need your help.

81
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:04,746
See, all of a sudden, he says...

82
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:06,946
he will go to Hanyang and wants me to pack food.

83
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:09,577
Do you think that makes sense?

84
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:11,687
- Physician Yoo? - Yes.

85
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:13,646
Why go to Hanyang?

86
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:15,356
My point exactly.

87
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:17,556
It has not been that long...

88
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:20,526
since he almost died and came back trying to find a cure.

89
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:23,796
Not to mention he was banished as punishment.

90
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:30,067
I just do not get him.

91
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:42,776
Physician Yoo.

92
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:48,617
Eun Woo.

93
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:02,767
Are you really going to Hanyang?

94
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:08,906
Yes.

95
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:13,507
Is something going on with you?

96
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:20,986
You do not need to know.

97
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:24,887
It is better for you if you do not know.

98
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:30,656
You must go, do you?

99
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:34,396
Yes.

100
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:38,007
I must go in person.

101
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:42,606
What about me?

102
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:49,416
Is there anything I can help you with?

103
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:52,947
This is not just about you. Everyone at the clinic... No.

104
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:56,356
Everyone in Sorak Village will be put in danger!

105
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:58,026
No.

106
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:01,156
Absolutely not.

107
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:03,457
You must stay here.

108
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:12,736
Oh, well...

109
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:15,937
I forgot to bring your book.

110
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:18,346
I will go get it now. Do not go anywhere.

111
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:20,476
You can give it to me next time...

112
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,856
Of course, he will not listen to me.

113
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:33,726
I should not have said that.

114
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,567
A thief?

115
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:03,686
She should have been back long ago.

116
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:05,625
Where is she?

117
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:06,626
This is my fault.

118
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:08,457
I should have gone with her.

119
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,027
Young Master.

120
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:13,897
Look, over there.

121
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:21,167
Eun Woo.

122
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:23,976
My gosh.

123
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:49,365
She lost consciousness due to an unstable pulse caused by shock.

124
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:50,667
But thankfully, no blood loss was detected.

125
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:53,365
- What is he saying? - How would I know?

126
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:55,937
"Thankfully, she did not bleed."

127
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:57,677
"She fainted from shock."

128
00:09:57,937 --> 00:09:59,476
Why can you not say that?

129
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:00,677
Move!

130
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,047
Oh, dear.

131
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:10,187
Use Naegwan and Sinmun.

132
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:12,856
Let go! Of course, I know that.

133
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:26,966
Hey.

134
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,176
Stay right here until she wakes up.

135
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:30,506
Do not take your eyes off of her.

136
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:32,506
If you take even one step away, I will...

137
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:34,177
I will take care of her.

138
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:39,216
Leave, will you?

139
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,187
Oh, okay.

140
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:44,417
Physician Yoo will take better care of her than you would.

141
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:45,787
Come on.

142
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:49,426
Young Master, then when will you leave for Hanyang...

143
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:51,156
Get out! Go!

144
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:52,866
Stop. I am leaving.

145
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:58,437
Until Lady Seo fully recovers,

146
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:00,937
do not even bring up Hanyang.

147
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,777
How could you...

148
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,077
expect her to freely treat patients without you?

149
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:08,006
I bet you have not even thought of it.

150
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:09,917
You selfish fool.

151
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:56,547
Eun Woo.

152
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:05,957
Did she wake up?

153
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:29,876
You are okay now.

154
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:32,187
I am truly glad.

155
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:42,327
I am glad. I just...

156
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:49,297
You are too brave for your own good. Why wander around alone at night?

157
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:50,636
My point, exactly.

158
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:53,766
Why did you go there so late?

159
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:56,736
Well...

160
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:59,245
I was on my way to get Physician Yoo's book...

161
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:01,876
and other things I had to return to him.

162
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:05,515
That late?

163
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:06,516
Exactly.

164
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,246
Do not do that ever again.

165
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:14,327
It is dangerous to go out alone at night.

166
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:17,126
It is my fault.

167
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:19,226
I should have tagged along.

168
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:21,027
You? Why?

169
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:26,006
I will come and accompany you.

170
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,416
I thought things were going well between her and Physician Yoo.

171
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:39,417
What is this?

172
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,216
When it comes to romantic relationships, you just never know.

173
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:48,356
My young master is no match for him.

174
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,256
Whatever. Leave them be.

175
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:53,397
Right, that house.

176
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,266
The deputy minister died, so only his wife and daughter live there.

177
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,937
Oh, the thief must have been after their money.

178
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:02,177
There is a chance that he was not a thief.

179
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:04,336
If he was not a thief, then who was he?

180
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:08,716
I should go find out what is going on.

181
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:09,976
I must find out who this man is.

182
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:11,147
- No! - No.

183
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:14,846
I will go.

184
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,287
As a royal inspector, it is my job to catch thieves.

185
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:18,886
I will go.

186
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:21,827
As a physician, it is my job to treat the ill.

187
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:28,167
Then you two can go together.

188
00:16:28,736 --> 00:16:29,936
- Yes. - Yes.

189
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:31,166
Go together? Why?

190
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,167
Why should I?

191
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:35,336
You both said you would go.

192
00:16:58,356 --> 00:17:00,366
I thought you were leaving like I asked you to.

193
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,466
Just leave, will you?

194
00:17:02,736 --> 00:17:05,096
No. I never planned to leave.

195
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:12,177
I gave you a chance. Why will you not leave?

196
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:15,047
Must I hold a knife to your throat to talk sense into you?

197
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:17,177
Or...

198
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:19,187
is this about Eun Woo?

199
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:22,316
Gyesoo Clinic is my home and family now,

200
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:24,457
so Eun Woo is certainly one of the reasons.

201
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:26,726
That is all the more reason for you to leave.

202
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:29,055
Fighting those who are after you...

203
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:30,296
will endanger everyone.

204
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:39,667
Eun Woo getting hurt like this.

205
00:17:40,236 --> 00:17:41,306
Do you find it a coincidence?

206
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:44,437
Are you suggesting...

207
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:47,546
that Ms. Eun Woo's attacker was after me?

208
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:51,647
It would make you an easier target to eliminate.

209
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:55,286
Another assassin could've been dispatched.

210
00:17:56,986 --> 00:17:58,957
I will show no mercy to anyone...

211
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:01,897
who harms her.

212
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:04,957
Likewise.

213
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:22,716
May one ask why a royal inspector has come by our residence?

214
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:25,816
I heard a robbery took place here last night.

215
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:27,986
A robbery?

216
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,117
A witness places someone jumping over your walls.

217
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:34,387
Is there anything that has gone missing?

218
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:43,066
Please mind me, but I still do not follow.

219
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:46,506
Given that it was especially silent last night,

220
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:49,036
I slept through the whole night.

221
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:54,347
It seems as though you have the wrong house.

222
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:56,677
See them out.

223
00:19:20,107 --> 00:19:22,536
- You there. - Yes, my lord.

224
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:25,076
Does your master have a daughter?

225
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:30,276
I must see her as it is crucial to our visit.

226
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,647
It is against custom...

227
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:35,417
to privately meet a young maiden before she is married.

228
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:38,756
This man is a royal inspector,

229
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:41,026
and we are investigating a serious matter.

230
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:42,996
Are you refusing to aid a royal inspector?

231
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:47,867
Unless my master orders me to, I cannot allow it.

232
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:53,137
I see a royal inspector does not carry much weight.

233
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:59,206
How dare you! Are you not aware...

234
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,177
that you can be punished for not following my command?

235
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:06,216
Lead us to her. I will take responsibility.

236
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:15,996
My lady, it is I.

237
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:24,566
My lady.

238
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:30,107
Lady Yeon Hwa, please wake up.

239
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:31,337
My lady.

240
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:33,407
I must take her to the clinic.

241
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:37,246
No, she cannot leave without her mother's approval.

242
00:20:37,476 --> 00:20:38,986
Then, how are we to help her?

243
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:41,986
I will not go.

244
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:45,556
My lady, are you all right?

245
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:48,897
I will not go anywhere.

246
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:58,437
Could the young lady have run into the burglar last night?

247
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:01,566
Well...

248
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:04,437
Something seems to have happened.

249
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:07,475
However, rather than being in shock,

250
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,216
she is fatigued and withdrawn.

251
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:12,016
Something must be gravely troubling her.

252
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:15,516
Truth be told,

253
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:19,486
something terrible almost happened to her.

254
00:21:20,226 --> 00:21:21,427
Something terrible?

255
00:21:24,857 --> 00:21:26,867
A kidnapper broke in.

256
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,536
A kidnapper?

257
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,207
And now, she is frightened of him returning.

258
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:47,947
A kidnapper?

259
00:21:48,986 --> 00:21:50,985
I have heard of widows being kidnapped,

260
00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:51,986
but not young maidens.

261
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:54,556
That is not all that was puzzling.

262
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:57,495
The story suggests the young lady was in shock,

263
00:21:57,496 --> 00:21:58,697
but her pulse...

264
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:01,597
was that of someone fatigued and withdrawn.

265
00:22:01,796 --> 00:22:04,437
It was her mother who seemed more nervous.

266
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:09,475
The daughter was raised by her single mother...

267
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:11,707
and has not left her quarters since birth.

268
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:14,847
If that daughter was almost kidnapped,

269
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:17,316
would she not have reported it to the authorities?

270
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:18,776
That is also what I thought.

271
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:21,687
She did not speak the truth even to the royal inspector...

272
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,117
which has me concerned.

273
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:26,126
Maybe I should meet her tomorrow.

274
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:29,225
Nonsense. You are hardly back to full health.

275
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:30,825
I feel better now.

276
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:33,197
It was I who saw the kidnapper, so allow me to meet the family.

277
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:37,265
We are not even sure that there was a kidnapper.

278
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:39,867
If that is not the case, you could be in danger.

279
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:42,736
Someone other than a kidnapper?

280
00:22:43,736 --> 00:22:44,976
And I could be in danger?

281
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:52,746
I will be of help as I am a witness.

282
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:54,286
Let me accompany you.

283
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:01,657
So that is what happened. I understand.

284
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:05,157
What did I say about letting strangers in?

285
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,466
We are only here to confirm some facts.

286
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:14,036
She has already informed me of the kidnapper.

287
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:17,976
Then, why did you not speak the truth yesterday?

288
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:20,576
She is to be married into a noble family.

289
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,846
By speaking of a kidnapping that may not even be true,

290
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:25,687
you will ruin my daughter's chance at having a good life.

291
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:29,187
How could you believe the words of my lowly servants?

292
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:31,516
Lady Yeon Hwa seems to be in great pain.

293
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,226
She should at least be treated.

294
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:40,066
I have heard about you, my lady.

295
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,295
Even though you became a widow at a young age,

296
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,697
rather than showing respect,

297
00:23:43,937 --> 00:23:46,206
you snipped your ribbon, let your hair down,

298
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:48,137
and have been living as you please.

299
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:52,305
To those who value tradition and custom,

300
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,076
you are considered unlucky and unfortunate.

301
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:59,986
My daughter is nothing like you.

302
00:24:02,046 --> 00:24:03,386
Take my words to heart.

303
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:06,786
What you heard today should not leave your mouth.

304
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:11,495
Should a false rumour ruin my daughter's future,

305
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:12,996
I will let terror...

306
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:15,526
rain down on whomever started it.

307
00:24:16,897 --> 00:24:19,036
Madam.

308
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:24,036
Lady Yeon Hwa...

309
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:38,516
Must you be this weak?

310
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:43,897
A long-term stagnation has drained her fluids and energy.

311
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:45,055
Her liver and heart...

312
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,167
are also being blocked from functioning properly.

313
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:50,566
Acupuncture should be performed to regain her energy flow.

314
00:24:50,597 --> 00:24:52,936
Then, she should take a brewed tonic...

315
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:54,535
to strengthen her liver and kidney.

316
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,677
(Yukmi, Cheongsimbohyeoltang: tonics to energize the liver and kidney)

317
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:02,046
I cannot have a male physician perform acupuncture on her.

318
00:25:02,516 --> 00:25:04,276
Prescribe the tonic for her instead.

319
00:25:06,216 --> 00:25:08,187
I may be of bad luck,

320
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:10,686
but studying medicine has made me useful...

321
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:11,857
when it comes to treating women.

322
00:25:12,216 --> 00:25:15,156
The needle only has to be placed on the Habgok,

323
00:25:15,157 --> 00:25:16,597
so there is no need for her to be embarrassed.

324
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,716
One, two,

325
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:38,617
three.

326
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:45,587
I feel better now.

327
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:52,367
I cannot allow her to leave her quarters,

328
00:25:52,496 --> 00:25:54,097
so you will make house calls instead.

329
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:07,647
My lady, you must have been terrified the other night.

330
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,476
I fainted after running into him out on the streets,

331
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:14,187
so I can only imagine how shocked you were.

332
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:19,016
Could you perhaps tell me what happened that night?

333
00:26:25,457 --> 00:26:28,266
- My lady! - What is it?

334
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:31,437
Where did you get this?

335
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:33,506
Where?

336
00:26:41,377 --> 00:26:42,516
Please leave.

337
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:46,617
Please let me be and leave!

338
00:26:51,187 --> 00:26:53,226
Why is the young lady in such a state?

339
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:56,526
My guess is that she is shocked by encountering the kidnapper.

340
00:26:57,026 --> 00:26:58,856
Is it not an anxiety disorder?

341
00:26:58,857 --> 00:26:59,995
(Gyeonggye, Jeongchung: an anxiety disorder)

342
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:02,796
No. If being in shock was the cause of her illness,

343
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:05,236
her heart would have been pounding.

344
00:27:05,697 --> 00:27:07,736
But she has a weakened digestive system...

345
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:09,506
and her pulse was thready.

346
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:12,947
So, what is she suffering from?

347
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:18,617
Physicians are not as smart as they claim to be.

348
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:21,016
If you were, you would have diagnosed her.

349
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:22,786
I am only being cautious.

350
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:27,486
One must know the cause in order to treat her illness.

351
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:30,957
By the looks of it, she is afraid of the kidnapper.

352
00:27:32,226 --> 00:27:33,566
Although the threat is no longer.

353
00:27:34,496 --> 00:27:35,837
So how will you treat her?

354
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:53,986
Again? Where do you keep going these days?

355
00:27:54,516 --> 00:27:56,916
When the dunce comes back, tell him to see the patients.

356
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:59,785
And he is not to give the nobles a discount, okay?

357
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:00,956
I asked where you are going.

358
00:28:00,957 --> 00:28:03,026
Are you seeing someone? Will I have a stepmom?

359
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:05,127
You will be an old groom.

360
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:08,725
Gye Ji Han is getting married.

361
00:28:08,726 --> 00:28:10,795
You will be struck by lightning for saying that.

362
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:12,566
Do not wish him on any woman.

363
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,975
"Physician Gye is the stingiest of men."

364
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:18,137
"What woman in the world would like him?"

365
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:20,806
Is what Man Bok said.

366
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:23,746
Hey, you...

367
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:25,715
- No. - Yes.

368
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:26,815
- No. - Yes.

369
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:29,087
I did not mean that. What I meant was...

370
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,357
Whoa...

371
00:28:30,687 --> 00:28:33,485
Oh, whatever. Since we are on the topic...

372
00:28:33,486 --> 00:28:35,426
That is not your only flaw.

373
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:36,956
You are mean and finicky.

374
00:28:36,957 --> 00:28:38,957
And you curse whenever you speak.

375
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:41,465
- Yes. - When he is drunk, woof, woof.

376
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:43,337
He barks like a dog.

377
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:44,996
Stop saying such nonsense!

378
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:49,066
I can barely support you lot, okay?

379
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:54,707
I know! Who would take in my ill-tempered dad?

380
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,676
Jang Gun. Do you want to fight me?

381
00:28:58,677 --> 00:28:59,687
- Do you? - No.

382
00:29:04,486 --> 00:29:07,457
Have you seen this herb before?

383
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:09,226
No.

384
00:29:11,357 --> 00:29:13,667
How many such stores are there here?

385
00:29:16,837 --> 00:29:18,837
About three, I think?

386
00:30:20,127 --> 00:30:22,226
What was that noise?

387
00:30:25,437 --> 00:30:26,437
What noise?

388
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:29,677
Who are you?

389
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,515
- Who are you? - Thief!

390
00:30:36,516 --> 00:30:38,446
Thief!

391
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:39,486
You thief!

392
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:53,597
- Granny. - Bok!

393
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:57,137
Oh, dear.

394
00:30:57,496 --> 00:30:58,697
- No way. - Halt.

395
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:02,907
Not this way.

396
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:11,316
You, keep still.

397
00:31:13,286 --> 00:31:14,986
- Man Bok. - My crotch.

398
00:31:17,857 --> 00:31:19,086
Stop right there!

399
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,726
- You! - Stop!

400
00:31:25,627 --> 00:31:26,627
Eun Woo.

401
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,566
It is okay. She is okay.

402
00:31:35,736 --> 00:31:38,637
It was definitely the thief.

403
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:41,607
He knew you were here and barged in.

404
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:44,576
It gives me the chills. Look.

405
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:52,117
I am fine now. I was just startled.

406
00:31:55,486 --> 00:31:58,427
I think we should all sleep here with her.

407
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:02,766
Yes. We will sleep in here with you.

408
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,167
All together?

409
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:05,796
That will be fun.

410
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:10,006
I will bring some snacks.

411
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:45,107
Oh?

412
00:32:47,506 --> 00:32:50,516
Why is the ground wet when it did not rain?

413
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:12,397
Strange. It is so strange.

414
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:16,607
What is it Jang Gun? Is something missing?

415
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:19,506
No. It is really strange.

416
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,746
Yangjegeun, gamcho, hwangi.

417
00:33:23,076 --> 00:33:24,377
They are all here.

418
00:33:25,476 --> 00:33:27,847
But there is something else.

419
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:33,157
Where did you get these?

420
00:33:34,486 --> 00:33:36,127
Did he leave them behind?

421
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,697
Oh, could this be what he came to steal?

422
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:42,466
- What? - We do not use such precious herbs.

423
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:45,097
Physician Gye has no money and says...

424
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:46,966
"Do you think this is the Palace?"

425
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:50,637
To us.

426
00:33:56,976 --> 00:33:57,976
Wait.

427
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:01,947
I need to go out.

428
00:34:02,246 --> 00:34:03,256
Okay.

429
00:34:04,957 --> 00:34:05,957
Oh, dear.

430
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:08,786
My lady. Where are you going?

431
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:13,266
You cannot go out on your own just yet.

432
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:40,686
It has not rained in days.

433
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:41,857
But there is mud.

434
00:34:45,757 --> 00:34:46,766
Medicinal herbs.

435
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:49,667
The mountains.

436
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:57,250
What did Choi Dol Seok do two days ago at the Hour of the Dog?

437
00:34:57,251 --> 00:34:58,480
He was having an affair...

438
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:00,380
and was with Wooi the gisaeng.

439
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:01,550
Wooi admitted to it.

440
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,389
And Park Yong Joo?

441
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,049
He drowned his unwed sorrows in drink,

442
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,819
then went around the village yelling he should...

443
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,560
kidnap someone to be his bride.

444
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:10,561
My lord.

445
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,300
You have no idea how hard I looked for you.

446
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,271
Me? Why?

447
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:21,339
The Second State Councillor is summoning you to Hanyang.

448
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,470
You must return immediately.

449
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,570
Why are you relaying a message to me?

450
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,381
Do you not know?

451
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:33,820
I am incredibly close with the Second State Councillor.

452
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:36,550
Have you even met my father?

453
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:41,260
You contacted many people...

454
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,461
to try to become one of my allies?

455
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,590
Yes.

456
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:49,901
Until the day I die, I will serve you...

457
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,930
until my bones turn to dust.

458
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,570
You are so cheerful.

459
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,740
You must have seen him at work.

460
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,840
What has Sin Woo been up to?

461
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,279
Well, he is working very hard on his investigatory duties.

462
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
And also...

463
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:16,121
Well, he seems to be hiding something as well.

464
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:19,231
Is he?

465
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,700
What is it?

466
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,030
Pardon?

467
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,941
It is not anything too hefty.

468
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:31,240
It is a blackened needle about this long.

469
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:35,381
It is not a needle physicians use most of the time.

470
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:37,350
It looks unusual...

471
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:40,581
and has a squared, flat shape.

472
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:43,490
It looked like he was carrying it around...

473
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,760
to investigate something in secret.

474
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:57,300
You seem awfully interested in Sin Woo.

475
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,070
Oh.

476
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,871
Please forgive me. It was not my place to say such a thing.

477
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,590
Drink up.

478
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,260
I knew it. We should have met sooner.

479
00:37:24,831 --> 00:37:25,860
Thank you, my lord.

480
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:30,570
Wait for my orders.

481
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:33,371
But in the meantime, keep tabs on him and report to me.

482
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:35,970
Sure thing, my lord.

483
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:40,541
I am at your command, my lord.

484
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,359
The mud on the suspect's shoes...

485
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,790
was found in the yard here...

486
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,860
and on the walls at Deputy Minister Choi's house.

487
00:37:59,331 --> 00:38:01,461
And he has rare medicinal herbs in his possession.

488
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:03,731
He must be an herb picker.

489
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:05,929
That is true. You cannot get such good-quality medicinal herbs...

490
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,570
even at the dispensaries. You must pick them yourself.

491
00:38:08,601 --> 00:38:10,509
It is humid at the top of Mount Sorak.

492
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,140
I heard there was wet mud everywhere.

493
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:14,909
Yes. I saw that when I went up there to find gastrodiae rhizoma...

494
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,910
for my young master.

495
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:17,081
- Yes. - I see.

496
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:20,550
A lonely herb picker came to the village to kidnap someone?

497
00:38:21,351 --> 00:38:22,851
There are three herb pickers in Mount Sorak.

498
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,920
It becomes steep and humid halfway up the mountain,

499
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:27,421
so it is not easy to climb to the top.

500
00:38:33,831 --> 00:38:35,460
Wild ginseng of such high quality...

501
00:38:35,461 --> 00:38:37,671
can only be picked by the herb picker who lives in the valley.

502
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:38,901
What?

503
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:42,040
Oh, my. You can figure out where they live by just smelling herbs?

504
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,871
This is truly fascinating.

505
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:47,010
No.

506
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,811
Uncle Gae Ddong told me.

507
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,909
He said he found rare wild ginseng for the first time in years.

508
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,311
Oh, so he told you.

509
00:38:52,851 --> 00:38:54,581
- Hey! - Careful!

510
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,450
I should go there as soon as the sun comes up.

511
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:07,901
Why is Yoo Se Yeob still alive?

512
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,041
I have a question.

513
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,581
Yoo Se Yeob is a mere physician.

514
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:26,251
Why must you get him killed in secret?

515
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,651
By any chance,

516
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,220
is there a specific reason?

517
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,760
You need a reason?

518
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:41,831
This is very unlike you.

519
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,070
You may leave.

520
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:31,610
Gosh. Did we come to the wrong place?

521
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:39,450
This way.

522
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,430
Oh, boy.

523
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,061
Young Master, this must be the place.

524
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,530
I will go in first. Follow me.

525
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,541
You thief!

526
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:08,251
Hush.

527
00:41:20,401 --> 00:41:21,461
My goodness.

528
00:41:24,331 --> 00:41:25,430
Young Master, what do we do?

529
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,700
Excuse me.

530
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:30,871
Wake up!

531
00:41:35,311 --> 00:41:36,680
- Take him to the room. - Yes, my lord.

532
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,110
Eun Woo!

533
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:39,880
Yes.

534
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:42,050
- Please administer acupuncture. - Okay.

535
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,131
Do you think he needs a needle in Sipseon too?

536
00:41:53,731 --> 00:41:56,771
No, his pulse is too weak.

537
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,600
The prolonged stagnation of energy has dried up his blood and fluids.

538
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,570
The energy of the liver and heart is not circulating at all.

539
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,110
Oh, wait.

540
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,211
It is exactly like Lady Yeon Hwa's symptoms.

541
00:42:11,351 --> 00:42:12,550
No.

542
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,720
No...

543
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:17,121
You woke up.

544
00:42:38,371 --> 00:42:39,410
My gosh.

545
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:44,311
Oh, dear. A man cannot even swallow a spoonful?

546
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,561
Please let me be and leave!

547
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,001
I think...

548
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,070
they have the same illness.

549
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,541
The same illness?

550
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,081
We caught the man who tried to kidnap you.

551
00:43:23,021 --> 00:43:24,791
He even came to the clinic...

552
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:26,990
and tried to attack Eun Woo.

553
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,930
No.

554
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,731
No! He would never do such a thing.

555
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:35,901
You know him, right?

556
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,001
What happened between the two of you?

557
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:49,381
If you do not say anything, he will be arrested.

558
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,581
Even if you do not tell us,

559
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,950
we know who he is.

560
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,851
Rare medicinal herbs only professional herb pickers can get.

561
00:44:00,621 --> 00:44:02,360
The daenggi cut in half.

562
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,590
And most importantly,

563
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,631
the two of you share the exact same symptoms.

564
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:13,840
We already know who you are trying to protect.

565
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:20,010
We just...

566
00:44:23,851 --> 00:44:26,211
We just wanted to be together. That is all.

567
00:44:32,151 --> 00:44:34,461
After my father passed away,

568
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,961
my family's wealth started to dwindle.

569
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,730
Oh, I am so forgetful. I forgot to bring the money.

570
00:44:39,731 --> 00:44:41,061
I will be right back.

571
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,430
Until I could marry a man who would help us financially,

572
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,970
I was to stay in the women's quarters.

573
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,581
Then one day, I happened to see him.

574
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,081
Is it heavy?

575
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:57,450
Shall I carry it for you?

576
00:44:58,910 --> 00:44:59,910
Okay.

577
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:03,320
Where do you need to go?

578
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,820
Let us go.

579
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:31,410
I told you that my mother would never approve of you.

580
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:34,251
You did not have to go through this.

581
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,220
Let us...

582
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:46,160
leave together.

583
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,530
Would you come with me?

584
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:08,950
Take my heart.

585
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:17,660
That is why we planned such an incident.

586
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:22,700
I thought my mother would give up if I got kidnapped.

587
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:26,070
But...

588
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:29,601
No! Moo Young!

589
00:46:30,101 --> 00:46:31,211
Moo Young!

590
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,811
How dare you fancy my daughter?

591
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:35,740
You will not leave this house in one piece!

592
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:38,580
Run!

593
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:40,481
Please make it out of here alive!

594
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,700
If I chose to be with him,

595
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,470
he might end up losing his life.

596
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,340
I will never see him again,

597
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:08,280
so please forgive me.

598
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,191
They both are suffering from being lovesick.

599
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,160
All day long, one can only think of the other.

600
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:31,929
The illness is not stated in medical books,

601
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,570
and it is tough to cure.

602
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:37,771
One cannot eat properly or sleep for that matter.

603
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,410
Smiles quickly fade and loneliness takes over.

604
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,510
They both miss each other so much.

605
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,751
I apologize, Physician Yoo.

606
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,990
I kept you from leaving.

607
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:02,901
But...

608
00:48:03,871 --> 00:48:06,271
I know you will have to leave.

609
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:11,811
That is right.

610
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:14,211
And I must also...

611
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,811
apologize.

612
00:48:55,921 --> 00:48:59,751
Oh, no. This again?

613
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,260
Do you recognize this herb?

614
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:06,461
To think of what I went through because of this...

615
00:49:08,601 --> 00:49:11,800
The Minister of Personnel died while looking into this herb.

616
00:49:12,871 --> 00:49:14,101
If you value your life,

617
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:16,441
you will leave immediately.

618
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,811
What do you mean this caused you trouble?

619
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:20,240
And why?

620
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:23,711
Because...

621
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,851
rumour had it that the herb was what led to the late King's death.

622
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:31,720
You must have been excited thinking that is wild ginseng,

623
00:49:32,191 --> 00:49:33,920
but you will be dragged to the State Tribunal...

624
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:34,961
if you are caught with it.

625
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,890
Now leave.

626
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,131
This conversation never happened.

627
00:49:43,771 --> 00:49:44,771
Yoo Hoo Myung.

628
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,101
How deep were you able to dig?

629
00:50:01,651 --> 00:50:02,651
Please tell me.

630
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,890
How is she doing?

631
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,291
The medicinal herb from the other day.

632
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:14,461
It was for her. Did you...

633
00:50:15,331 --> 00:50:19,200
Was that why you came by the clinic that night?

634
00:50:22,271 --> 00:50:25,240
I saw you two making house calls.

635
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,240
I wanted to secretly drop them off,

636
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:30,680
but you thought I was a thief.

637
00:50:32,311 --> 00:50:33,351
My apologies.

638
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,720
How is she doing?

639
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,961
Lady Yeon Hwa is feeling better.

640
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:49,901
You should focus on getting better yourself.

641
00:50:54,271 --> 00:50:55,871
Son Moo Young, come out here!

642
00:51:01,211 --> 00:51:02,211
Father.

643
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:05,751
What is going on?

644
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,780
I heard that Son Moo Young was here.

645
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,651
Did he do something terrible?

646
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:14,961
He has been charged with theft.

647
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:18,291
Arrest him.

648
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,390
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

649
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,231
Was the report filed by Deputy Minister Choi's wife?

650
00:51:23,101 --> 00:51:24,101
That is right.

651
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:27,371
But Father, he is sick.

652
00:51:39,674 --> 00:51:40,984
These are from him.

653
00:51:43,584 --> 00:51:46,053
Come. You should see him.

654
00:51:48,183 --> 00:51:49,183
No.

655
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:52,453
All I did was bring him back luck,

656
00:51:53,223 --> 00:51:55,093
and now he has been arrested.

657
00:51:57,124 --> 00:51:58,794
It must end here.

658
00:52:01,134 --> 00:52:03,203
I am of no use to him.

659
00:52:05,504 --> 00:52:07,303
Are you planning on not eating at all?

660
00:52:10,843 --> 00:52:11,973
Is she aware...

661
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:17,183
of my arrest and imprisonment?

662
00:52:22,384 --> 00:52:23,384
You must not...

663
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:26,593
tell her.

664
00:52:29,794 --> 00:52:33,464
You should let yourself be treated at least for her sake.

665
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:36,604
Even if I make it out of here,

666
00:52:38,874 --> 00:52:41,174
I will not let myself hold her down.

667
00:52:45,243 --> 00:52:46,243
I will leave the village.

668
00:52:55,783 --> 00:52:58,093
(Let Us Protect Their Beautiful Love)

669
00:52:58,654 --> 00:53:01,524
One should not keep their feelings bottled up.

670
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:03,993
Feelings must be expressed!

671
00:53:04,993 --> 00:53:06,794
Take those in our village for instance.

672
00:53:07,663 --> 00:53:10,064
A perfectly fine specimen of a man...

673
00:53:10,734 --> 00:53:14,444
accompanies a pretty young lady day and night,

674
00:53:14,803 --> 00:53:16,342
but he seems unaware of his feelings...

675
00:53:16,343 --> 00:53:18,242
or is too shy to actually express them.

676
00:53:18,243 --> 00:53:19,843
It is frustrating, if you ask me.

677
00:53:20,413 --> 00:53:22,343
The lovesick birds will soon come by the clinic.

678
00:53:24,354 --> 00:53:27,214
Physician Gye would be thrilled to have two new patients.

679
00:53:27,884 --> 00:53:29,223
I would hardly be pleased.

680
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:32,452
In their case, it will be incurable...

681
00:53:32,453 --> 00:53:33,892
because of the young man.

682
00:53:33,893 --> 00:53:34,893
Of course.

683
00:53:36,493 --> 00:53:38,163
We should have them marry.

684
00:53:38,464 --> 00:53:41,262
Yes, let them marry.

685
00:53:41,263 --> 00:53:43,803
We can stuff ourselves with noodles and rice cakes.

686
00:53:44,573 --> 00:53:46,033
Marriage, my foot.

687
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:48,773
Being expressive is an acquired talent.

688
00:53:48,774 --> 00:53:51,572
Let me tell you about this particular young man.

689
00:53:51,573 --> 00:53:53,374
He will not be able to express his feelings...

690
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,613
until he takes his last breath.

691
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,483
You speak as if you have expressed your feelings often.

692
00:53:59,484 --> 00:54:02,183
Of course I have. You have no idea.

693
00:54:02,854 --> 00:54:04,153
- "My darling." - Stop that.

694
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:05,154
"I apologize."

695
00:54:08,194 --> 00:54:09,693
You are just as frustrating...

696
00:54:09,694 --> 00:54:11,162
when it comes to expressing your feelings,

697
00:54:11,163 --> 00:54:13,762
so practice when you can by using Man Bok...

698
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:14,904
as a dummy.

699
00:54:15,263 --> 00:54:18,134
Goodness. As if practicing will help.

700
00:54:19,303 --> 00:54:20,433
That is it!

701
00:54:21,404 --> 00:54:22,803
I must set it up immediately.

702
00:54:24,413 --> 00:54:25,643
Set what up?

703
00:54:27,073 --> 00:54:29,682
What is it? Will he confess his feelings?

704
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,683
What?

705
00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:32,654
Lady Eun Woo,

706
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:35,924
you must accompany me. Shall we?

707
00:54:42,763 --> 00:54:45,734
We will be having a feast soon!

708
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:54,033
- Goodness. - A feast.

709
00:54:57,473 --> 00:54:58,944
You want me to release him?

710
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,383
First, you ignore my telling you to leave.

711
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,214
And now, you ask for something preposterous.

712
00:55:05,854 --> 00:55:08,024
Are you that comfortable around me?

713
00:55:11,453 --> 00:55:13,624
You are very much aware...

714
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:16,393
that Son Moo Young did not steal anything.

715
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,634
How can you worry about someone else...

716
00:55:19,964 --> 00:55:21,604
when I have orders to kill you?

717
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:23,833
Because you are someone...

718
00:55:23,834 --> 00:55:26,374
who does not blindly follow unjustified orders.

719
00:55:38,453 --> 00:55:40,983
If you speak your heart in the moonlight,

720
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:43,053
the bamboo forest will relay it to your loved one.

721
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:46,194
Here, no one else can hear what you say,

722
00:55:46,823 --> 00:55:49,223
so you can say whatever has been weighing you down.

723
00:55:55,763 --> 00:55:58,573
Do not worry, my lady.

724
00:55:59,134 --> 00:56:02,004
You can pretend Man Bok is him.

725
00:56:04,143 --> 00:56:07,173
Where do you think you are going? We walked far enough.

726
00:56:07,174 --> 00:56:09,413
The person who wants to talk should go.

727
00:56:09,544 --> 00:56:11,282
- But... - Leave the women alone...

728
00:56:11,283 --> 00:56:13,512
so they can truly bare their hearts.

729
00:56:13,513 --> 00:56:15,024
- But... - Forget it.

730
00:56:15,424 --> 00:56:16,584
You lead the way.

731
00:56:23,124 --> 00:56:24,493
You are so dull-witted.

732
00:56:24,694 --> 00:56:27,834
I had a plan of my own when I came here.

733
00:56:33,334 --> 00:56:34,343
My lady.

734
00:56:36,004 --> 00:56:38,013
Now say what is on your heart.

735
00:56:43,843 --> 00:56:46,754
There is a lot you wished to say.

736
00:56:49,354 --> 00:56:52,323
I was told such thoughts should be kept to myself.

737
00:56:53,354 --> 00:56:57,093
That bad things happen if I bare my heart.

738
00:56:59,033 --> 00:57:02,763
If something bad were to happen to him...

739
00:57:05,174 --> 00:57:06,504
It will not.

740
00:57:09,643 --> 00:57:12,973
They say the full moon grants wishes.

741
00:57:13,643 --> 00:57:14,984
How about...

742
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:18,013
instead of me, you speak to the moon?

743
00:57:36,464 --> 00:57:37,564
Eun Woo.

744
00:57:45,544 --> 00:57:46,544
Go on.

745
00:58:01,964 --> 00:58:03,294
I miss you.

746
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:09,703
Do not go.

747
00:58:11,734 --> 00:58:14,843
Like right now, stay by my side.

748
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:20,613
Just thinking of you being away makes me feel sad.

749
00:58:25,354 --> 00:58:26,413
That is why.

750
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:44,504
I knew it all along.

751
00:58:44,674 --> 00:58:46,234
She is no ordinary lady.

752
00:58:48,803 --> 00:58:50,743
More than my frustrating master,

753
00:58:51,643 --> 00:58:53,944
she is a hundred times better.

754
00:58:54,643 --> 00:58:55,714
She did it.

755
00:59:04,223 --> 00:59:05,323
Like that.

756
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:08,294
Do just that.

757
00:59:20,004 --> 00:59:22,073
I do not want to leave you.

758
00:59:23,803 --> 00:59:25,374
I wish to be with you.

759
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:28,643
I miss you.

760
00:59:30,314 --> 00:59:31,984
The earth on your hands.

761
00:59:33,783 --> 00:59:35,124
The smile on your face.

762
00:59:36,354 --> 00:59:38,124
The smell of grass. All of it.

763
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,863
Please come back to me alive.

764
00:59:47,093 --> 00:59:48,203
Yeon Hwa.

765
01:00:17,294 --> 01:00:19,694
I always feared I could not reach you.

766
01:00:28,643 --> 01:00:29,904
My heart will always...

767
01:00:32,073 --> 01:00:33,274
belong to you.

768
01:01:08,183 --> 01:01:10,283
Where are Son Moo Young and Deputy Minister Choi's daughter?

769
01:01:11,783 --> 01:01:13,013
They left.

770
01:01:13,113 --> 01:01:14,624
You should have sent them back.

771
01:01:14,854 --> 01:01:17,424
You should have sent Lady Choi home!

772
01:01:18,223 --> 01:01:20,453
If you keep acting out, I must punish you.

773
01:01:21,093 --> 01:01:24,263
What would you do if they both were to die?

774
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:28,234
The two can only live if they are together.

775
01:01:28,504 --> 01:01:31,733
If we do not let them leave now, her mother will never release her.

776
01:01:31,734 --> 01:01:33,634
Are you saying you are in the right?

777
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:35,774
Should we not save them first?

778
01:01:38,774 --> 01:01:40,843
Since when were you so unruly?

779
01:01:41,584 --> 01:01:43,282
If I had known, I would not have...

780
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:44,553
You do not know...

781
01:01:46,084 --> 01:01:48,384
the burning feeling of love.

782
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:02,904
The fool.

783
01:02:04,064 --> 01:02:05,234
Sin Woo...

784
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:07,702
is asking about...

785
01:02:07,703 --> 01:02:10,343
the discoloured needle used to treat the late king?

786
01:02:10,544 --> 01:02:14,314
Everything Im Soon Man said is true?

787
01:02:15,283 --> 01:02:16,283
Is that it?

788
01:02:17,214 --> 01:02:19,754
Yes. Yoo Hoo Myung...

789
01:02:20,413 --> 01:02:22,524
died with the discoloured needle in his fist.

790
01:02:29,194 --> 01:02:32,363
Crucial evidence that the former king was poisoned...

791
01:02:33,033 --> 01:02:34,663
is in the tiger cub's possession?

792
01:02:35,363 --> 01:02:37,404
So he can stab me in the back?

793
01:02:37,533 --> 01:02:39,134
Would he dare do that?

794
01:02:39,734 --> 01:02:41,004
Why not ask him yourself?

795
01:02:43,944 --> 01:02:45,143
Do you know...

796
01:02:46,073 --> 01:02:48,183
why all revolts eventually fail?

797
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:52,984
It is because they cannot cut down one traitor.

798
01:02:55,953 --> 01:02:57,484
To cut them down without hesitation...

799
01:02:58,624 --> 01:03:01,424
and then fill their places with other loyal men.

800
01:03:03,763 --> 01:03:04,933
That is...

801
01:03:05,794 --> 01:03:08,033
what I must do.

802
01:03:13,803 --> 01:03:15,404
Summon Im Soon Man.

803
01:03:17,444 --> 01:03:18,573
Right now.

804
01:03:31,694 --> 01:03:35,524
You do not know the burning feeling of love.

805
01:03:58,314 --> 01:03:59,854
Did the Second State Councillor send you?

806
01:04:28,143 --> 01:04:29,544
Eun Woo.

807
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:32,854
You are always braver than I am.

808
01:04:35,323 --> 01:04:39,754
I only relayed what I thought Lady Choi wished to say.

809
01:04:42,194 --> 01:04:46,234
With my hands, I caused the former king to die.

810
01:04:52,104 --> 01:04:53,203
That is why...

811
01:04:54,104 --> 01:04:55,604
I was banished from the Palace...

812
01:04:55,973 --> 01:04:58,073
and unable to use needles.

813
01:04:58,843 --> 01:04:59,944
And also,

814
01:05:01,013 --> 01:05:03,714
someone is still threatening me over that incident.

815
01:05:08,424 --> 01:05:10,053
I do not wish to leave.

816
01:05:11,254 --> 01:05:12,294
However...

817
01:05:13,424 --> 01:05:15,464
I must discover the truth.

818
01:05:18,593 --> 01:05:19,834
Will you still...

819
01:05:22,033 --> 01:05:23,604
wait for me?

820
01:05:57,863 --> 01:06:01,033
Sin Woo must be involved in it too.

821
01:06:01,544 --> 01:06:03,973
The Second State Councillor’s son was attacked before he could slay me.

822
01:06:04,374 --> 01:06:05,374
Who attacked him?

823
01:06:06,143 --> 01:06:07,912
- Se Yeob. - Your Majesty.

824
01:06:07,913 --> 01:06:10,512
A court maid from the Royal Kitchen will be here soon.

825
01:06:10,513 --> 01:06:11,683
Treat her.

826
01:06:13,214 --> 01:06:14,653
I suppose she cannot talk.

827
01:06:14,654 --> 01:06:16,483
I found the court maid.
