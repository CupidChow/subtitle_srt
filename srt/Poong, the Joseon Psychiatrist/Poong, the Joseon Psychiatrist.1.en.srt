(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:46,892
Head Acupuncturist Yoo Se Yeob.

4
00:00:47,762 --> 00:00:49,023
He was born in Hanyang,

5
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:52,563
and has never gone beyond the Four Main Gates.

6
00:00:52,563 --> 00:00:54,633
He is a true man of Hanyang.

7
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:08,513
He entered Seonggyungwan at age 15,

8
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:11,212
came first in the Special Exam for Liberal Arts at 17,

9
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:12,483
but that is not all.

10
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:15,883
The next year, at 18, he aced all three major state exams...

11
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:17,993
in the liberal arts category.

12
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:23,022
But he gave up studying arts when his mother died of an illness,

13
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:26,063
and turned to medicine, making him the maddest of the mad.

14
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:31,573
Anyway, he came first in the First and Second Medical Exams,

15
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:33,632
and got into the Medical Office in one go.

16
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:37,302
There is no medical text in Joseon he has not read,

17
00:01:37,673 --> 00:01:39,543
and his extraordinary skills earned him...

18
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:43,043
the title of Head Acupuncturist, bestowed by the King.

19
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:45,813
Son of Yoo Hoo Myung, Minister of Personnel,

20
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:47,052
he was born with a silver spoon,

21
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:49,483
and everyone from the King down to the maids...

22
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:52,492
wished to be treated by my young master.

23
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:56,623
I almost forgot, he is deathly good-looking.

24
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:58,063
Look at them all swoon.

25
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:01,032
It is almost a myth that all the patients he saw...

26
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:04,032
since becoming a physician, he cured.

27
00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:08,073
Just when he was doing so well,

28
00:02:08,073 --> 00:02:10,302
curing a hundred percent of his patients...

29
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:21,623
What is the matter?

30
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:23,882
What is wrong?

31
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:27,022
Oh, dear.

32
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:30,263
Do something. What if she were to die?

33
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:44,312
She is already dead.

34
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:46,173
She is dead?

35
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:48,242
What should we do, then?

36
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:51,483
She is a maid from the Royal Kitchen.

37
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:52,652
Halt!

38
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:55,953
Wait.

39
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,062
What? Do you think...

40
00:03:08,462 --> 00:03:10,663
you can revive a dead girl?

41
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,902
No. She is not yet dead.

42
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:17,142
You almost killed her,

43
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:19,742
but she met me and she will live.

44
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:26,582
What are you doing?

45
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:31,353
She looks dead because her energy is not reaching her brain,

46
00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:32,522
but she is alive.

47
00:03:32,522 --> 00:03:34,392
Did she not let out a scream...

48
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:36,223
before she fell and began to convulse?

49
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:39,592
She did. She screamed, then fell and convulsed.

50
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:41,533
It is epilepsy.

51
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:43,163
Please step back.

52
00:03:56,742 --> 00:03:57,883
Oh, dear.

53
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:04,182
The acupuncture points...

54
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:05,622
(Cheondol, Hwagae, Okdang)

55
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:06,992
are Cheondol, Hwagae, Okdang.

56
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:22,802
One.

57
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,612
Two. Three.

58
00:04:29,642 --> 00:04:32,383
- Goodness. - She is alive.

59
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:35,822
- Give me the scissors. - What?

60
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:37,853
- Scissors! - Oh, yes.

61
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:43,893
What on earth are you doing?

62
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:46,692
You cannot rip a court maid's skirt...

63
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,333
You pronounced her dead just a few minutes ago.

64
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,673
What is the big deal of cutting a girl's skirt...

65
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:53,333
when you almost killed her?

66
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,742
Book 64 of Energy and Medicine.

67
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,012
"Epilepsy causes a patient to appear dead,"

68
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:02,942
"but timely acupuncture can save them."

69
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:05,283
I knew that already.

70
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,983
There is no time to waste.

71
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,283
I will use one more needle to revive her.

72
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:17,062
One, two...

73
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:19,663
three.

74
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:28,572
She is alive. You saved her!

75
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:44,593
How dare you make such a noise?

76
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:49,593
His Highness the Crown Prince is at death's door!

77
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,062
(Episode 1)

78
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:59,872
The Crown Prince had malaria not long ago.

79
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:03,103
I told you to tend to him, so why did you not right away?

80
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:05,812
I heard his symptoms today were lighter.

81
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:07,173
The court maid's life...

82
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:08,812
Who cares about a court maid's life?

83
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:12,283
No amount of acupuncture is helping the Crown Prince's symptoms.

84
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,413
His Majesty requested you especially,

85
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:15,853
so do not act out of turn.

86
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:18,423
Just because you studied with the Crown Prince,

87
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:20,492
if you act rudely in front of the King,

88
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:22,793
I will kick you out immediately. Do you understand?

89
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:24,632
Yes.

90
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:33,273
No amount of acupuncture or medicine will cure him.

91
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:37,143
Do you know of a cure?

92
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:40,273
Yes, Your Majesty. I will administer acupuncture,

93
00:06:40,673 --> 00:06:43,983
but I need you to sit a short distance away.

94
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:46,682
You are being insolent again.

95
00:06:47,182 --> 00:06:48,622
Forgive him, Your Majesty.

96
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:57,393
Will this do?

97
00:06:57,393 --> 00:06:58,463
Yes, Your Majesty.

98
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:33,733
One.

99
00:07:35,002 --> 00:07:36,002
Two.

100
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:45,473
Three.

101
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:51,483
Sit me up immediately.

102
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:11,372
Did you make me move knowing he would do this?

103
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:12,702
Yes, Your Majesty.

104
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,903
Agitating the Habgok point...

105
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:17,572
cures indigestion sometimes by causing one to vomit.

106
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:21,283
If you were to sit too close, your robe would have gotten soiled.

107
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:24,442
You administered treatment and saw a step ahead.

108
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:26,452
You live up to your reputation.

109
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:29,122
Son.

110
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:31,822
Do you feel better now?

111
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:34,552
- I feel much better. - Good.

112
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:39,192
Forgive me for telling you not to become a physician.

113
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:41,762
Was that not because...

114
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:44,302
he insisted on studying medicine when he was a great scholar?

115
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:48,242
Is it not true that his own father is still angry?

116
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:50,102
Are you, Lord Yoo?

117
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:52,212
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

118
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:54,982
I must make you Head Acupuncturist.

119
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:57,243
Forgive me for saying this,

120
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:00,182
but I already am Head Acupuncturist, Your Majesty.

121
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:01,212
Are you?

122
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:07,352
That is the highest you can go before you become a Royal Physician.

123
00:09:09,393 --> 00:09:12,133
I will give Physician Yoo Se Yeob...

124
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:13,993
the nickname Divine Needle,

125
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:16,133
as well as 3,600 liters of rice.

126
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:17,562
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:20,003
You are an incredibly talented acupuncturist.

128
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:33,052
Your skills have improved significantly.

129
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:36,653
However, you must not become arrogant. Always do your best.

130
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:39,493
Yes, Father. I will never forget that.

131
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:44,623
Is something the matter?

132
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,763
His Majesty has asked me...

133
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:49,033
to serve as the Supreme Commissioner of the Medical Office.

134
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,033
(Supreme Commissioner: The highest advisory position)

135
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:55,173
Is His Majesty experiencing health problems?

136
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:03,883
Se Yeob, His Majesty plans to conquer the North soon.

137
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:08,552
But the Second State Councilor and his followers will try to stop him.

138
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,552
A big storm is coming.

139
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,592
The stagnation of energy caused by stress...

140
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:15,722
will significantly worsen his boils.

141
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:16,722
I am deeply concerned.

142
00:10:17,462 --> 00:10:18,763
We cannot do that, Your Majesty.

143
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:23,033
Second State Councilor. 5 years ago, and even 3 years ago...

144
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:26,202
You advised me against it and said we should wait for the right time.

145
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:31,202
Do you truly wish to advance into the North?

146
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:34,712
A sword cannot be sheathed again once drawn.

147
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:37,682
Your Majesty must choose the most opportune time.

148
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:39,913
An uprising has occurred in Qing's border area.

149
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,452
The country is in turmoil,

150
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:43,852
so we absolutely cannot miss this opportunity.

151
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,253
I will dispatch the main army,

152
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:48,663
so you ought to prepare thoroughly.

153
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:49,663
Must you...

154
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:52,793
let your high-handed decision...

155
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,533
cause another bloodbath on our soil?

156
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,602
Please reconsider!

157
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:00,732
Second State Councilor!

158
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:04,102
The people who were taken hostage in the Year of the Red Rat...

159
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:06,312
are still suffering.

160
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:07,913
I ought to...

161
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:12,212
save them as soon as I can for it is my duty.

162
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:23,793
We were keeping a close watch on him.

163
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:27,432
When did the King conspire with the Chief General?

164
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:29,832
It would be like throwing ourselves into a blazing fire.

165
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:31,802
We must stop him at all costs.

166
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:43,113
His Majesty will not realize his dream of conquering the North.

167
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:15,182
Your Majesty, your nighttime refreshments are here.

168
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,903
Your Majesty, did you have a nightmare?

169
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:12,503
We must expedite our plan to attack the North.

170
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:22,013
Time is of the essence.

171
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,952
Go as fast as you can and deliver this to the Chief General.

172
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:19,602
Your Majesty.

173
00:14:20,202 --> 00:14:21,873
Please issue an order at once...

174
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:23,773
to stop the army from advancing into the North.

175
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:55,572
Please, Your Majesty!

176
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:57,472
Please think about the people...

177
00:14:57,472 --> 00:15:00,743
who will suffer because of this, Your Majesty.

178
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:05,552
- Please show mercy, Your Majesty. - Please show mercy, Your Majesty.

179
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:09,822
Why is it...

180
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:17,822
that none of you understand my intentions?

181
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:23,903
Your Majesty.

182
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:25,802
Your Majesty!

183
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:27,572
What are you waiting for?

184
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:30,043
Take His Majesty to his bedchamber!

185
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:33,013
Please open your eyes, Your Majesty!

186
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:42,423
Where are you going looking like that?

187
00:15:42,623 --> 00:15:44,322
They need me at the palace now. See you later.

188
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:46,052
Stop. I said, stop!

189
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:47,552
My goodness.

190
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:51,993
I must hurry.

191
00:15:57,263 --> 00:15:59,432
Now, you can go. Hurry.

192
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:17,222
Father was healthy.

193
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:18,753
Why did he suddenly fall ill?

194
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:20,092
His concerns wore him down.

195
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:22,023
It caused stagnation of the energy of the liver.

196
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:23,893
Drawing out the pus with the stiletto needle...

197
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:25,763
will reduce his pain instantly.

198
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:27,732
- However... - What is it?

199
00:16:29,102 --> 00:16:31,802
How did the boil grow this much overnight?

200
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:33,273
This is strange.

201
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:34,732
It does not make sense.

202
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:38,472
I cannot administer acupuncture on His Majesty.

203
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:40,273
He should be treated by the royal physician.

204
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:47,052
Are you the head acupuncturist?

205
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:50,123
I trust that you can cure me.

206
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:54,452
Your Majesty, let us wait for the royal physician.

207
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:01,332
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

208
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:03,763
Se Yeob, go ahead and administer acupuncture on my father.

209
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:05,572
Why hesitate?

210
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:07,572
Treat His Majesty at once!

211
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:08,572
No, we cannot do that.

212
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:10,702
Let us wait for the royal physician.

213
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:17,243
We must hurry.

214
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:18,982
Understood.

215
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:23,823
What if...

216
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:26,053
we ruin his health by waiting for the royal physician?

217
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:30,323
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

218
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,192
What if someone used poison that speeds up blood flow...

219
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:34,863
to worsen his boils...

220
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,462
No, poison? That can't be.

221
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:39,532
This is an order.

222
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,373
Make my pain go away at once.

223
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:44,472
Hurry!

224
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:49,343
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

225
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:51,113
Hurry, Se Yeob!

226
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:56,823
No, Se Yeob. You must not do that.

227
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:00,593
Se Yeob, hurry!

228
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:02,462
Do something.

229
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:05,393
Head Acupuncturist Yoo Se Yeob.

230
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:07,393
I will administer acupuncture on His Majesty.

231
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:14,363
Blood!

232
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:23,903
This cannot be.

233
00:19:24,202 --> 00:19:25,742
This bleeding is abnormal.

234
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:32,182
- Your Majesty. - What are you doing?

235
00:19:33,282 --> 00:19:36,423
- Father. - Stop the bleeding this instant!

236
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:38,692
Se Yeob, what is happening?

237
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,532
A stiletto needle must not be used in his condition.

238
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:59,073
I knew your arrogance would cause trouble someday!

239
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,613
He is Head Acupuncturist Yoo Se Yeob.

240
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:15,923
Sinner Yoo Se Yeob will receive the royal command.

241
00:21:44,313 --> 00:21:47,252
It is the needle Physician Yoo used when treating His Majesty.

242
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:49,083
This custom-made needle...

243
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,653
would only change color if it came in contact with poison.

244
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:55,762
Someone had the audacity to slip my father poison?

245
00:21:56,063 --> 00:21:58,022
Who and how?

246
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:02,163
That is still a mystery, but I will bring you answers.

247
00:22:04,063 --> 00:22:06,173
- Not here, my lord. - Are you sure?

248
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:08,873
Did you find any suspicious medicinal herbs or food?

249
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:10,272
No, Commissioner Yoo.

250
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:12,212
Did you search the court ladies' rooms and belongings?

251
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:13,972
Nothing was out of the ordinary.

252
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:19,913
Please help me, Commissioner Yoo.

253
00:22:20,752 --> 00:22:23,123
Are you not a court maid of the Royal Kitchen?

254
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,492
The fear is eating me up from the inside.

255
00:22:28,893 --> 00:22:30,222
It seems as though...

256
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:33,932
I am the one responsible for His Majesty's...

257
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:39,432
I was not aware of what this was.

258
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:42,143
I was only told that it was a spice from Qing.

259
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:53,653
Could you please take a good look at it?

260
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:55,722
- I do not know what it is. - But...

261
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,093
Could you have seen it from somewhere?

262
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:01,692
I have never seen anything like this before.

263
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:03,063
Hold on.

264
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:07,762
Yoo Hoo Myung has been looking into the medicinal herb log.

265
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:24,883
Royal Physician Shin Gui Soo...

266
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:27,813
ordered all poisonous herbs to be gathered and burned.

267
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:31,752
This document must be delivered to the Crown Prince immediately.

268
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:49,232
Young Master Yoo.

269
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:56,502
Your father...

270
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:02,413
Your father...

271
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:09,722
It is about your father.

272
00:25:33,772 --> 00:25:36,913
No. It cannot be.

273
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:40,012
This cannot be true.

274
00:25:40,782 --> 00:25:42,722
It cannot be.

275
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:08,012
This cannot be.

276
00:26:08,012 --> 00:26:09,482
As you may have all heard,

277
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:12,653
Minister of Personnel Yoo Hoo Myung...

278
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:15,883
passed away after falling from his horse last night.

279
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:18,853
Another tragic event was met during the national mourning period.

280
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:22,022
However,

281
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:25,492
his death cannot wash away his sins.

282
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:28,492
Minister of Personnel Yoo Hoo Myung...

283
00:26:28,492 --> 00:26:29,663
will be punished as...

284
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:32,262
Commissioner of the Medical Office for the King's passing.

285
00:26:32,432 --> 00:26:35,742
Even though he has passed away, he will be stripped...

286
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,373
of his rank and status within the court.

287
00:26:39,673 --> 00:26:41,742
The land he was granted...

288
00:26:42,512 --> 00:26:44,012
will also be confiscated.

289
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:48,482
Meanwhile, his son Yoo Se Yeob...

290
00:27:02,962 --> 00:27:05,462
He may be responsible for the King's death,

291
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:08,103
but no physician has ever received...

292
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:11,442
capital punishment regarding this matter.

293
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:17,682
Head Acupuncturist Yoo Se Yeob of the Medical Office...

294
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:22,083
will be removed from office and will be ordered to never...

295
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:24,222
step foot in Hanyang again.

296
00:27:38,932 --> 00:27:42,073
His inaccurate treatment led to the preceding King's death.

297
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,542
He must pay with his life.

298
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:45,202
That he must!

299
00:27:45,502 --> 00:27:47,212
His Majesty purposely chose...

300
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:48,813
to punish Yoo Hoo Myung heavily...

301
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:50,212
in order to give Yoo Se Yeob a lighter sentence.

302
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:53,982
It was his first order and command as the leader of this country.

303
00:27:54,952 --> 00:27:56,252
Let us comply.

304
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,462
Se Yeob, you are to stay alive.

305
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:10,103
You are now the only one who can uncover the truth.

306
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:35,653
Lady Seo!

307
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:38,423
My gosh.

308
00:28:39,663 --> 00:28:41,992
Dan, a body that has been wiped down with vinegar water...

309
00:28:41,992 --> 00:28:43,762
should show traces of blood.

310
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,663
There are no traces of that though.

311
00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:48,073
Where do you think she was punctured?

312
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:49,103
Sorry?

313
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:51,242
How on earth would I know?

314
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:53,542
Besides, now is not the time for this.

315
00:28:53,643 --> 00:28:55,042
I reminded you numerous times...

316
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:56,413
that you were to be measured for your wedding dress.

317
00:28:57,113 --> 00:28:59,682
This means she cannot have been poisoned.

318
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:02,952
The chicken that also ate the same food...

319
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:04,923
must still be alive.

320
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:06,653
I should check on them next.

321
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:08,423
- You wait here. - What? No.

322
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:11,262
You cannot. The others are waiting for you.

323
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:12,563
- Come, Lady Seo. - But...

324
00:29:12,563 --> 00:29:13,893
(Autopsy Office)

325
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:15,962
- Come. This way. - Lady.

326
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:18,563
Did you sneak into...

327
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:20,272
the Autopsy Office to see the body?

328
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:23,042
The magistrate will be furious if he finds out.

329
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:25,702
Do not worry. I will make up an excuse to tell my father.

330
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,512
Even so, I am...

331
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:30,782
I will catch the culprit and let you take the credit.

332
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:31,883
Just wait.

333
00:29:41,252 --> 00:29:42,722
She is still young.

334
00:29:42,992 --> 00:29:45,663
I think they are rushing the wedding.

335
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:48,192
You will never find another match as good for her, my lady.

336
00:29:48,593 --> 00:29:52,333
Just look at how the cloth flows off her frame.

337
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:54,173
Just a few adjustments...

338
00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:58,373
Will you be careful?

339
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,313
Are you all right?

340
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:01,942
I apologize, my lady.

341
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:06,053
This is it!

342
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:09,153
Thank you so much. Are we done now?

343
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,752
- Wait. Eun Woo! - My lady.

344
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:14,893
- Where are you going? - My lady!

345
00:30:16,462 --> 00:30:19,462
Where did all the chickens go?

346
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:21,633
They were all here not long ago.

347
00:30:21,932 --> 00:30:23,133
Did a tiger take them?

348
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:26,073
I took a look at the Choi woman's body.

349
00:30:26,903 --> 00:30:27,903
And?

350
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:31,073
There were no signs she bled out.

351
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:33,113
So authorities think she was poisoned.

352
00:30:33,343 --> 00:30:35,512
I bet they locked up her maid who cooked her breakfast.

353
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:37,782
Release her immediately.

354
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:39,813
Immediately?

355
00:30:40,212 --> 00:30:42,682
I cannot do that until you find the killer.

356
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:51,522
The culprit stuck this needle in the crown of her head...

357
00:30:51,522 --> 00:30:52,522
and killed her.

358
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,633
That is why there was no blood.

359
00:30:54,992 --> 00:30:56,002
The real culprit...

360
00:30:59,603 --> 00:31:01,073
is the chicken thief.

361
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:05,643
Why would Choi's killer...

362
00:31:05,643 --> 00:31:07,512
steal the magistrate's chickens?

363
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:10,942
To make her death look like poisoning.

364
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:14,212
The real killer tried to frame the maid.

365
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:19,083
What happens if you put rice in the mouth...

366
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,192
of a body that has ingested poison?

367
00:31:20,192 --> 00:31:21,752
In that case,

368
00:31:21,752 --> 00:31:23,762
the poison would seep into the rice.

369
00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:25,962
And if you feed that rice to the chickens?

370
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:29,633
The ones that ate it would keel over and die.

371
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:32,432
But what if the chickens were fine?

372
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:40,472
They would realize...

373
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:43,012
she was killed some other way, not by poison.

374
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,012
That is why they stole the chickens.

375
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:48,083
She really is smart.

376
00:31:48,482 --> 00:31:51,752
Where will you find the real killer?

377
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:57,923
The killer will be hiding in a cave in the mountains.

378
00:32:01,063 --> 00:32:02,063

379
00:32:06,472 --> 00:32:07,472
Yes.

380
00:32:08,702 --> 00:32:11,942
My lady. What will you do?

381
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:14,313
It is dangerous to go alone.

382
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:26,893
I found you.

see any of my chickens?

Have you ever seen a tree break its own branch?

410

A tree does not break its own branches.

to break those close to them, and even themselves.

Do not break yourself.

00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:40,951
This rice cake...

496
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,790
nearly killed you, so I shall get rid of it for you.

497
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:47,860
Yes, sure thing! You can take it all.

498
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,431
- Thank you again. - What a relief.

499
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:52,201
- Have some water. - Yes, water!

500
00:43:52,201 --> 00:43:54,331
- Have some water first. - Who knew the rice cake would...

501
00:43:54,571 --> 00:43:56,071
With that hand,

502
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,101
you cannot work as a physician.

503
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:03,540
You need not be concerned for my hand is fine.

504
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,851
I was going to offer to fix it for you.

505
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,020
I am not interested in being treated by a drunkard.

506
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,721
Oh, dear. You are a dunce who cannot even administer acupuncture.

507
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,661
I suppose you are not desperate yet.

508
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:25,000
If you change your mind, come to the clinic by the gyesoo tree...

509
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,170
and find me.

510
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:27,920
Hey, wake up.

511
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:29,190
Hey!

512
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,090
You will save many, so stay alive, okay?

513
00:46:50,511 --> 00:46:51,610
Please.

514
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:53,310
Please...

515
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:18,440
Please, wake up.

516
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:19,701
Hey.

517
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,011
Wake up!

518
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:26,511
(Gyesoo Clinic)

519
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:30,110
How many types of pulses are there?

520
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:33,221
Twenty...

521
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:36,321
eight?

522
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:40,020
Correct. Bu, Chim, Ji, Sak.

523
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,590
Familiarize yourself with these four types,

524
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:44,831
and you can detect most ailments.

525
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:46,400
Here, try it.

526
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,940
So? You can feel my pulse, right?

527
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:59,681
Father, are you ill? I do not feel anything.

528
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:02,480
You silly goose! How could I have no pulse when I am not dead?

529
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:06,081
Do not grab my wrist like that. Gently place your fingers over it.

530
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:08,621
Oh! You are alive, Father.

531
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:11,121
Goodness. This is awfully frustrating.

532
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:12,960
I keep getting more patients,

533
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,891
but no one can help me.

534
00:48:15,491 --> 00:48:16,491
Is there a physician here?

535
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,560
I request your expertise.

536
00:48:20,971 --> 00:48:22,071
You...

537
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,840
Aren't you the dunce from the marketplace earlier?

538
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,141
I found her drowning.

539
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:27,871
She is breathing again, but her pulse is weak.

540
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,310
In here.

541
00:48:35,951 --> 00:48:37,051
Pressure must be applied...

542
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,920
to the indang, sakwan, and the tips of the fingers.

543
00:48:39,781 --> 00:48:41,250
Shut it and let me work.

544
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,400
Where did you find such a sweet young lady?

545
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,040
Change her clothes...

546
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,641
and massage her limbs for adequate blood flow.

547
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,440
Gosh.

548
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,911
Come on.

549
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,610
Or would you rather stay and watch her be stripped?

550
00:49:17,391 --> 00:49:18,960
Now that she is out of the woods,

551
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,460
a bowl of herbal tonic will...

552
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,130
Hey, you.

553
00:49:23,701 --> 00:49:25,201
You dunce, stop right there!

554
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,571
Why are you slithering away like you are doing a moonlight flit?

555
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,670
She came back from the brink of death.

556
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:34,770
Please take good care of her.

557
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,940
I asked where you were headed,

558
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,781
and you gave me crap.

559
00:49:39,511 --> 00:49:40,511
What?

560
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,051
- Crap? - Young Master Yoo...

561
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:45,781
is not someone you can mistreat.

562
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:48,150
Who exactly is this young master of yours?

563
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,661
Young Master Yoo...

564
00:49:51,261 --> 00:49:53,190
passed the Exam for Liberal Arts...

565
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,931
as well as the Medical Exam in first place.

566
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,130
Minister of Personnel Lord Yoo Hoo Myung's son!

567
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:01,971
He was so successful in the Medical Office,

568
00:50:01,971 --> 00:50:04,670
His Majesty the King himself called him Divine Needle.

569
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,270
That is who he is.

570
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:13,540
I see. A physician of the Medical Office.

571
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:16,181
Now I get it.

572
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,650
Rather than being skilled acupuncturists,

573
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,181
the physicians there...

574
00:50:20,181 --> 00:50:22,690
are known to be gifted flatterers.

575
00:50:24,761 --> 00:50:27,360
You must be the way you are...

576
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,690
due to the lousy mentors you had.

577
00:50:28,891 --> 00:50:30,801
No wonder you could not contain your shivering hand...

578
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:31,801
while holding the needle.

579
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,971
Jang Gun.

580
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,230
Yes?

581
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,241
Jang Gun is right here.

582
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,770
And I have been brewing the tonic.

583
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,110
Bring over Chil Sung from the house with the persimmon tree.

584
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:44,610
He should take them away.

585
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,940
Sure.

586
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,051
Jang Gun.

587
00:50:48,511 --> 00:50:50,380
Who exactly is Chil Sung?

588
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:51,750
He's a soldier of the government office.

589
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,980
Let me see.

590
00:50:53,281 --> 00:50:56,520
The herbal tonic, acupuncture, and the change of clothes.

591
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,321
That is at least ten nyang.

592
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:00,491
Either pay ten nyang or answer to the magistrate.

593
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,491
Are you charging me the bill...

594
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,630
when I saved a drowning woman?

595
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,661
Who else can I charge? Myself?

596
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:08,971
If you do not want to answer to the magistrate,

597
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,701
you will stay until she comes to.

598
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,551
Your world lies only within this circle.

599
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:21,581
You heard him.

600
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,880
You are standing in the palm of my hand.

601
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,020
Step out of that circle...

602
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:29,391
and your world will come crumbling down.

603
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:45,701
Why you...

604
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:47,940
Alcohol will kill you, darn it.

605
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,710
Come on, Ji Han.

606
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,241
I barely took a sip just now.

607
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:53,980
Who are you trying to kid?

608
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,011
Anyway, they will be staying with you for the night.

609
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,790
We apologize for inconveniencing you.

610
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:05,391
That is quite all right. I welcome you more than anything.

611
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:11,331
Here. Let us drink.

612
00:52:13,261 --> 00:52:14,571
Never suggest that.

613
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:16,971
Alcohol brings out a different person in him,

614
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:18,801
so do not offer him any.

615
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,471
I see you live a boring life.

616
00:52:23,471 --> 00:52:26,581
Master Yoo, it has been too long since we slept under soft covers.

617
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,480
How nice.

618
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,681
Are these the feathers of a phoenix?

619
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:36,451
Lie down and see for yourself.

620
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:43,290
Gosh, is that really necessary?

621
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,380
Get out here.

622
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,451
Get out here already!

623
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:10,020
Yes, I am coming!

624
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,500
I see that you did not have any nightmares last night.

625
00:53:19,031 --> 00:53:20,871
Maybe the energy here is pure.

626
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,670
Anyway, rise and shine.

627
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,971
Physician Gye is calling for us.

628
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:28,770
Master Yoo.

629
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,650
Goodness.

630
00:53:38,221 --> 00:53:39,821
She actually ran off.

631
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:44,860
You saved her life...

632
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,261
and she thanked you by leaving without paying.

633
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,860
This is exactly why I had you stay behind.

634
00:53:52,431 --> 00:53:55,500
Chil Sung, how is your mother's back?

635
00:53:55,871 --> 00:53:58,301
She can make it to the marketplace when it is not raining.

636
00:53:58,571 --> 00:53:59,940
Bring her in sometime.

637
00:54:00,201 --> 00:54:01,641
I will stop it from ever raining...

638
00:54:01,641 --> 00:54:03,710
or fix your mother's back forever.

639
00:54:04,011 --> 00:54:05,340
Thank you, Physician Gye.

640
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:11,281
All right. Now, let us punch some numbers.

641
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,420
Acupuncture is three nyang, herbal tonic is five nyang,

642
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,560
and the clothes are two nyang.

643
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,060
Are you still going on about the bill?

644
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,290
One must always be strict when it comes to payments.

645
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:25,560
Adding a day's worth of interest...

646
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,761
That is enough.

647
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:28,730
A physician who saves lives...

648
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,670
should not be money-mad.

649
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:32,741
What nonsense are you spewing?

650
00:54:33,141 --> 00:54:35,571
I have seen my fair share of incompetent physicians,

651
00:54:35,571 --> 00:54:38,480
but none of them were heavy drinkers,

652
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,851
money-mad, or foul-mouthed like yourself.

653
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,920
You should know that I am known to be mediocre in this village.

654
00:54:52,661 --> 00:54:53,661
However,

655
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,891
it seems to me that you are broke.

656
00:54:57,431 --> 00:55:00,400
Lucky for you, the clinic is short-staffed...

657
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,031
considering the number of patients we have.

658
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:05,670
That is why I will make a generous offer.

659
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:08,471
To pay for the 10 nyang plus the 1 nyang for the night's stay,

660
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,940
you will see patients here for 11 days.

661
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,081
Refuse to do so...

662
00:55:12,081 --> 00:55:14,310
and you will be punished accordingly by the government office.

663
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,310
What do you say?

664
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,920
How generous is that?

665
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,020
Now, sign the contract.

666
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,060
As if I would agree to it.

667
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,960
Well, the alternative...

668
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:33,031
You being a physician...

669
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:35,431
is why I went out of my way to offer you this deal.

670
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:38,241
And I told you that she was a complete stranger.

671
00:55:40,701 --> 00:55:41,971
You may say that,

672
00:55:42,471 --> 00:55:43,911
but she could also be the woman...

673
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:45,641
you were running away with.

674
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:47,310
The water brought out your silhouette...

675
00:55:48,281 --> 00:55:50,610
and she ran away from you disappointed.

676
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,551
What? How dare you!

677
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:58,261
Master Yoo, please.

678
00:55:58,261 --> 00:56:00,690
Goodness, I am terrified.

679
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,690
A joke or two has him disrespecting his elder.

680
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:06,130
Fine. Hit me if you must. You will only have to pay me more.

681
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,071
- Hit me. - Gosh.

682
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:11,071
- My goodness, no. - Hit me already!

683
00:56:13,301 --> 00:56:15,371
Master Yoo, considering the punishment you received,

684
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,270
it would be unwise to be summoned before a government office.

685
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:18,641
Please sign the contract.

686
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:20,710
I will not agree to an unfair deal.

687
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,110
Not paying for lodging and then an act of fraud.

688
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:26,480
Those are grounds for immediate arrest.

689
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:31,190
I will get us the ten nyang in any way possible by tomorrow,

690
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,790
so please sign the contract for now.

691
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:35,331
Seriously?

692
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,261
Can you not listen to me for this one day?

693
00:56:41,571 --> 00:56:44,101
We have been living the way you chose for us...

694
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,301
for the past year.

695
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:48,471
Are you saying we should throw it all away?

696
00:56:57,451 --> 00:56:59,221
Stop fighting it. You will only hurt yourself.

697
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,301
We have a deal, do we not?

698
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,900
Ip Bun, prepare to make rounds.

699
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:23,310
Patients do not come in the morning since they are busy farming.

700
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,411
Your first patient today will be him.

701
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,310
He's a tightrope walker who suffers from dizziness.

702
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:29,310
Treat his condition,

703
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:31,681
but do not give him any alcohol.

704
00:57:44,146 --> 00:57:46,117
Father. Do you know those men?

705
00:57:46,617 --> 00:57:48,757
How do you know a man from the Medical Office?

706
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:53,527
Minister of Personnel Lord Yoo Hoo Myung's son!

707
00:57:53,527 --> 00:57:55,867
He was so successful in the Medical Office,

708
00:57:55,867 --> 00:57:58,637
His Majesty the King himself called him Divine Needle.

709
00:57:58,996 --> 00:58:00,467
That is who he is.

710
00:58:02,706 --> 00:58:05,407
Say something. Do you know those men?

711
00:58:06,737 --> 00:58:07,876
I do.

712
00:58:08,206 --> 00:58:10,677
I opened up so many bodies during the war.

713
00:58:10,876 --> 00:58:12,447
I can see right into a man.

714
00:58:12,617 --> 00:58:15,047
That is not what I am asking.

715
00:58:15,246 --> 00:58:17,246
You do not know them, do you?

716
00:58:17,387 --> 00:58:20,586
Did you leave your clinic in the hands of complete strangers?

717
00:58:20,916 --> 00:58:24,726
He needs a shoulder to cry on, so he will not do anything rash.

718
00:58:26,726 --> 00:58:28,896
You talk like you do know something.

719
00:58:33,967 --> 00:58:36,606
I brought a female physician to check your pulse.

720
00:58:36,606 --> 00:58:38,476
You can relax.

721
00:58:38,476 --> 00:58:39,476
A female physician?

722
00:58:42,277 --> 00:58:43,606
May I have your wrist?

723
00:58:57,827 --> 00:58:59,327
Bu, Chim, Ji, Sak.

724
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:02,367
You just had to find one of them and you could not?

725
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:04,637
I really did not feel any of those four!

726
00:59:04,797 --> 00:59:06,237
That lady must be crazy.

727
00:59:06,237 --> 00:59:08,536
Her pulse was dancing all over the place.

728
00:59:08,536 --> 00:59:10,206
Why would a pulse dance?

729
00:59:11,077 --> 00:59:12,336
Darn it all!

730
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:17,177
I was too afraid...

731
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,047
to walk into the water.

732
00:59:22,947 --> 00:59:24,286
She...

733
00:59:25,286 --> 00:59:27,757
walked right into the stream...

734
00:59:28,657 --> 00:59:30,586
without one bit of hesitation.

735
00:59:31,556 --> 00:59:33,856
She told me to live.

736
00:59:35,396 --> 00:59:36,927
I am alive,

737
00:59:38,536 --> 00:59:40,197
but it feels like death is...

738
00:59:48,177 --> 00:59:51,717
You gave a patient alcohol? And you call yourself a physician?

739
00:59:53,277 --> 00:59:54,586
I am no longer...

740
00:59:56,447 --> 00:59:57,956
a physician.

741
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:01,157
You are not a physician?

742
01:00:01,157 --> 01:00:03,487
Are you fooling around to avoid paying your dues?

743
01:00:04,697 --> 01:00:06,626
You are talking about money again.

744
01:00:12,737 --> 01:00:14,067
I was...

745
01:00:15,536 --> 01:00:18,336
once praised as the Divine Needle!

746
01:00:19,936 --> 01:00:21,007
But now...

747
01:00:22,277 --> 01:00:24,146
I cannot practice acupuncture.

748
01:00:26,217 --> 01:00:28,817
I am no longer a physician!

749
01:00:29,217 --> 01:00:32,556
Yes! You are upset you can no longer practice acupuncture.

750
01:00:32,556 --> 01:00:33,686
Is that why...

751
01:00:34,016 --> 01:00:36,586
you gave him alcohol and put him in this state?

752
01:00:36,856 --> 01:00:40,927
That shows you do not have the right mindset for a physician!

753
01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:44,766
You did not see him as a patient!

754
01:01:05,257 --> 01:01:06,617
Whatever you wish to be,

755
01:01:07,717 --> 01:01:09,427
you have much learning to do.

756
01:01:14,867 --> 01:01:17,697
Fine. You can challenge me too. I will take you on.

757
01:01:18,697 --> 01:01:19,867
He is not like this...

758
01:01:20,996 --> 01:01:22,237
when he is sober.

759
01:01:23,036 --> 01:01:25,306
Just one shot is enough to knock him out.

760
01:01:59,036 --> 01:02:00,237
Water.

761
01:02:07,177 --> 01:02:08,447
Sir.

762
01:02:09,416 --> 01:02:11,016
Am I dying?

763
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:15,157
You will not die. Not now at least.

764
01:02:16,527 --> 01:02:18,257
Thank you.

765
01:02:19,056 --> 01:02:21,327
Thank you so much, sir.

766
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:24,396
Do not drink anymore.

767
01:02:25,797 --> 01:02:27,097
Sir.

768
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:31,376
I must...

769
01:02:32,777 --> 01:02:35,476
walk the tightrope.

770
01:02:37,277 --> 01:02:40,646
If I cannot, I do not feel as if I am living.

771
01:02:42,686 --> 01:02:45,556
Because I did not feel like living,

772
01:02:45,556 --> 01:02:47,456
I drank so I could feel high.

773
01:02:49,157 --> 01:02:51,726
And now I cannot go a day without alcohol.

774
01:02:57,726 --> 01:02:58,967
You are so cool.

775
01:02:59,097 --> 01:03:01,436
That was not worth clapping for.

776
01:03:01,967 --> 01:03:03,867
- What number is this? - Number four.

777
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:05,936
Just four? Here goes.

778
01:03:18,657 --> 01:03:19,786
Sit.

779
01:03:35,836 --> 01:03:37,766
Watch what you eat.

780
01:03:42,407 --> 01:03:44,847
I will treat the man who suffers from dizziness.

781
01:03:45,246 --> 01:03:47,677
But I will leave as soon as he is cured,

782
01:03:47,677 --> 01:03:49,186
so tear up our contract.

783
01:03:49,786 --> 01:03:52,117
It is your obvious duty to cure a patient.

784
01:03:52,387 --> 01:03:55,387
To annul the contract, you must offer something else.

785
01:03:55,927 --> 01:03:57,527
What else must I offer?

786
01:03:59,257 --> 01:04:01,827
Make him walk the tightrope again.

787
01:04:03,396 --> 01:04:05,036
If not, stay ten more days.

788
01:04:13,637 --> 01:04:15,277
Three months or so ago,

789
01:04:15,847 --> 01:04:18,217
I fell from the tightrope.

790
01:04:18,617 --> 01:04:21,317
Since then, I cannot go back up unless I have a drink.

791
01:04:29,226 --> 01:04:30,987
The medicine expunged the alcohol,

792
01:04:30,987 --> 01:04:33,157
so now I will treat the dizziness.

793
01:04:33,827 --> 01:04:35,927
There are six kinds of dizziness,

794
01:04:35,927 --> 01:04:39,266
but your symptoms do not fit any one of those six exactly.

795
01:04:39,367 --> 01:04:41,266
So I will treat the one in which you show...

796
01:04:41,266 --> 01:04:43,106
the most marked symptoms.

797
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:49,277
Daechu.

798
01:04:50,246 --> 01:04:51,376
Joksamri.

799
01:04:52,777 --> 01:04:54,887
And acupuncture on points Taebek and Taean.

800
01:04:59,257 --> 01:05:01,887
Gosh. I feel so calm and relaxed,

801
01:05:01,887 --> 01:05:03,856
and my body is squirming.

802
01:05:05,456 --> 01:05:07,956
I feel like I can walk a tightrope right now.

803
01:05:10,367 --> 01:05:12,436
You will slowly recover.

804
01:05:12,766 --> 01:05:14,197
Thinking of the tightrope...

805
01:05:15,367 --> 01:05:18,206
makes my lungs puff up.

806
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:20,737
When I am on the rope,

807
01:05:21,777 --> 01:05:23,476
everyone else is beneath me.

808
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:27,376
I do not envy any noble lord or minister.

809
01:05:44,797 --> 01:05:47,436
Ji Han!

810
01:05:47,797 --> 01:05:49,266
Look at me now!

811
01:05:49,706 --> 01:05:51,536
Will you come on out?

812
01:05:53,106 --> 01:05:55,947
Watch me now, after I got treated last night!

813
01:05:57,347 --> 01:05:59,016
See what I can do?

814
01:06:10,456 --> 01:06:13,757
I must test myself. I will get up on a rope now.

815
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:18,836
Would you like to come watch? I will put on a great show for you.

816
01:06:24,637 --> 01:06:25,706
Wait for me.

817
01:06:26,706 --> 01:06:28,677
If he succeeds, I leave.

818
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,646
Get the contract ready.

819
01:06:43,226 --> 01:06:44,627
Goodness.

820
01:06:47,426 --> 01:06:49,697
Do you feel dizzy. Do not push yourself.

821
01:06:50,926 --> 01:06:52,096
I am fine.

822
01:06:52,567 --> 01:06:54,396
You are not. Come down.

823
01:06:54,396 --> 01:06:55,707
No!

824
01:06:56,567 --> 01:07:00,337
If I go down now, I might never come back up again.

825
01:07:27,697 --> 01:07:29,266
- Hey! - Are you okay?

826
01:07:32,777 --> 01:07:33,877
I am doomed.

827
01:07:34,806 --> 01:07:36,046
I am doomed now.

828
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:38,917
The treatment has only just begun.

829
01:07:39,117 --> 01:07:40,117
No.

830
01:07:40,917 --> 01:07:43,317
I know that something...

831
01:07:44,146 --> 01:07:45,856
has gone very wrong.

832
01:07:46,317 --> 01:07:47,487
Nothing has gone wrong.

833
01:07:47,686 --> 01:07:50,056
Without acupuncture, your recovery will be slow.

834
01:07:51,087 --> 01:07:52,096
What?

835
01:07:53,256 --> 01:07:54,457
You did not administer acupuncture?

836
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:57,426
Then how are you treating him?

837
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:00,367
I told you.

838
01:08:01,296 --> 01:08:02,567
I cannot administer acupuncture.

839
01:08:03,966 --> 01:08:06,476
You are a swindler, not a dunce.

840
01:08:07,037 --> 01:08:08,447
I bet you are not even a physician.

841
01:08:08,747 --> 01:08:10,546
My young master is a talented physician.

842
01:08:10,546 --> 01:08:12,877
People used to call him the Divine Needle.

843
01:08:12,877 --> 01:08:15,516
This is only a temporary thing as he is still recovering...

844
01:08:15,516 --> 01:08:17,487
from emotional shock.

845
01:08:17,716 --> 01:08:19,056
Then try and administer acupuncture.

846
01:08:19,457 --> 01:08:20,716
Let me see...

847
01:08:20,716 --> 01:08:22,487
if this is a temporary or a permanent thing.

848
01:08:26,627 --> 01:08:29,197
Why? Do you carry that needle box around...

849
01:08:29,197 --> 01:08:31,327
to swindle people?

850
01:08:48,886 --> 01:08:51,087
If I got to walk the tightrope just once more,

851
01:08:51,247 --> 01:08:53,686
I would not be this sad now.

852
01:08:55,226 --> 01:08:57,886
Had I known that was the last time...

853
01:08:59,226 --> 01:09:01,296
I would have stayed on the rope longer.

854
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:03,567
Why?

855
01:09:04,567 --> 01:09:07,167
Do you feel like it is all your fault?

856
01:09:07,796 --> 01:09:09,266
Or do you pity yourself more?

857
01:09:11,907 --> 01:09:14,377
His condition is not that hard to treat.

858
01:09:15,077 --> 01:09:17,846
However, he has a bigger problem.

859
01:09:18,476 --> 01:09:20,716
His obsession with tightrope walking.

860
01:09:20,947 --> 01:09:22,046
That obsession...

861
01:09:23,287 --> 01:09:25,157
has caused him to be sick at heart.

862
01:09:29,686 --> 01:09:30,726
If I cannot walk the tightrope,

863
01:09:31,256 --> 01:09:32,896
I would rather be dead.

864
01:09:33,027 --> 01:09:34,027
I am no longer...

865
01:09:35,726 --> 01:09:37,067
a physician.

866
01:09:37,497 --> 01:09:38,497
Please...

867
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:39,667
Please.

868
01:10:24,377 --> 01:10:25,377
Try...

869
01:10:26,646 --> 01:10:27,646
walking the tightrope.

870
01:10:28,587 --> 01:10:29,587
Sorry?

871
01:10:29,817 --> 01:10:32,516
Close your eyes and get on the rope.

872
01:10:33,856 --> 01:10:35,327
You know it like the palm of your hand,

873
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:37,356
so you can do it with your eyes closed.

874
01:10:39,796 --> 01:10:40,827
Do not cry.

875
01:10:42,466 --> 01:10:44,627
You said you wanted to do it one last time.

876
01:10:45,337 --> 01:10:46,867
So I would like to grant your wish.

877
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:50,207
But it is on the ground.

878
01:10:50,466 --> 01:10:52,136
Who says you must do it in the air?

879
01:10:53,037 --> 01:10:55,277
Who says the rope must be held above our heads?

880
01:11:22,207 --> 01:11:23,207
We need music.

881
01:11:24,506 --> 01:11:25,506
Bring on the music.

882
01:11:26,306 --> 01:11:28,907
Okay, here we go!

883
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:41,457
When I am on the rope,

884
01:11:42,527 --> 01:11:44,287
everything is beneath my feet.

885
01:11:46,226 --> 01:11:47,296
I become the King...

886
01:11:49,027 --> 01:11:50,327
and the sky.

887
01:11:54,896 --> 01:11:55,907
When I am on the rope,

888
01:11:58,337 --> 01:12:00,006
it all becomes my world.

889
01:12:13,987 --> 01:12:17,527
Goodness gracious. Look at those silly clowns.

890
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,407
Is that what they taught you in the Medical Office?

891
01:12:39,617 --> 01:12:42,087
How to lure others with your sly words.

892
01:12:43,487 --> 01:12:44,487
Well...

893
01:12:45,046 --> 01:12:48,487
He is now torn between the janggu and kkwaenggwari.

894
01:12:48,856 --> 01:12:51,056
He can play musical instruments instead of tightrope walking,

895
01:12:51,256 --> 01:12:53,627
so he can earn a living and support himself.

896
01:12:55,867 --> 01:12:57,766
So you cannot work as an acupuncturist anymore.

897
01:12:57,766 --> 01:12:59,067
Are you that embarrassed of it?

898
01:13:01,367 --> 01:13:02,966
Now that he has figured out a way to earn a living,

899
01:13:03,766 --> 01:13:05,436
I shall leave to do the same.

900
01:13:06,407 --> 01:13:08,707
You can use moxibustion if you cannot administer acupuncture.

901
01:13:08,777 --> 01:13:10,777
If you cannot do that, you can use herbal decoctions.

902
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:11,917
If you cannot even do that,

903
01:13:12,247 --> 01:13:15,146
use that sly tongue of yours as you did with him.

904
01:13:15,787 --> 01:13:18,216
Running away will not solve anything, you dunce.

905
01:13:19,987 --> 01:13:21,926
If you are struggling, scream for help.

906
01:13:21,926 --> 01:13:23,457
Try waving your arms too.

907
01:13:23,726 --> 01:13:24,726
Give in...

908
01:13:25,327 --> 01:13:28,127
and follow this drunkard's advice for you have nothing to lose.

909
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:31,167
Then you will live,

910
01:13:31,697 --> 01:13:32,697
just like that tightrope walker.

911
01:13:39,106 --> 01:13:41,337
You do not seem to be following. You sure are a dunce.

912
01:13:41,436 --> 01:13:42,447
In any case,

913
01:13:42,777 --> 01:13:44,346
he could not actually walk the tightrope,

914
01:13:44,346 --> 01:13:47,546
you must keep your word and work here for 20 days.

915
01:14:13,037 --> 01:14:14,037
Do you not want to eat?

916
01:14:14,337 --> 01:14:16,006
There is an egg, for a change.

917
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:18,676
Must I do house calls too?

918
01:14:19,176 --> 01:14:21,146
I believe it was not part of our agreement.

919
01:14:21,886 --> 01:14:24,716
I did not say you would not be doing house calls.

920
01:14:28,987 --> 01:14:29,987
This is nice.

921
01:14:35,926 --> 01:14:36,926
Your energy is stagnant.

922
01:14:37,197 --> 01:14:39,136
Have you been worried about something?

923
01:14:39,837 --> 01:14:41,567
How did you know?

924
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:43,667
Your muscles tensed up because of the energy blockage.

925
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:46,237
That is why you are having a difficult time swallowing.

926
01:14:46,707 --> 01:14:48,306
A herbal remedy would be helpful.

927
01:14:48,306 --> 01:14:51,976
That old physician over there will take care of it for you.

928
01:14:53,146 --> 01:14:54,617
Yes, ma'am.

929
01:14:54,976 --> 01:14:56,846
I will prepare a herbal decoction for you.

930
01:15:02,157 --> 01:15:03,856
I have done my job, so I am leaving.

931
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:16,266
Please help my young lady. Hurry.

932
01:15:16,567 --> 01:15:18,466
- But I am... - Please, hurry!

933
01:15:20,237 --> 01:15:21,237
Over there.

934
01:15:21,676 --> 01:15:22,676
Please hurry.

935
01:16:10,827 --> 01:16:11,987
The physician from Hanyang...

936
01:16:11,987 --> 01:16:13,997
is sure different.

937
01:16:14,226 --> 01:16:16,266
Just seeing his face will heal you of all your diseases.

938
01:16:17,426 --> 01:16:18,497
Someone is dying!

939
01:16:18,766 --> 01:16:21,197
Mind your own business.

940
01:16:21,436 --> 01:16:23,306
- You are hurting here. - Let go!

941
01:16:23,806 --> 01:16:25,106
- Oh, dear. - Stop!

942
01:16:25,976 --> 01:16:27,407
You killed your husband.

943
01:16:27,407 --> 01:16:29,707
It is your fault that my son died!

944
01:16:29,707 --> 01:16:31,707
When patients come, just hear them out.

945
01:16:31,707 --> 01:16:33,617
Nod along when they vent their anger.

946
01:16:34,216 --> 01:16:36,417
Why did you come here to save me?

947
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:38,186
Please allow me the chance to save you.

948
01:16:38,186 --> 01:16:39,817
I will find a way...

949
01:16:40,016 --> 01:16:41,317
to save you.
