00:00:32,757 --> 00:00:35,096
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:39,997
No, wait!

4
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:44,837
I am sorry. I did wrong.

5
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:49,207
But I did it because the Second State Councillor told me to.

6
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:53,247
I had no choice. That is the truth.

7
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:56,877
It is time...

8
00:00:57,747 --> 00:00:59,987
to reveal the truth clearly.

9
00:01:01,216 --> 00:01:03,457
What command you were given,

10
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:07,427
and what evil you did to bribe the Second State Councillor!

11
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:10,396
Yes. Of course.

12
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:12,766
I will tell you everything.

13
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:14,537
Will you...

14
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:19,137
help me get out of this alive?

15
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:21,737
Yoo Se Poong.

16
00:01:22,636 --> 00:01:25,306
No. Yoo Se Yeob, sir.

17
00:01:36,657 --> 00:01:39,927
What the Second State Councillor made me do and took,

18
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:42,556
I will tell you everything.

19
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:45,067
Believe me.

20
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:48,567
I, Im Soon Man,

21
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:52,106
will expose the Second State Councillor’s corruption!

22
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:11,586
That way. Go and search!

23
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:12,687
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

24
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:22,567
Listen, Se Poong.

25
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:24,606
Here.

26
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:27,407
Do not speak. I must stop the bleeding.

27
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:30,807
Here, take this.

28
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:35,976
My field of gold.

29
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:44,687
You cannot take it.

30
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:50,326
All this... is mine.

31
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:57,256
The Second State Councillor...

32
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,636
gave dansacho to the former king.

33
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,696
What will you do now?

34
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:06,266
Commander Im...

35
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:09,136
would have recorded what he gave the Second State Councillor.

36
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:11,407
I must find that ledger.

37
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:12,907
That ledger.

38
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:17,176
I found it.

39
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:21,256
Here.

40
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:27,897
From sable skins...

41
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:30,326
to produce meant for the King, he gave as a bribe.

42
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,527
What does this mark mean?

43
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,097
After he stopped giving sable skins and produce,

44
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:39,037
a massive amount of money and gold changed hands.

45
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:41,676
That must be the money made from selling opium.

46
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:45,147
He gave him gold bars to coincide with each harvest.

47
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,176
With the stiletto needle and this, we can take him down.

48
00:04:58,186 --> 00:05:00,257
While I get things going in the Palace,

49
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:02,697
I need you to look into the damage caused by opium.

50
00:05:02,926 --> 00:05:04,296
Okay, I will do that.

51
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,736
Young master, be sure to eat on time.

52
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:11,507
- I will be back soon. - Okay.

53
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:13,306
We should go.

54
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:20,647
No. You should remain here...

55
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:23,246
We must go. Is this not a pressing matter?

56
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:30,686
Have a safe trip. Go on.

57
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:35,056
Was she going too?

58
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:36,926
I have no idea.

59
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,407
I feel bad you have to be my hands.

60
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:50,376
Now I am putting you in danger.

61
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:55,316
I promised I would not let you leave alone.

62
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,257
We have come this far together, and I will stay until the end.

63
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:07,186
Yes. This is really the end.

64
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:12,527
I will bring the Second State Councillor to his knees.

65
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,637
(Episode 12)

66
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:45,267
That ledger shows...

67
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,597
how the Second State Councillor bled the people dry,

68
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:50,337
and that stiletto needle was used on the former king.

69
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:57,407
Are you saying...

70
00:06:58,407 --> 00:07:00,916
this is enough to have him locked up immediately?

71
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:02,847
It is not yet time, Your Majesty.

72
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:05,116
Wait until he falters...

73
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:08,116
and causes himself to crumble.

74
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:10,986
When that time comes,

75
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,957
that is when you charge him for murdering the former king.

76
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:18,897
But the court...

77
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:22,097
is full of his people.

78
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:24,366
Even if we find more proof,

79
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:27,137
he will cut his losses and get out unscathed.

80
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,207
How about you burn his tail...

81
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:32,347
so he cannot cut it off and escape?

82
00:07:36,676 --> 00:07:39,517
Set fire to his tail?

83
00:07:47,157 --> 00:07:50,496
Here, on the date where it says the former king's boils went red...

84
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,126
and formed blisters,

85
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:53,967
write down what he ate.

86
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:54,967
Okay.

87
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:00,936
(February 9)

88
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:04,037
For a late-night snack, he was served candied red ginseng.

89
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:08,816
(February 9, candied red ginseng)

90
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:11,787
The next day, red bean porridge.

91
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:15,587
(February 10, red bean porridge)

92
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:21,527
Physician Gye must have arrived safely, right?

93
00:08:23,356 --> 00:08:25,267
His Majesty's royal guard went with him,

94
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,097
so they must have arrived by now.

95
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:29,967
I am sure...

96
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:32,007
everything will go well.

97
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:37,976
You said bad things came from what you were never worried about.

98
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:41,616
I trust that you will untangle the mess.

99
00:09:03,997 --> 00:09:05,007
If...

100
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:07,137
something happens...

101
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:12,607
I will be fine.

102
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:26,127
Long time no see, Shin Gui Soo.

103
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:39,936
I did not know that you were still alive.

104
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:41,907
Of course, you did not know.

105
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:44,907
You killed everyone.

106
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:49,877
You must want to get rid of me now.

107
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:52,046
You know that, yet you dared to show up before me?

108
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:54,686
I am here to give you a chance.

109
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:01,027
You should kneel before me and beg me to spare you, if anything.

110
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:02,027
What? A chance?

111
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:06,296
You will give me a chance? How dare you!

112
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:08,796
Did you think you could live...

113
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:13,737
as if nothing happened when you poisoned a king?

114
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:17,377
Such insolence!

115
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:21,346
That is a groundless accusation.

116
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,076
The stiletto needle used that day.

117
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:26,647
His Majesty has it.

118
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:30,617
What did you say?

119
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:32,627
Why?

120
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:34,086
Do you not believe me?

121
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,456
The Second State Councillor ordered you...

122
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:39,727
to murder the late King.

123
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,537
Everyone already knows all about it.

124
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:44,507
You killed your teacher and your friend...

125
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:45,836
and joined hands with the Second State Councillor.

126
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:48,237
How could a physician...

127
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:51,277
harm someone using poisonous herbs? Do you not care...

128
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:54,676
as long as you get the royal physician title?

129
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:59,346
Who is my friend? And who is my teacher?

130
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,887
All Jeon Kyu Hyung did was coddle hypocrites like you.

131
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:03,617
I do not consider him my teacher!

132
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:04,987
Our teacher...

133
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,027
cherished your skills...

134
00:11:10,997 --> 00:11:12,066
as a physician.

135
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:21,936
His Majesty promised...

136
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:24,377
that he would spare your family...

137
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:27,076
if you confessed.

138
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:33,586
You must save your innocent children for they did nothing wrong.

139
00:11:37,257 --> 00:11:38,826
This is your last chance to atone for your sins.

140
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:40,956
Think wisely.

141
00:11:51,737 --> 00:11:52,936
You could not find the stiletto needle?

142
00:11:55,836 --> 00:11:57,176
It must have burned...

143
00:11:57,436 --> 00:11:59,507
and melted in the fire when Im Soon Man died.

144
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:01,946
Then what about Yoo Se Yeob?

145
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:04,017
While I was taking care of Im Soon Man,

146
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,446
he disappeared.

147
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:09,316
You fool.

148
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:12,086
You asked for a chance.

149
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:14,926
I will not repeat myself.

150
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:17,257
The stiletto needle and Yoo Se Yeob.

151
00:12:17,926 --> 00:12:20,066
Neither can be allowed to exist.

152
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,367
Understood.

153
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:25,867
I will do that.

154
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:29,336
Physician Yoo was right.

155
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:31,806
Shin Gui Soo is faltering.

156
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:34,346
What now?

157
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:36,617
If what I am thinking is right,

158
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:40,647
Shin Gui Soo will go straight to the Second State Councillor.

159
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,416
Where is the Second State Councillor?

160
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:50,556
As soon as he gets there, the palace guards on site...

161
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:53,767
will arrest him in front of the Second State Councillor.

162
00:12:56,397 --> 00:12:57,796
Royal Inspector Cho Sin Woo...

163
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:00,706
must be arrested with him.

164
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:04,676
What is this ruckus?

165
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:10,546
How dare you.

166
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:12,887
This is the Second State Councillor’s residence!

167
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:15,887
Obey the King's command!

168
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:20,127
Tie up Shin Gui Soo and Royal Inspector Cho Sin Woo!

169
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:21,497
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

170
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:27,466
- Let go! - Councillor Cho!

171
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:31,566
Did you say...

172
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:33,466
it was the King's command?

173
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:35,007
Yes.

174
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:44,946
Fine.

175
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:48,086
Go ahead and obey the King's command.

176
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,416
Councillor Cho!

177
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:52,157
This is His Majesty's chance to learn...

178
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,727
what could happen...

179
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:57,556
when he wrongfully imprisons someone without evidence.

180
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:03,637
Do not worry.

181
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,836
He cannot punish his loyal subjects who did nothing wrong at all.

182
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:11,576
Do not be afraid.

183
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:13,407
Take them!

184
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:14,846
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

185
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:31,326
I have secured...

186
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:34,997
countless pieces of evidence and witnesses.

187
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:37,637
As the royal physician,

188
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:41,507
how dare you poison the late King?

189
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:46,507
Your Majesty, there are many eyes watching me in the Palace.

190
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:49,946
They record every single thing I do,

191
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:51,787
and there are court maids who work as royal tasters.

192
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:54,017
How could you believe such false accusations?

193
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:56,686
This is not fair, Your Majesty!

194
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:59,387
You are still telling lies?

195
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:02,027
Does the man behind you...

196
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:05,397
scare you more than I do?

197
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:29,686
Tell them to cancel the morning audience.

198
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,426
Yes, Your Majesty.

199
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:40,966
When did this begin?

200
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:43,237
His condition has been worsening...

201
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,466
since he saw the royal physician yesterday.

202
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:47,107
He does not trust the physicians in the Medical Office.

203
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:49,637
Se Yeob, I...

204
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,477
I cannot breathe.

205
00:15:54,147 --> 00:15:56,216
You are experiencing heart palpitations caused by anxiety.

206
00:15:56,446 --> 00:15:59,186
Please get some rest. I will make some herbal tonic for you.

207
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:01,757
What about acupuncture?

208
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:07,227
Your acupuncture saved my life many times.

209
00:16:09,627 --> 00:16:10,627
I can no longer...

210
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:13,227
administer acupuncture.

211
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:16,566
What do you mean?

212
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,206
For some reason,

213
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:22,037
I can no longer hold a needle.

214
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:25,407
However, there is a female physician who assists me.

215
00:16:25,676 --> 00:16:27,176
Please allow her to do it.

216
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:33,446
You have my permission.

217
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,287
Your Majesty.

218
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:14,186
The Second State Councillor would like an audience with you.

219
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:20,796
Will you be okay?

220
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:25,106
Now is not a good time.

221
00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:28,376
Your Majesty, tell him to leave.

222
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:30,437
You should see him another time.

223
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,007
No.

224
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:35,017
If I do not do it now,

225
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:39,146
I may never have another chance to have a 1-on-1 with him.

226
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:47,227
Your Majesty.

227
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:50,197
You do not look so well.

228
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:52,326
Hence,

229
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:55,537
I visited the dispensary and prepared a good medicine for you.

230
00:17:58,366 --> 00:17:59,366
My medicine...

231
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:02,277
is not important now.

232
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,177
It has been confirmed...

233
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,046
that my father...

234
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:15,987
was lethally poisoned.

235
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,826
Your Majesty,

236
00:18:24,826 --> 00:18:28,366
one must refrain from making such horrible accusations.

237
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,066
The case was under inspection this past year.

238
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:36,836
Royal physician Shin Gui Soo...

239
00:18:38,606 --> 00:18:40,007
administered the poison.

240
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,687
Are you saying you have proof of this crime?

241
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,497
Would I have mentioned this...

242
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,326
without evidence to back up my claim?

243
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:07,467
A royal physician could not have done it alone...

244
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:11,106
which is why...

245
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:14,146
I must dig deep into who gave the orders.

246
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:20,717
Do you not agree, Second State Councillor?

247
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:27,487
Your Majesty,

248
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:31,096
your order is my command.

249
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,007
I am sure you came here for answers,

250
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:46,177
so why have you not asked me about your adoptive son?

251
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:49,917
An anonymous report was made regarding a dead court maid,

252
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:52,217
and her death is being investigated.

253
00:19:53,086 --> 00:19:56,687
He will soon be released, so do not worry.

254
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:18,237
Father.

255
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,816
Is there anyone who could have known that you killed the court maid?

256
00:20:24,677 --> 00:20:27,086
Is that why I was arrested?

257
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:32,626
Now that Im Soon Man is dead,

258
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:36,556
the assassins could have been talking.

259
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:38,667
That would worry me.

260
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,396
You will soon be released,

261
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:45,106
so maintain your silence until then. Do you understand?

262
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:48,406
Of course. Please do not worry about me.

263
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:03,316
Would His Majesty be all right?

264
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:05,757
Now that you treated him with acupuncture,

265
00:21:05,757 --> 00:21:06,987
he will lie down and rest.

266
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:10,227
He must take cheongshimhwan and ondamtang when he awakes,

267
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,197
but the Medical Office cannot be trusted.

268
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:15,636
Please do not worry. The plan is already in motion.

269
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:27,247
Young Master, Lady Seo.

270
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:29,277
Stop bouncing with glee and get back to work.

271
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:30,747
Yes, get back to work.

272
00:21:31,116 --> 00:21:33,386
We must make these until the end of the day.

273
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:34,886
Must you all take a punch at me?

274
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,017
When did you all make it here?

275
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:39,126
I sent word since it would be...

276
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:41,527
more dangerous for them in Sorak Village.

277
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:43,427
That was wise of you.

278
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:46,126
Darn.

279
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:49,497
Cho Tae Hak is will not be easy to take down.

280
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:51,437
We may seem to have weakened him,

281
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:53,537
but he might not react in the way we anticipated.

282
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:58,037
Shin Gui Soo very much believed that Councillor Cho...

283
00:21:58,037 --> 00:21:59,646
would guarantee his freedom.

284
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,777
He could position himself...

285
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:04,177
to be the only one who does not take the blame.

286
00:22:05,346 --> 00:22:07,086
How can he...

287
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:08,556
when the evidence against him is clear?

288
00:22:09,013 --> 00:22:10,614
We do not have evidence...

289
00:22:10,614 --> 00:22:13,013
directly linking him to the former king's death.

290
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:15,713
If he continues to claim innocence,

291
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:17,653
only Shin Gui Soo will be punished.

292
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:21,753
We need a way to rattle his cage.

293
00:22:22,723 --> 00:22:24,124
What could it be?

294
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:26,693
Physician Gye.

295
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:28,834
Yes?

296
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:30,993
I have too much work to do,

297
00:22:30,993 --> 00:22:32,733
so dinner will be red bean porridge tonight.

298
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:35,503
- Red bean porridge sounds good. - Enjoy.

299
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:42,274
Look at these plump round dumplings.

300
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:54,324
For a late-night snack, he was served candied red ginseng.

301
00:22:56,024 --> 00:22:57,653
The next day, red bean porridge.

302
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:01,763
Red bean porridge!

303
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:08,903
Red bean porridge.

304
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:14,044
I have an idea.

305
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:26,253
The other day, I was not myself due to the severe cold I had.

306
00:23:26,884 --> 00:23:29,193
I was also embarrassed for wasting your time.

307
00:23:30,193 --> 00:23:34,294
It is why I have prepared a snack for you all today.

308
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:37,134
Please enjoy.

309
00:23:56,284 --> 00:23:57,753
Please enjoy it freely.

310
00:24:07,064 --> 00:24:08,094
They are the snacks...

311
00:24:08,094 --> 00:24:09,763
my late father used to frequently enjoy.

312
00:24:20,574 --> 00:24:22,213
My recent illness...

313
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:25,183
had me rethink the importance of gifted physicians.

314
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:28,144
It is why I wish to reinstate a physician...

315
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:30,013
to a post in the Medical Office.

316
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,153
Allow him to enter.

317
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:00,614
Physician Yoo Se Yeob...

318
00:25:00,614 --> 00:25:02,953
who was banished from the Palace and Capital...

319
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:05,524
will be reinstated as Head Acupuncturist.

320
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:08,624
But Your Majesty, the former king died at his hands...

321
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:09,923
Royal Physician Shin Gui Soo...

322
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:13,193
is currently being questioned for that reason,

323
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:16,894
and Yoo Se Yeob's name will soon be cleared.

324
00:25:27,044 --> 00:25:28,673
Councillor Cho,

325
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:32,344
you are the only one who has not taken a single bite.

326
00:25:32,544 --> 00:25:36,653
You dare to confront me despite the difference in our ranks?

327
00:25:40,153 --> 00:25:41,324
My apologies.

328
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,493
However, the others seem to have eaten,

329
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:48,463
but you have yet to take a single bite.

330
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:51,463
May one assume there is a reason behind it?

331
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:58,074
In front of you are the two snacks...

332
00:25:58,074 --> 00:26:00,074
that were consumed by the former king...

333
00:26:00,544 --> 00:26:02,344
right before he passed away.

334
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:05,544
They were laced with poison.

335
00:26:15,054 --> 00:26:18,663
The former king passed away after ingesting these snacks.

336
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:23,263
Anyone who is aware of that could not have eaten them.

337
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:30,634
You evil boy.

338
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:34,673
You are audaciously framing another for the mistake you made.

339
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:37,173
The Royal Kitchen court maid was tricked into thinking...

340
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:38,683
that dansacho was a rare herb from Qing.

341
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:42,384
A round dumpling was laced with dansacho...

342
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:43,953
to keep it from being caught by the royal food taster.

343
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:46,723
The Second State Councillor caused the death of the former king.

344
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:16,683
Where is your proof?

345
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:18,753
What you described...

346
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:22,394
is a wild story you concocted in your brain!

347
00:27:25,024 --> 00:27:26,124
Proof?

348
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:32,104
Do you know what this is?

349
00:27:34,604 --> 00:27:35,604
Councillor Cho stashed away goods...

350
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:36,774
that were presented to His Majesty...

351
00:27:37,503 --> 00:27:39,044
and approved opium to be distributed...

352
00:27:39,044 --> 00:27:40,374
despite it being banned by the royal court.

353
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:43,114
It is all written here along with the bribes he took.

354
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:45,584
- What? - How can that be?

355
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:48,544
It is proof...

356
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:51,453
that he stole from the country and harmed the people with drugs.

357
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:52,953
I am...

358
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:56,554
being framed, Your Majesty!

359
00:27:56,794 --> 00:27:58,493
An investigation will prove who is right.

360
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:03,233
Do not just stand there. Arrest Councillor Cho immediately!

361
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,534
Yes, Your Majesty.

362
00:28:04,534 --> 00:28:06,703
- What? - What on earth is happening?

363
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:08,403
- How could this be? - A ledger?

364
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:18,344
My lord!

365
00:28:41,864 --> 00:28:44,733
Royal Physician Shin. Are you all right?

366
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:48,544
What is the Second State Councillor up to?

367
00:28:50,243 --> 00:28:52,713
I do not know how much longer I can take this.

368
00:28:54,344 --> 00:28:57,814
His Majesty seems to know a lot.

369
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,253
Do not worry.

370
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:04,624
My father spoke to the King in private.

371
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:07,723
Then he came to see me to say we would be released soon.

372
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:12,203
Okay.

373
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:17,973
Come out.

374
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:24,544
Is it my turn?

375
00:29:30,153 --> 00:29:31,284
Why?

376
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:36,594
Why did you kill Wol?

377
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:38,354
Why?

378
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:42,933
Is that what...

379
00:29:43,894 --> 00:29:45,233
you did to my father too?

380
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:02,084
Come with me.

381
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:14,158
My goodness.

382
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:18,299
I said I would do it.

383
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:23,498
Our smart little lady can eat more.

384
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:28,468
Who would have known they used round dumplings?

385
00:30:28,738 --> 00:30:31,379
Still, we cannot bring down Councillor Cho...

386
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:33,379
unless the royal physician turns against him, right?

387
00:30:34,448 --> 00:30:36,619
Shin Gui Soo is cornered.

388
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:38,248
He will make up his mind,

389
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:40,049
and so will the members of the court.

390
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,458
Will you all eat up?

391
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,589
Now that we are living in a Hanyang mansion,

392
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:49,029
everything is much better quality, right?

393
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:51,599
No, I cannot tell at all.

394
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:54,228
The crunchy rice definitely tastes better.

395
00:30:55,369 --> 00:30:57,268
Jang Gun, you know your stuff.

396
00:30:57,738 --> 00:31:01,809
This is not even your mansion and you brag any chance you get.

397
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:04,238
Your old place was this fancy.

398
00:31:04,438 --> 00:31:06,508
How did you survive at the clinic?

399
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:08,379
You ate much more with us,

400
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:10,418
and you say it is nicer here, you boar?

401
00:31:12,188 --> 00:31:13,188
Boar!

402
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:29,639
Dunce, this place of yours.

403
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:31,869
You do not have alcohol, do you?

404
00:31:32,438 --> 00:31:33,468
As if.

405
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:35,609
He is the weird one.

406
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:37,738
His father drank like crazy.

407
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:39,478
Give me that.

408
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:42,948
The wine I made for him should still be untouched.

409
00:31:44,448 --> 00:31:46,619
I know how to make wine too.

410
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:49,119
You can make what you cannot drink?

411
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,889
What a good boy.

412
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:16,178
Take the others to safety!

413
00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:17,418
Physician Gye.

414
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:27,158
Physician Gye.

415
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:42,779
Physician Gye.

416
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,488
Father.

417
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:54,849
Father.

418
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:00,359
We cleaned his wound.

419
00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:03,599
We will give him an energizing tonic and then see how he does.

420
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,799
You and Jang Gun, make medicines that give energy.

421
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,498
Okay. I hope he does not run a fever.

422
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:13,208
I will also prepare some Haedoktang.

423
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,208
(Haedoktang: Used to combat inflammation)

424
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:16,779
And something to stop the bleeding.

425
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:19,879
No. Something to improve his stamina.

426
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:22,448
No, make something with all the best ingredients...

427
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:24,049
Physician Yoo.

428
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:26,649
You did your best.

429
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:28,388
He will be okay.

430
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,859
I have to make all that, right?

431
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:39,328
You know acupuncture, my lady.

432
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,569
Stay with my father.

433
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:42,938
Jang Gun and I will make all the tonics.

434
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:48,808
I should have learned acupuncture.

435
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:00,089
Am I doing something pointless?

436
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:05,929
What is the use if I cannot protect those dear to me?

437
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,069
- Physician Gye. - Physician Gye.

438
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,578
Why the long face?

439
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:28,578
Is someone dead?

440
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,418
Do not speak.

441
00:34:41,328 --> 00:34:42,828
Your father...

442
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:47,368
was a good man.

443
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:53,938
You must not run away like I did.

444
00:34:57,938 --> 00:35:00,049
Perhaps I waited...

445
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:03,518
for someone like you...

446
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,219
to show up and put everything right.

447
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:15,929
"Run away." "No, do not."

448
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:22,098
I taught you nothing but nonsense.

449
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:25,969
I am sorry.

450
00:35:38,018 --> 00:35:39,018
Physician Gye.

451
00:35:41,688 --> 00:35:42,688
Physician Gye.

452
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:49,299
I think he just passed out.

453
00:36:04,138 --> 00:36:06,009
I will condemn them all...

454
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,719
and correct everything.

455
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:13,549
Yes.

456
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:15,819
We are almost there.

457
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:18,558
It is okay.

458
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:22,058
It will all be okay.

459
00:36:37,638 --> 00:36:39,978
Head Acupuncturist, report your findings.

460
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:05,239
Gwak Gyo Young, the King's taster...

461
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,779
was poisoned with something not even a silver binyeo could detect.

462
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:18,449
This stiletto needle was specially made to discolour...

463
00:37:18,748 --> 00:37:20,288
when coming into contact with such substances.

464
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:27,659
The colour of the needle changed when it touched the court lady's blood.

465
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,328
Also, purple blisters were found on the body,

466
00:37:31,328 --> 00:37:34,098
and it shows that a deadly plant called dansacho was used.

467
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:37,998
Furthermore,

468
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:43,009
the exact same discolouration occurred on this needle as well.

469
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:45,708
This stiletto needle was used...

470
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,879
the last time I treated the late King.

471
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:53,018
Just like the court lady's needle, its colour has changed.

472
00:37:55,618 --> 00:37:56,888
Why did this happen?

473
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,788
The Second State Councillor used dansacho...

474
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,558
to poison him.

475
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:04,958
- He poisoned the late King? - That is absurd.

476
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:07,328
- My gosh. - How could he do such a thing?

477
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:09,969
I swear, I did not do anything...

478
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:11,768
that I should be ashamed of.

479
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:18,009
The person who knows the most about dansacho is someone else.

480
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:20,909
The person who caused the late King's death...

481
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,618
was none other than Yoo Se Yeob.

482
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:28,589
His father, Commissioner Yoo Hoo Myung,

483
00:38:28,688 --> 00:38:31,388
left the citadel to get rid of the evidence...

484
00:38:31,388 --> 00:38:33,328
and suffered such an accident.

485
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:36,029
Your Majesty, the Second State Councillor...

486
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:38,699
is absolutely right!

487
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:44,268
Many people here witnessed Yoo Se Yeob attempting...

488
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,368
to treat the late King with his needles.

489
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:50,409
You were there too, Your Majesty.

490
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:53,609
He claims that I used dansacho.

491
00:38:53,808 --> 00:38:57,549
But who saw me and the royal physician, Shin Gui Soo?

492
00:38:57,549 --> 00:38:59,018
Who is the witness?

493
00:39:02,348 --> 00:39:03,859
The person who put dansacho...

494
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:06,958
in the late King's food as per the Second State Councillor’s order.

495
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:10,098
Wol, the court maid.

496
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:12,458
That court maid is dead.

497
00:39:16,138 --> 00:39:17,668
Please do not let the wicked traitors...

498
00:39:18,368 --> 00:39:21,009
deceive you, Your Majesty.

499
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:23,538
- Please, Your Majesty. - Please, Your Majesty.

500
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:48,129
Your father died at the hands of an assassin...

501
00:40:48,288 --> 00:40:51,359
sent by the Second State Councillor. It was not me.

502
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:56,998
And the court maid is not dead.

503
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:03,279
She is alive.

504
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:23,359
Councillor Cho poisoned the King...

505
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,629
as he was against his plan to conquer the North.

506
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:28,629
This evidence was found before your father died.

507
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:30,839
It states that the royal physician collected...

508
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,808
and burned all the dansacho as per Councillor Cho's order.

509
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:36,308
Because of this, I began to suspect Councillor Cho.

510
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:38,839
And that is why I hid the stiletto needle...

511
00:41:39,578 --> 00:41:41,009
and the court maid as well.

512
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,089
Tell His Majesty who you are.

513
00:41:51,118 --> 00:41:54,659
I am Wol, a court maid in the Royal Kitchen.

514
00:42:05,368 --> 00:42:06,938
Is it true...

515
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:09,409
that you were told to put dansacho in the late King's food?

516
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:11,509
Yes.

517
00:42:12,578 --> 00:42:14,748
I was told that it was a rare spice from Qing.

518
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:17,779
I was ordered to sprinkle it on the King's candied red ginseng...

519
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,918
and to put it in his red bean porridge as well.

520
00:42:24,518 --> 00:42:27,828
Tell us exactly how you put it in the red bean porridge.

521
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:33,799
In the round dumplings, as I was told it would enhance the flavours.

522
00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:42,069
And who ordered you...

523
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:44,478
to do that?

524
00:42:55,219 --> 00:42:56,719
Royal Physician Shin Gui Soo...

525
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,958
gave me the order along with the ingredient list.

526
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:08,569
Your Majesty!

527
00:43:09,868 --> 00:43:12,268
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

528
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,609
I was afraid of the Second State Councillor’s power.

529
00:43:17,009 --> 00:43:18,339
He threatened me...

530
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:21,049
that he would hurt my family if I did not obey his orders.

531
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:22,348
That is why I did it.

532
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,578
I did not do it of my own accord, Your Majesty!

533
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:34,089
There is one more thing.

534
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:35,728
Tell us.

535
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:38,629
I witnessed...

536
00:43:42,098 --> 00:43:44,699
Lord Yoo Hoo Myung's murder.

537
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:52,138
What is she saying?

538
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:56,478
Tell us...

539
00:43:58,248 --> 00:43:59,449
what you witnessed.

540
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:05,618
He was in a rush to go somewhere.

541
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:09,859
Someone appeared out of nowhere and hit him with a heavy stick.

542
00:44:22,438 --> 00:44:23,779
Did you see the person who hit him?

543
00:44:29,779 --> 00:44:31,918
He was wearing a jade butterfly ornament.

544
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,529
A black jade butterfly ornament...

545
00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:48,899
is the symbol of your family, Councillor Cho.

546
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:54,208
Shin Gui Soo, you ought to tell the truth.

547
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,879
Who ordered you to use dansacho on the late King?

548
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:02,208
Who was it?

549
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,288
It was the Second State Councillor!

550
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:13,388
He was the one who gave me the dansacho.

551
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:18,159
All I did was hand it over to that girl, Your Majesty!

552
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:32,879
This is a trap.

553
00:45:34,509 --> 00:45:36,348
You are doing this to slander me!

554
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:40,788
If that is the case...

555
00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:44,989
Why did you steal this secret letter...

556
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:47,558
and try to endanger our country?

557
00:45:59,808 --> 00:46:01,069
Get rid of him...

558
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:04,739
and deliver the late King's secret letter to Qing.

559
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,078
You assassinated the late King...

560
00:46:07,509 --> 00:46:09,679
and stole the letter that ordered the army to advance into the North.

561
00:46:09,879 --> 00:46:11,179
And to survive,

562
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:14,248
you tried to use the letter to get Qing's army involved!

563
00:47:00,328 --> 00:47:01,598
Keep His Majesty safe!

564
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:51,848
What did you just do?

565
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:53,118
My goodness.

566
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:12,739
What I did...

567
00:48:14,538 --> 00:48:15,538
was...

568
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:19,578
to salvage this country from the aftermath of the war.

569
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:23,049
I...

570
00:48:25,478 --> 00:48:29,089
am the most loyal subject this country has ever seen!

571
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:15,647
Se Yeob.

572
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:21,088
Yes, Your Majesty.

573
00:49:23,057 --> 00:49:24,858
I was born fragile and weak.

574
00:49:25,457 --> 00:49:28,897
Days like this did not seem to be in my future.

575
00:49:36,638 --> 00:49:37,937
I thank you for that.

576
00:49:40,307 --> 00:49:43,077
You are one of the sturdiest and healthiest leaders...

577
00:49:43,077 --> 00:49:44,147
this country has ever seen.

578
00:49:45,577 --> 00:49:47,318
You not only saved my life,

579
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:50,187
but persistently searched for the truth.

580
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:53,827
All alone, while suffering from an illness from within,

581
00:49:54,227 --> 00:49:55,988
you let yourself carry the burden.

582
00:49:58,258 --> 00:49:59,258
I apologize...

583
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,528
all while expressing my gratitude.

584
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:07,807
It must have been depressing for you...

585
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,868
to have lost your ability to perform acupuncture.

586
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:12,338
I worry...

587
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:15,707
that you also harbour an illness within just like I do.

588
00:50:16,718 --> 00:50:17,747
Have you been taking it lightly...

589
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,818
all because you are a physician yourself?

590
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:26,118
I apologize, Your Majesty, for making you worry.

591
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:28,258
However,

592
00:50:28,957 --> 00:50:31,798
it seems as though you have gained even a better ability.

593
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:36,198
Now that you can cure illnesses within one's heart and mind,

594
00:50:36,937 --> 00:50:39,838
I should refer to you as a specialist of the mind.

595
00:50:46,278 --> 00:50:47,948
I have yet to recover...

596
00:50:48,778 --> 00:50:51,147
and am in need of a physician who can cure me.

597
00:50:52,977 --> 00:50:53,988
Would you...

598
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:57,818
be willing to take on the position as royal physician?

599
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:14,437
Ip Bun, you're getting food everywhere!

600
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:17,738
Hold on, Father.

601
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,178
Is that alcohol?

602
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:23,778
Gosh, of course I am not drinking. Keep serving our guests.

603
00:51:24,178 --> 00:51:27,118
Take another sip and I will discard it all!

604
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:43,327
Look how fine he is.

605
00:51:47,707 --> 00:51:49,037
Physician Yoo, you glow like the sun.

606
00:51:49,508 --> 00:51:50,977
What did I tell you?

607
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:53,877
There is no man in Hanyang better looking than him.

608
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,108
I am blinded.

609
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:01,548
Poong is now getting married!

610
00:52:01,548 --> 00:52:04,858
Everyone, may I have your attention?

611
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:05,957
Attention, children.

612
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,227
Physician Yoo who was wrongfully accused of a crime...

613
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:12,497
and banished from the Palace and Hanyang...

614
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:17,368
turned out to be the physician who saved His Majesty's life.

615
00:52:21,267 --> 00:52:23,608
- Nice! - Attention, please!

616
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:25,608
Minister of Personnel...

617
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:27,948
Supreme Commissioner Yoo Hoo Myung...

618
00:52:28,108 --> 00:52:31,618
was also one of this country's most loyal subjects!

619
00:52:34,948 --> 00:52:38,588
Enjoy all the various foods we have prepared for you.

620
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:41,858
And spread the word.

621
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,057
Yes, spread the word!

622
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,368
Spread the word, please.

623
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:51,167
- Bravo! - Bravo!

624
00:52:51,497 --> 00:52:53,068
As per His Majesty's command,

625
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:55,138
back in office is Head Acupuncturist Yoo Se Poong...

626
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,178
I mean, Yoo Se Yeob.

627
00:52:57,238 --> 00:53:00,278
Let us have fun and celebrate his accomplishment!

628
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:01,807
Let us party!

629
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:05,147
Here, here!

630
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:17,557
The Medical Office?

631
00:53:18,658 --> 00:53:21,397
His Majesty summoned you back to the Medical Office?

632
00:53:22,727 --> 00:53:24,798
Not just as the head acupuncturist,

633
00:53:26,167 --> 00:53:27,667
but as the royal physician?

634
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:32,238
Call me baffled.

635
00:53:33,207 --> 00:53:35,608
Granny, there is nothing to be baffled about.

636
00:53:36,207 --> 00:53:38,417
A royal physician is a high-ranking position.

637
00:53:38,577 --> 00:53:40,218
I bet you will get paid a lot.

638
00:53:40,687 --> 00:53:42,287
Not really.

639
00:53:42,488 --> 00:53:44,318
No government job pays well.

640
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,258
But they still expect you to work twice as much.

641
00:53:48,088 --> 00:53:51,258
Physician Gye, you were also ordered to return to office.

642
00:53:52,258 --> 00:53:53,258
- Me? - Oh, my.

643
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:54,997
Goodness.

644
00:53:54,997 --> 00:53:55,997
Why me?

645
00:53:56,097 --> 00:53:57,937
Why not? You said it yourself...

646
00:53:57,937 --> 00:53:59,638
that you were a renowned physician of the Medical Office.

647
00:53:59,638 --> 00:54:03,068
Exactly. It must be time for you to show us what you are made of.

648
00:54:03,068 --> 00:54:04,077
Right.

649
00:54:05,077 --> 00:54:06,838
Once everyone goes to the Medical Office,

650
00:54:07,008 --> 00:54:08,678
who will run Gyesoo Clinic?

651
00:54:12,718 --> 00:54:13,747
You are right.

652
00:54:17,258 --> 00:54:18,258
Hold on a second.

653
00:54:18,557 --> 00:54:23,488
All we have to do is open Gyesoo Clinic in Hanyang.

654
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,198
That will be Hanyang Clinic, not Gyesoo Clinic.

655
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:29,528
Right, Hanyang Clinic.

656
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:34,307
Let me think. We can store herbs there and...

657
00:54:34,307 --> 00:54:35,638
If Physician Gye becomes a royal physician,

658
00:54:36,267 --> 00:54:38,178
will he be ordered around too?

659
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,238
That sure is baffling.

660
00:55:02,428 --> 00:55:03,428
Would you...

661
00:55:04,397 --> 00:55:07,368
be willing to take on the position as royal physician?

662
00:55:08,468 --> 00:55:09,468
Father,

663
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:13,238
how must I live my life from here?

664
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:17,847
Physician Yoo, are you here?

665
00:55:27,488 --> 00:55:29,858
Are you going somewhere?

666
00:55:31,997 --> 00:55:33,627
I will leave the country tonight.

667
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,568
To where exactly?

668
00:55:40,368 --> 00:55:43,307
I have yet to decide. Maybe to the warm Okinawa...

669
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:46,207
or far away to western China.

670
00:55:52,247 --> 00:55:54,088
The truth would not have been revealed...

671
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:56,488
without your help.

672
00:56:03,627 --> 00:56:05,928
My actions were to atone for my family's sins.

673
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,097
They do not change the fact that I committed treason.

674
00:56:10,597 --> 00:56:12,597
For assisting you in a meager role,

675
00:56:12,997 --> 00:56:15,238
His Majesty spared me my life.

676
00:56:17,138 --> 00:56:20,238
You could have lived in power...

677
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,977
with the Second State Councillor.

678
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:26,048
But you made this choice.

679
00:56:29,088 --> 00:56:30,557
I felt uncomfortable.

680
00:56:34,127 --> 00:56:36,727
While I enjoyed the power as an adopted son,

681
00:56:37,658 --> 00:56:40,127
others had to die for no reason.

682
00:56:43,528 --> 00:56:45,968
Although I learned to use a sword to survive,

683
00:56:48,008 --> 00:56:50,307
I never once used it in vain.

684
00:56:51,638 --> 00:56:55,908
That is how you saved both me...

685
00:56:56,477 --> 00:56:57,847
and Wol.

686
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,488
Are you returning to the Medical Office?

687
00:57:03,448 --> 00:57:04,917
As a royal physician?

688
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:07,787
I have not yet decided.

689
00:57:10,028 --> 00:57:11,327
It is because of Eun Woo.

690
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:17,537
Do not live in pain like me in a position you do not want.

691
00:57:18,198 --> 00:57:21,608
Look deep into your heart in advance.

692
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:28,807
Take good care of Eun Woo.

693
00:57:36,517 --> 00:57:37,718
Royal inspector.

694
00:57:39,687 --> 00:57:41,127
I wish you good health.

695
00:58:15,127 --> 00:58:16,127
Oh, dear.

696
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:21,198
What is wrong with me?

697
00:58:35,977 --> 00:58:37,077
There.

698
00:58:48,127 --> 00:58:51,158
What did you wish for?

699
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:54,698
What about you?

700
00:58:56,068 --> 00:58:59,968
I wished that Gyesoo Clinic flourish.

701
00:59:01,807 --> 00:59:04,477
Will you not work at the Medical Office?

702
00:59:04,537 --> 00:59:08,678
No. The pay is too tiny, and there are too many...

703
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,647
nosy people who nag...

704
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:13,618
and comment on what to do, so I will not work there.

705
00:59:15,017 --> 00:59:16,588
Ip Bun will be disappointed.

706
00:59:17,988 --> 00:59:20,318
Sorak Village suits her just right.

707
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:22,227
I cannot have her getting too dreamy.

708

You know you are very important...

Forget about the dunce who cannot use needles.

711

We should start over.

712
00:59:42,108 --> 00:59:44,747
Why should she start over with you?

713
00:59:46,818 --> 00:59:48,718
Oh, I am so scared.

Right.

716

I should return this to you now.

gave me a new set of needles.

724
