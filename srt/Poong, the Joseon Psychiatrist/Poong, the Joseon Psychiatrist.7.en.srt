You knew my father?

Not only are you a dunce, you are an eavesdropper too.

You listen in on conversations? Good for you.

19
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:22,054
I heard clearly...

20
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:24,323
that you studied with my father.

Answer my question!

00:02:32,363 --> 00:02:33,694
You knew...

25

who I was all along?

26
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:41,173
Yes! Everyone in Hanyang knows what happened.

27
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:43,944
That Yoo Hoo Myung died a suspicious death...

28

Then why...

30
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,814
Why did you not say anything?

31
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:55,553
Should I have held both your hands...

32
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:57,953
and shared stories from the past?

33
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:03,094
I let you stay at my clinic and be some sort of physician.

34
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:08,464
Why does the royal inspector speak to you in such a manner?

35
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:10,333
I have no idea!

36
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:13,034
How would I know what he was saying...

37
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:14,974
when he barged in just like that?

38
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:17,374
I ask because I think my father was involved.

39

Shut your mouth!

171
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:09,273
You are still not over her.

172
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:18,013
I have not even tasted any of the dishes yet.

173
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,413
What? Why would you shove this in my face now?

174
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:24,354
You must pay off her debt in her stead.

175
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:27,424
She owes me 1,000 nyang in total.

176
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:29,794
Of course, you do not have that kind of money.

177
00:12:30,294 --> 00:12:31,294
Then...

178
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:34,733
Hand over Gyesoo Clinic.

179
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,533
Then I will call it even.

180
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:41,804
You must be going senile.

181
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:43,104
She left Ip Bun with you...

182
00:12:43,574 --> 00:12:45,743
and asked you to raise her,

183
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:47,544
so you must pay off her debt.

184
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,643
I will go to Ip Bun now.

185
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,743
Do not underestimate the power of this promissory note.

186
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:59,724
If I take issue with this and report you,

187
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:02,924
I can sell Ip Bun to get my money back.

188
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:05,763
Oh, hold on.

189
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:07,564
Will you be okay if she finds out?

190
00:13:08,263 --> 00:13:09,763
Can I tell Ip Bun...

191
00:13:10,564 --> 00:13:11,564
that her mother...

192
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:15,704
died at your hands, you insane murderer and quack?

193
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:19,604
Hand over Gyesoo Clinic.

194
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:21,444
Otherwise,

195
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:24,044
I will go to Ip Bun and tell her everything right away.

196
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:29,214
I can see that you are faltering.

197
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:34,023
I will tell Ip Bun that she is not your daughter.

198
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:38,224
What do you say? Can I tell her everything?

199
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:41,663
Shut your mouth!

200
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:51,304
That scoundrel.

201
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:56,243
Here.

202
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:02,913
What is this?

203
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:04,113
Chinese yam juice.

204
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:07,324
You should have told us that it was the steppe ratsnake.

205
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,153
We all thought Man Bok was going to die.

206
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:10,694
Drink up.

207
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,263
Your caring daughter made this for you...

208
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:15,763
so you can get your appetite back. Drink up.

209
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:45,993
Wake up.

210
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:47,834
Wake up.

211
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:53,464
Wake up.

212
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:56,574
Please...

213
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:05,643
No! Please, no...

214
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:07,844
Well...

215
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:10,674
About what Man Bok said earlier...

216
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:13,714
Just forget about it.

217
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:15,783
You know,

218
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:18,623
they say people talk nonsense...

219
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:20,054
in their final moments.

220
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:23,123
I understand.

221
00:16:24,023 --> 00:16:26,794
People even speak ill of the King behind his back.

222
00:16:29,893 --> 00:16:31,133
Did it not...

223
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,064
offend you?

224
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:35,334
"Learn to read the room."

225
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:38,574
I was told that countless times even at the Medical Office.

226
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:41,814
They always said it...

227
00:16:42,143 --> 00:16:43,613
after I flaunted my skills.

228
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:46,613
So I am not offended.

229
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:51,184
Stop!

230
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:54,483
She is going in the water again!

231
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,993
My gosh!

232
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:00,393
Get her, quick!

233
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:08,574
Stop!

234
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:09,674
Hurry!

235
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:11,033
Good grief!

236
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:14,143
Come on!

237
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:16,513
Yoo Jung?

238
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:18,913
- Do you know her? - Enough!

239
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,383
Yes.

240
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:35,393
My gosh.

241
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:37,133
- Lay her down. - Yes, sir.

242
00:17:40,463 --> 00:17:41,473
What is the matter?

243
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:43,604
Whenever she sees water, she jumps in.

244
00:17:44,034 --> 00:17:45,943
Was she bitten by a crazy dog or something?

245
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:47,604
The mad dog disease?

246
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:49,774
Has she done this in the past?

247
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:51,683
She dragged her out of a creek earlier,

248
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:53,284
but she jumped in again.

249
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:56,514
Let us administer acupuncture first.

250
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:02,024
- Go ahead. - Yes.

251
00:18:02,554 --> 00:18:04,524
At Daeryeung and Sinmun.

252
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:07,024
Sinmun and Daeryeung.

253
00:18:22,713 --> 00:18:23,713
Arson?

254
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:25,844
Where was the fire?

255
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:29,554
She threw some burning firewood on the roof of a house,

256
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:31,524
where a woman lives alone.

257
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:35,453
She was seen carrying the firewood.

258
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:37,754
That cannot be.

259
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:41,024
Was she holding a grudge against that woman?

260
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:44,094
They had never even met.

261
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:47,463
How do you know the woman who started the fire?

262
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:50,173
The bookstore I used to frequent...

263
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,443
The biggest one in the village.

264
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:53,703
She is that family's only daughter.

265
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:55,844
The bookstore?

266
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:58,113
They also own the general store.

267
00:18:58,544 --> 00:19:00,413
They are well off. Am I wrong?

268
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:04,514
She got me so many good books.

269
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:07,683
I heard her parents spent a fortune...

270
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:10,153
to marry her off to a poor nobleman.

271
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:14,094
It is possible that an illness prompted her to start the fire.

272
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,334
Do you think she might really have mad dog disease?

273
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:19,034
She seems to have a maddening thirst.

274
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:24,943
I told you to only get the ones we could sell.

275
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:26,643
You never listen to me.

276
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:27,673
Who picked this one?

277
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:29,274
This one is too much work!

278
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:31,883
It is an important ingredient to cool the blood to stop bleeding!

279
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:33,143
I know that too!

280
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:35,514
Will we only treat trauma patients who bring in no money?

281
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:37,953
"All my foul-mouthed father cares about is money."

282
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:42,294
Said Ip Bun.

283
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:44,554
Goodness.

284
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:46,994
Physician Gye, are you here?

285
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:49,094
I heard you were selling the house.

286
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:51,834
Will you be moving soon?

287
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,133
Here. Take your time and look around.

288
00:19:54,973 --> 00:19:57,604
The land is abundant with yang energy.

289
00:19:58,104 --> 00:20:00,074
- And down here... - Are you selling the property?

290
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:01,973
How can it be sold without the owner's permission?

291
00:20:02,673 --> 00:20:05,383
You cannot show buyers what is not on the market.

292
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:07,883
- What? - I am sure about it though.

293
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:10,314
According to Commander Im, the property is on the market.

294
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:13,153
Is he the owner of this place? No, it is I.

295
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:14,794
Now, get lost!

296
00:20:17,494 --> 00:20:19,294
Words would have sufficed.

297
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:21,633
There was no need to splash water. Let us leave.

298
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,994
Granny, nicely done.

299
00:20:31,643 --> 00:20:34,004
Why on earth did you buy so much?

300
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,373
It is not like we have a ritual to hold.

301
00:20:35,373 --> 00:20:37,074
We have a lot of mouths to feed now.

302
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:38,744
Besides, this is what I buy almost every day.

303
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:41,514
We cannot drain our resources to feed them though.

304
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:43,514
Starting today, everyone will eat...

305
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:44,923
blanched vegetables dipped in soy sauce.

306
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:49,024
What is with him today?

307
00:20:52,893 --> 00:20:53,923
Darn it.

308
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:01,774
Father, you are to eat alone today.

309
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,574
If I see you at the table, I might have indigestion.

310
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:21,183
Let us eat.

311
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:36,734
Do you have any issues?

312
00:21:37,203 --> 00:21:39,104
Like you said, we are sticking to blanched vegetables.

313
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:43,844
Even dogs are left in peace while they eat.

314
00:21:50,314 --> 00:21:52,054
I think I already have indigestion.

315
00:21:56,854 --> 00:21:58,094
Ibchun, wusu, gyeongchib, chunbun, cheongmyeong,

316
00:21:58,094 --> 00:21:59,163
gokhu, ibha, soman.

317
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:00,363
Ibchun, wusu, gyeongchib, chunbun, cheongmyeong,

318
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:01,633
- gokhu, ibha, soman. - Jang Gun.

319
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:03,034
- Ibchun, wusu, gyeongchib... - Stop!

320
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:07,734
Gosh.

321
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:13,244
What the...

322
00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:22,814
What?

323
00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:28,183
Why you...

324
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:31,693
How dare you try to trick me.

325
00:22:36,794 --> 00:22:38,403
(Samudang)

326
00:22:40,203 --> 00:22:41,234
Yoo Jung?

327
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:45,373
It is Eun Woo. I am sure you remember me.

328
00:22:46,873 --> 00:22:49,913
I wished to hear from you, but you were not in contact.

329
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:59,324
Is it true that you set fire to a stranger's home?

330
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:02,024
It does not seem possible.

331
00:23:02,193 --> 00:23:04,254
Please tell me I am wrong.

332
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,963
Yoo Jung, what is wrong?

333
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:13,663
Why are you doing this?

334
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:16,673
Please stop. Please.

335
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:25,044
Water...

336
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:27,344
Water.

337
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:32,683
What could have made her that way?

338
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:36,754
Bottled up anger manifested into an illness of the mind.

339
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:40,024
Could it have stemmed from her relationship with her in-laws?

340
00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:42,564
Let us confirm that ourselves.

341
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,774
It is obvious that my daughter-in-law set the fire,

342
00:23:49,774 --> 00:23:52,004
so why did they feel the need to rummage through the house?

343
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:57,173
The dispatched officers must have made a mess of things.

344
00:23:58,044 --> 00:23:59,943
She has never been the chirpiest...

345
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:01,653
which keeps me from reading her.

346
00:24:02,953 --> 00:24:05,784
How dare she set someone else's home on fire.

347
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:10,193
But I knew her as someone who was bold enough...

348
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:11,794
to always speak her mind.

349
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:12,584
Was there a child?

350
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:13,883
It died of an illness.

351
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:15,594
What rotten luck.

352
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,564
This is what I get for welcoming the wrong person into my family.

353
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:25,064
Mourning clothes are not worn when a child passes away,

354
00:25:25,064 --> 00:25:26,734
but not Yoo Jung.

355
00:25:27,764 --> 00:25:30,104
Could the sadness have swallowed her whole?

356
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:31,534
Maybe that led to her repressed anger.

357
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:35,413
Her chambers reminded me of those lived in by maids.

358
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:37,413
While others at that residence...

359
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:39,784
had decorative cabinets and high-quality duvets.

360
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:44,484
As a maiden, she was known for her boisterous charm...

361
00:25:44,554 --> 00:25:46,254
which is why I figured she would have a good life.

362
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:47,883
It is not too late for her.

363
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:48,923
Once we find the root of her problem,

364
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:49,923
help her release her anger,

365
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,223
and sort out the arson charge, she might be able to be happy again.

366
00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:59,004
Here, here. Double your money.

367
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:01,633
Lady or gentleman. Guess where the marble is...

368
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:03,104
and double your money.

369
00:26:05,943 --> 00:26:07,344
- I will pay you double. - Here.

370
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:09,274
- The money will be mine. - Double your money.

371
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:12,683
Double your money, people.

372
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:21,584
Yes!

373
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,354
Jang Gun won the money.

374
00:26:24,754 --> 00:26:28,123
No one can fool our Jang Gun.

375
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:30,933
- What the... - Let us try it once more.

376
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,203
- What... - Come on, then.

377
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:37,433
- Darn it. - How could you?

378
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:39,044
You sent out a young boy to earn money.

379
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:40,703
I never made him do anything.

380
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:43,514
He did it on his own accord not to get kicked out.

381
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:44,973
That is the same as compelling him.

382
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:46,883
Are you not shamed being the adult here?

383
00:26:47,643 --> 00:26:48,683
You brat.

384
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,254
Do you know how much it costs to put food on the table?

385
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,883
Jang Gun should learn how to earn one's keep.

386
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:55,554
Babying him will not do him good.

387
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:59,363
From here on out, you are to economize...

388
00:26:59,363 --> 00:27:00,893
regardless of your age!

389
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:05,534
What is it? Is a creditor trying to seize this house from you?

390
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:19,284
What did I expect from someone of lowly origin?

391
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:24,354
How dare you set fire to a house that is owned by one's husband?

392
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:27,123
It shows the lack of moral education you received.

393
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:29,024
You made a mockery out of it!

394
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:35,794
Are you even listening to me?

395
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:40,933
What... Unbelievable.

396
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:44,173
Wench!

397
00:27:56,354 --> 00:27:57,484
Let me enter.

398
00:27:57,713 --> 00:27:59,324
Not again.

399
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:01,123
Lady Seo, please.

400
00:28:05,524 --> 00:28:08,734
Yoo Jung, do you recognize me now?

401
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:22,014
The heartache must have been excruciating.

402
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:23,913
To lose your daughter like that...

403
00:28:32,683 --> 00:28:33,723
Yoo Jung.

404
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,453
- What? - Yoo Jung.

405
00:28:39,024 --> 00:28:40,524
Are you kidding me?

406
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:47,534
Stop this.

407
00:28:47,534 --> 00:28:49,534
Please stop this, Yoo Jung.

408
00:28:54,574 --> 00:28:57,044
It is too hot.

409
00:29:27,021 --> 00:29:28,021
No.

410
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,051
Who would be responsible if she were to escape?

411
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,561
Right now, she is unwell.

412
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:34,920
You cannot judge or sentence her.

413
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,601
Are you going to ask me to release every prisoner to you?

414
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:42,831
Also,

415
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:46,101
are you so skilled that you can surely repress anger...

416
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
in just three days?

417
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:49,311
Yes.

418
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,480
He is. From what I saw,

419
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
he is the greatest physician in Joseon.

420
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:09,960
What is the problem?

421
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,261
I will treat her,

422
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:12,960
and you can dock my pay accordingly.

423
00:30:14,101 --> 00:30:15,630
Repressed anger is hard to cure.

424
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,470
What about her food and board?

425
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,301
We barely make enough to support ourselves.

426
00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:20,970
She is sick...

427
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,541
because she lost her daughter.

428
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:24,710
We must see what the cause is,

429
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,210
and if she was framed for arson.

430
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Then you...

431
00:30:34,821 --> 00:30:35,821
eat less.

432
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:39,761
Tell Man Bok to do the same.

433
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,561
I will limit Man Bok to two bowls per meal. How is that?

434
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:48,561
Tell Lady Seo to eat just one bowl too.

435
00:30:50,371 --> 00:30:51,371
Oh, poor me.

436
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,311
Did the royal inspector release her this time too?

437
00:30:58,541 --> 00:30:59,541
Yes.

438
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,680
When I was framed for murder,

439
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:05,051
he treated me pretty nicely for a young nobleman.

440
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,021
I heard he is a skilled swordsman too.

441
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:11,450
His face is the best part of him.

442
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,660
The handsome one is the one with the sword, right?

443
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,291
Granny.

444
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,190
Oh, right.

445
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:20,160
Lady Seo, you and the royal inspector.

446
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,331
I heard you were close since childhood.

447
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,470
You make such a pretty couple.

448
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,871
Why did you two not marry in the first place?

449
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:39,081
Young Master.

450
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,351
You just had dinner and you are eating corn on the cob?

451
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:44,051
Oh, dear.

452
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,660
My Poong.

453
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:47,960
He is jealous.

454
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,591
He is all grown up.

455
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,130
I think...

456
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:55,200
you eat too much, causing moisture and toxins to build up.

457
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,601
- What? - Before you have a stroke too,

458
00:31:57,601 --> 00:32:00,200
you must eat just one bowl of rice per meal.

459
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:03,710
One bowl is too little.

460
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:11,811
My gosh!

461
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,660
If concern or fury brings on depression,

462
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,630
it blocks your energy, causing an illness.

463
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,670
Which of the two is the cause?

464
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:35,811
Is it concern or fury?

465
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,480
It is fury.

466
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,521
I prescribe 100 rounds of moxa cautery on two points.

467
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:51,481
Oh, my gosh.

468
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,220
Why are you out this late?

469
00:33:57,651 --> 00:33:59,291
Do you want water?

470
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,530
Where are you going?

471
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,990
Are you all right?

472
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:17,871
Oh, my gosh.

473
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:22,450
You do nothing but read boring books.

474
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,050
That is why you do not improve.

475
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,220
You are so prim and haughty, just like your father.

476
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,050
Where can I find a cure...

477
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,320
if not in books on medicine?

478
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:34,890
You must have mastered all the books on medicine...

479
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,461
to call yourself a physician.

480
00:34:36,461 --> 00:34:37,860
Once you become a physician,

481
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,700
you must read books that teach you about the human race.

482
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:42,771
That is how you learn to deduce...

483
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:44,831
what caused someone's illness.

484
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:46,840
Is that why you always read storybooks?

485
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,970
Now, take a look.

486
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,381
See for yourself. Everything goes in a storybook.

487
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,180
You can cross into the afterlife,

488
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,711
and you can meet the dead too.

489
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,160
Go and see your daughter.

490
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,570
This is the afterlife.

491
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,541
Storybooks say...

492
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:26,780
you can meet the deceased in the afterlife.

493
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:29,950
A spring will sprout up if you dig the ground.

494
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,081
Consider that the afterlife.

495
00:35:35,021 --> 00:35:37,121
Pretend this place is the afterlife.

496
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,331
Yoo Jung. Go along with it and do as he says.

497
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,961
Pretend your daughter is in there.

498
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,271
Seol.

499
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:19,521
Seol.

500
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:23,731
My child.

501
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:27,760
The fury you kept bottled up.

502
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,291
We will hear your story.

503
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,561
Yes. Tell us whatever you want.

504
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:47,811
Because of me,

505
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:52,751
my daughter died.

506
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,621
I am of middle-class.

507
00:38:58,191 --> 00:39:00,691
My father, who wanted me to marry into a noble family,

508
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:03,291
married me off to a poor nobleman.

509
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:06,501
He gave us a house and paid a dowry.

510
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:08,731
But in that house,

511
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:11,570
I was always alone.

512
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,610
How dare you take a break?

513
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,840
Since you are now married to a nobleman,

514
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:24,010
you must work hard...

515
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,510
to earn money!

516
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,050
Because you are low born,

517
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,720
I have to teach you and spell out everything.

518
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,921
Darn you!

519
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,030
When my daughter was born,

520
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,090
I was finally not alone anymore.

521
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:40,231
Mom.

522
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,831
Yes?

523
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:45,070
I am cold.

524
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,441
My sweet child, take more medicine.

525
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:53,740
Lord Im's family sent a messenger.

526
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,381
You promised to help them,

527
00:39:56,381 --> 00:39:58,550
so you ought to keep your promise.

528
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,050
I cannot go anywhere when Seol is this ill.

529
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,950
Is she not our daughter?

530
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:08,390
Obviously, I will take good care of her.

531
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,731
Hurry up and go.

532
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,530
Then make sure you check in often to see how Seol is doing.

533
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,871
How brazen!

534
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:20,271
How dare you tell your husband what to do?

535
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,840
Seol, I will be back soon.

536
00:40:28,941 --> 00:40:30,751
Mom, please stay.

537
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:34,081
Hurry up! My goodness.

538
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,151
I will be back shortly.

539
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,590
Goodness.

540
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:48,700
Seol.

541
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,930
Look.

542
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,501
This is the comb you wanted.

543
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,220
Seol?

544
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:14,990
Seol.

545
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,331
Seol, wake up.

546
00:41:20,401 --> 00:41:22,461
Seol.

547
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,371
Seol... No! My daughter...

548
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,171
Wake up. It is me, your mother.

549
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:34,410
Seol!

550
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:35,680
Because I...

551
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,510
Because of her low born mother,

552
00:41:39,151 --> 00:41:41,050
she suffered all her life and died.

553
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,530
Gosh.

554
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,360
When Seol died,

555
00:41:55,561 --> 00:41:58,771
my husband and mother-in-law did not care. No one did.

556
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,610
That was when it all began.

557
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:07,441
I started feeling this inextinguishable flame in my chest.

558
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,081
When I saw the fire in the furnace while making dinner,

559
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:14,820
the flame in my chest was ignited.

560
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:20,121
I grabbed some firewood without even realizing it.

561
00:42:21,191 --> 00:42:23,160
Then I walked and walked.

562
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:27,160
I have no recollection of what happened after that.

563
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:34,441
After your daughter died,

564
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:36,970
you sent someone out to find your husband. Where was he?

565
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:40,881
What do you think? It is obvious.

566
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:45,651
How dare you set fire to a house that is owned by one's husband?

567
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:57,760
I am a physician.

568
00:42:58,561 --> 00:43:01,961
We heard there was a fire. We are here to make sure you are okay.

569
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:04,501
The magistrate's office sent us.

570
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,171
Thank goodness the fire was put out quickly.

571
00:43:07,171 --> 00:43:08,771
I nearly died.

572
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,271
That crazy woman tried to burn my house down.

573
00:43:11,711 --> 00:43:15,541
Anyway, is the magistrate's office sending us medicine?

574
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,121
I heard you lived alone. Is someone else here?

575
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,251
Whether I live alone or not, it is none of your business.

576
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,521
I only said that because I did not want any gossip.

577
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,860
If your husband inhaled smoke too,

578
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,860
both of you would need medicine.

579
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,601
Yes, he did. He inhaled a lot of smoke.

580
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,700
Have you never met Lady Jang, the woman who started the fire?

581
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,271
No, never.

582
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,651
What brings you by again?

583
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:55,720
I believe we left one of the needles here.

584
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:57,820
Would you like to see?

585
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,421
Physician Yoo received this from the King...

586
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:01,820
when he aced the medical licensing exam.

587
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,530
If you receive treatment with this,

588
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,760
all your ailments will go away.

589
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,561
Right, Physician Yoo?

590
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,530
Yes.

591
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,941
Is that so? Come on in.

592
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,171
It is indigestion caused by eating too much meat and greasy food.

593
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:51,910
So what do you think?

594
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,640
You have trouble digesting food.

595
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:57,811
It has been going on for a while.

596
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,320
Correct.

597
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,720
I suppose the beef ribs were too greasy. My stomach is upset.

598
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:05,791
Beef ribs?

599
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,320
I have to eat meat at every meal.

600
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,030
If there is a special medicine that can help me digest meat,

601
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:14,061
I would love to try it.

602
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:22,271
The Royal Needle will be helpful. Right?

603
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,541
- The Royal Needle? - Yes.

604
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,481
Oh, right. To get the beef grease out,

605
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:34,180
I must put the needle into the sole of your foot.

606
00:45:34,421 --> 00:45:35,481
That is fine.

607
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:42,621
My stomach is upset. Please hurry.

608
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:43,961
Sure.

609
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,280
Please hang in there.

610
00:46:08,481 --> 00:46:09,751
Please hang in there.

611
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:20,960
I am sorry.

612
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,799
They are living a comfortable life thanks to Yoo Jung's money.

613
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:24,799
It made me so angry.

614
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:28,569
Her daughter-in-law got arrested, so she probably cannot sleep.

615
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,739
Stimulating Yongcheon helps relax the body and mind.

616
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,069
Well done.

617
00:46:34,379 --> 00:46:36,879
You should have tapped the needles into Tonggok and Taechung too.

618
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,250
Anyway, why did you go back to that house?

619
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,989
Because Yoo Jung may not have been the one who started the fire.

620
00:46:52,129 --> 00:46:54,830
Are you sure you started the fire?

621
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,100
The firewood at that house...

622
00:46:58,429 --> 00:46:59,799
I did it.

623
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,199
What?

624
00:47:03,509 --> 00:47:07,339
I failed to overcome my anger due to my lowly origin.

625
00:47:09,949 --> 00:47:12,449
Unlike Eun Woo, I do not come from a noble family.

626
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,520
Why do you have so much on your mind?

627
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,629
Just tell me.

628
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,429
Forget it.

629
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:29,830
I can be your dating coach and even confess your feelings in your stead.

630
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:31,569
I can do anything.

631
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:34,500
Move.

632
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:35,940
What?

633
00:47:37,609 --> 00:47:39,609
What is with all the floor mattresses?

634
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,410
My goodness.

635
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,149
You move around so much when you sleep.

636
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,750
From here to all the way over there.

637
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:49,949
Like this.

638
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,489
Not only that, but you also snore and grind your teeth.

639
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:56,160
Me? You are being ridiculous.

640
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:58,589
I wake up...

641
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:01,629
in the exact same position I go to sleep in.

642
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,529
As if.

643
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,940
You roll around the entire room all night...

644
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,969
only to go back to where you started in the morning,

645
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:13,609
which is why you believe that.

646
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,609
Are you ashamed of it, being of noble birth?

647
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:20,850
Noble birth? As if that means anything.

648
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,420
Gosh.

649
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,020
Here you go.

650
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,730
- What is this? - Oh, this?

651
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:33,529
A tonic was brewed with the snake we caught.

652
00:48:33,529 --> 00:48:36,060
Drink up, Young Master. Meat is good for your hand tremors.

653
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,830
How can one drink such a foul tonic?

654
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,469
It will work wonders, given how Lady Seo brewed it.

655
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,910
Unlike most ladies of noble birth,

656
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:50,149
she sure is high-spirited.

657
00:48:50,149 --> 00:48:52,109
She caught a snake...

658
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:54,649
that even scares those of lowly birth.

659
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:56,549
That is it.

660
00:48:57,089 --> 00:48:58,319
Our origin is not that important.

661
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,620
- That is it. - Sorry?

662
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,620
That is it!

663
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,560
The patient married into a noble family...

664
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,730
but was frowned upon for her lowly origin.

665
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,799
A lady of a noble family must be docile,

666
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:14,170
so she must have thought...

667
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:16,370
she could not even talk back to her husband.

668
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,410
It is why she did not speak of the mistress she had.

669
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,910
What can we do to relieve her of this illness?

670
00:49:24,779 --> 00:49:27,250
It will require your help,

671
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:31,890
but I am not sure if you can do it.

672
00:49:32,489 --> 00:49:34,690
Please tell me what it is. I am willing to do anything.

673
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:40,029
I do not think you have what it takes.

674
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:49,299
It is nothing.

675
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,810
Forget I said anything.

676
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,910
That still is no reason for you to stop midway.

677
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:05,589
A woman of noble birth should not carry a table.

678
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:07,890
I am here to eat with you.

679
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,589
You must eat.

680
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:11,929
How else will you replenish your energy?

681
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,359
Goodness.

682
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:17,069
What if someone sees you?

683
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
Is something wrong?

684
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,799
I have only dumped the rice in my soup.

685
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:22,569
This is not acceptable as a noble lady.

686
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,410
Being noble is no different.

687
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,239
Your in-laws taught you wrong.

688
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,620
What a meal that was.

689
00:50:46,259 --> 00:50:48,429
I cannot help but think that your husband...

690
00:50:51,469 --> 00:50:53,540
is a piece of garbage.

691
00:50:54,399 --> 00:50:56,339
- Eun Woo! - "A piece of garbage."

692
00:50:56,699 --> 00:50:58,870
"Keep talking bollocks, will you?"

693
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:03,410
Boll...

694
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,410
Say it.

695
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,080
Boll...

696
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,420
Lady Eun Woo,

697
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,819
I am afraid we must come up with a different plan.

698
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,890
No, let me try again.

699
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,529
A piece of garbage.

700
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,629
Keep talking bollocks...

701
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:25,830
Cussing requires experience.

702
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,370
It is not easy for one to speak such lowly words.

703
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,239
What is it with him and his sudden sense of frugality?

704
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:33,810
What is it this time?

705
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:36,140
We are to make a soup with the scales he collected...

706
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,549
from the fish store.

707
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,520
Darn you, Psycho Gye Ji Han!

708
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,620
That reminds me.

709
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:45,319
Physician Gye mentioned how you eat too much.

710
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:48,259
From now on, you must only eat one bowl per meal.

711
00:51:48,259 --> 00:51:49,259
Dunce!

712
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,589
Should you be chatting so much...

713
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:53,429
when you cannot make yourself useful as an acupuncturist?

714
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:54,500
Stop idling away.

715
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,799
- I told you to make a house call. - Psycho Gye Ji Han.

716
00:51:57,799 --> 00:51:59,929
The lady there adores you...

717
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:02,100
and will pay a hefty amount for your services.

718
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,100
Get going!

719
00:52:03,609 --> 00:52:04,710
Darn him.

720
00:52:07,879 --> 00:52:09,239
Darn you, Psycho Gye Ji Han!

721
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:16,020
I would love to snap his neck...

722
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,350
and serve it on a pike.

723
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,350
Darn that...

724
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:23,489
A noble lady should not say...

725
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,690
such foul words.

726
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:28,100
Being of noble birth does not make us different.

727
00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:32,270
It is only the shell we were born into.

728
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,040
Why must we keep our emotions bottled up inside?

729
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:37,270
One should be able to laugh,

730
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,170
be angry, and cuss at others.

731
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:42,980
Yoo Jung, people are all the same.

732
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:53,859
Do you think it worked?

733
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,989
Laying it out in foul words...

734
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:58,230
released the frustration within me.

735
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:00,759
I am glad.

736
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,469
I wonder why I never brought myself to try this before.

737
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:08,040
- Sorry? - The frustration is now gone.

738
00:53:08,469 --> 00:53:09,940
What I did to help Yoo Jung...

739
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,609
helped me in return.

740
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:24,649
I remember now.

741
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:30,120
I am not the one who set fire to the house.

742
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,330
When will you kick that woman out?

743
00:53:36,859 --> 00:53:39,830
I am of noble birth, and she is of middle-class.

744
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,870
Anyone will say that I should be your legitimate wife.

745
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:45,370
Since that is the case, let me call you as one.

746
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:46,770
My wife.

747
00:53:47,779 --> 00:53:50,850
Bring me all the money she has saved up.

748
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,210
If you wish to be adored, I mean.

749
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,420
Come here, my darling.

750
00:53:57,719 --> 00:53:59,719
Come here.

751
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,060
There is no need to be shy.

752
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,529
You seem delighted.

753
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:19,509
Are you now willing to really light something on fire?

754
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:58,580
It is I, Jang Yoo Jung.

755
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,980
Kim Gwang Tae, you rat. Get out here!

756
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:08,390
How dare you!

757
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:11,259
Are you insane?

758
00:55:11,529 --> 00:55:12,960
You are the one who is insane.

759
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,429
Yes, I am of middle-class.

760
00:55:15,629 --> 00:55:17,000
But I made a life for myself...

761
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,330
while you spent yours chasing skirts.

762
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,299
I am only guilty...

763
00:55:20,739 --> 00:55:23,100
of being born in a world where only the nobles are valued.

764
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,810
That is all.

765
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:29,739
This is how you act after setting my house on fire?

766
00:55:30,339 --> 00:55:31,980
She is not the one who started the fire.

767
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:33,279
It was you.

768
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,719
What are you saying?

769
00:55:41,489 --> 00:55:43,960
She may have come here with the firewood,

770
00:55:44,859 --> 00:55:46,330
but you set the fire yourself.

771
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,399
The firewood she failed to throw at the house.

772
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,170
It is right there.

773
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,569
You burn oak...

774
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:01,239
while her family burns pine.

775
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:06,980
That is oak,

776
00:56:07,649 --> 00:56:08,649
and this is pine.

777
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:10,620
Look closely!

778
00:56:16,819 --> 00:56:20,359
You probably saw Yoo Jung turn around and head home.

779
00:56:33,609 --> 00:56:34,609
Due to it raining recently,

780
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:36,879
the fire did not spread.

781
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:40,850
Although you probably wished for the house to burn down.

782
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:43,080
Why would I set fire to my own house?

783
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:46,020
I will soon tell you why.

784
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:53,330
Are you Myeong of the Deokpyeong Heo clan?

785
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,299
Yes. Why do you ask?

786
00:56:57,899 --> 00:57:01,000
According to the family register, one by that name does not exist.

787
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:03,810
What nonsense are you spewing?

788
00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:06,440
I have seen the genealogical record myself.

789
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:07,679
What you saw was a forgery.

790
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,509
She was once imprisoned for this exact crime.

791
00:57:12,879 --> 00:57:14,020
She set fire to her own house...

792
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,819
to give you a reason...

793
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,219
to kick out your wife...

794
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,420
before her identity was revealed.

795
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,390
All she wanted was your money.

796
00:57:25,029 --> 00:57:26,029
Arrest her.

797
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:27,129
- Absolutely. - Will do.

798
00:57:28,759 --> 00:57:31,069
Defamation of character and forgery are your crimes.

799
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,629
Do not forget arson too.

800
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,710
A mistress is only a mistress.

801
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,009
One's devoted wife...

802
00:57:45,009 --> 00:57:48,420
must forgive her husband despite his flaws.

803
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:51,549
You have not forgotten, have you?

804
00:57:53,089 --> 00:57:54,390
You are Seol's mother.

805
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,529
Shut your mouth, you scumbag.

806
00:58:01,129 --> 00:58:02,560
Do not say my daughter's name.

807
00:58:05,069 --> 00:58:07,469
That is no language to use to me.

808
00:58:07,469 --> 00:58:09,140
How so, you piece of garbage?

809
00:58:09,339 --> 00:58:11,210
I would wring your neck...

810
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,270
and shove you into a pile of manure.

811
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:15,239
How dare you try to lecture me?

812
00:58:17,379 --> 00:58:19,210
Why are you so vulgar?

813
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:20,679
- I should... - Freeze!

814
00:58:21,549 --> 00:58:24,819
If you so much as take one more step, I will...

815
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,520
beat you up so no bone remains in one piece.

816
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:32,190
You are the darnedest fool of most crass birth I ever saw!

817
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,160
Darn you! You punk! You scum!

818
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,830
Mugwort! Lavender! Daisies!

819
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,870
I would love to scrape the road with your face.

820
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:43,299
I will pluck out a bone and beat you with it.

821
00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:44,370
Oh, dear.

822
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,640
- My gosh. - He is a thick-faced fool.

823
00:58:48,009 --> 00:58:49,210
Use this.

824
00:58:53,379 --> 00:58:54,819
Do not kill me.

825
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,949
I am sorry. I was wrong to...

826
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,399
Do not ever come back.

827
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:14,839

Well done.

- You did very well. - Good for you.

832

I did not do anything wrong, did I?

Oh, whatever.

834

I can see clearly now.

835

The fire that burned me up is gone too.

My older brother invited me to stay.

Do not worry about me anymore.

I hope you can visit one day.

841

I bought this...

Okay.

Oh. I have something for you too.

Thank you.

You are great at drawing.

Do not ever choose misfortune again.

From now on, focus only on being happy.

Are you afraid I will tattle?

This is 50 nyang, the principal. What about the interest?

I will give you that later. Now go.

Keep your mouth shut! Be quiet.

She was his first love? I know that. Everyone here knows that.

868

So what? She was pretty.

869
01:02:47,649 --> 01:02:50,520
I must be pretty because I am her daughter.

870
01:02:52,949 --> 01:02:56,759
Your mother, because of this fool of a physician...

871

She died. Is that what you want to say?

872

She died because he did not administer acupuncture.

Not even the legendary Huatuo could cure someone with the plague.

874
01:03:11,469 --> 01:03:14,210
And to treat the plague you prescribe tonics, not needles.

Right, Father?

No?

Your full name is not actually Gye Ip Bun.

You are not Gye Ji Han's daughter!

880
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,620
I know that. My birth father's name was Ahn, was it?

881
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:34,230
Instead of Gye Ip Bun, does that make me Ahn Ip Bun?

882
01:03:35,029 --> 01:03:37,399
- What... - I do not like that name.

883

Get lost. I will repay the interest next time.

I must get lost? How will you pay me back?

893
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:09,500
You owe me at least 1,000 nyang more.

894
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,629
Here is the interest.

895
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,440
- What? - The Gyeongguk Daejeon says...

896
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,969
the interest cannot exceed 60 percent of the principal.

897
01:04:19,739 --> 01:04:20,980
Did you not know that?

898
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,410
Darn you. Can you not calculate?

899
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,910
How is 60 percent of 50 nyang just one nyang?

900
01:04:27,279 --> 01:04:30,949
If we show intent to repay one nyang at a time, that is enough.

901
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,319
Oh, and it is not actually Physician Gye who owes you, is it?

902
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:39,290
How about we spend this on a lawyer and take this case to court?

903

Darn you.

Well done!

She was a useless cook, but she was pretty?

It is true. Lady Namhae made this.

That is why I am pretty, but a pretty bad cook.

You fall for him and kept going to his place.
