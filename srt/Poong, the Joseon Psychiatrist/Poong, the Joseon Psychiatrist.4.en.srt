(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,031
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,171
I will grant you...

4
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,340
the opportunity to serve me.

5
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,881
Why would I agree to that?

6
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:56,551
Why?

7
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:58,790
Because...

8
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:02,461
your name is Yoo Se Yeob.

9
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,201
That is who you are.

10
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,341
From what I hear, you murdered the late King.

11
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:29,351
Poor you.

12
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,961
The Head Acupuncturist who aced the Medical Exam...

13
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,030
was doing so well,

14
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,861
but his one mistake was to kill the King.

15
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,430
That must have ruined your physician career.

16
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:45,601
Right now, you are in need...

17
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:47,540
of someone high up to look out for you.

18
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,510
You do.

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,051
If you do as I say, you will amass a great fortune,

20
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:57,851
and live better than you did in the Palace.

21
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,491
Rather than work for Gye Ji Han, the quack who does harm,

22
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,021
what I can offer is much better.

23
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:07,631
I was a physician who was...

24
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,501
arrogant and foolish.

25
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,971
I must pay for my crime for the rest of my life.

26
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,070
I cannot go back to the life I had.

27
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:21,840
That is true. That is why you need me to look out for you.

28
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:23,581
Do excuse me.

29
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,451
Wait, Se Yeob. Se Poong.

30
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,081
Darn it.

31
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:36,051
The spot that clinic is located...

32
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:38,321
is prime real estate.

33
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,231
(Episode 4)

34
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,620
From what I hear, you murdered the late King.

35
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:19,391
Eun Woo.

36
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,261
They are pretty, like you.

37
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:28,331
I found them on the ground.

38
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Oh, dear.

39
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,681
Is she not up yet?

40
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,451
She should be by now.

41
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:58,261
Sin Woo?

42
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,331
Eun Woo.

43
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,400
What are you doing here?

44
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,670
Where were you at this early in the day?

45
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,441
What are you carrying?

46
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,480
And...

47
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,011
Your clothes...

48
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:18,681
and hair...

49
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,860
Starting today, I will live at Gyesoo Clinic and learn medicine.

50
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:26,521
Medicine?

51
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:30,800
Eun Woo.

52
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:34,300
It was hard enough for you to break free from your in-laws.

53
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,131
Why would you torture yourself?

54
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,470
Do you know how hard the life of a female physician is?

55
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,040
Can you not just enjoy life and have fun now?

56
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,780
Everyone has a different definition of fun.

57
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:52,621
You always thought training in martial arts was fun,

58
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:54,790
and I had fun reading books...

59
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,220
and solving mysterious cases.

60
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,290
A woman of noble birth studying medicine?

61
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,261
Your father would not allow it.

62
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,400
But... he did.

63
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:11,871
He did what?

64
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:17,311
I have nowhere else to go as a woman of noble birth.

65
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,641
But as a physician,

66
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:21,980
I can start a new life, and that excites me.

67
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,451
Now, I want to go about the way I choose,

68
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,990
doing the work I choose.

69
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:55,610
Boo!

70
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:58,780
Oh, my goodness.

71
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:00,321
You scared me bad.

72
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,521
Do you like him that much?

73
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,030
I can see the sweetness dripping from your gaze.

74
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,501
Other servants cannot stand their masters.

75
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:13,871
You are a strange case.

76
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,001
Why are you suddenly crying?

77
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,400
- He is crying. - He is.

78
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,571
The boar is crying!

79
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:24,581
No. I am not.

80
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:26,040
- You cried. - I did not.

81
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,980
- Your eyes... - I did not cry.

82
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,480
Will you stop it? I said stop it.

83
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,400
It is not like that.

84
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:48,571
He used to treat the King, but now...

85
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,201
When he was in the Medical Office,

86
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:55,641
everyone lined up for his acupuncture treatment.

87
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:57,280
He got into trouble for it.

88
00:07:57,681 --> 00:08:00,181
But now he cannot even hold a needle.

89
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:03,650
If only he could cure his darn hand tremors,

90
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:05,751
he would be summoned right back to Hanyang.

91
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:09,050
Make way.

92
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,061
I have a question.

93
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,761
Who treats hand tremors the best?

94
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:22,100
Hand tremors?

95
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,311
Let me check your pulse.

96
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:33,681
You cannot.

97
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,211
How dare you touch a woman's flesh?

98
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:42,090
Can you not just look and then prescribe something?

99
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,691
What are your symptoms?

100
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,470
The young lady sometimes plays the geomungo for me in private.

101
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:58,270
Recently, her hands tremble whenever she plays,

102
00:08:58,401 --> 00:08:59,740
and the music is unbearable.

103
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,681
I will pay you however much the treatment costs.

104
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:12,250
Prescribe the best of medicinal herbs.

105
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:18,990
It would be best she eats meat to regain some energy.

106
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,090
If your hands still tremble,

107
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,961
I will prescribe a deer antler tonic then.

108
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,701
- Next. - Thank you.

109
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:46,581
My goodness.

110
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:48,421
- He treasures her. - Make way!

111
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,051
Talk about being overprotective.

112
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,990
The lady did not say a word herself.

113
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,331
"Prescribe the best of medicinal herbs."

114
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:59,561
How sweet.

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,671
I am jealous. When can I meet a man like him?

116
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,240
On top of being wealthy,

117
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,041
he is incredibly sweet to her.

118
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Ip Bun!

119
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,711
Come to your senses.

120
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,510
Following money will lead you straight to your own demise.

121
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:15,151
That is right. Those with money are often the bad ones.

122
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:17,281
Gosh, whatever.

123
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:19,480
You always speak ill of those who are wealthy and successful.

124
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,651
Meat dishes for hand tremors.

125
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,890
Meat dishes for hand tremors.

126
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,461
He cannot even memorize that one thing.

127
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,860
That birdbrain.

128
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:35,931
My lady.

129
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,201
Are you hurt?

130
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,441
Let me carry you.

131
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,041
Do not block your master's way.

132
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:56,390
How dare you glare at me like that?

133
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
That brazen fool.

134
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,870
Let us go.

135
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:10,331
This way.

136
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,140
How dare he.

137
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,951
What was that just now?

138
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:41,171
What are you doing?

139
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:43,870
You feed us this kind of rabbit food every day.

140
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,000
That is why my young master's hands are not getting better.

141
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,340
No wonder!

142
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:52,281
It is not like meat can magically fall into your lap.

143
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:55,581
If you are that worried,

144
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,411
go catch a hare or something.

145
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,090
Right.

146
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:06,161
Even the Dragon King of the Sea wanted a hare when he fell ill.

147
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,860
Oh, come on.

148
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,990
That is because it is the easiest animal to catch.

149
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,331
No, a hare.

150
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:13,201
My goodness.

151
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,211
What? I cannot eat such a cute creature.

152
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:24,311
I refuse.

153
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Young Master, hares are traditionally considered...

154
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:29,051
What was it?

155
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:32,720
Right, even the Dragon King of the Sea...

156
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,490
sent his subjects to catch one when he fell ill.

157
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,151
Try this folk remedy.

158
00:12:36,151 --> 00:12:37,890
That is a folk belief, not a remedy.

159
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,720
The herbal medicine is enough for me.

160
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,331
Should I make some soup with the hare?

161
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,890
Oh, dumplings with hare meat are delicious too.

162
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,730
- Dumplings are the best. - True.

163
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:49,730
I never really liked meat to begin with.

164
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:51,071
What?

165
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:52,901
When we lived in Hanyang,

166
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:55,110
you ate beef whenever you had the chance,

167
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,640
raw or grilled.

168
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:59,541
Have you seen cows' innocent eyes? How could you eat them?

169
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,051
Can we please keep the hare and raise it?

170
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,110
- Please? - No.

171
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,110
- Please? Let us. - No.

172
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,781
- Please! - No, not a chance.

173
00:13:05,781 --> 00:13:08,191
- Please let us keep it. - Put the carrots away. Come on!

174
00:13:08,191 --> 00:13:09,821
- Please? - No way.

175
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,020
- No? - Not a chance.

176
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,220
- Let us keep it, please. - No.

177
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,561
- Please? - No.

178
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:15,531
- Please? - No way. Not a chance.

179
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:19,401
Hand tremors?

180
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,500
Find high-quality medicinal ingredients.

181
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,571
Like gastrodiae rhizoma.

182
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,071
I think I am almost there.

183
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:33,110
The wild ones grow deep in the mountains.

184
00:13:35,211 --> 00:13:37,551
Be careful. You might encounter a tiger.

185
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
I am...

186
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,671
a fearless man.

187
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:01,211
Here I come.

188
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,441
He should have at least told me what it looked like.

189
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:07,811
All he told me was that it would be up in the mountains.

190
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,750
Look at this. Clearly, this is not it.

191
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,051
Oh.

192
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,661
This could be it.

193
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,431
My goodness. What is going on over there?

194
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,671
My lady, you must get up.

195
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,301
You have to come with me.

196
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,340
You need to get up!

197
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:41,911
Do you wish to die?

198
00:14:42,411 --> 00:14:43,581
I heard you.

199
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,850
Let go of my hand.

200
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,480
Wait, hold on.

201
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,020
Yes, it is you.

202
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,760
You are the young lady who was at the clinic the other day, right?

203
00:14:57,961 --> 00:15:00,100
You must have sprained your ankle.

204
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,370
Let me take you to the clinic.

205
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:04,031
Who are you?

206
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,270
Let go of my hand.

207
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:14,911
She told you to let go.

208
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:17,551
What are you doing to your master?

209
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:21,291
Mind your own business.

210
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,990
Just go away.

211
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,520
"Just go away"?

212
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,421
Why do you keep glaring at me?

213
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,100
You see, people used to call me "Rock-Hard Knuckles".

214
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,840
I cannot believe this.

215
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,711
Since you punched me first,

216
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,951
I now have no reason to hold back.

217
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,321
Oh, no...

218
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Hold on.

219
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,100
I should take you to the governor's office before we go to the clinic.

220
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,370
By the way, where did the boar go?

221
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,240
I wonder too. At every mealtime, he gets so excited.

222
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,110
He should be jumping around excitedly now.

223
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:54,681
Jang Gun! Go find Man Bok.

224
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,110
- Okay! - Do you have nothing better to do?

225
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,520
You are worried that he will miss a meal?

226
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:00,321
All he thinks about is food.

227
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:02,321
I am sure he will be back before the meal is ready.

228
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,191
That is true. If Man Bok can miss a meal...

229
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,890
Gye Ji Han can quit alcohol.

230
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,860
And dogs will stop pooping.

231
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,760
- What? - Shut it, you fool!

232
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:20,041
Then let us go over yin and yang after dinner.

233
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,871
Oh, let us study a little more. Just until Man Bok is back.

234
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:27,711
Shall we?

235
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,810
Yes.

236
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:29,951
Okay.

237
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,520
Who reads a book to learn about yin and yang?

238
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:41,490
Over here!

239
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
What is this?

240
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,851
Tie him up at once!

241
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:14,631
Let go.

242
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:17,591
Why are you arresting me? Let go of me!

243
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:21,601
This was not me! I did not do this.

244
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,830
Oh, dear.

245
00:18:33,752 --> 00:18:34,752
Man Bok.

246
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:38,191
Young Master!

247
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:39,822
What on earth happened?

248
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:42,991
I was told where I could find high-quality gastrodiae rhizoma,

249
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:45,062
so I went there to get some for you and...

250
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:46,562
Gastrodiae rhizoma? I am not ill.

251
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:47,661
What was it for?

252
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,961
I hear that it helps with hand tremors.

253
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:51,502
My gosh.

254
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:55,372
Young Master, I did not kill anyone.

255
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:57,241
You know me.

256
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:00,572
Yes, of course. I believe you, Man Bok.

257
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,141
Do not falsely admit to committing the crime...

258
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:04,211
just to break free from the torture.

259
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:07,282
I will prove your innocence, so stay strong until then.

260
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:08,721
Yes, Young Master.

261
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,151
What about it do you remember?

262
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:13,092
Tell us everything.

263
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,532
Let go of my hand.

264
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,431
Do you wish to die?

265
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:25,302
Before I passed out,

266
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:27,332
I came across the lady with hand tremors.

267
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:31,872
Her manservant was dragging her someplace to kill her.

268
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:38,012
The body is that of Gae Ban,

269
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:40,282
the manservant at Lord Jung's residence.

270
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:49,991
Judging by his wounds,

271
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:51,862
the cause of death was a hatchet to the head.

272
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:55,362
Right now, Man Bok seems to be responsible for his death.

273
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:58,201
May I see the hatchet?

274
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:09,112
The many wounds to the head suggest...

275
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:11,141
a personal grudge.

276
00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:13,012
Man Bok could not have done this.

277
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:19,921
Please take a look at this.

278
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,562
I now understand why his head was bashed in.

279
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,762
These are ligature marks.

280
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:33,332
That is correct. The murder weapon may seem like a hatchet,

281
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,671
but he was in fact strangled.

282
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:37,872
Why did this need to be covered up?

283
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:39,772
To misdirect the investigators.

284
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:43,481
This way, whoever killed the man could make Man Bok take the fall.

285
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,951
I request that you release Man Bok.

286
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:51,181
I cannot release a suspect based on circumstantial evidence.

287
00:20:51,622 --> 00:20:54,691
This is terrible. The victim may be a manservant,

288
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:57,491
but murder is always punished by beheading.

289
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,062
Why you...

290
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:05,701
Stay alert!

291
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:07,102
If you lose your focus,

292
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:09,401
your manservant will not be able to live.

293
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:12,772
He is not my manservant. To me, he is...

294
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,441
Enough. Just get ready for the road.

295
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:18,252
His residence.

296
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:20,181
Lord Jung's is where we are headed.

297
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,582
Maybe we will get lucky.

298
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:30,322
Lord Jung must be distressed by the tragic event.

299
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,262
As soon as I heard the news, I came rushing for a house call.

300
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:40,171
You...

301
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:45,441
You too, my friend.

302
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,641
Your eyes are murky, your lips are busted,

303
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,211
and your skin is dry.

304
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:50,812
Your internal organs must be in shambles.

305
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:53,312
I am serving patients...

306
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,312
with free additional acupuncture treatments today.

307
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:55,921
Get 2 for the price of 1.

308
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:57,921
We, at Gyesoo Clinic,

309
00:21:57,921 --> 00:21:59,991
wish to take care of our neighbours.

310
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,362
I am saying that I will treat you for free today.

311
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,862
I understand your words, but who are these other people?

312
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:12,772
Why should I let you all in when this is not a feast?

313
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,471
We are here on official business.

314
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:20,711
District Governor Seo dispatched physicians...

315
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:22,312
to the bereaved family.

316
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:26,881
Now, step aside.

317
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:27,911
Who are you to block our path...

318
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:28,951
when we were sent by the district governor?

319
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,622
You heard him. Do not block our way.

320
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:34,691
Lead the way to Lord Jung.

321
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:36,921
That was clever of you.

322
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:45,872
I can only imagine how upset you must be...

323
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:47,631
over the death of a family member.

324
00:22:48,471 --> 00:22:50,002
A family member?

325
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:52,512
Are you dismissing our class system?

326
00:22:52,812 --> 00:22:54,842
It is only a manservant who lost his life today.

327
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,711
It does not warrant this amount of fuss.

328
00:22:56,812 --> 00:22:59,711
Goodness. The manservant is the least of our worries.

329
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,252
We were sent to check on your welfare, my lord.

330
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:06,092
It is no secret that you provide the village with mental support.

331
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,961
Him and his arrogant gazes.

332
00:23:12,262 --> 00:23:14,802
He was hardly obedient.

333
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,401
His death is actually a reward.

334
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:19,102
I worry less now that he is dead,

335
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:21,441
so you do not need to worry about me.

336
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:26,211
That manservant of yours must have been a troublemaker.

337
00:23:26,211 --> 00:23:28,411
You have no idea.

338
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,042
He is of better use to us as a corpse.

339
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,552
Anyway, perform the acupuncture and hurry on out.

340
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,552
He was going to be sold anyway.

341
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:41,092
I will have lost nothing as long as I get my money back.

342
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:45,562
How are you feeling?

343
00:23:46,931 --> 00:23:48,092
Hand tremors...

344
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:50,862
usually manifest due to one being concerned.

345
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:54,272
The shock of what happened recently must have worsened your condition.

346
00:23:55,171 --> 00:23:56,372
She was not shocked at all.

347
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:59,241
Ever since she came back from the clinic,

348
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:01,481
she has been lying still under her covers.

349
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,381
It seems as though she must be given a deer antler tonic.

350
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:06,211
Allow me to check her pulse.

351
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:07,711
Goodness.

352
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:10,951
I already told you I cannot allow you to take her pulse.

353
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,691
But maybe a female physician could.

354
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:17,122
Of course.

355
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:20,262
As if there is a female physician...

356
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:21,862
who has fully mastered all medical texts.

357
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,332
Please give her your best deer antler tonic.

358
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:29,802
As for her diet, she is being served top-quality beef every day.

359
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:32,842
Lady Hyo Yeon.

360
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:35,941
You were in the woods where Gae Ban was killed.

361
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:42,782
She was home all day.

362
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:45,122
I already told you that.

363
00:24:45,822 --> 00:24:47,921
The question was directed at Lady Hyo Yeon.

364
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,292
Please answer me.

365
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:55,701
If you were there, you would've met a burly manservant.

366
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:58,532
He is like family to me.

367
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:03,842
- Look here... - Right this moment,

368
00:25:03,842 --> 00:25:05,842
he is being framed as Gae Ban's killer...

369
00:25:05,842 --> 00:25:08,241
and might be sentenced to decapitation. Please.

370
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:11,711
If you were there, let us know what happened.

371
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:13,211
- Look here! - Lady Hyo Yeon.

372
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,622
Ban...

373
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:26,931
Ban...

374
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:31,631
Ban...

375
00:25:32,602 --> 00:25:33,701
Ban?

376
00:25:34,171 --> 00:25:36,042
She calls him Ban, not Gae Ban.

377
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:40,872
My lady.

378
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:43,512
Please calm down.

379
00:25:49,122 --> 00:25:50,681
I already told you...

380
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:53,122
that she has not been feeling well all day.

381
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:55,562
Right?

382
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:58,832
Yesterday, you were also bedridden.

383
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,231
You were not feeling well, and Lord Jung was worried.

384
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,872
Yes, that is true.

385
00:26:11,171 --> 00:26:12,241
Anyway, what should we do?

386
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,012
The physician seems to have more questions to ask you.

387
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:16,981
Could he carry on?

388
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,752
Or should I request that he leaves?

389
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:24,721
I should rest.

390
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,491
Lady Hyo Yeon, you still have not answered my question.

391
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:31,092
What happened yesterday?

392
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,461
What is this ruckus I hear?

393
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:36,161
How dare you question her without my approval?

394
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,532
Leave this instant!

395
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:46,471
Physician Yoo.

396
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:51,512
I must apologize.

397
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:54,151
Gae Ban never behaved properly.

398
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:56,451
I am afraid that thinking of him...

399
00:26:56,752 --> 00:26:58,022
upset the lady.

400
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:00,092
Is that why Lord Jung...

401
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:01,491
I am afraid so.

402
00:27:04,161 --> 00:27:05,691
This is for only you to hear,

403
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:08,802
but Lord Jung did suspect...

404
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:10,832
that Gae Ban had the audacity to develop romantic feelings...

405
00:27:12,532 --> 00:27:14,572
for Lady Hyo Yeon.

406
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:17,372
Is that true?

407
00:27:22,582 --> 00:27:24,241
Of course not.

408
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:27,352
We will be back.

409
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,451
With deer antler tonic that will replenish her energy.

410
00:27:31,022 --> 00:27:32,491
I am afraid that Lord Jung...

411
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:35,191
has banned you from entering the residence.

412
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:38,792
Good night.

413
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:43,131
I hope you did not forget how you were open to the idea...

414
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:49,671
of a master female physician treating the young lady.

415
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:00,052
If such a person existed,

416
00:28:00,352 --> 00:28:02,221
I would gladly pay a hefty sum.

417
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:08,461
The boar killed a man!

418
00:28:08,592 --> 00:28:11,592
The boar killed a man!

419
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:13,191
- Of course not. - The boar...

420
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,792
- killed a man! - He could not harm anyone.

421
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:16,631
Man Bok...

422
00:28:16,631 --> 00:28:19,302
mourned the ant he killed while chopping firewood.

423
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:22,872
Him and his fragile heart. He must be crying his eyes out.

424
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:25,002
They arrested the wrong man.

425
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:27,171
He will soon be back whining for more food.

426
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,842
And complaining about the side dishes.

427
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:34,612
What happened? You said you would soon have him back!

428
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:38,381
It seems impossible.

429
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:42,891
None of this would have happened...

430
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:45,792
had you eaten the rabbit as told.

431
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:48,802
Darn it.

432
00:28:53,072 --> 00:28:55,802
Physician Yoo. May I have a word?

433
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:03,381
The way to save Man Bok...

434
00:29:04,012 --> 00:29:05,481
is to get to Lady Hyo Yeon.

435
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:09,122
And there is only one way...

436
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,522
to get her to speak.

437
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:16,522
It is for me to become a physician who mastered a medical script.

438
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:23,931
I hope you did not forget how you were open to the idea...

439
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:28,401
of a master female physician treating the young lady.

440
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:32,211
What you said to the young nobleman...

441
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:34,911
meant you would help in person.

442
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:41,552
But it takes a long time to master a medical script.

443
00:29:42,052 --> 00:29:44,451
Man Bok will be executed before then.

444
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:49,721
Physician Yoo.

445
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,991
You can never accomplish...

446
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,961
what you do not try.

447
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:56,901
Mencius...

448
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,731
He said that studying...

449
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:03,941
If you have begun to learn,

450
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:05,711
do not give up until you are well-learned.

451
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:07,612
"Doctrine of the Mean", chapter 20.

452
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:12,552
Very well.

453
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:16,052
We shall try.

454
00:30:18,552 --> 00:30:21,752
But medicine is much more difficult than the texts of Confucianism.

455
00:30:22,062 --> 00:30:23,961
The training will be hard.

456
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:25,391
Yes. It should be.

457
00:30:29,802 --> 00:30:30,802
We will start with these.

458
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,131
I do not plan to sleep.

459
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,872
I will let you sleep.

460
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:37,901
My cramming lecture...

461
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:40,211
will help you memorize faster than anyone.

462
00:30:42,681 --> 00:30:44,512
Medical texts say that...

463
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:46,312
based on general shape,

464
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,582
it is better to be thin than fat.

465
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:51,552
A bright complexion is better than a yellow one.

466
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:53,951
Each person must be treated differently.

467
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,062
Gokji.

468
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,461
(Gokji)

469
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:03,631
Where is Susamri?

470
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:05,201
Here.

471
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,002
Find Habgok.

472
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:08,002
(Habgok)

473
00:31:09,141 --> 00:31:10,141
Well done.

474
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:16,381
This is a drawing of the 12 Hard Pulses.

475
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:18,981
You should be able to memorize this...

476
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:21,082
before the sun sets today.

477
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:26,221
This is the body and its organs.

478
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,191
This is what is inside of us.

479
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:31,721
Each human body is like that of a nation.

480
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:34,661
When a heart does not function properly,

481
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,161
it threatens your life,

482
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:39,532
so you must be careful and cautious.

483
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:44,302
Good.

484
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:51,812
Okay.

485
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:55,852
There are many ways to get through each season.

486
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,151
In spring and summer, sleep late and wake early.

487
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:01,891
In the autumn months, sleep and wake early.

488
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:10,562
Raw and dried.

489
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:14,131
The black, dried jihyang herb is the same as the white raw one.

490
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:15,302
Pick up the black one.

491
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:20,512
It is made by juicing...

492
00:32:20,512 --> 00:32:22,012
and then drying raw jihyang.

493
00:32:22,312 --> 00:32:25,012
If you do that until it is very dark and shiny,

494
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:26,082
it is ready.

495
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:29,681
Black jihyang is sweet...

496
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,082
and tasty.

497
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:34,391
Young Master...

498
00:32:38,421 --> 00:32:39,431
I wonder...

499
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,562
if Man Bok gets any sleep.

500
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:47,002
He does snore as soon as his head hits the pillow,

501
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:49,471
but he is picky about clothes.

502
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,512
Whenever I would throw anything on to go out,

503
00:32:55,112 --> 00:32:57,681
he would touch it up for me saying people would gossip.

504
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:05,421
Is that why what you have been wearing recently looks oddly...

505
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:09,562
Do I not look good enough?

506
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:13,792
We must try to get Man Bok out.

507
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:18,032
Yangge, Yangji, Yanggok.

508
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,872
Find them.

509
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:28,641
Yangge, Yangji, Yanggok.

510
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:37,551
Man Bok will be healthy and fine.

511
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:43,861
You might find it strange,

512
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,491
but to me,

513
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:48,761
he is my only family.

514
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:51,801
Where is Onyu?

515
00:33:58,071 --> 00:34:01,042
Do you not have any siblings?

516
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:04,982
No. I have no siblings,

517
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,281
and my mother is deceased.

518
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,882
My father too...

519
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:18,991
Now,

520
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:21,792
Man Bok is all I have left.

521
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:27,931
Eat a few more.

522
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:35,272
Are you taking pity on me?

523
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:38,442
Where is Joktonggok?

524
00:34:44,152 --> 00:34:45,152
Somewhere here.

525
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,431
Lady Hyo Yeon is a lot like you.

526
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:56,361
Me?

527
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:57,801
Yes.

528
00:34:59,172 --> 00:35:00,172
I mean...

529
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,801
you from the past.

530
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:09,582
You both looked like you stood all alone in the world.

531
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:14,451
Is it not strange?

532
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,082
Her betrothed cares for her dreadfully,

533
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,951
and her father thinks the world of her.

534
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:23,161
But she looked like she had no one.

535
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:26,891
No.

536
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:30,632
I think she is more like you.

537
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:35,471
How so?

538
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:38,872
The determined look in your eyes to save Man Bok.

539
00:35:39,911 --> 00:35:43,181
I saw the similar look in Lady Hyo Yeon's.

540
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:46,411
Ban...

541
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:50,321
Ban...

542
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:54,122
What are you saying?

543
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:56,761
Poong.

544
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,062
Poong...

545
00:36:07,272 --> 00:36:08,272
Poong.

546
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,111
What kind of feel is that?

547
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:27,792
Why did Lady Hyo Yeon say "Ban" instead of "Gae Ban"?

548
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,431
The records say Man Bok is the killer.

549
00:36:40,402 --> 00:36:42,031
A slave living at Gyesoo Clinic?

550
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:43,801
There is nothing to consider.

551
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:46,011
A lowly fool killed a man.

552
00:36:46,011 --> 00:36:47,172
He must be executed.

553
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:50,712
My daughter's betrothed brought this from Qing.

554
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:52,781
It is very valuable,

555
00:36:52,781 --> 00:36:54,551
so keep it safe at home.

556
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:55,681
Qing?

557
00:36:57,352 --> 00:37:00,252
There is an ongoing investigation into my slave's death,

558
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:01,591
and it is a headache.

559
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,192
I would like the case to be closed soon.

560
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,692
I will take care of that for you.

561
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:11,201
They do say you are more efficient...

562
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:13,872
than the frustrating district governor.

563
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:15,801
The investigation is not yet over.

564
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,372
There are many suspicious circumstances.

565
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:19,372
District Governor.

566
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:23,241
Did you not hear the court wants those who cause unrest punished?

567
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,181
We need not waste time...

568
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:27,281
on the lives of two lowly slaves.

569
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:28,281
Three days.

570
00:37:30,252 --> 00:37:32,181
If you do not find new proof by then,

571
00:37:32,181 --> 00:37:33,522
I will carry out the execution.

572
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,422
I focus only on records.

573
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,692
They say the man we have is guilty,

574
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:39,692
and that is that.

575
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,531
(Gyesoo Clinic)

576
00:38:03,321 --> 00:38:04,321
Is it a special day?

577
00:38:04,622 --> 00:38:05,991
What is all this food?

578
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:08,692
I am making Gongjindan.

579
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:11,122
Man Bok must eat well in prison.

580
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,132
We are cooking him some food.

581
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:15,931
With his appetite,

582
00:38:16,602 --> 00:38:18,062
prison food will not be enough.

583
00:38:19,571 --> 00:38:21,372
Rice balls for the boar.

584
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:25,542
Should you not stuff it with some flavouring?

585
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:27,071
It has to keep,

586
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,641
so it is seasoned only with salt and sesame oil.

587
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,341
Anything else will go bad.

588
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:34,082
You do not know as you were never locked up.

589
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:38,422
Lady Namhae, have you been to prison?

590
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:40,252
I killed my ex-husband.

591
00:38:42,562 --> 00:38:43,562
Me too.

592
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,422
What?

593
00:38:45,732 --> 00:38:46,991
Really?

594
00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:49,232
I have never even been married before.

595
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:54,031
People often ask her to cook food for those in prison.

596
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:58,872
Everyone is doing this for Man Bok. How thoughtful.

597
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:00,172
What can I do to help?

598
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:01,172
Here.

599
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,942
- Wrap this up. - Got it.

600
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,511
Thank you all.

601
00:39:06,551 --> 00:39:09,321
But these look as though they were made for a banquet.

602
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:12,692
He said he needed those for something.

603
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:14,422
Who said that?

604
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:17,321
I asked her to make those.

605
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,732
You said you would go back to Lord Jung's residence.

606
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:25,832
What is with that face?

607
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,482
You must leave at once.

608
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:39,712
Lord Jung will really kill me this time.

609
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:44,221
Come on. See what we brought before you turn us away.

610
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,422
Once you see it, you will hate to let it go to waste.

611
00:39:46,692 --> 00:39:48,122
Forget it.

612
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:50,761
If I let you in, they will eat what you brought at my funeral.

613
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,161
We are here on official business.

614
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,971
Is that so?

615
00:39:59,971 --> 00:40:01,272
You said that last time too.

616
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:05,071
All right, then. Return safely.

617
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:09,442
This was sent by the government. If you let this go to waste...

618
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:15,852
The government?

619
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:18,922
Yes, there will be problems if you turn us away.

620
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:21,152
Rumour has it that Lord Jung's daughter who is soon to be wed...

621
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,321
is having some health issues.

622
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,431
The royal inspector dispatched by His Majesty the King...

623
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:28,792
ordered to have the food sent to Lord Jung's residence.

624
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:31,062
What do we do? Should we just leave?

625
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:33,832
No, wait. Do not leave.

626
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,841
If that is the case, I will ask Lord Jung...

627
00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:39,872
as soon as he is back, so please wait a few moments.

628
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:43,042
Then let us do this.

629
00:40:43,212 --> 00:40:45,852
Physician Yoo and I will wait outside...

630
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:49,652
while our cook goes in to drop off the food quickly.

631
00:40:59,661 --> 00:41:01,632
You are not allowed to bring food...

632
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:03,562
to criminals arrested for murder.

633
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:04,861
He is not a murderer.

634
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:07,701
You have been a constable for years, yet you are still so slow-witted.

635
00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:08,971
Did you catch him?

636
00:41:08,971 --> 00:41:11,602
Oh, dear. Everyone who works here is in cahoots together.

637
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:15,272
What is it?

638
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,111
How brutal.

639
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:20,152
You are playing dumb...

640
00:41:20,152 --> 00:41:21,482
after killing a man with an axe.

641
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:22,821
No, that is not true.

642
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:25,721
I swear, I never killed anyone.

643
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:27,051
I am telling you the truth!

644
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,122
No, you are lying.

645
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:33,462
You will be beheaded in just three days.

646
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,562
You know what it means, right?

647
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:38,562
They will chop your head off.

648
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:43,841
What is this about?

649
00:41:44,442 --> 00:41:48,911
He is my family. Threaten him once more, and we will have problems.

650
00:41:49,411 --> 00:41:50,882
What will you do?

651
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,911
What? Do you still think you are a well-respected physician...

652
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,752
in the Medical Office?

653
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:02,451
Do not run your mouth like that.

654
00:42:02,761 --> 00:42:04,261
Come on.

655
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:08,332
You could not get off your high horse even in the Palace,

656
00:42:08,332 --> 00:42:09,962
so you got fired.

657
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:12,102
Shut your mouth!

658
00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:13,471
Oh, right.

659
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:16,942
Will you split his stomach open too when he dies?

660
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:19,511
The loony of the Medical Office.

661
00:42:19,511 --> 00:42:21,741
Physician Gye the Quack!

662
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,611
You scoundrel!

663
00:42:25,141 --> 00:42:27,252
I will make sure you cannot walk ever again.

664
00:42:27,252 --> 00:42:28,411
You know about my acupuncture skills.

665
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:32,652
Oh, I am so very scared. Of course, I know all about it.

666
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:36,062
Even the woman you loved...

667
00:42:36,491 --> 00:42:37,891
died because of your magical skills.

668
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:46,801
Ip Bun, you are all grown up now.

669
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:48,571
Do you remember your mother's face?

670
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:02,212
You said you would just drop it off and leave.

671
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,221
Why are you cooking up a storm?

672
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:06,792
Then what? Let Lord Jung eat cold food?

673
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,352
Then the royal inspector...

674
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:12,161
No. What if the King arrests and interrogates me?

675
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:13,991
Even so, this is...

676
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:19,301
It is good.

677
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:21,772
It is delicious.

678
00:43:22,272 --> 00:43:23,872
But can I eat this?

679
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:26,011
Yes, it is fine.

680
00:43:26,011 --> 00:43:27,071
Eat as much as you want.

681
00:43:28,741 --> 00:43:31,611
A servant sure understands how other servants feel.

682
00:43:31,982 --> 00:43:33,681
I know how hard you all work.

683
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:35,652
That is why I made extra food.

684
00:43:35,652 --> 00:43:37,852
Go bring everyone!

685
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:38,922
Okay.

686
00:44:17,692 --> 00:44:19,891
- One moment. - Oh, my.

687
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:22,761
- She flipped it! - Wait a moment.

688
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:26,701
This tastes best when it is hot. Stay put and wait.

689
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:32,728
You cannot do this.

690
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:36,369
You promised me that you would let me keep the geomungo.

691
00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:44,708
Once we get married next month,

692
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:47,639
you will have to look after the household as my wife,

693
00:44:48,509 --> 00:44:51,708
so you cannot keep playing the geomungo.

694
00:44:53,378 --> 00:44:54,679
This...

695
00:44:56,588 --> 00:44:58,248
I cannot give up.

696
00:45:12,228 --> 00:45:15,799
Do not talk back to me from now on.

697
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:20,309
Answer me.

698
00:45:21,338 --> 00:45:22,409
Answer me!

699
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:27,119
Okay.

700
00:45:35,688 --> 00:45:37,188
Once you become my wife,

701
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:40,829
you will have to do your best to always look elegant and beautiful.

702
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:43,628
Do you like this?

703
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:45,929
But...

704
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,199
after such a tragic incident,

705
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,509
I cannot wear such a bright colour.

706
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:52,938
A tragic incident?

707
00:45:54,009 --> 00:45:55,909
What are you talking about?

708
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:00,179
Ban...

709
00:46:03,288 --> 00:46:05,949
I mean, Gae Ban is dead.

710
00:46:05,949 --> 00:46:07,958
So what? It has nothing to do with us.

711
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:14,128
That day, you did not go anywhere.

712
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:18,068
You did not do anything. Am I wrong?

713
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:23,108
It is okay.

714
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:25,708
Everything is okay.

715
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:27,878
Lady Hyo Yeon.

716
00:46:29,038 --> 00:46:31,608
The daenggi truly suits you.

717
00:47:09,989 --> 00:47:12,049
Oh, is this okay?

718
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:14,989
We have no choice.

719
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:18,559
You do anything and everything to help your patients.

720
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:22,128
I must do something to find evidence.

721
00:47:24,068 --> 00:47:25,329
We ought to save Man Bok.

722
00:47:28,398 --> 00:47:29,639
Yes, we must.

723
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:31,309
We must save him.

724
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:43,318
But what are you looking for?

725
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:02,329
Master Jung.

726
00:49:04,029 --> 00:49:05,728
You should try these.

727
00:49:08,068 --> 00:49:09,068
Of course.

728
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:12,438
I would have headed to the kitchen myself.

729
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:14,009
I apologize for inconveniencing you.

730
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:17,549
This little man kept sending me after you...

731
00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:19,248
so that you could taste these.

732
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:21,049
Are they not delicious?

733
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:22,049
They are.

734
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:44,309
I found it.

735
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:48,279
This...

736
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:50,148
This is Gae Ban's identity tag.

737
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:52,679
But his name...

738
00:49:53,648 --> 00:49:55,378
is Ban, not Gae Ban.

739
00:49:56,248 --> 00:49:58,389
That is correct, and the meaning of it...

740
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:01,418
is friend and partner.

741
00:50:04,228 --> 00:50:06,429
(Ban)

742
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:12,599
Young Master, my gosh.

743
00:50:15,768 --> 00:50:17,538
Why are you here...

744
00:50:17,538 --> 00:50:19,538
and not at the clinic seeing patients?

745
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:25,878
They were treated to perfection...

746
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:28,318
and were sent home.

747
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:30,788
Which is what I would expect from Joseon's best physician.

748
00:50:30,788 --> 00:50:32,188
Once you are able to perform acupuncture again...

749
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:37,389
I apologize.

750
00:50:42,759 --> 00:50:43,768
Goodness.

751
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:46,128
If you were going to visit,

752
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:47,668
you could have brought me some rice balls.

753
00:50:47,668 --> 00:50:50,369
Even after all these years, you are still dense.

754
00:50:51,108 --> 00:50:52,938
That never crossed my mind.

755
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:00,978
My goodness.

756
00:51:02,248 --> 00:51:04,248
You are the best. Thank you.

757
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:15,958
Young Master.

758
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:18,299
Once I die,

759
00:51:19,128 --> 00:51:21,099
please have me buried.

760
00:51:22,338 --> 00:51:23,338
Those words of weakness!

761
00:51:23,768 --> 00:51:25,438
I said I would not let you die.

762
00:51:25,668 --> 00:51:29,509
Lowly beings like me die when misfortune finds us...

763
00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:30,949
and get discarded.

764
00:51:30,949 --> 00:51:33,918
Please know that I do not even dream of having a grave.

765
00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:36,179
All I want is to be buried.

766
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:40,989
The dead manservant was thrown out, was he not?

767
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:46,998
Lord have mercy on him and guide his soul to a better place.

768
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:50,599
I do not wish to cross paths with his resentful spirit.

769
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:06,208
This is the place.

770
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:08,378
In about 15 days,

771
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:10,648
the wild animals will have fed on him.

772
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,958
A person died,

773
00:52:17,989 --> 00:52:19,188
and this is how was he treated?

774
00:52:20,128 --> 00:52:21,128
He is of lowly origin.

775
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:31,838
Sin Woo.

776
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:33,009
Eun Woo?

777
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:35,838
How are you here?

778
00:52:37,878 --> 00:52:39,179
How long have you waited?

779
00:52:40,248 --> 00:52:41,748
I had a question to ask.

780
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:44,688
Is the sentence being handed out quickly...

781
00:52:44,688 --> 00:52:46,989
because it is a case of a slave killing another slave?

782
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:52,659
It would have been the same had their origins been different.

783
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:54,898
All I do is make the ruling.

784
00:52:55,228 --> 00:52:57,529
And that is based on the evidence collected.

785
00:52:58,429 --> 00:53:00,699
Could you please have the sentencing pushed back?

786
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:01,969
How can he be framed as a killer...

787
00:53:01,969 --> 00:53:04,168
for being found next to the body...

788
00:53:04,168 --> 00:53:05,739
when there is no motive?

789
00:53:07,538 --> 00:53:09,838
The motive might be a mystery, but there is enough evidence.

790
00:53:11,549 --> 00:53:12,809
Also, I cannot delay the ruling...

791
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:14,049
since the royal court has already been informed.

792
00:53:14,779 --> 00:53:16,989
Unless there is new evidence that contradicts the findings.

793
00:53:18,219 --> 00:53:19,688
Why must it be rushed?

794
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:22,759
Maybe I should request that you live among these quarters instead.

795
00:53:23,389 --> 00:53:25,029
You should not get involved in dangerous events...

796
00:53:25,029 --> 00:53:26,659
with that young physician.

797
00:53:28,659 --> 00:53:29,728
Eun Woo,

798
00:53:30,768 --> 00:53:32,599
you have always had a cheerful spirit.

799
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:41,509
Sin Woo,

800
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:44,349
no one is born with one personality.

801
00:53:48,279 --> 00:53:49,349
Good night, then.

802
00:54:07,668 --> 00:54:09,168
One, two, three.

803
00:54:41,038 --> 00:54:43,668
Lady Hyo Yeon, we are from Gyesoo Village.

804
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:46,838
The physicians to be exact.

805
00:54:47,009 --> 00:54:48,208
We shall enter.

806
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:57,349
Her left Gwan pulse is thready.

807
00:54:58,219 --> 00:55:00,588
It skips a beat from time to time as well.

808
00:55:02,659 --> 00:55:05,788
Her fatigued heart is causing her hand tremors.

809
00:55:06,588 --> 00:55:08,858
We will rejuvenate her energy with needle moxibustion...

810
00:55:08,858 --> 00:55:10,299
and have her consume a herbal tonic.

811
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:13,228
Maybe you can perform acupuncture next time.

812
00:55:15,768 --> 00:55:16,768
Sure.

813
00:55:28,478 --> 00:55:30,849
Do you know how to perform acupuncture?

814
00:55:33,889 --> 00:55:34,889
Of course.

815
00:55:36,188 --> 00:55:39,688
Have you always been a skilled physician?

816
00:55:44,898 --> 00:55:45,969
I envy you.

817
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:49,469
No one is born with a skill.

818
00:55:49,969 --> 00:55:52,869
In life, we choose what we wish to do...

819
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:54,438
and have it come true.

820
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:58,248
I have only recently started to practice medicine.

821
00:56:00,449 --> 00:56:01,518
We request...

822
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,119
that you accompany us to a place.

823
00:56:26,268 --> 00:56:28,409
We found this at Gae Ban's quarters.

824
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:30,648
(Ban)

825
00:56:30,648 --> 00:56:32,349
Is this his identity tag?

826
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:37,688
Ban.

827
00:56:38,188 --> 00:56:40,219
It means friend, companion,

828
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:42,759
and partner.

829
00:56:45,389 --> 00:56:48,529
Gae Ban which is the name he was given must have meant...

830
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:50,799
"dog food."

831
00:56:51,429 --> 00:56:53,869
My guess is that Lord Jung named him that way...

832
00:56:54,338 --> 00:56:56,199
as he threw out food for him to eat.

833
00:57:02,038 --> 00:57:03,849
There you go.

834
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:07,378
As of today, I will name you Gae Ban...

835
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:09,518
as in dog food.

836
00:57:11,418 --> 00:57:13,989
Rather than calling him the same way,

837
00:57:14,259 --> 00:57:16,659
you called him "Ban."

838
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:17,858
(Ban)

839
00:57:21,329 --> 00:57:22,699
This is your name.

840
00:57:26,228 --> 00:57:27,998
A good friend.

841
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:30,099
Is that not what it means?

842
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:32,768
He was the friend you grew up with.

843
00:57:35,608 --> 00:57:37,148
Lady Eun Woo assumed...

844
00:57:38,279 --> 00:57:40,719
that a friend helped him...

845
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:43,148
receive his identity tag.

846
00:57:44,449 --> 00:57:45,489
Was she right?

847
00:57:55,329 --> 00:57:58,568
(Ban)

848
00:58:03,139 --> 00:58:04,239
Ban.

849
00:58:08,608 --> 00:58:09,809
I am sorry.

850
00:58:14,378 --> 00:58:15,579
I am sorry.

851
00:58:35,139 --> 00:58:36,139
I...

852
00:58:37,168 --> 00:58:38,608
remember now.

853
00:58:40,038 --> 00:58:41,708
When Ban died,

854
00:58:44,409 --> 00:58:46,179
I was there.

855
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:49,279
It is possible...

856
00:58:51,588 --> 00:58:53,389
that I might have killed him.

857
00:58:57,588 --> 00:58:59,759
I will tell all at the magistrate's office.

858
00:59:00,659 --> 00:59:02,228
Give me just one day.

859
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:15,509
My lady, I am glad you have recovered,

860
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:19,949
but how am I to live if you were to fall ill again?

861
00:59:21,748 --> 00:59:22,978
Come home with me.

862
00:59:22,978 --> 00:59:25,188
Lady Hyo Yeon has something to say.

863
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:26,688
Let it go.

864
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,418
A man's life depends on it.

865
00:59:28,418 --> 00:59:31,728
I care more for my future wife than the life of a slave.

866
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:35,259
And yet you treat your future wife like she is your lowly sacrifice?

867
00:59:40,438 --> 00:59:41,568
Physician.

868
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:45,168
Did you say "lowly sacrifice"?

869
00:59:46,469 --> 00:59:48,378
Your lowly slave...

870
00:59:48,378 --> 00:59:50,509
strangled and killed my lowly slave.

871
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:53,679
You must compensate us for it.

872
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:57,549
You are stirring things up because you have no money for that.

873
00:59:58,088 --> 00:59:59,288
What a pity.

874
01:00:04,628 --> 01:00:07,429
Come with me. Now.

875
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:19,268
Please keep your word, my lady.

876
01:00:35,989 --> 01:00:36,989
Down.

877
01:00:44,529 --> 01:00:47,268
Why is everyone moping?

878
01:00:48,139 --> 01:00:50,369
No one is dead yet.

879
01:00:51,768 --> 01:00:53,438
What are you here for?

880
01:00:53,438 --> 01:00:56,279
You do not know? I came over in a litter...

881
01:00:56,279 --> 01:00:58,279
to get on your nerves and infuriate you.

882
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:01,748
Have you heard?

883
01:01:01,978 --> 01:01:03,719
The executioner from the village over...

884
01:01:05,049 --> 01:01:07,659
is busy sharpening his blade.

885
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:11,728
Come to the magistrate's office between 5 and 7pm...

886
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:13,929
and collect the fool's head.

887
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:15,199
You...

888
01:01:19,869 --> 01:01:21,099
What is that for?

889
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:25,068
You demented old hag. Do you have a death wish?

890
01:01:25,969 --> 01:01:29,239
I relayed the good news to you.

891
01:01:29,909 --> 01:01:30,978
Now I shall leave.

892
01:01:32,549 --> 01:01:33,849
Do not see me off.

893
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:41,219
Goodbye.

894
01:01:47,759 --> 01:01:50,398
Will she come to the magistrate's office?

895
01:01:51,299 --> 01:01:54,898
All we can do is trust her and wait.

896
01:01:55,469 --> 01:01:57,909
Trust her and wait for what?

897
01:01:58,608 --> 01:02:01,878
You two are too naive and sweet for your own good.

898
01:02:01,978 --> 01:02:04,378
Poong and the young lady?

899
01:02:04,509 --> 01:02:05,708
No.

900
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:14,018
(Gae Ban)

901

(Gil Soo)

902
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:19,329
Prescribe the best of medicinal herbs.

903
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:20,529
(Hyo Yeon)

904
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,458
I was there.

905
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:24,998
What are you doing to your master?

906
01:02:25,668 --> 01:02:28,268
Yesterday, you were also bedridden.

907
01:02:28,268 --> 01:02:29,799
Do you wish to die?

908
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:31,268
I might have killed him.

909
01:02:31,268 --> 01:02:32,909
I did not kill anyone.

910
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,108
(Gae Ban)

911
01:02:35,438 --> 01:02:37,248
(We shall protect Man Bok and Hyo Yeon)

912
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:42,719
That is what we have so far.

913
01:02:42,818 --> 01:02:46,518
Then we can just tell the magistrate that Lady Hyo Yeon did it.

914
01:02:46,818 --> 01:02:48,559
You said she said so.

915
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:51,159
Do you think she really killed Gae Ban?

916
01:02:52,429 --> 01:02:54,829
Would she have if they were like siblings?

917
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:58,998
But then, Gae Ban was rebellious, unlike a slave.

918
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:02,869
Then did he molest her out of love?

919
01:03:03,498 --> 01:03:05,038
Come on.

920
01:03:05,038 --> 01:03:07,938
Do not turn it into a crass love story.

921
01:03:07,938 --> 01:03:11,378
Both Gae Ban and the handsome young man love her.

922
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:15,949
She did not look strong enough to hold a hatchet.

923
01:03:16,279 --> 01:03:19,549
He was strangled with twine, not killed with a hatchet,

924
01:03:19,918 --> 01:03:21,818
so it does not look impossible.

925
01:03:22,188 --> 01:03:24,759
What? He was not killed by a hatchet?

926
01:03:25,529 --> 01:03:28,099
Everyone in the market believes so.

927
01:03:28,228 --> 01:03:31,398
Man Bok has strong, muscly arms,

928
01:03:31,398 --> 01:03:33,429
and people who thought he could kill...

929
01:03:33,429 --> 01:03:35,538
are saying he eventually did.

930
01:03:38,909 --> 01:03:42,478
The officials never announced the cause of death.

931
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:46,478
They would just let people talk as they pleased.

932
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:51,288
(We shall protect Man Bok and Hyo Yeon)

933
01:03:51,889 --> 01:03:53,018
Then...

934
01:03:54,889 --> 01:03:56,418
how did Master Gil Soo know?

935
01:03:57,288 --> 01:03:58,889
Your lowly slave...

936
01:03:58,889 --> 01:04:02,199
strangled and killed my lowly slave.

937
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:05,268
He knew the fact that...

938
01:04:05,869 --> 01:04:07,438
Gae Ban was strangled.

939
01:04:13,909 --> 01:04:15,279
Let us catch the killer.

940
01:04:17,878 --> 01:04:21,418
Let us catch the killer!

941
01:04:23,918 --> 01:04:24,949
What...

942
01:04:26,349 --> 01:04:28,219
Why are you here again?

943
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:29,588
Why would a physician visit?

944
01:04:29,588 --> 01:04:31,688
I am here to see if your lord is all right.

945
01:04:32,259 --> 01:04:33,489
My lord!

946
01:04:34,128 --> 01:04:35,829
What is this fuss about?

947
01:04:39,869 --> 01:04:41,469
I must see your daughter.

948
01:04:52,378 --> 01:04:53,849
We are too late.

949
01:04:56,119 --> 01:04:57,648
They left already.

950
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:03,958
Put up posters. The handsome fool is the killer.

951
01:05:04,389 --> 01:05:06,728
We have no time to hire an artist.

952
01:05:07,429 --> 01:05:09,228
Ip Bun can draw it.

953
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:13,568
I do not remember any features other than that he was handsome.

954
01:05:15,568 --> 01:05:17,568
Jang Gun remembers everything.

955
01:05:18,768 --> 01:05:22,509
Jang Gun. Did you not see his face?

956
01:05:27,818 --> 01:05:29,549
His eyes look more evil.

957
01:05:30,148 --> 01:05:31,219
No.

958
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:33,549
This does not look like him.

959
01:05:33,549 --> 01:05:35,259
Darn it.

960
01:05:37,659 --> 01:05:38,929
Not that either.

961
01:05:38,929 --> 01:05:40,958
It looks weird. This is not his face.

962
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:45,029
No.

963
01:05:51,369 --> 01:05:52,438
Good.

964
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:54,338
Yes, this is it.

965
01:05:54,338 --> 01:05:56,608
A little darker. Almost there.

966
01:05:57,239 --> 01:05:58,409
It is done.

967
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:01,679
- Good. - Good.

968
01:06:09,518 --> 01:06:12,559
My lady. We just have to cross this ridge.

969
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:15,628
I will make you happy for the rest of our lives.

970
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:17,699
Stay strong.

971
01:06:19,829 --> 01:06:23,438
Can you not just let me go?

972
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:27,108
Please.

973
01:06:29,378 --> 01:06:30,478
Come along.

974
01:06:37,349 --> 01:06:38,988
If you will let me go,

975
01:06:39,448 --> 01:06:41,418
I will not tell anyone.

976
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:46,429
You will not tell anyone?

977
01:06:47,429 --> 01:06:48,498
Tell what?

978
01:06:49,729 --> 01:06:52,198
You did not see anything.

979
01:06:57,408 --> 01:06:58,738
Are you crying?

980
01:07:01,338 --> 01:07:03,378
Why are you crying when this is all on you?

981
01:07:03,378 --> 01:07:06,349
This would not have happened if you did not play the geomungo.

982
01:07:06,408 --> 01:07:09,948
You made me look like this. Do you get that?

983
01:07:10,378 --> 01:07:13,389
I am barely refraining from killing you and you cry?

984
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:35,878
I apologize.

985
01:07:37,009 --> 01:07:40,208
I crossed the line. Forgive me.

986
01:07:41,578 --> 01:07:44,918
To me, you are my everything.

987
01:07:44,918 --> 01:07:46,088
You are my life.

988
01:07:47,588 --> 01:07:49,658
I do not fear death.

989
01:07:49,988 --> 01:07:51,288
What I fear is...

990
01:07:53,859 --> 01:07:55,328
not being able to see you.

991
01:07:56,128 --> 01:07:57,259
So please...

992
01:07:58,128 --> 01:07:59,628
Pull yourself together.

993
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:09,908
Have you seen this person?

994
01:08:14,679 --> 01:08:16,078
Have you seen these people?

995
01:08:16,248 --> 01:08:17,549
Have you seen these people?

996
01:08:17,549 --> 01:08:18,748
Take a look!

997
01:08:18,748 --> 01:08:19,849
Leave, will you?

998
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,658
- Hey! What is wrong with her? - Go away.

999
01:08:22,658 --> 01:08:24,229
This pretty young lady and...

1000
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:26,488
Take a good look. He has big, piercing eyes.

1001
01:08:27,389 --> 01:08:28,429
You really have not seen them?

1002
01:08:28,429 --> 01:08:30,359
- No, we have not. - No, we have not.

1003
01:08:48,679 --> 01:08:50,778
Hey, dunce!

1004
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,059
Someone saw Gil Soo on the way to Sorak Port.

1005
01:08:55,658 --> 01:08:58,828
Sorak Port? Many merchants from Qing frequent the port.

1006
01:08:58,828 --> 01:09:01,429
A ship from Qing arrives between 3 and 5pm on the 15th of each month.

1007
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:05,099
He used to import goods from Qing, so he must know.

1008
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,429
The 15th? That is today.

1009
01:09:06,868 --> 01:09:08,498
- What? - Between 3 and 5pm?

1010
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:10,639
Then we do not have time.

1011
01:09:15,578 --> 01:09:16,578
Sin Woo.

1012
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:19,748
We heard we could borrow horses and constables...

1013
01:09:19,748 --> 01:09:21,849
with the royal inspector's permission.

1014
01:09:21,849 --> 01:09:24,189
We cannot use our resources to help you with a personal matter.

1015
01:09:24,189 --> 01:09:26,549
We are doing this to make sure the law is implemented fairly.

1016
01:09:26,549 --> 01:09:27,859
This is not a personal matter.

1017
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:31,689
The real culprit is holding Lady Hyo Yeon hostage.

1018
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:33,189
The law must be obeyed.

1019
01:09:34,028 --> 01:09:35,599
I ought to follow the rules.

1020
01:09:36,429 --> 01:09:37,429
Please, Sin Woo.

1021
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:42,139
Please trust me.

1022
01:09:42,338 --> 01:09:43,599
He is the real culprit.

1023
01:09:43,599 --> 01:09:44,969
We must catch him at all costs.

1024
01:09:45,868 --> 01:09:47,238
If I am wrong,

1025
01:09:47,238 --> 01:09:48,809
I will gladly accept any punishment.

1026
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:53,549
Who do you think you are?

1027
01:09:54,979 --> 01:09:56,519
Even last time, everyone was shocked...

1028
01:09:56,519 --> 01:09:57,689
when you let the girl go into the woods.

1029
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:02,418
This is not about you being punished.

1030
01:10:02,618 --> 01:10:04,389
Someone's life depends on this.

1031
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:07,828
I cannot give up like this.

1032
01:10:09,429 --> 01:10:10,528
If you help us this time,

1033
01:10:10,929 --> 01:10:12,628
I will do anything you say.

1034
01:10:17,639 --> 01:10:18,639
By any chance,

1035
01:10:19,109 --> 01:10:20,939
do you know where Gae Ban's corpse is?

1036
01:10:47,569 --> 01:10:48,569
Get up.

1037
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:54,908
You said you were in a rush.

1038
01:10:55,538 --> 01:10:56,708
I will let you borrow a horse.

1039
01:11:01,019 --> 01:11:03,149
The execution will be carried out between 5 and 7 pm as planned.

1040
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:06,418
You must catch him and bring him to me before that.

1041
01:11:09,889 --> 01:11:12,059
Make way!

1042
01:11:12,328 --> 01:11:14,088
Make way!

1043
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:17,158
No, please...

1044
01:11:17,158 --> 01:11:18,168
- Man Bok. - Man Bok.

1045
01:11:18,328 --> 01:11:19,498
My gosh.

1046
01:11:19,498 --> 01:11:21,899
- Help me, please. - Man Bok.

1047
01:11:21,899 --> 01:11:23,338
- Man Bok. - Save me.

1048
01:11:23,338 --> 01:11:24,609
Man Bok.

1049
01:11:26,639 --> 01:11:27,738
Man Bok!

1050
01:11:43,288 --> 01:11:44,288
I will be back soon.

1051
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:51,799
What? You even know how to ride a horse?

1052
01:11:51,799 --> 01:11:53,599
We do not have time. We must hurry.

1053
01:12:41,979 --> 01:12:44,988
(Yoo Se Yeob)

1054
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:11,979
Stop!

1055
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:13,549
- All of you, back off! - Stop.

1056
01:13:13,549 --> 01:13:15,748
Young Master!

1057
01:13:15,748 --> 01:13:17,418
I suppose you have managed to find Yoo Se Yeob.

1058
01:13:17,418 --> 01:13:18,418
Kill him.

1059
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:21,488
I will uncover all the hidden secrets...

1060
01:13:21,488 --> 01:13:23,189
and survive at all costs.

1061
01:13:23,519 --> 01:13:24,788
Visual hallucinations?

1062
01:13:24,788 --> 01:13:26,689
Has this ever happened before?

1063
01:13:26,689 --> 01:13:29,158
A bruise and another wound.

1064
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:30,229
Who hit him?

1065
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:31,299
I have a question.

1066
01:13:31,299 --> 01:13:32,569
- Ma'am! - You see,

1067
01:13:32,569 --> 01:13:35,069
you are awfully slow-witted.

1068
01:13:35,368 --> 01:13:38,309
I told you to stay away from the physician.

1069
01:13:38,668 --> 01:13:39,868
I must save him.

1070
01:13:39,868 --> 01:13:42,609
That is why you said you would make a house call.

1071
01:13:42,738 --> 01:13:43,878
You will help me, right?
