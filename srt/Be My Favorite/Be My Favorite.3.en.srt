4

If you want to hit on Pear,

5
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:18,021
the first thing you need is the guts to talk to her.

6
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:20,522
Is this seat taken?

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,665
No.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,715
You can take it, Kawi.

9
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:24,051
I reserved a table at 5.

10
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:27,160
After you told her the truth, I’ll sneak out

11
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:28,899
and let you two talk privately.

12
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:30,400
Thanks.

13
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:32,056
I like it so much, Kawi.

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,254
Kawi,

15
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:29,560
why don’t I see you at all?

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,891
I have work to do every day.

17
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,525
But I’m planning to reduce it.

18
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,305
I want more time to make friends with people.

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,096
That’s great

20
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:42,523
because I want to know you better.

21
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:52,666
Let me get you this.

22
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,602
Sure.

23
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:57,959
Here.

24
00:01:58,515 --> 00:02:00,849
Okay. Thank you, sir.

25
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:01,842
Do I need to give you back?

26
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:03,280
You can.

27
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:06,814
What university activities are you doing now?

28
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:08,384
A lot.

29
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:11,577
You can join me if you want.

30
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:12,641
I will be so awkward.

31
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:14,186
You won’t.

32
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:15,366
You want this too?

33
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,190
Sure.

34
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:19,183
Eat lots of fruits, Kawi.

35
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:19,880
Roger that.

36
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:39,400
[Pisaeng: I’m taking off. Already took care of the meal. You don’t have to pay.]

37
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:43,801
[Kawi: Are you really not coming back?]

38
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:49,577
Kawi.

39
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:51,228
Huh?

40
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:52,154
What is it?

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,827
Pisaeng messaged me saying he needed to leave early

42
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:00,555
and we could continue.

43
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:14,379
But we ordered so much food.

44
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,624
We can’t finish all these. Let me invite a friend.

45
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:20,426
Hello, Kwan.

46
00:03:20,956 --> 00:03:22,249
What are you doing?

47
00:03:22,673 --> 00:03:23,848
Want to eat with us?

48
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:25,683
At the same place.

49
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:32,868
Kwan is joining us.

50
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,759
Don’t you have a date with Pear tonight?

51
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:44,802
Why are you here with us?

52
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,410
How many times have I told you?

53
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:48,906
Pear and I aren’t a thing.

54
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:50,905
Stop saying anything like that.

55
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,764
I don’t want people to get the wrong idea.

56
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:55,000
You guys, too.

57
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:00,548
Can I have her then?

58
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,621
I’ve always had eyes for Pear.

59
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,622
I just don’t want to step on your toes.

60
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:14,287
You can try hitting on her.

61
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:18,805
Are you sure you don’t want her?

62
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,800
Or did you already do her and not like it?

63
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
I’m warning you one last time, Not.

64
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,927
Don’t say things like that about Pear ever again.

65
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:32,098
What the hell is wrong with you?

66
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,360
How do you get home, Kawi?

67
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,444
Want to ride with us?

68
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:55,000
Ah, that’s all right.

69
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,439
I don’t think there’s enough room.

70
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:58,055
My dorm is just nearby.

71
00:04:58,055 --> 00:04:59,136
I’ll walk there.

72
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:00,955
Okay.

73
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:04,120
Let’s have a meal together again next time.

74
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:05,407
Um.

75
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,399
Bye-bye.

76
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:07,904
Bye.

77
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:18,232
So?

78
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:19,841
Disappointed, huh?

79
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:22,390
You were hyped up thinking you’d have a date with Pisaeng.

80
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:24,857
Exactly.

81
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:26,804
How did things turn out like this?

82
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,564
[Pisaeng]

83
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:52,971
I was just going to call you.

84
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:53,931
Where are you?

85
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:55,580
I sent Pear off.

86
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:56,642
Are you hungry?

87
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:05,290
Let’s eat!

88
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:12,255
Didn’t you just have a meal with Pear?

89
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:15,081
Come on.

90
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:18,000
I couldn’t eat a lot in front of her, could I?

91
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,608
Why do you need to maintain your image?

92
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,461
What are you afraid of?

93
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:27,802
Honestly, you don’t need to pretend when you’re with others.

94
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,840
If you allow people to see your true self,

95
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,329
they can like you quite easily.

96
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:37,993
No way.

97
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:39,321
You’re fooling me.

98
00:06:39,697 --> 00:06:42,968
Who would like a glutton who eats like a pig?

99
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:13,853
Woo!

100
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:45,308
[Pearmai Pataraporn sent you a friend request.]

101
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:46,029
Hey.

102
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,925
At least I’m her friend now.

103
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:09,598
Now let’s check out the result.

104
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,363
(I can travel back in time to fix certain things,

105
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:42,200
but not everything.)

106
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,577
(In particular, I can't change other people.)

107
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,351
It’s like nothing changes at all.

108
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:14,574
Pisaeng!

109
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:16,437
What are you doing here?

110
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:18,418
Why are you not at your wedding?

111
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:29,810
Hey!

112
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:31,528
Are you drunk?

113
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,364
Are you out of your mind?

114
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:39,374
You cannot attend your ceremony while drunk.

115
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:40,408
I won’t attend it.

116
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:44,628
I can’t marry Pear.

117
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:47,024
What?

118
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,578
I like someone else.

119
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,165
Huh?

120
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,667
Who do you like?

121
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:04,497
Hey!

122
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:08,067
Are you crazy?

123
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:11,715
I’m sorry.

124
00:10:12,324 --> 00:10:13,118
I just…

125
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:18,984
For the past 10 years…

126
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:19,616
Pisaeng.

127
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:20,703
haven’t you had feelings for me at all?

128
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,567
Pisaeng, wait.

129
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:23,874
Why are you doing this?

130
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:24,577
I like you.

131
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:25,989
I can’t marry Pear.

132
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:26,847
I like you.

133
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:27,486
Stop!

134
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:28,407
Ouch.

135
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:31,278
I’m sorry.

136
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,280
I’m sorry.

137
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:48,440
What did I do with the past?

[Humanities Group Chat]

139
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,219
[Kwan: Pear is nowhere to be found. No one can reach her.]

140
00:10:57,219 --> 00:10:59,071
[Kwan: She doesn’t take her dad’s calls.]

Damn it.

Hey!

155
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:52,782
How did it go?

156
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,868
Did the crystal ball I fixed for you help with anything?

157
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,144
Uncle!

158
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:05,480
Everything that happens is because of you.

159
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:08,760
The crystal ball you fixed can take me back in time.

160
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:11,327
Now everything is a mess.

161
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:13,090
Hey!

162
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:17,803
You said it yourself you wanted to fix your life.

163
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:20,589
Come on.

164
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:25,410
This doesn’t even come close to ‘Fix.’

165
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,503
I don’t know how you did it

166
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:33,246
but right now my life is in chaos.

167
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,878
Can you put things back the way they were?

168
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,834
You said you weren’t satisfied with your life then.

169
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,895
And now you want to go back to that?

170
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:43,498
Come on, Uncle.

171
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,842
This life is worse.

172
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:52,602
Have you ever imagined someone else having this opportunity?

173
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:55,333
I bet they are living their dream life now.

174
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:01,412
You know how lucky you are to have this chance?

175
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,838
Why don’t you make use of it?

Uncle…

177
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,720
The crystal ball can only take you back in time

178
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,269
but if you want to better your life, you must take action.

179
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:15,081
Right your wrongs.

180
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,503
If you want the right result, do the right thing.

181
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:19,390
So?

182
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,800
Did you take any action?

183
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:25,147
I did.

184
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,743
It’s still wrong.

185
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don’t know what to do now.

186

If I had known you’re such a quitter,

187
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,390
I wouldn’t have wasted my time fixing the crystal ball for you.

188
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:47,520
Are you saying I can still fix it and take it all back?

189
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:49,800
Or even make it all better.

190
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:55,031
It’s your call.

191
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:58,075
Think it through.

192
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:01,308
Find out what’s best.

193
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:14,622
Is he gone?

194
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,153
It’s all because of you, Pisaeng.

195
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:07,538
Oh.

196
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:15,592
The power of the crystal ball doesn’t last forever.

197
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,987
Chances, likewise.

198
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,240
They are limited.

199
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:25,164
So whatever you want to do with the crystal ball from now on,

200
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:28,172
be careful.

201
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:38,821
Don’t worry, Pear.

202
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:42,001
I will make everything better.

203
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:04,737
If I can ruin it,

204
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:06,303
I can fix it.

205
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,512
Traveling back this time, I need to think more carefully about what I should do.

206
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:16,038
If I’m not mistaken,

207

208
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,565

Turning the crystal ball in the past

Okay. Okay.

214
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:49,854
So what I must do is…

215
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:54,609

00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,493
I don’t think that’s enough for you.

374
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:55,209
Want to order one more?

375
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,659
Kawi.

376
00:28:04,888 --> 00:28:05,600
Kawi.

377
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,569
- Hey!
- Hey!

378
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,210
What?

379
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:13,159
What’s wrong with you?

380
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:15,084
You were staring at me and looking absent-minded.

381
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,376
Absent-minded?

382
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:18,869
I wasn’t.

383
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,680
Bullshit.

384
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:24,449
You looked at me but didn’t respond to what I said.

385
00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:29,357
Do you like me?

386
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,515
Like you, my ass.

387
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:31,971
No.

388
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:33,742
You’re turning red.

389
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,057
I’m not.

390
00:28:37,057 --> 00:28:38,471
I can see it here. Your face is red.

391
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:39,795
The food is spicy. Look at the chili.

392
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:40,481
See?

393
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,999
Seriously.

394
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,262
If you like me, you can just say it.

395
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:51,489
I’m quite used to people liking me.

396
00:28:52,574 --> 00:28:54,156
It won’t make me feel uncomfortable.

397
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:57,573
Read my lips.

398
00:28:58,258 --> 00:29:00,258
I don’t like you.

399
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,582
And I don’t have feelings for you.

400
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,282
There’s already someone I like named Pearmai. Got it?

401
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:10,551
What are you laughing at?

402
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:14,799
It’s so fun messing with you, Kawi.

403
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:17,409
But it’s not fun for me.

404
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:28,700
Pisaeng.

405
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:31,353
We need to clear things up.

406
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:37,887
You two talk.

407
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:41,461
I’ll go eat in the bathroom.

408
00:29:53,564 --> 00:29:54,944
So what’s the matter with you last night?

409
00:29:57,142 --> 00:29:58,402
I got upset about what you said.

410
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:00,085
I’m sorry.

411
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:07,029
Do you realize that

412
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:09,689
you’ve changed?

413
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:11,695
What?

414
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,082
We’re friends.

415
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,754
But you don’t associate with me anymore.

416
00:30:15,116 --> 00:30:16,399
You don’t talk to me about anything.

417
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:19,799
What’s your problem?

418
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:21,675
Say it.

419
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:23,432
Do you want to punch me?

420
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,840
The problem is your filthy mouth, Not.

421
00:30:30,223 --> 00:30:31,373
Your mindset, as well.

422
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:32,558
That’s it.

423
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:33,395
Are we clear?

424
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:37,794
You don’t need to care how I’ve changed.

425
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:41,164
You are the one who should change.

426
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:58,768
What are you looking at?

427
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,305
Never seen people eating in the bathroom or what?

428
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,417
Hey, Kawi.

429
00:31:11,105 --> 00:31:12,111
Hi, Pear.

430
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:15,496
Where’s Pisaeng?

431
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:19,368
I have no idea.

432
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,578
Are you alone? Where is Kwan?

433
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:23,436
She’s eating with her family.

434
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:26,516
Have you eaten?

435
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:30,365
I haven’t.

436
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:31,551
I’m starving.

437
00:31:31,714 --> 00:31:32,828
Let’s eat.

438
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:35,245
Here you go.

439
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:36,634
Pipo Jelly Smoothie.

440
00:31:39,502 --> 00:31:41,013
How did you know it’s my favorite drink?

441
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:43,484
Well,

442
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:45,455
I knew it from the buddy game.

443
00:31:46,162 --> 00:31:47,252
Aw.

444
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:48,997
How lovely you are.

445
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:57,280
Right, whenever I see you with Pisaeng,

446
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,525
I feel like you guys have been friends for years.

447
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:05,961
I’m sorry.

448
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:09,009
That’s all right.

449
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:12,374
It’s good.

450
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:14,439
Pisaeng should have more friends.

451
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,074
But…

452
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,300
Aren’t you and him already close?

453
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:27,009
Besides me who’s been close to him because our parents know each other,

454
00:32:28,516 --> 00:32:29,930
he doesn’t have any more friends.

455
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:33,187
He might seem like that on the outside,

456
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:36,518
but he’s a lonely guy.

457
00:32:39,318 --> 00:32:41,895
He used to be close to Not,

458
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,799
but just not anymore.

459
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:47,373
I'm not sure what they're arguing over.

460
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,821
But now I see Pisaeng is close to you.

461
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:55,977
And I’m so okay with that.

462
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,447
Well…

463
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,938
I don’t know, Pear.

464
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,259
You should go.

465
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:19,198
The get-together is held only once a year.

466
00:33:20,364 --> 00:33:21,593
I don’t want you to miss it.

467
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:26,062
Let me think about it.

468
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,240
Um.

469
00:33:46,365 --> 00:33:46,904
Pear.

470
00:33:47,523 --> 00:33:48,023
Hm?

471
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:53,705
Your phone.

472
00:33:55,529 --> 00:33:56,491
I completely forgot.

473
00:33:57,107 --> 00:33:57,721
Thank you.

474
00:34:00,968 --> 00:34:01,652
Pisaeng.

475
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,421
Can I ask you a question?

476
00:34:15,212 --> 00:34:17,424
The number of your Facebook friends decreases by more than half.

477
00:34:20,818 --> 00:34:21,770
What happened?

478
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:30,335
At one point, I realized there’s no point in accepting so many friend requests.

479
00:34:31,782 --> 00:34:33,521
It’s like I bought too many pieces of clothes.

480
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:38,605
One day, I have to give away some and keep only those I really want to wear.

481
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:39,979
That’s all.

482
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:43,678
I’m not being depressed or dramatic.

483
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:44,878
Don’t worry.

484
00:34:48,612 --> 00:34:49,234
Okay.

485
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:55,467
Since you've got off your car, want to come say hi to my dad?

486
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:00,009
I’d rather not.

487
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:02,708
I’m quite sleepy.

488
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:04,504
I’m afraid your dad will ask me to drink with him.

489
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,697
Tell him I said hi.

490
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:14,073
Um.

491
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:17,036
Get home safe.

492
00:35:32,368 --> 00:35:33,505
You’ve felt lonely?

493
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,413
You’re always surrounded by people.

494
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:39,009
How can you possibly be lonely?

495
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:49,135
[Kawi: Wanna have a drink?]

496
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:03,009
Yeah!

497
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,741
Hi, Pisaeng.

498
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:09,022
Hi, buddy.

499
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:09,587
Hi.

500
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:10,987
Let’s drink.

501
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:13,477
Get Pisaeng a glass.

502
00:36:14,728 --> 00:36:16,272
Why did you want to drink, Kawi?

503
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:18,426
Here it is, my friend.

504
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:19,122
Hi.

505
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:26,726
Kawi asked us to drink with him.

506
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:28,854
Didn’t think he’d ask you too.

507
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,009
Come on. Let’s drink.

508
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,985
Cheers.

509
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:40,527
Bottoms up.

510
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:44,148
Hey, drink up.

511
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:45,161
I drank all of mine.

512
00:36:45,394 --> 00:36:46,722
Yes, bottoms up.

513
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,095
Yes. Like that!

514
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:56,059
Give him applause.

515
00:36:56,504 --> 00:36:57,496
You’re awesome.

516
00:36:57,496 --> 00:36:58,166
Hey.

517
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:58,785
Kawi.

518
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:01,830
You’re pretty cool.

519
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:04,889
You can become one of our guys.

520
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,220
Drink with us sometimes.

521
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,160
You must.

522
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:08,826
Okay.

523
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:14,446
At first, I was afraid I couldn’t get along with you all.

524
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:18,053
But you guys are all right.

525
00:37:20,508 --> 00:37:23,354
Not, congratulations.

526
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:27,203
You’ll be a famous writer in the future.

527
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:28,425
Famous, my ass.

528
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,649
I’ve just written one book.

529
00:37:31,578 --> 00:37:33,261
Trust me.

530
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,255
Your work will be so well-known in the future.

531
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,524
You’ll be living a good life.

532
00:37:41,197 --> 00:37:43,197
It’s a shame that you’re such an a…

533
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:48,914
What?

534
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:52,649
Nothing.

535
00:37:53,108 --> 00:37:54,372
Let’s drink.

536
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,377
Cheers.

537
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:05,276
Pisaeng.

538
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:07,929
Aren’t you going to drink?

539
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:08,649
Cheers.

540
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:11,713
No. I have to drive.

541
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:14,083
All right then.

542
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,049
You want Fried Chicken Tendons?

543
00:38:17,315 --> 00:38:18,066
No.

544
00:38:19,315 --> 00:38:20,564
I guess he’s already eaten.

545
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,326
Hey.

546
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:30,527
Aren’t you two close friends?

547
00:38:32,107 --> 00:38:32,773
Yes,

548
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:35,649
we were in the same class in high school.

549
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,179
An all-boys school.

550
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:39,517
Others are studying Engineering.

551
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:41,600
It’s just him and me who are in Humanities.

552
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:43,920
But then,

553
00:38:44,576 --> 00:38:46,350
one day he chose a girl over his friend.

554
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,758
Hey, guys.

555
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:48,608
Easy.

556
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:49,376
Cool down.

557
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:50,798
Eat first.

558
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:52,897
All right. I’ll eat then.

559
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:57,769
I don’t know what the fight is about

560
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:00,506
but you guys are friends.

561
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,026
You should talk things out.

562
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:04,176
Maintain your friendship.

563
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:06,151
Me?

564
00:39:07,018 --> 00:39:08,100
I’ve never wanted to fight.

565
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,232
I’ve never wanted to have a fight with him at all.

566
00:39:11,738 --> 00:39:13,653
Ask him what his problem is.

567
00:39:14,456 --> 00:39:16,308
I was just speaking about the girl he likes

568
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,769
and he’s being dramatic for no reason.

569
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:20,449
I told you Pear and I are friends.

570
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:24,523
If you don’t like her, why did you get frustrated when I said I’d hit on her?

571
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:26,013
You were making stupid excuses.

572
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:26,963
You wanted to keep her to yourself.

573
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:28,069
That’s bullshit!

574
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:29,572
Hey, guys!

575
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:31,753
Easy there.

576
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:36,802
Here’s what it is.

577
00:39:38,685 --> 00:39:39,856
I like Pear.

578
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:48,282
So Pisaeng helped me by giving you signals to back off.

579
00:39:48,282 --> 00:39:48,934
It’s not that.

580
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:50,273
Come on, Pisaeng.

581
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:56,209
Thanks a lot for helping.

582
00:39:57,025 --> 00:39:59,638
But I can’t stand seeing you two fight.

583
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:02,311
You should patch things up.

584
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,885
You really like Pear?

585
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:07,097
Right.

586
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:09,627
I thought you were dating…

587
00:40:10,227 --> 00:40:10,912
Max.

588
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:12,205
That’s the one.

589
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:13,839
Please.

590
00:40:14,928 --> 00:40:16,928
Of course, I’m not dating him.

591
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,068
What about you?

592
00:40:20,274 --> 00:40:21,503
Do you really like Pear?

593
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:23,324
No.

594
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,752
I just want to try hitting on her.

595
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:29,649
But if you really like her, Kawi,

596
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:33,135
I can always back off for you.

597
00:40:34,023 --> 00:40:35,113
She’s just a chick.

598
00:40:37,192 --> 00:40:38,261
I can always do this for my friend.

599
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:41,480
All right, then.

600
00:40:41,712 --> 00:40:44,791
You two are on good terms now, yeah?

601
00:40:46,142 --> 00:40:47,338
Back to being friends, right?

602
00:40:47,604 --> 00:40:48,935
Come on. Show me a handshake.

603
00:40:48,935 --> 00:40:49,769
Handshake.

604
00:40:52,226 --> 00:40:54,226
I just don’t know what you’re trying to do here, Kawi.

605
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:03,715
Pisaeng, wait.

606
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,049
Wait.

607
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,047
What the heck is wrong with you?

608
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:12,929
I’m trying to get you back to being friends with Not.

609
00:41:13,076 --> 00:41:14,021
Did I ask you to?

610
00:41:14,782 --> 00:41:15,837
Leave me alone.

611
00:41:16,397 --> 00:41:18,397
I don’t want to be friends with those assholes.

612
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,548
Why not?

613
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:23,481
A friend is someone I feel comfortable with.

614
00:41:23,863 --> 00:41:25,186
If I’m gonna be friends with someone,

615
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:26,805
that person should make me feel that way.

616
00:41:27,566 --> 00:41:29,418
What’s your problem if I want to avoid them?

617
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:30,513
Just like that?

618
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:31,729
Yes.

619
00:41:32,895 --> 00:41:36,122
I want you to be close to Not again so you won’t be close to me.

620
00:41:49,422 --> 00:41:50,245
Are you serious?

621
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:53,643
Let’s try again.

622
00:41:54,604 --> 00:41:55,430
I was saying it wrong.

623
00:41:55,874 --> 00:41:57,048
Let me say it again.

624
00:41:57,987 --> 00:41:59,416
You can be my friend.

625
00:42:00,155 --> 00:42:01,499
But you should keep your distance sometimes.

626
00:42:02,218 --> 00:42:04,218
You can’t stick with me all the time.

627
00:42:09,388 --> 00:42:10,111
Why?

628
00:42:13,157 --> 00:42:14,709
I guess it’s as you said.

629
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:19,224
A friend is someone we feel comfortable with.

630
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:21,369
And you feel uncomfortable with me?

631
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:22,447
And unsafe.

632
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:34,413
Next time,

633
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:36,894
just tell me honestly.

634
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:40,180
Damn it.

635
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:41,240
Pisaeng.

636
00:42:42,004 --> 00:42:42,944
Pisaeng, wait.

637
00:42:46,095 --> 00:42:47,324
Why are you following me?

638
00:42:47,752 --> 00:42:49,667
You just said you felt unsafe with me around.

639
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,888
I’m paying you back for Pear’s gift.

640
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:04,126
What are you sulking about now?

641
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,710
Why are you so upset?

642
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:14,011
What do you want?

643
00:43:14,855 --> 00:43:15,480
Take it!

644
00:43:28,618 --> 00:43:30,978
(It doesn’t matter how many times I’m given a chance to start over.)

645
00:43:32,022 --> 00:43:39,501
(This is always this difficult thing I'll never be good at.)

646
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,522
(Who should I keep?)

647
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:52,947
(Who should I disregard?)

648
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:03,869
(Is there any way to ensure that I made the right choice?)

649
00:44:06,857 --> 00:44:08,857
[The Faculty of Humanities Party. We leave at 9 sharp.]

650
00:44:23,978 --> 00:44:25,177
You really came.

651
00:44:26,108 --> 00:44:27,057
This should be fun.

652
00:45:16,828 --> 00:45:19,738
What are the lotto results on the 16th…?

653
00:45:26,484 --> 00:45:27,321
This is it.

654
00:45:27,786 --> 00:45:29,012
I now have 20,000 baht.

655
00:45:29,386 --> 00:45:31,153
Too bad I couldn’t find the first-prize lottery tickets.

656
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:33,867
Well, the last two digits prize is good enough.

657
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:35,649
I have the money to pay Pisaeng back.

658
00:45:35,868 --> 00:45:38,058
I also have some to spend on the get-together trip.

659
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:43,948
Three, two, one, go!

660
00:45:45,266 --> 00:45:46,199
(The get-together?)

661
00:45:46,305 --> 00:45:48,324
(It’s something I would never join.)

662
00:45:48,753 --> 00:45:51,874
(But to fix things with Pear, I will give it a try.)

663
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:56,129
I heard from our seniors that there are first-year students confessing to each other at the Faculty’s get-together every year.

664
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,105
There have been many couples from this event.

665
00:45:58,105 --> 00:46:00,328
We don’t have any right to eavesdrop on other people’s conversations.

666
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,650
You just like to ruin my happiness.

667
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:03,150
Let me go!

668
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,457
I told you to stop!

669
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:05,768
(Will I survive that?)

670
00:46:05,768 --> 00:46:07,136
(Please root for me, guys.)
