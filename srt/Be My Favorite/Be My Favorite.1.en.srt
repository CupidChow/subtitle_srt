What is time?

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,885
Science defines time as the numbers 1-12 on the clock face.

6
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:46,858
In terms of philosophy, however,

7
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,440
Aristotle said humans didn’t realize the existence of time until…

8
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:55,599
they noticed changes.

00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:25,884
Is it a buffet?

17
00:01:26,617 --> 00:01:27,271
How much per each?

18
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,267
799 baht.

19
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:36,083
Maybe next time.

20
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:38,429
I just realized I got something to do at my dorm.

21
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:39,823
Sorry.

25

38
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,240
I’m Pearmai.

Can you sign my signature book?

40
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:25,848
My name is Bodkawee.

41
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,067

Thanks to you, Kawi.

45
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,832
I thought I’d get chewed out by the seniors.

46

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,196
Yesterday I hurried back home as I got something to do.

51
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:06,336

52
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:08,479
I haven’t talked to anyone yet.

53
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:12,273
No. You can get yelled at by the seniors.

00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:00,828
I pulled a dramatic scene.

184
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:04,376
I used touching words. Yet he refused to repair it.

185
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:22,040
Who says this is winter?

186
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,006
It’s boiling hot.

187
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:34,751
Hey.

188
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:40,654
Do you know which bus I should get on if I want to go to Bangkok Bus Terminal?

189
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:41,587
I don’t.

190
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:53,153
I’ll look it up for you.

191
00:17:57,398 --> 00:18:06,911
You must get on bus number 509 at the bus stop out front and get off at The Bangkok School for The Blind.

192
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:09,480
Then you get on bus number 462.

193
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:12,715
It’ll take you to Bangkok Bus Terminal.

194
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:20,503
I’ll write it down for you.

195
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:31,370
Here you go.

196
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:43,272
Hey.

197
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:46,482
Is this crystal ball yours?

198
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,752
I saw you wandering around looking for a repair shop.

199
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,548
Can I have a look?

200
00:18:58,901 --> 00:18:59,610
Sure.

201
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:10,777
How long has it been broken?

202
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:14,166
More than 10 years.

203
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:18,609
It doesn’t even seem important. Why have you kept it this long?

204
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:20,866
Why don’t you throw it away?

205
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:30,199
Exactly.

206
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:33,368
I don't know why I keep it.

207
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:36,626
I can’t do anything with it anyways.

208
00:19:39,747 --> 00:19:42,105
What would you do with it if it could be fixed?

209
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:46,740
Okay.

210
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:47,863
Bye-bye.

211
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:50,760
Pearmai’s secret buddy, please reveal yourself.

212
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,680
I’d like to give it to someone.

213
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:56,119
In case it could fix something in the past.

214
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,684
That was a complete disaster.

215
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:07,272
True.

216
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:12,124
How have you been, Kawi?

217
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,156
You never update anything on social media.

218
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:19,598
Nothing is going on in my life.

219
00:20:20,074 --> 00:20:22,372

Come on.

226
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,804
We barely see each other.

227
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,880
One drink, all right?

228
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,640
He doesn’t drink. Don’t force him.

229
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,562
Let’s cheers.

235

Dance with us. Come on.

236
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,798
I don’t dance.

237

238
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,415

What would you do with it if it could be fixed?

00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,221
I’d like to give it to someone.

In case it could fix something in the past.

254

Do you want me to fix it for you?

Pardon me?

256
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,565
Write down your address.

257
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:54,400
Once I’m done, I’ll send it back to you.

258

Are you reliable?

259
00:23:59,014 --> 00:24:00,378
Are you stealing it?

260

Do you want that?

268
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,496

00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:51,412
I didn’t think this is how you truly are, Kawi.

367
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:52,677
How am I?

368
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,713
So what?

369
00:33:53,713 --> 00:33:54,833
What are you gonna do?

370
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:55,901
How am I?

371
00:33:56,942 --> 00:33:59,800
You’re a psychopath, going around stealing people’s clothes.

372
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,936
Think whatever you want.

373
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:03,122
I don’t care.

374
00:34:03,122 --> 00:34:05,108
Because this is my dream.

375
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:08,102
In my dream, I can do anything I please.

376
00:34:11,345 --> 00:34:12,269
Are you high?

377
00:34:12,269 --> 00:34:13,210
Take a pick.

378
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,481
You’re coming with me and confessing to Pearmai about the secret buddy

379
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:21,745
or your clothes go to a charity.

380
00:34:24,747 --> 00:34:25,492
Come on.

381
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:29,970
What do you want?

382
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:31,301
Are you coming or not?

383
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:35,633
What foundation should I donate them to?

384
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:39,235
Fine!

385
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:41,074
I’m coming.

386
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,690
Ow!

387
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,497
You promised.

388
00:34:59,571 --> 00:35:01,571
Lun-la-la-lun-lun-la.

389
00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:20,108
Whoa!

390
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:22,455
Pisaeng.

391
00:35:24,967 --> 00:35:28,080
Are we meeting Pear here?

392
00:35:28,823 --> 00:35:29,686
I came to work.

393
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:31,995
Work?

394
00:35:33,888 --> 00:35:34,732
What work?

395
00:35:34,957 --> 00:35:35,978
Are you a security guard?

396
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:44,938
Hey.

397
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,033
You promised you’d take me to see Pear.

398
00:35:49,371 --> 00:35:50,655
But I didn’t say when.

399
00:35:50,768 --> 00:35:52,002
Wait until I’m done working.

400
00:35:53,391 --> 00:35:54,720
What work?

401
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,059
Where should I wait?

402
00:35:58,472 --> 00:35:59,617
Right here.

403
00:36:00,316 --> 00:36:01,396
Take care of my stuff.

404
00:36:03,472 --> 00:36:05,472
Where are you going, Pisaeng?

405
00:36:06,187 --> 00:36:06,902
Hey.

406
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:09,014
If this is a dream, I should wake up already.

407
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:12,045
Is it not?

408
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:16,360
If it’s not a dream, then what on earth is it?

409
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:05,905
I’ve been in this world for almost 30 years, yet I’ve never tried this stuff.

410
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:08,455
I’m gonna drink all these.

411
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:27,081
Oh.

412
00:38:39,002 --> 00:38:41,573
(You’ve been nothing but boring.)

413
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:47,064
(You’ve been nothing but boring.)

414
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:36,823
Oops!

415
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:43,776
Pisaeng.

416
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:44,952
Let’s dance.

417
00:39:44,952 --> 00:39:47,936
Go.

418
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,885
You call this dancing?

419
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,067
Do you know what rhythm is?

420
00:39:56,497 --> 00:39:57,598
This is rhythm.

421
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,271
I can’t see how it’s not.

422
00:39:59,674 --> 00:40:00,835
Look at this.

423
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:03,918
Just enjoy.

424
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:12,669
By the way, thank you so much for the drinks.

425
00:40:14,257 --> 00:40:15,627
You’re so kind.

426
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,678
You have to pay me back.

427
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:26,292
Pay you back?

428
00:40:26,613 --> 00:40:30,424
All I have is 300 baht.

429
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:38,635
You’re drunk.

430
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:39,950
Let’s go.

431
00:40:40,863 --> 00:40:41,716
What?

432
00:40:42,621 --> 00:40:43,512
No.

433
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:44,981
I’m dancing.

434
00:40:45,768 --> 00:40:47,362
Don’t you want to see Pear?

435
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:54,297
Let’s go.

436
00:40:56,994 --> 00:40:58,298
See you, guys.

437
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,208
Pisaeng, wait.

438
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,723
Where are we going? Tell me.

439
00:41:08,806 --> 00:41:09,873
Pisaeng.

440
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:10,747
Hey!

441
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:15,073
Where is Pear?

442
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:15,799
Pear?

443
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:16,936
I’m finding out for you.

444
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:18,596
Just be quiet.

445
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:20,528
Or I’ll just leave you here.

446
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:21,814
Okay. Good.

447
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:22,990
Very good.

448
00:41:24,432 --> 00:41:26,432
You f*cking have a problem with me, bitch?

449
00:41:28,581 --> 00:41:29,846
You dare talk shit to me now?

450
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,770
How dare you talk–

451
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,514
Hey!

452
00:41:39,596 --> 00:41:41,104
You toxic masculine asshole.

453
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,579
Who says it’s okay to hit girls?

454
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,165
Quit it now.

455
00:41:45,165 --> 00:41:46,800
If you don’t, I’ll make you.

456
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,684
- Who the f*ck are you?
- Hey!

457
00:41:49,193 --> 00:41:49,930
Sorry, man.

458
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,666
My friend is drunk.

459
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:53,022
Don’t mind him.

460
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:53,917
Who’s drunk?

461
00:41:53,974 --> 00:41:54,932
I’m not.

462
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:56,446
This scumbag hurt that girl.

463
00:41:56,446 --> 00:42:00,248
It’s a modern world now and you still hurt women?

464
00:42:00,248 --> 00:42:01,785
You’re making this world unpleasant.

465
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,094
It’s between us lovers. You f*ck off.

466
00:42:07,773 --> 00:42:08,766
But my friend was right.

467
00:42:09,337 --> 00:42:10,620
You are just trash.

468
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,907
True. You’re a dirtbag. Just go to hell.

469
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:14,961
Haha. You deserved that.

470
00:42:15,684 --> 00:42:16,349
What are you laughing at?

471
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,118
Let’s go.

472
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:19,880
Move.

473
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,710
Hey!

474
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,010
Who hit our boss?

475
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:29,230
Pisaeng.

476
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,508
They outnumber us.

477
00:42:30,652 --> 00:42:31,399
Can you handle them?

478
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:32,652
I think you can. Can you?

479
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:34,988
Of course, I can’t.

480
00:42:35,224 --> 00:42:36,283
Kawi, run!

481
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:39,606
Pisaeng, wait.

482
00:42:39,606 --> 00:42:40,947
Hey!

483
00:43:27,994 --> 00:43:29,994
[Pearmai]

484
00:43:36,023 --> 00:43:37,075
Are you Bodkawee?

485
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:41,487
I already know. Just making sure.

486
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:46,340
I’m your secret buddy.

487
00:43:47,698 --> 00:43:48,326
What?

488
00:43:49,357 --> 00:43:50,568
Why are you telling me?

489
00:43:52,261 --> 00:43:53,719
Well, I’ll be your caretaker.

490
00:43:54,054 --> 00:43:55,334
Just let me know what you want.

491
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,589
I’ll treat you to what you want to eat.

492
00:43:58,231 --> 00:43:59,729
But not today.

493
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:01,048
Not available.

494
00:44:04,896 --> 00:44:05,912
Are you nuts?

495
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:09,640
The fun of this game is hiding your identity.

496
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:12,544
That’s not my style.

497
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:17,180
If I’m to take care of someone, I’ll do it in the open.

498
00:44:17,795 --> 00:44:18,627
Not sneakily.

499
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:31,029
What a weirdo.

500
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,352
(It’s great to live a dream life.)

501
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:45,591
You dine in a fancy restaurant every day?

502
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:46,635
(But…)

503
00:44:51,694 --> 00:44:52,696
Holy shit!

504
00:44:52,696 --> 00:44:53,893
(It’s not just a dream.)

505
00:44:54,046 --> 00:44:55,889
I want to know you better, Kawi.

506
00:44:59,437 --> 00:45:01,437
(It seems like my life is more fun than I thought.)

507
00:45:01,723 --> 00:45:03,408
(Please stay tuned.)
