Cardiac arrhythmia is the cause of his death.

5
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:21,811
I’m so sorry, Kawi.

6
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:24,375
Did you forget something?

7
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,286
Your mom is having her exhibition at the gallery.

8
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:28,282
You told me you would come.

9
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:30,388
Pear.

10
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:31,689
It’s okay.

11
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:32,468
I understand.

12
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:34,240
You’re flying tonight?

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,692
Are you coming with me?

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,200
I’m not letting you go.

15
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:38,486
What did you say?

16
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:40,840
I will set everything right.

17
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:42,775
Will you go out with me?

18
00:00:44,788 --> 00:00:45,580
No.

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,253
You must let me hit on you first.

20
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:53,167
It looks so good.

21
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:58,360
Hitting on someone like you is so easy.

22
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:00,000
Just take you out to eat.

23
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:01,834
Yeah?

24
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:02,912
Nice mouth.

25
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,676
A while ago, you were having a sad puppy face.

26
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:15,116
Hey!

27
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:17,255
I better not.

28
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:19,692
I think I’ll quit drinking.

29
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:22,009
Why?

30
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:29,664
Come to think of it, alcohol helps in a way.

31
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:33,446
It helps make my life more fun.

32
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:37,030
With it, I do things I’m not brave enough to do.

33
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:45,258
Even so, when I use it too often, it comes back and hurts me.

34
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:50,510
That’s good.

35
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:56,340
Whoa!

36
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:04,237
Let’s eat.

37
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:05,411
Sure.

38
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:16,621
It’s so good.

39
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:19,075
Good, huh?

40
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:19,776
Um.

41
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,722
Kawi.

42
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:25,570
I’m glad

43
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:29,129
that you finally opened your heart to me.

44
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,644
I never thought I’d get the chance.

45
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:39,604
Come on.

46
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:42,000
We no longer need touching speeches.

47
00:03:54,017 --> 00:04:01,691
Will it sound bad if I say I’m glad Pear got something to do?

48
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:04,669
I ended up dating you instead.

49
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:09,347
It sounds bad.

50
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,056
So bad.

51
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,793
I want the next bite already.

52
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,166
Pear.

53
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:46,732
Congratulations.

54
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,147
Thanks a lot, honey.

55
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:56,833
Thank you so much for coming.

56
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:00,234
I’ve missed you so much, you know?

57
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:10,470
Pear’s mother is an artist.

58
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:14,412
But once she married and had a child,

59
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:19,731
family responsibilities and everything else took its toll on her creativity.

60
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:25,488
So she decided that it wasn’t the life she wanted.

61
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:27,436
She asked for separation.

62
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,560
I know how it feels to be abandoned by someone we love.

63
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:43,738
It’s really painful.

64
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:47,166
It was a long time ago.

65
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:50,001
I guess Pear already forgave her mom.

66
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:01,267
Lots of people came to see your exhibition today.

67
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:06,193
I’m happy for you.

68
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:14,147
Thank you so much

69
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:18,224
and please tell your dad I said thanks.

70
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:24,848
If it weren't for you and your dad, today wouldn’t have happened for me.

71
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,524
How dare you say that?

72
00:06:35,273 --> 00:06:44,904
You traded Dad’s pain and my heartache for the path you chose.

73
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:05,689
Wow.

74
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:11,694
Do you want to eat anything else?

75
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:14,955
Let’s see.

76
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:20,057
Is there anything delicious around here?

77
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:23,502
Me.

78
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:24,456
I’m delicious.

79
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:25,541
Wanna try?

80
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:27,460
Ow!

81
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:29,737
You’re cheeky.

82
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,421
[Incoming Call - Fluke]

83
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:42,619
Hello.

84
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:44,609
Yes. What’s up?

85
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,940
Now?

86
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:51,119
He’s with me.

87
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:53,721
But he’s not available.

88
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:55,764
I’ll let him know though.

89
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:57,844
What is it?

90
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:01,270
Fluke called.

91
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:02,822
He said he couldn’t reach you.

92
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:12,646
My battery died again.

93
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:17,085
So…

94
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,104
Why did he call?

95
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:24,960
The band that was supposed to play tonight canceled.

96
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:26,646
So the owner asked your band to play instead.

97
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,175
Yeah?

98
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,000
What time?

99
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:31,853
10.

100
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,240
What time is it now? Check your watch.

101
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,390
9.

102
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,540
Hey.

103
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:42,240
It’s almost time.

104
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,531
Come on. Let’s go.

105
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:44,257
Wait.

106
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:45,430
Where are you going?

107
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:46,649
We’re not done with our date yet.

108
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:48,791
We finished eating.

109
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:50,535
What else should we do?

110
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:52,840
It’s a date.

111
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,352
It must end with…

112
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,711
With?

113
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,574
Well…

114
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:05,400
Don’t play dumb.

115
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,610
I really have no idea.

116
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:09,903
Tell me.

117
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,893
Whatever.

118
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
No more eating. Back to your place then?

119
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:17,163
Come on.

120
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:18,000
No.

121
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:19,554
I’m performing with my band.

122
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,118
Choose then.

123
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:29,087
Between me and your band, what will you choose?

124
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,060
Damn it.

125
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,400
All right. Thank you all so much for coming tonight.

126
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,576
Tonight is special as it’s Pang’s birthday over here.

127
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:55,832

When did you come?

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And why are you sitting all alone?

00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:23,020

Thank you.

142
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:51,120
Drink with me.

143
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:52,485
Please.

144
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,080
Can I just not drink? I quit.

145
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,001
No. You must.

146
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:02,066
You must entertain the customers.

147
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,734
If you don’t drink, it won’t be fun for them.

148
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,564
Then the owner might stop hiring us.

149
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:08,599
Please.

150
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:12,800
Pretty please!

151
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,151
Drink.

152
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:21,123
Sorry.

153
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:23,667
My friend over there is allergic to alcohol.

154
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:28,959
But I can drink for him.

155
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,370
What do you think?

156
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,462
Fine by me. Totally.

157
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:34,404
All right. You can drink instead.

158
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:36,911
All right. You can drink instead.

159
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:39,353
But you must drink it all.

160
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:47,179
Bottoms up.

161
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:50,996
Woo-hoo!

162
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:54,221
And that’s Pisaeng.

163
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:59,827
If you want to hand us drinks tonight, hand them to him instead.

164
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:02,244
He will take them for us.

165
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,624
Hey, boy.

166
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:07,423
One more.

167
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:08,485
Drink one more.

168
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:09,095
One more?

169
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,066
Bottoms up.

170
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,108
It’s my birthday.

171
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:22,468
Bottoms up.

172
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:42,138
(Sorry. The number you've dialed cannot be connected…)

173
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:49,556
You’re back, huh?

174
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:54,000
(Sorry. The number you've dialed cannot be connected…)

175
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:00,107
Yes.

176
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:04,042
Your mom told me what happened.

177
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:08,258
Are you still angry with her?

178
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:12,720
No.

179
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:20,375
I just…

180
00:13:30,195 --> 00:13:31,078
Okay.

181
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:33,960
I think we need to have a word.

182
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,621
What do you want to talk about?

183
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:42,682
There’s nothing to talk about.

184
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,072
We must

185
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:48,600
so that I know what you’re thinking

186
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,916
and what you’re feeling.

187
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:54,185
Do you even care?

188
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:56,248
Pear.

189
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:04,283
If you really do, why did you let her leave me?

190
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:08,163
Why did you let her do that to me?

191
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,735
She’s that selfish.

192
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,223
How could you tell me to forgive her?

193
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:23,732
And how should I respond to that?

194
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,587
Do I have the right to say I’m not okay?

195
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:46,345
How is it my fault?

196
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:57,276
This is not fair at all.

197
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:07,743
Thank you so much, Kawi

198
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:11,039
for coming with such short notice.

199
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,590
I felt really bad.

200
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,548
Hey, that’s okay.

201
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,619
This guy isn’t okay though.

202
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:21,801
I am.

203
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:23,399
Damn you.

204
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,521
There, there. Just rest.

205
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:26,762
He’s furious when drunk.

206
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:28,983
Don’t worry. I’ll take care of him.

207
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,000
All right then.

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,839
See you.

209
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:31,393
Get home safe.

210
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:33,312
Bye. Thank you so much.

211
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:35,859
See you.

212
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,062
You all right?

213
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:40,952
Wanna go home?

214
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:54,246
Is the ride here yet?

215
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:57,045
Wait a bit.

216
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:00,335
When will it come?

217
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,270
It’s coming. Look.

218
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,141
In five minutes.

219
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:04,207
Just wait a little.

220
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,453
Okay.

221
00:16:14,388 --> 00:16:15,092
Kawi.

222
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:15,737
Hm?

223
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:19,154
So…

224
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:22,540
We are together now.

225
00:16:26,398 --> 00:16:27,587
What?

226
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:30,000
You said you’d hit on me first.

227
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:33,278
Come on.

228
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:36,080
No more hitting on you.

229
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,268
Let’s just be together.

230
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:38,354
Yeah?

231
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:39,585
What?

232
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:43,351
The ride is almost here.

233
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:46,972
It’s not here yet.

234
00:16:58,544 --> 00:16:59,477
Kawi.

235
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:00,628
Hm?

236
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:03,445
Kawi!

237
00:17:03,865 --> 00:17:05,499
What?

238
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:11,656
Kawi.

239
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:16,941
Yes?

240
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,039
Can I get a kiss?

241
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:22,946
Huh?

242
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,730
Oh, come on.

243
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,440
Can’t I get just one little kiss?

244
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,154
Not here.

245
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:47,407
Damn you.

246
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,380
Hey. Our ride is here.

247
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,065
This one.

248
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:55,235
Let’s go.

249
00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:58,302
Hey!

250
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:01,025
Fine. No kiss, it is.

(Pear, it’s me.)

256

Yes.

What is it?

258
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:07,044
About the thing I told you before,

259
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:08,772
I was right.

260
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,429
(So I’m with him already, aren’t I?)

261
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:29,594

(When did this happen?)

267
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,610
(It’s good he’s sleeping.)

268
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:11,933
(If he’s awake, I won’t dare stare at him like this.)

269
00:20:12,062 --> 00:20:15,474
If you're going to stare this hard, you might as well eat me.

270
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:25,419
Hey!

271
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:28,559
Oh.

272
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:30,711
I thought you were sleeping.

273
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:34,663
I’m awake.

274
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,943
Go take a shower.

275
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:40,364
You didn’t take a shower last night. Can’t you smell yourself?

276
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,016
I just don’t remember when I blacked out last night.

277
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,499
Oh, you have the guts to ask now?

278
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:55,254
You blacked out in the taxi.

279
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:57,240
I carried you up here.

280
00:20:58,287 --> 00:20:59,857
You’re damn heavy.

281
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:02,581
I didn’t realize that at all.

282
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:06,868
Wait a minute.

283
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:08,290
What?

284
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:11,000
Did you do anything to me last night?

285
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,815
Are you crazy?

286
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:17,779
Who would do anything to you?

287
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:20,022
Do you really think I would?

288
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:22,278
I don’t know.

289
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:23,746
I was unconscious.

290
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:25,254
Who knows?

291
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:27,873
You might not be able to resist your desire.

292
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,220
I won’t do anything to you.

293
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:33,719
What kind of person do you think I am?

294
00:21:34,814 --> 00:21:35,771
There, there.

295
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:37,162
I’m kidding.

296
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:39,336
Are you mad?

297
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:42,005
There, there. Don’t be mad.

298
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,542
Please don’t get mad.

299
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:46,612
Asshole.

300
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:49,233
I should’ve let you sleep on the streets.

301
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:57,032
What a lazy day.

302
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:58,518
Can we just not go to class?

303
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,291
Should we skip?

304
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:02,152
No.

305
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:03,506
We have a quiz today.

306
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,901
Come on. I just want to cuddle you all day.

307
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,843
Please, please.

308
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:10,512
No.

309
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:11,117
We don’t want to be late.

310
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:11,641
Go.

311
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:12,978
Let me hug you a little longer, yeah?

312
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:17,906
No hurries.

313
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:19,560
Enough.

314
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,633
It’s ticklish.

315
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:39,396
Do you think people will notice I’m wearing your shirt?

316
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,155
Oh, please.

317
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,318
Let’s go.

318
00:22:42,846 --> 00:22:43,517
Wait.

319
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:45,794
Stop by the shopping mall first.

320
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,774
What?

321
00:22:48,252 --> 00:22:50,088
I just told you have a quiz.

322
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:51,044
Why are we going?

323
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,147
The quiz is at 1 p.m.

324
00:22:53,427 --> 00:22:54,577
It’s only 11 now.

325
00:22:55,048 --> 00:22:57,003
You should’ve just slept in class yesterday since it’s such a rush.

326
00:23:02,136 --> 00:23:03,645
I’m sorry, sir.

327
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,546
I will not get on your nerves ever again, sir.

328
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:13,417
I want to buy a new phone.

329
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:16,216
How rich you are.

330
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,089
What you’re using now is still new.

331
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,327
Want a new one already?

332
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,000
Not for me. I’m buying it for you.

333
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:25,150
Huh?

334
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:28,368
What? No!

335
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:29,336
Why not?

336
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,294
Your battery is deteriorated.

337
00:23:32,773 --> 00:23:35,387
Tell me what phone you want.

338
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:37,193
Sugar Daddy will buy it for you.

339
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:38,641
Please.

340
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:42,622
If we are to date each other, don’t do this.

341
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:48,017
When we were just friends, I bought you food and things many times.

342
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:50,632
Why are you thinking so much now?

343
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:53,369
We are together.

344
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:55,717
That’s why I need to think more carefully.

345
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:58,418
What do you mean?

346
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:15,480
Hey.

347
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:18,598
Are you okay?

348
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,226
Don’t tell me you’re still thinking about it.

349
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:41,834
If we're going to be together, I don't want to take advantage of you.

350
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,911
That's the reason I don't want you to always pay for or buy me expensive stuff.

351
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:52,297
What does it matter if I do?

352
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,513
Isn't this our business?

353
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,935
Why should you care about what other people think?

354
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:04,709
I don’t care about other people.

355
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:08,051
I care about you.

356
00:25:11,815 --> 00:25:13,154
If we decide to date,

357
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:17,067
I want our relationship to be successful.

358
00:25:18,837 --> 00:25:20,244
I don't want it to fall short.

359
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,785
You may think I'm overthinking things.

360
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:34,859
But I will feel more comfortable if we are more equal.

361
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:40,172
We are neither givers nor takers.

362
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,846
Just stay together.

363
00:25:43,931 --> 00:25:44,928
Don’t leave each other.

364
00:25:46,614 --> 00:25:47,775
That’s all I need.

365
00:25:58,073 --> 00:25:58,820
Okay.

366
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:05,009
From now on, whatever I do, I promise I will let you know first.

367
00:26:06,236 --> 00:26:07,990
I will not do anything without discussing it with you.

368
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:10,679
And if I do anything wrong,

369
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:14,938
give me a chance to adjust.

370
00:26:23,294 --> 00:26:23,833
Um.

371
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:36,784
Of course, it’s true.

372
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:38,040
I saw it with my own eyes.

373
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,126
You’re talking nonsense, Not.

374
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,470
They might be just drunk and messing with each other.

375
00:26:43,497 --> 00:26:44,709
Do you think I’m stupid?

376
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:46,154
I have brains.

377
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:49,565
I could tell what it was that I saw.

378
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:52,163
I think it’s possible.

379
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,004
Those two are suspiciously close.

380
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:56,844
Remember what I told you?

381
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,686
Someone saw Pisaeng in a gay bar.

382
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:02,777
Really?

383
00:27:02,893 --> 00:27:03,616
Yes.

384
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:04,513
See?

385
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:10,220
Thinking back on his weird behaviors lately, it all clicks.

386
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:12,076
You’re right.

387
00:27:12,406 --> 00:27:13,261
True.

388
00:27:14,053 --> 00:27:14,969
Hey, Kwan.

389
00:27:16,183 --> 00:27:16,978
What did Pear say?

390
00:27:17,591 --> 00:27:18,974
Did you talk to her about this?

391
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,514
You told Pear about this?

392
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,371
Yeah, why?

393
00:27:22,968 --> 00:27:24,968
Do you want Kawi to keep lying to her?

394
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,942
It’s a shame I didn’t take their photos.

395
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:00,590
Kwan.

396
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:04,216
Hasn’t Pear come yet?

397
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,194
Oh.

398
00:28:07,348 --> 00:28:10,410
You haven’t talked to her yet, Kawi?

399
00:28:15,647 --> 00:28:17,416
Pear is sick.

400
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,617
She’s taking a day off.

401
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:39,250
Pear doesn’t answer the phone.

402
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,817
You try.

403
00:28:42,605 --> 00:28:46,566
She doesn't take your calls. What makes you think she will take mine?

404
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:48,832
Oh, come on. I told you to call her. Just call.

405
00:29:01,476 --> 00:29:04,806
(Sorry. The number you've dialed cannot be connected…)

406
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:05,587
She didn’t answer.

407
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:08,927
Damn. What should I do?

408
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:11,513
She must have known about us.

409
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:12,836
Probably not.

410
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,348
Don’t make it up in your head.

411
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:15,551
Make it up, my ass.

412
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,525
Didn’t you hear what those guys said?

413
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:20,435
Let’s not lie to ourselves. They talked about us.

414
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:23,442
I should’ve cleared things up with Pear first.

415
00:29:23,724 --> 00:29:25,628
I shouldn’t have agreed to be with you first.

416
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:27,200
So what?

417
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:30,285
So what if Pear knows or other people know?

418
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:33,112
Sooner or later they will find out.

419
00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:56,326
Hi, Kawi.

420
00:29:57,502 --> 00:29:58,359
Hello, sir.

421
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:58,994
Hello.

422
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,609
I came to see Pear.

423
00:30:03,246 --> 00:30:04,822
Pear went out a while ago.

424
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:08,329
I even thought she went to see you.

425
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:18,116
[Pisaeng: Pear came to see me at my place.]

426
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:34,495
Do you think I was being rude to say that to her?

427
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:37,350
Not really.

428
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:41,047
But if you knew you’d act that way if you saw her,

429
00:30:41,955 --> 00:30:43,492
you shouldn’t have gone in the first place.

430
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:46,791
If I knew, that’d be great.

431
00:30:50,313 --> 00:30:51,831
Before last night, whenever I saw her,

432
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:55,917
she was struggling with something.

433
00:30:57,329 --> 00:30:58,866
It’s either work or money.

434
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:02,407
That’s why I didn’t feel that angry.

435
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:07,713
But yesterday,

436
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:10,730
she started to be successful.

437
00:31:11,574 --> 00:31:13,497
She looked happier.

438
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:18,271
Given the fact that she did that to me and Dad,

439
00:31:19,915 --> 00:31:21,530
I just could take it.

440
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:28,597
The more I say it, the worse it sounds.

441
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:35,025
You don’t need to blame yourself that much, Pear.

442
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:38,745
You can be honest about your feelings.

443
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:40,693
It’s not that bad.

444
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:50,437
Pisaeng.

445
00:31:54,947 --> 00:32:01,210
You know you’re the only friend I trust and can open up to about anything, right?

446
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:06,622
I don’t even tell my dad everything.

447
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:12,817
But there’s nothing at all I hide from you.

448
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
I didn’t actually come to talk about my mom.

449
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:24,406
I want to talk about something else.

450
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:28,496
About what?

451
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,495
Can you promise you won’t hide it from me?

452
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:44,263
Pear.

453
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:48,608
Pear.

454
00:32:48,753 --> 00:32:50,753
I have something important to tell you.

455
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:52,654
There’s no need.

456
00:32:55,063 --> 00:32:56,063
I know everything.

457
00:32:57,802 --> 00:32:59,166
Pisaeng told me.

458
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:07,117
Pear, I really am sorry.

459
00:33:08,282 --> 00:33:10,282
I didn’t mean to hide this from you.

460
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:12,276
You must be thinking I’m fooling–

461
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:12,941
Just forget it.

462
00:33:15,736 --> 00:33:17,254
Don’t say anything right now.

463
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:22,858
I’m not angry.

464
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:27,230
I just don’t get what it is.

465
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,060
Pear, wait.

466
00:33:33,406 --> 00:33:33,914
I…

467
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:34,827
Just let me go.

468
00:33:36,712 --> 00:33:38,712
I’m not ready to hear anything from you.

469
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:20,068
I’m sorry.

470
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:26,608
I just couldn’t lie to Pear.

471
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:10,174
Stressed out?

472
00:35:19,824 --> 00:35:21,076
Of course, I am.

473
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:24,860
I told you I wanted to set everything right.

474
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:27,804
But in the end…

475
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:30,737
Damn it.

476
00:35:32,242 --> 00:35:34,357
How many more mistakes will I make in life?

477
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:47,209
When you said set everything right, I thought it meant us getting together.

478
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,309
That’s not enough?

479
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:59,635
♪ The pain that still burns ♪

480
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:01,463
♪ It’s painful to still love you ♪

481
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:04,460
♪ Still want to take care of you ♪

482
00:36:06,441 --> 00:36:08,923
[Pearmai: Can we meet? I want to talk to you.]

483
00:36:10,155 --> 00:36:10,891
[Not: Sure thing.]

484
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:11,814
Hey.

485
00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:14,396
Are you having a date with Pearmai?

486
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,631
What’s going on here?

487
00:36:18,253 --> 00:36:19,224
Don’t be nosy, you two.

488
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:22,090
I’m off.

489
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,789
Hey, where are you going?

490
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:25,311
Right. Where are you going?

491
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:27,889
None of your business.

492
00:36:29,107 --> 00:36:31,195
He’s having a secret now.

493
00:36:35,912 --> 00:36:36,728
Not.

494
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,714
Not.

495
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:40,940
Hi, Kwan.

496
00:36:42,387 --> 00:36:43,274
What’s up?

497
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:54,236
I know we agreed that there must be no jealousy between us.

498
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:00,260
And if one of us wants to get serious with someone else,

499
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:01,823
the other must let go.

500
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:08,262
I don’t want to break the promise I gave you

501
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:14,233
but I want to be honest about my feelings.

502
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:24,290
Is there any way we can make our relationship right, Not?

503
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,541
I’m really sorry.

504
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,598
I don’t feel that much about you.

505
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:49,191
Hey.

506
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,953
You can’t blame me.

507
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:54,285
We have an agreement.

508
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:56,039
But can it not be Pear?

509
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:06,049
She and I are friends.

510
00:38:09,362 --> 00:38:11,362
That’s too hurtful, Not.

511
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,391
I can’t.

512
00:38:23,964 --> 00:38:25,365
She’s the only one I like.

513
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:30,709
I must be honest about my feelings too.

514
00:38:32,524 --> 00:38:33,319
Right?

515
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:56,996
So that means, aside from ours,

516
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,140
everyone else's life is miserable.

517
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:03,863
Just like I saw in the future.

518
00:39:05,897 --> 00:39:07,644
Pear's, in particular.

519
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:08,699
Pear.

520
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:20,715
The question is

521
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:24,699
are we really letting these things happen?

522
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:34,524
If we do what’s right for us but it leads other people’s lives to mistakes,

523
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,772
can we still call it righteousness?

524
00:39:55,634 --> 00:39:56,991
We just got together

525
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:00,638
and now we’re already blaming ourselves,

526
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:04,373
and feeling so responsible for others.

527
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:10,667
Well, then.

528
00:40:12,137 --> 00:40:13,663
Should we keep dating?

529
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,521
I get what you said.

530
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:32,966
But I can’t help thinking if you’re dating some girl, not me,

531
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:37,442
will you be this worried?

532
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:39,970
Will you be this guilty?

533
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:48,076
No.

534
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:51,521
It has nothing to do with that.

535
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,661
If you ask me if I want to continue dating you,

536
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:02,608
the answer is yes.

537
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:05,467
Because I don’t want to lose you anymore.

538
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:11,975
But is there any other way we can make things better?

539
00:41:27,502 --> 00:41:29,157
I think the only thing we can do is

540
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:36,236
no matter what happens, we hold hands and get through it together.

541
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,681
That thing you told me

542
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,703
about Kawi and Pisaeng,

543
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,218
I know it’s true.

544
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:59,249
Sorry, I didn’t believe you before.

545
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:04,190
It’s fine.

546
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,098
No problem at all.

547
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:08,406
I’m okay now that you know the truth.

548
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:14,411
Then…

549
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:17,608
Can I ask you something?

550
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:23,597
I don’t want you to tell more people about them.

551
00:42:25,995 --> 00:42:28,886
I don’t want them to feel bad and uncomfortable.

552
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:31,886
And it’s their personal matter.

553
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:35,086
You’re still protecting them?

554
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:39,419
Well, they are my friends.

555
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,084
And they are your friends too.

556
00:42:44,382 --> 00:42:45,073
Aren’t they?

557
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,033
Just because you asked,

558
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:54,135
I won’t say anything.

559
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:00,806
Thank you.

560
00:43:05,956 --> 00:43:07,202
Will you excuse me then?

561
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:10,415
Hold on a second.

562
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:15,086
You called me here because of just this?

563
00:43:16,203 --> 00:43:16,815
Um.

564
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:18,964
Why?

565
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:20,897
Well…

566
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:29,440
Not.

567
00:43:32,312 --> 00:43:34,709
I know how you feel about me.

568
00:43:38,943 --> 00:43:40,369
But I don’t like you that way.

569
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:45,436
All I can give you is friendship.

570
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:49,787
I’m truly sorry.

571
00:43:58,033 --> 00:44:05,478
Another thing that is also important is that we have hope.

572
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:12,049
I don’t know what makes you believe only bad things will happen in the future.

573
00:44:13,407 --> 00:44:15,614
But can’t we just be optimistic?

574
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,213
I’d like to believe otherwise.

575
00:44:22,189 --> 00:44:25,787
I believe things won’t turn into mistakes.

576
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:31,925
I believe everyone will do the right thing.

577
00:44:34,143 --> 00:44:40,140
I believe the future will be as good as it can get.

578
00:44:43,178 --> 00:44:44,558
But no matter what happens,

579
00:44:46,029 --> 00:44:53,406
I believe there’s nothing more right than us being together.

580
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:36,806
I want to crash here with you tonight.

581
00:45:36,806 --> 00:45:37,669
Hey!

582
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:38,966
Go take a shower.

583
00:45:41,013 --> 00:45:43,013
Why do I have to see you unclothing?

584
00:45:43,953 --> 00:45:44,915
Wanna shower with me?

585
00:45:48,406 --> 00:45:50,340
Not this ride. It’s too much.

586
00:45:50,495 --> 00:45:51,237
I don’t like it.

587
00:45:51,237 --> 00:45:53,406
You haven’t tried it yet.
How do you know if you like it or not?

588
00:45:54,058 --> 00:45:55,920
If you’re afraid, just hold on to my hand.

589
00:45:56,334 --> 00:45:56,963
Okay?
