Pisaeng.

5
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:18,976
Thank you for asking me to move in.

6
00:00:22,226 --> 00:00:22,893
Hey.

7
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:24,360
You have a temperature.

8
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:26,018
No.

9
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:27,772
Don’t get too close or you’ll catch the fever too.

10
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:29,908
If that’s the case, I should have been sick already.

11
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:31,691
We are always together.

12
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,862
What is this, doctor? Isn’t it just influenza?

13
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,041
And he must have got it from me.

14
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,480
Why is his condition more severe than others, doc?

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,026
Pisaeng.

16
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:43,722
Ever since he got admitted, have you got any sleep?

17
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,177
You should go back and get a good sleep.

18
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:48,342
Or you might be worse than Kawi.

19
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:50,452
Pisaeng.

20
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,710
I know you’re worried about him.

21
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:55,116
But he’s already under medical care.

22
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:30,886
Kawi.

23
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:34,040
Are you really not signing with that record label?

24
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,979
You told me they could make you famous.

25
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:42,311
I know that will happen.

26
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:44,152
That’s why I’m not signing.

27
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:48,687
Why not?

28
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,327
Well…

29
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,284
Come to think of it,

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,740
I don’t want to be in that position anymore.

31
00:02:58,437 --> 00:03:03,781
Money and fame come with all toxic things in life.

32
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:05,830
My private life will be violated.

33
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:07,282
It’s not worth it.

34
00:03:18,444 --> 00:03:21,889
I asked myself what I truly wanted.

35
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:25,004
And I think I’m happy just the way I am now.

36
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:27,755
I write songs for people to sing.

37
00:03:28,462 --> 00:03:30,635
At least I have a job and money to spend.

38
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:33,639
I play with Fluke and the band when I have free time.

39
00:03:34,223 --> 00:03:35,274
That’s enough for me.

40
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:49,166
But what you’re missing is a lot.

41
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,573
Don’t you feel like it’s a shame?

42
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,173
If it doesn’t suit you or belong to you,

43
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:04,194
why would you feel like it’s a shame?

44
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:12,575
What should I put here?

45
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:26,680
Is it because of me?

46
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:31,797
What do you mean?

47
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:38,160
Am I the reason you’re not signing with that record label?

48
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:42,010
Hey.

49
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:44,388
Don’t make it up in your head.

50
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:47,881
Kawi.

51
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:53,984
If they don’t want you to reveal anything about us, I’m okay with that.

52
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:59,316
I don't have to exist if it would help you succeed.

53
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
I told you it’s not about that.

54
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:15,927
The truth is…

55
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:19,160
I came from the future.

56
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:23,265
The crystal ball music box in my room,

57
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:28,504
that’s what sent me back here.

58
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:34,720
What’s the matter?

59
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:42,509
Nothing.

60
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:44,200
It’s nothing.

61
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,148
Don’t you have anything to do today?

62
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,678
Don’t you have anything to do today, sir?

63
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:35,998
No.

64
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:37,939
I’m free today.

65
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:42,992
Aren’t you going out?

66
00:07:58,051 --> 00:07:58,650
Hey.

67
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:04,905
Hey!

68
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:07,425
Are you all right?

69
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:11,277
Yeah.

70
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:13,087
No.

71
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:16,547
We should just stay in and do something fun.

72
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:18,822
Come on.

73
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:22,241
There’s nothing fun to do here, sir.

74
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,149
Should we…

75
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:27,784
go out?

76
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:35,125
Fine.

77
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:38,197
Let’s do it.

78
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:40,464
Let’s go to a theme park.

79
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:43,000
Hey.

80
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:46,753
How do you know I want to go there?

81
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,609
Well…

82
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:56,279
I just know.

83
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,907
I’ve always wanted to come here since I was a child.

84
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:22,632
I’ve never been here before.

85
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:25,827
Let’s get inside.

86
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:39,307
I feel like today happened already.

87
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:46,017
Do you think so?

88
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,071
I spun your crystal ball

89
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:04,059
and it took me back here.

90
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,077
Just what I thought.

91
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:41,161
I must confess that when you first told me about this,

92
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:44,157
I was doubtful.

93
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,384
In fact, I wasn’t quite convinced.

94
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,064
Up until now.

95
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:58,160
I must thank myself then

96
00:11:00,186 --> 00:11:01,440
for being deadly sick

97
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:04,720
and making you desperate enough to spin the crystal ball.

98
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,410
And you finally believed me.

99
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:15,311
I’m sorry.

100
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:18,392
Come on.

101
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:20,595
You don’t need to apologize.

102
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:23,590
Things like this are hard to believe.

103
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:26,059
I get you.

104
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:37,817
So how are we doing there?

105
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,655
Leave out the part where I’m sick.

106
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:47,099
Nothing new.

107
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,300
We still live together.

108
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:52,962
I get older

109
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:55,728
but you’re still the same.

110
00:11:58,161 --> 00:11:59,218
How come?

111
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,155
We’re the same age.

112
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,813
Why are you the only one who grows old?

113
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:05,309
I don’t know.

114
00:12:07,014 --> 00:12:08,160
I start to have gray hair.

115
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,171
But you don’t.

116
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:12,996
Yeah?

117
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:32,731
Actually, I'm sorry for more than just not believing you.

118
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,359
I’m sorry for not taking good enough care of you.

119
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:45,740
You’re sick because of me.

120
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,024
Now that

121
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,414
you came back here,

122
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:24,137
have you thought about how you’d fix that?

123
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:36,914
I have no idea.

124
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:39,288
I can’t come up with anything.

125
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:48,160
All I know is I don’t want you to die.

126
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:51,232
I don’t want you to get sick.

127
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:58,815
Right.

128
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:02,756
What can I do?

129
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:13,616
No idea.

130
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:16,254
It’s 10 years ahead.

131
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:18,752
You can take your time to think.

132
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:22,383
Let’s enjoy today as much as we can.

133
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:23,512
Okay?

134
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:29,896

Let’s go.

170
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:16,992
No. Go where?

171
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,600
No way. No!

172
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:36,195
Argh!

173
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:47,640
Are you getting on this ride?

174
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:51,251
Yes.

175
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:52,561
Why?

176
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:57,950
The last time, you said you were scared of it.

177
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:03,519
I admit I’m scared.

178
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,036
But we’re already at a theme park.

179
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:12,160
If we don't try it, it's as if we've never been here at all.

180
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:18,160
I should be the one who says that.

181
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:38,308
If you’re scared, just hold on to each other’s hand.

182
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:44,874
Um.

183
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:05,175
Argh!

184
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:06,187
It hasn’t even started yet.

185
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:07,325
Oh!

186
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:09,093
Pisaeng!

187
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,050
Are you okay?

188
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:34,653
I am.

189
00:18:35,637 --> 00:18:36,714
But I need a little rest.

190
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:41,301
If I’d known you’d be sick,

191
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:43,443
I wouldn’t have made you get on the ride.

192
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:47,186
Look. I’m okay.

193
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,020
It’s pretty fun.

194
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:02,622
Hey.

195
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:06,273
What happens in the next 10 years exactly?

196
00:19:06,975 --> 00:19:09,524
How come you’re more paranoid than me now?

197
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:10,331
Hm?

198
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:23,214
If we woke up and got to spend today over and over,

199
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:26,323
that’d be great.

200
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,473
Like in Groundhog Day?

201
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:32,188
Hey. I don’t think so.

202
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:34,784
Why?

203
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:37,863
Do you not want tomorrow to come?

204
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:53,456
I do, only if I don’t lose you.

205
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:57,461
- But–
- Pisaeng.

206
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,505
You will never lose me.

207
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:19,689
Should we go home?

208
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:21,772
Hold on.

209
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:31,822
Can you please tell me the plan in your head?

210
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:36,192
Do you want to change anything?

211
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:47,717
What if we stop being together?

212
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:52,732
What do you say?

213
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,424
I love you.

214
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:32,120
But being together costs you so much.

215
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:35,313
I’m the reason you’re sick.

216
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:38,035
And I can’t help you with anything.

217
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
If you know this is your future,

218
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,073
will you want to change it too?

219
00:21:59,137 --> 00:22:01,463
This time, the one who came from the future is you.

220
00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:05,268
You can’t ask me.

221
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,234
Ask yourself

222
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:12,448
if you want to change anything.

223
00:22:30,718 --> 00:22:31,748
If I said no,

224
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:36,807
would I sound like a selfish person?

225
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:45,995
No.

226
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:51,025
Because I don’t want to change anything either.

227
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,787
You…

228
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,401
are the right thing for me.

229
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:13,269
I want to have you in my life

230
00:23:15,438 --> 00:23:16,824
no matter what happens.

231
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:30,520
What if I’m going to lose you for real?

232
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:33,507
There’s a chance that you…

233
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:42,460
If you’re scared,

234
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,597
just hold on to each other’s hand.

235
00:24:53,775 --> 00:24:54,570
I’m sorry.

236
00:24:55,864 --> 00:24:57,320
I forgot you don’t like it.

237
00:24:58,828 --> 00:24:59,945
You can leave it open.

238
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:04,984
It’s nice to feel the breeze.

239
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:55,186
(And that was the last time we got to travel back in time.)

240
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:03,810
(The key lesson I learned from this miracle wasn’t how to mend the past.)

241
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:08,582
(But it’s that we must choose to live the life

242
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:12,949
we never want to go back and fix it.)

243
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:17,492
The patient is well recovering.

244
00:27:18,624 --> 00:27:21,392
I’m transferring him to a regular patient room.

245
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:23,212
Thank you, doctor.

246
00:27:25,802 --> 00:27:26,808
Thank you very much.

247
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:55,102
I know what you sneakily did.

248
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:39,506
Why are you covering my eyes?

249
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:41,238
Just hold on.

250
00:28:41,372 --> 00:28:42,004
Keep walking.

251
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:43,283
Am I going to bump into something?

252
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:45,625
A bit to the right.

253
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:46,617
Now go straight.

254
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:48,526
Are we there yet?

255
00:28:50,722 --> 00:28:51,652
Right here.

256
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:56,082
Yeah!

257
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:57,446
He lives!

258
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:59,691
Welcome home, Kawi.

259
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,221
Congrats.

260
00:29:01,221 --> 00:29:02,773
You’ve lost some weight.

261
00:29:02,978 --> 00:29:04,076
Thank you, guys.

262
00:29:05,894 --> 00:29:06,705
We missed you.

263
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:08,777
Kawi, you survived.

264
00:29:34,668 --> 00:29:35,437
Oh, please.

265
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:36,806
Stop already.

266
00:29:36,806 --> 00:29:38,235
Why do you keep looking into the mirror?

267
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:41,806
You did it at home, in the car, and here.

268
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:44,004
When will we get to go inside?

269
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:46,293
Come on.

270
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:48,067
Help me check. Do I look pale?

271
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:49,601
Are my lips pale?

272
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:51,996
No.

273
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:53,482
You’re cute.

274
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:56,389
Be honest. I’m being serious here.

275
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,986
Don’t compliment me if you don’t mean it.

276
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,553
And why are you losing your self-confidence all of a sudden?

277
00:30:04,773 --> 00:30:08,403
You’re not the one who just recovered from the deadly illness.

278
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:19,277
Kawi.

279
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:21,806
You’re way past that.

280
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,806
Just be happy now.

281
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:30,872
Don’t let anything that was already through affect you in the present.

282
00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:41,881
You got a point.

283
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,330
But…

284
00:30:49,203 --> 00:30:51,203
I didn’t get through it alone.

285
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:56,023
We got through it together.

286
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:10,227
If it wasn't for the strength you showed in warning me when I traveled back there,

287
00:31:10,783 --> 00:31:12,783
I wouldn’t be able to get through it.

288
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,050
Come to think of it, we’re a great team.

289
00:31:19,104 --> 00:31:22,934
When one is weak, the other is still strong.

290
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,431
That’s why

291
00:31:30,564 --> 00:31:32,224
we need to always stick together.

292
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,053
Ahem.

293
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:40,248
Whose wedding is this exactly?

294
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:44,486
Are you guys the guests or the hosts?

295
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:49,300
Today, we are the guests.

296
00:31:49,744 --> 00:31:50,929
But one day,

297
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,239
we will be the hosts for sure.

298
00:31:55,358 --> 00:31:56,505
What are you saying?

299
00:31:58,492 --> 00:32:00,391
Come on. Let’s get inside.

300
00:32:38,472 --> 00:32:40,472
What’s wrong?

301
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:46,067
I’m happy for Pear.

302
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:51,334
Seeing her now reminds me of her then.

303
00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:56,065
When I traveled back in time to try to make her like me.

304
00:32:57,945 --> 00:32:59,605
The harder I tried, the worse it got.

305
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:05,367
I hope she’s found her true happiness.

306
00:33:07,596 --> 00:33:10,040
Pear chose the right thing for herself.

307
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:12,224
Just like us.

308
00:33:16,092 --> 00:33:16,894
Or what?

309
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:21,806
Do you still want to travel back in time and try hitting on her again?

310
00:33:23,482 --> 00:33:24,256
What?

311
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:25,743
Are you jealous?

312
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:28,466
No.

313
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:30,137
I’m just saying.

314
00:33:33,225 --> 00:33:35,617
I spun the crystal ball just for fun.

315
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:38,704
But it didn’t take me anywhere anymore.

316
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:41,806
It’s like what the uncle said.

317
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:44,664
The crystal ball’s power isn’t infinite.

318
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,009
It’s become an ordinary crystal ball now.

319
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:55,611
If it still has power,

320
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,244
do you want to change anything?

321
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:03,073
Do you still want to be the one standing there next to Pear?

322
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:11,265
No.

323
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:14,001
I like my life.

324
00:34:16,276 --> 00:34:17,962
I like being with you the most.

325
00:34:23,116 --> 00:34:26,806
(We all have different concepts of living the right life.)

326
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:36,156
(No one can tell if your life choices are right or not,

327
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:39,459
but you can.)

328
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,200
Let’s go out front.

329
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,071
One, two, three.

330
00:34:48,197 --> 00:34:49,073
Hey!

331
00:35:01,357 --> 00:35:02,913
Woo-hoo!

332
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:06,263
(For me,

333
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:09,072
no matter what happens,

334
00:35:10,768 --> 00:35:12,663
being his

335
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:16,611
and belonging to one another

336
00:35:17,611 --> 00:35:20,108
is the rightest thing.)

337
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:53,646
Here.

338
00:35:57,828 --> 00:35:58,690
What?

339
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:01,146
An anniversary gift.

340
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,296
But I already lost track of how many years.

341
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:22,497
You don’t like it?

342
00:36:24,327 --> 00:36:25,339
It’s not that.

343
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:28,339
But I got this from you before.

344
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:33,854
I mean before I traveled back to be with you.

345
00:36:35,552 --> 00:36:36,688
Back then,

346
00:36:38,648 --> 00:36:41,806
our situation was so bad.

347
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,956
But it didn’t end the same way finally.

348
00:36:50,147 --> 00:36:50,860
Right.

349
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,316
I just didn’t think I’d get it from you again.

350
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:57,166
Thank you.

351
00:37:27,276 --> 00:37:28,221
What are you looking at?

352
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:31,524
A cute person.

353
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:35,382
Seriously.

354
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,806
Aren’t you sick of it?

355
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:38,624
How many years have you been saying that?

356
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:41,538
I’m not.

357
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:45,263
I'll keep saying it until you stop being cute,

358
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:49,294
which will never happen.

359
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:52,216
Sweet talker.

360
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:02,197
Hey.

361
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:04,414
Can I get a gift too?

362
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:10,807
What do you want?

00:38:24,754 --> 00:38:26,989

are the right thing for me.

377
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:34,512
Was that enough?

378
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:36,916
No.

379
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:40,074
But I’ll get more later tonight.

380
00:39:40,074 --> 00:39:40,753
Cheeky!

381
00:39:41,137 --> 00:39:42,588
You’re becoming too much these days.

382
00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:53,378
Hey.

383
00:39:55,678 --> 00:39:56,934
At Pear’s wedding,

384
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:04,268
you asked me if I wanted to travel back in time and fix anything.

385
00:40:05,395 --> 00:40:06,951
It’s my turn to ask you.

386
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:11,982
If we could still travel back in time, would you want to do it?

387
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:16,018
Yes.

388
00:40:23,012 --> 00:40:25,012
I want to go back and hit on you again.

389
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,900
And I’ll do it over and over.

Hey!

408
00:42:18,554 --> 00:42:19,449
What are you doing?

409
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,623
Taking my boyfriend’s pics.

410
00:42:21,308 --> 00:42:21,977
Look.

411
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:27,150
Why are you smiling so widely?

412
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:28,686
Are you so happy?

413
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:30,822
I’m happy for our friend.

414
00:42:34,564 --> 00:42:36,564
I’m so happy for Pear.

415
00:42:37,028 --> 00:42:40,439
She finally found someone who’ll make her really happy.

416
00:42:41,502 --> 00:42:42,526
Wanna get married too?

417
00:42:43,545 --> 00:42:44,391
Nah.

418
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:45,871
You didn’t even think.

419
00:42:46,326 --> 00:42:47,351
A wedding?

420
00:42:47,552 --> 00:42:49,552
I don’t need to think. It’s exhausting and costly.

421
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:53,082
We can have a small wedding in a garden or maybe on the beach.

422
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,415
Let’s decide again in a couple of years.

423
00:42:54,415 --> 00:42:55,069
No.

424
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:56,219
Five years then.

425
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:56,806
No.

426
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:58,193
Why not?

427
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,073
I already told you why.

428
00:43:00,618 --> 00:43:01,733
You will change your mind.

429
00:43:01,733 --> 00:43:02,618
I know it.

430
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:03,713
No way.

431
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:05,715
If we’re to have a wedding, we must have no more than 30 guests.

432
00:43:06,456 --> 00:43:07,637
Whatever you say.

433
00:43:08,343 --> 00:43:09,423
Oh, yeah?

434
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,016
Look at this event.

435
00:43:12,016 --> 00:43:13,761
I think it’s too big.

436
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:15,607
We can’t take care of all the guests equally.

437
00:43:16,018 --> 00:43:16,615
So…

438
00:43:16,615 --> 00:43:17,678
are we having a wedding?

439
00:43:18,645 --> 00:43:19,809
No.

440
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:22,088
I went to a friend’s wedding at the beach before.

441
00:43:22,088 --> 00:43:22,913
It was not good.

442
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:24,123
It was hot and tiring.

443
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:25,086
My skin was sticky.

444
00:43:25,127 --> 00:43:27,127
I think we should hold it at a hotel.

445
00:43:27,127 --> 00:43:28,330
We don’t need to worry about the weather.

446
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:30,472
Okay. Got it.

447
00:43:31,113 --> 00:43:32,146
Got what?

448
00:43:32,146 --> 00:43:33,623
I wasn’t talking about our wedding. No.

449
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,476
Let’s get married.

450
00:43:35,476 --> 00:43:36,063
No.

451
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:38,323
We can have a wedding on the moon.
