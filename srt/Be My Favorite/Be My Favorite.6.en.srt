[Pisaeng: Come see me at the faculty building rooftop.]

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,935
Pisaeng.

6
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,397
I have something important to say to you as well.

7
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:22,367
I like you.

8
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:25,640
I think you know I can’t accept your feelings.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,166
I can be your friend though.

10
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:28,486
If that’s okay with you.

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,638
I’m okay.

12
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:27,298
Eat all you want.

13
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:28,766
This meal is on me.

14
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:35,923
Guys, we’re taking off now.

15
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:38,238
Don’t forget to turn off the AC when you’re done eating.

16
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:40,145
Eat with us.

17
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:41,268
I ordered a lot.

18
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,884
You two enjoy. We’re playing at the bar.

19
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:47,680
By the way, I’m going to tell the owner I’m bringing you next time.

20
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,196
Seriously?

21
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:50,038
Yeah.

22
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:51,299
Sing with us.

23
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,554
Sure. Thanks.

24
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:54,038
Yeah. See you later.

25
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:57,096
Wow.

26
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:03,142
You ordered so much food.

27
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:04,446
Finish them all.

28
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:14,237
I don’t know.

29
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:18,314
It’s an old habit.

30
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,122
Actually, I haven't had much of an appetite lately.

31
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:24,253
You haven’t had much of an appetite?

32
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:31,562
Is something bothering you?

33
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:43,599
Yes.

34
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:46,231
My dad is sick.

35
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:48,268
You know that, right?

36
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:53,753
Yeah. You told me.

37
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,837
But he’s getting treatment, isn’t he?

38
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:03,118
He’s received care through Social Security for over a year.

39
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:07,202
They simply give him medications and symptomatic treatment.

40
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:12,487
Just three months ago, they transferred him to a specific institute.

41
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:16,533
But it requires some traveling. It’s here in Bangkok.

42
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,877
That’s why his attendance is inconsistent.

43
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,212
And that’s why his condition is getting worse.

44
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:27,362
I tried so hard to persuade him to get back to treatment.

45
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:31,816
Then the new doctor said my dad might need surgery.

46
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:36,535
But the waiting list is so lengthy that we must wait until the second half of next year.

47
00:03:38,657 --> 00:03:40,129
And that’ll be too late.

48
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:42,390
Too late?

49
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:44,148
Too late for what?

50
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:56,177
My dad is not healthy.

51
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm scared he'll die before he gets to the surgery.

52
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:10,268
My mom remarried and is now living abroad.

53
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,979
She barely contacts us.

54
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,752
My dad is all I have.

55
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:21,862
Without him, I have no one left.

56
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:40,092
Hey.

57
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:43,976
Pear’s father is a cardiothoracic surgeon.

58
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:45,709
You can talk to her.

59
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,647
Yes, really, Dad.

60
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:07,232
It’s true. I’m back to singing again.

61
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,503
A group of friends asked me if I wanted to join them.

62
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,170
Is that so?

63
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:15,206
(They said I’d get to sing at the bar.)

64
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,831
Will that affect your study?

65
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:20,447
(Come on, Dad.)

66
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:21,976
I sing only 2-3 nights a week.

67
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:26,131
What if people from an entertainment company come to the bar?

68
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:29,869
I might become a famous singer.

69
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:38,409
Dad.

70
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,922
Now that you know, live a long life with me, okay?

71
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:51,960
(If I become well-known, you’ll be proud.)

72
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:59,119
(Oh, I just went to see the doctor last month.)

73
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:02,904
He said if the surgery was necessary, it should take place in the middle of next year.

74
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,013
Dad.

75
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,360
What if I can find a doctor who can treat you quicker than that?

76
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:16,978
Who?

77
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,574
[A meal with Pear’s father.]

78
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:31,718
I’m not going out tonight if that’s what you’re asking me.

79
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:34,832
I don't have as much money as you to party every night.

80
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:36,632
No.

81
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:38,621
I’m not asking you to go anywhere.

82
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:41,055
I’m just sick of Not’s group.

83
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,232
And Kawi is eating at Pear’s.

84
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:46,345
I didn’t know who to go to.

85
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:47,640
Are we friends already?

86
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,262
Hey!

87
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,273
Max.

88
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:01,370
Can I ask you something?

89
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:02,618
Um.

90
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:06,263
When you realized you’re not the same as others,

91
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
did you feel isolated?

92
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:23,719
If I said no, that’d be a lie.

93
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:29,437
Miss Treedaow,

94
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:33,099
you’re a female tycoon who has achieved great success in various fields,
[Treedaow Jirawarakul, Businesswoman of the Era]

95
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:40,122
like real estate, an import business, restaurants, and even a football club.

96
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:43,097
Do you still have any other businesses you want to get your hands on?

97
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:45,852
That depends on time and opportunity.

98
00:07:45,852 --> 00:07:49,865
I heard you’re interested in politics. Is that true?

99
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:51,981
Where did you hear that from?

100
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,000
Let’s put it this way.

101
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:54,957
(As a citizen…)

102
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:55,638
Hey.

103
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,705
Do you know this woman?

104
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:00,000
She shares your last name.

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,609
(I'd be delighted to contribute my skills to benefit our country.)

106
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:05,329
Why do you ask?

107
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,436
(But it all depends on timing and opportunity.)

108
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:08,144
Nothing.

109
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:10,734
I’ve been following her.

110
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:14,072
I like what she says.

111
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:15,480
Yeah?

112
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:37,120
Kawi, everything on this table is my dad’s cooking.

113
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:40,799
They look wonderful, sir.

114
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,187
Do you drink wine?

115
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:44,526
I can use a drinking buddy.

116
00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:47,840
I’m not very good at drinking, sir.

117
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,922
Then you practice tonight.

118
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:56,317
Thank you.

119
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:12,941
Please.

120
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:15,390
Dad.

121
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,784
You're a bad influence for encouraging him to drink.

122
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:24,562
According to studies, a glass of red wine a day is beneficial to your heart.

123
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:29,240
But I think a bottle a day is better.

124
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:36,000
Please.

125
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:39,769
How is it?

126
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:41,132
So good.

127
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:50,272
(How should I start talking about my dad?)

128
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:51,531
(Should I say it now?)

129
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:52,704
There’s more.

130
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:57,099
(Not good.)

131
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,295
(It’s too early.)

132
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:00,899
(He might think that I only came to ask for a favor.)

133
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:02,974
(I should wait a little longer.)

134
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:03,924
Dad.

135
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:04,812
Hm?

136
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,275
Kawi’s father is having heart disease.

137
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:11,651
It’s pretty severe.

138
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:13,340
Is that so?

139
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,208
He’s waiting to get treatment in a public facility.

140
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:19,660
It should be some time before he is treated.

141
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,271
Ah.

142
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:23,196
Can you…

143
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,181
take Kawi’s dad as a patient under your care?

144
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:32,462
Kawi,

145
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,481
my dad is so good.

146
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:38,556
He must be able to find a way to help him.

147
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:43,827
Pear.

148
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:46,638
I’m not that good.

149
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,360
You are that good, Dad.

150
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:52,360
You’re a great doctor.

151
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,815
With your help, I’m sure Kawi’s dad will be all right.

152
00:10:56,815 --> 00:10:58,025
Please.

153
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:59,760
Please help, Dad.

154
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,294
Please.

155
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,000
Please help him.

156
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,346
Please.

157
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,364
Please, Dad.

158
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:10,009
Would you excuse me? I need to use the bathroom.

159
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:33,160
The new doctor said my dad might need surgery.

160
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,323
But the waiting list is so lengthy that we must wait until the second half of next year.

161
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:46,599
Pisaeng.

162
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,000
Where are you?

163
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,811
Me?

164
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:51,950
At the café Max works for.

165
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,450
What?

166
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,845
How come are you with Max?

167
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:55,332
Why? What happened?

168
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:56,998
Stay where you are.

169
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:58,209
I’m coming to you now.

170
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:01,591
Kawi.

171
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:06,584
Are you okay?

172
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:12,479
Why are you here?

173
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:15,102
You said you needed to use the bathroom.

174
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,715
Pear, I’m sorry.

175
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:19,511
I just realized I got something urgent to do.

176
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:20,991
I need to go now.

177
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:21,826
Sorry, Pear.

178
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,498
You’ll know once he gets here.

179
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,062
Pisaeng.

180
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,972
Why did you tell Pear about my dad?

181
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:51,283
I just wanted to help.

182
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:54,225
You’re finding a way to treat your dad, aren’t you?

183
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:57,342
If I waited for you to tell Pear yourself, it’d be too late already.

184
00:12:57,342 --> 00:13:00,416
Right! But I should’ve been the one who said it.

185
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,158
Why did you guys even bother to talk inside?

186
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:04,561
I can hear it from here.

187
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,453
Damn you!

188
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,754
[Mom: I’m flying back from Hong Kong.]

189
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:59,233
[Mom: But I might need to go to Phuket right away.]

190
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,027
[Mom: I’ll see you on Sunday, son.]

191
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:29,807
Is it Pisaeng?

192
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,914
Damn right.

193
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,231
It’s Pisaeng.

194
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:34,238
He told Pear about my dad.

195
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,000
I just don’t get him.

196
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,899
I mean the one that likes you.

197
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:39,880
Is it Pisaeng?

198
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:58,340
The only bar I know is this place.

199
00:14:58,712 --> 00:14:59,874
Are you okay with it?

200
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,269
Anywhere that serves alcohol will do.

201
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:07,715
You’ve been drinking more lately.

202
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:08,933
Do you even realize it?

203
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:14,665
Damn you.

204
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:16,939
Seriously.

205
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:18,839
Why?

206
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:23,541
Why do you always have problems when people try to help you?

207
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:27,039
You know?

208
00:15:27,815 --> 00:15:30,000
I feel so sorry for Pisaeng.

209
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,480
He’s done so much for you.

210
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,769
But you let your stupid ego hurt him.

211
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:36,000
What’s wrong with you?

212
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:41,300
It’s not ego.

213
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,598
I just don’t know how much longer he is going to be nice to me

214
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:48,955
when the thing between us is impossible anywhere.

215
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:51,508
If he continues being nice like this,

216
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:54,072
how will things turn out in the end?

217
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,190
Let me ask you something.

218
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,740
How do you feel about him exactly?

219
00:16:27,606 --> 00:16:29,420
Why did you ask me that?

220
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,550
And why are you having this reaction?

221
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:53,325
[Incoming Call - Kawi]

222
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:31,886
If you want to be angry with me, go ahead.

223
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:35,160
But I’m telling you, I’m not saying sorry.

224
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,199
I did what I thought I should.

225
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:39,562
And I just wanted to help you.

226
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:48,793
Whatever you think of it, I will accept it in the end.

227
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:08,585
I’m sorry.

228
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,389
I really am sorry.

229
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:22,530
And I’d like to thank you too.

230
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:28,816
Because what you do for me…

231
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,728
means the world to me.

232
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:53,093
Are you drunk?

233
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:54,251
I’m not.

234
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:02,320
Yes, I am.

235
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,239
I just drank with Max.

236
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,214
But I’m saying it not because I’m drunk.

237
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,401
I really want to apologize.

238
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:18,986
It’s my bad.

239
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,509
I’m mad at myself.

240
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,118
I just want to make things better

241
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:30,772
but I can’t.

242
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,705
Everything is ruined.

243
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:38,812
And I need people’s help all the time.

244
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:42,247
I suck.

245
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:47,714
It’s a matter of life and death for my dad

246
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:51,364
yet I can’t do anything about it.

247
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:52,989
What do you think you can do?

248
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:54,797
You’re not a doctor.

249
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,987
And since when asking for help sucks?

250
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:08,598
But recently,

251
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,780
you’ve been helping me a lot.

252
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:19,565
It is so much that I don’t know how to pay you back.

253
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:25,687
If that’s all you can think of, you can rest.

254
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,323
I don’t need anything back from you.

255
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:32,515
Pisaeng.

256
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:02,500
I’ve got something to say.

257
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,319
My head feels heavy.

258
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:16,849
Hey!

259
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:28,798
Pear.

260
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:31,338
Hey.

261
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:32,955
Not.

262
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,248
Why are you here alone?

263
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:41,462
I’ve never seen you in this bar before.

264
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:45,881
Our friends like to come here.

265
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:48,575
So I thought if I stopped by I might see some of them.

266
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:50,799
But I didn’t.

267
00:24:52,528 --> 00:24:53,306
You did see me.

268
00:25:09,518 --> 00:25:10,561
Where are we going?

269
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:22,980
Hey.

270
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:25,183
Don’t sleep yet. Change first.

271
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:27,475
Here.

272
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,885
Done.

273
00:25:48,434 --> 00:25:49,234
Change your pants.

274
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:54,526
Fine.

275
00:25:59,061 --> 00:25:59,734
Kawi.

276
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:00,681
Wear these pants.

277
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:01,329
Here.

278
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:10,957
Done.

279
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:13,665
Change your top too.

280
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,335
Why?

281
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:52,596
Why do you have to be so nice to me?

282
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:57,919
I told you.

283
00:26:58,978 --> 00:26:59,727
I like you.

284
00:27:05,117 --> 00:27:05,843
Like?

285
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:08,917
Why?

286
00:27:10,851 --> 00:27:12,516
Why do you like someone like me?

287
00:27:13,877 --> 00:27:16,777
I can’t see any good in me.

288
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:21,360
You’re a great guy.

289
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:24,482
You can like anyone.

290
00:27:27,055 --> 00:27:28,622
I’m a loser.

291
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:30,681
I’m poor.

292
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:33,238
And I’m mean.

293
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:38,497
I don’t see how I’m a good match for you.

294
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:45,541
You’re cute.

295
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:47,922
Does this reason sound enough?

296
00:30:48,143 --> 00:30:50,001
You said you’d fly to Phuket in the morning.

297
00:30:50,552 --> 00:30:51,827
A change of plan.

298
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:54,988
Come.

299
00:30:57,495 --> 00:30:58,684
Come and give me a hug.

300
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:02,406
Are you too grown up to hug your mom? Come.

301
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:09,986
Happy I’m here, aren’t you?

302
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:19,900
That’s enough, Mom.

303
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:22,804
Well, well.

304
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,599
You drink with your friends and with other people.

305
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:30,574
But with me, you’re reluctant.

306
00:31:39,476 --> 00:31:46,367
My employees saw you in a place you don’t normally go.

307
00:31:49,418 --> 00:31:54,800
You know most of my employees are people from that community, right?

308
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,319
We talked about this.

309
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:07,439
Whatever decision you make, I should be the first one you talk to.

310
00:32:11,144 --> 00:32:11,809
Mom.

311
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:17,121
You might be able to use your crafty talk to buy time when I was 15.

312
00:32:17,847 --> 00:32:19,626
But I’m 20 now.

313
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:22,564
I’m old enough and confident in what I am.

314
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:26,622
If you can’t take it, that’s your problem.

315
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,306
You think someone like me can’t take it?

316
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:37,128
Knowing your sexuality is one thing.

317
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:41,164
But telling people what you are is another.

318
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:45,202
That later one is what destines your life,

319
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:48,294
what you can do, and what you cannot.

320
00:32:50,231 --> 00:32:51,748
You said you’re confident.

321
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:53,751
But have you thought about this stuff?

322
00:33:02,469 --> 00:33:03,986
So why exactly are you here, Pear?

323
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:07,547
Why?

324
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,800
I’m not allowed to feel like drinking and listening to music?

325
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:11,909
You are.

326
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:17,006
I just thought you’d like a pretty bar,

327
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,404
not this type of bar.

328
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:22,924
Do you want to go to a nicer place?

329
00:33:22,924 --> 00:33:23,468
I can take you.

330
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:29,724
You mean some other night, right?

331
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:31,822
Because I’m going home soon.

332
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:45,391
Where is Kawi by the way?

333
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:52,431
I don’t know.

334
00:33:58,026 --> 00:34:01,041
Are you and Kawi dating?

335
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:04,961
Hey. I didn’t mean to intrude. I just–

336
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:05,491
No.

337
00:34:06,316 --> 00:34:07,611
Kawi and I are friends.

338
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,876
Does everyone think Kawi and I are together?

339
00:34:18,197 --> 00:34:18,697
No.

340
00:34:19,247 --> 00:34:20,076
Not everyone.

341
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,584
Some people don’t think so.

342
00:34:21,765 --> 00:34:22,828
I don’t think so either.

343
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,339
Pear.

344
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:46,033
Do you really think Kawi is straight?

345
00:34:47,956 --> 00:34:48,868
What do you mean?

346
00:34:49,794 --> 00:34:52,533
Well, he’s a cute guy.

347
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:55,075
It’s not weird that girls like him.

348
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:57,684
But...

349
00:34:59,636 --> 00:35:01,195
I don’t think he’s a straight man.

350
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:07,439
And what is a straight man supposed to be?

351
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,027
Like you?

352
00:35:53,723 --> 00:35:54,402
Pisaeng,

353
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:57,937
I’ve got something to tell you.

354
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,150
The truth is

355
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,274
I came from the future.

356
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:14,096
The crystal ball music box in my room,

357
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:20,681
that’s what sent me back here.

358
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,268
Pisaeng.

359
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:05,607
You’re up.

360
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:07,267
Want a coffee?

361
00:37:10,682 --> 00:37:12,501
Hey. I…

362
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:15,747
I was so drunk last night.

363
00:37:16,331 --> 00:37:18,281
And I…

364
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:18,979
All right.

365
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:20,364
I know.

366
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:22,671
I don’t know what happened.

367
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:24,553
But you and I kissed.

368
00:37:24,858 --> 00:37:25,857
- Was that real or just a dream?
- Kawi!

369
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:31,185
Good morning.

370
00:37:36,091 --> 00:37:37,189
Your name is Kawi?

371
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:39,842
What a unique name.

372
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:53,152
Kawi, are you in the same faculty as Pisaeng?

373
00:37:56,659 --> 00:37:57,424
Yes, ma’am.

374
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:03,446
Were you two out drinking last night?

375
00:38:06,105 --> 00:38:07,964
No, ma’am.

376
00:38:08,148 --> 00:38:12,543
I drank with my friend and came to see Pisaeng later.

377
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:16,793
Pisaeng never brought anyone here.

378
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:22,200
It’s my bad, ma’am.

379
00:38:22,995 --> 00:38:25,196
I had a little too much to drink. That’s why I was drunk.

380
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:26,791
Eat.

381
00:38:27,757 --> 00:38:28,627
I’ll take you back.

382
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:51,604
Kawi.

383
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:02,630
What are you going to do about your dad?

384
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:05,027
Are you looking for a new doctor?

385
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,865
No.

386
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:13,876
There’s no time left.

387
00:39:16,614 --> 00:39:17,767
In a few days,

388
00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:21,394
my dad’s condition will get worse.

389
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:26,116
Okay.

390
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:28,313
Hurry up and take care of it.

391
00:39:29,457 --> 00:39:30,602
If you need anything,

392
00:39:30,944 --> 00:39:31,618
just let me know.

393
00:39:33,793 --> 00:39:34,691
Wait, Pisaeng.

394
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:37,725
I…

395
00:39:39,312 --> 00:39:40,829
I want to talk to you about last night.

396
00:39:45,962 --> 00:39:47,197
Whatever happened–

397
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:48,519
Take care of the thing with your dad first.

398
00:39:49,716 --> 00:39:51,092
Don’t worry about other things now.

399
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:54,133
Trust me.

400
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,110
Take care of the thing with your dad first.

401
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:28,925
Don’t worry about other things now.

402
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,810
Where will you two go to celebrate New Year?

403
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,244
Yeah?

404
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,490
Enjoy your holiday.

405
00:40:49,826 --> 00:40:50,732
Excuse me.

406
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:52,255
Hey, Kawi.

407
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,756
Hello, sir.

408
00:40:56,756 --> 00:40:57,867
Hello.

409
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:01,674
Sir,

410
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:06,550
I sincerely apologize for what happened.

411
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:09,510
I know what I did was inappropriate.

412
00:41:10,993 --> 00:41:11,844
You’re fine.

413
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,993
Don’t worry.

414
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:14,880
Pear is like this.

415
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:17,597
Sometimes she can be a little bossy.

416
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:20,834
But I really need your help, sir.

417
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:27,924
My dad is the only person I have left in my life.

418
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:30,482
I don’t want to lose him.

419
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:36,639
I promise I will do anything to pay you back.

420
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:39,657
Kawi, but…

421
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:43,368
I know what I’m asking is improper.

422
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,627
I’m sorry, sir.

423
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:55,860
But I can’t just do nothing and let my dad die.

424
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,615
Sir,

425
00:42:01,573 --> 00:42:04,080
please take my dad as your patient.

426
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,650
I took some notes. I’ll share them with you.

427
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:22,020
Pear.

428
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,730
Can I talk to you for a moment?

429
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:41,878
Pear.

430
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:44,995
I’m truly sorry.

431
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:48,908
I didn’t mean to make you angry.

432
00:42:52,677 --> 00:42:54,299
I’m not angry with you.

433
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,966
When you were stressed out about your dad and didn’t tell me,

434
00:43:06,122 --> 00:43:07,619
I was actually upset.

435
00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:14,489
But then I realized it’s not easy to say and you might not be ready yet.

436
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:28,322
My dad agrees to take your dad as his patient.

437
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:34,552
When you’re ready, take your dad to see him.

438
00:43:39,404 --> 00:43:42,970
From now on, don’t hide things from me.

439
00:43:43,884 --> 00:43:45,381
You’ve helped me a lot.

440
00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:48,022
I want to return the favor.

441
00:43:57,661 --> 00:43:58,348
Dad,

442
00:43:58,872 --> 00:44:00,500
can you come to Bangkok tomorrow?

443
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,414
I just found you a new doctor.

444
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:06,758
Why should I go?

445
00:44:07,094 --> 00:44:09,457
I have a doctor's appointment at the beginning of next year.

446
00:44:10,142 --> 00:44:13,464
Transferring to a new hospital now can be troublesome.

447
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:15,392
(Come on, Dad.)

448
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,521
You won’t have to get in line here.

449
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:19,673
If you need surgery, you can get it right away.

450
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,725
You’re saying it like I’m dying in two days.

451
00:44:29,662 --> 00:44:30,189
Dad,

452
00:44:31,238 --> 00:44:33,970
you know well how bad it is.

453
00:44:34,996 --> 00:44:36,660
If you don’t get treatment now,

454
00:44:36,805 --> 00:44:38,281
you will die in a few days.

455
00:44:41,871 --> 00:44:43,090
What a mouth.

456
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,431
Are you jinxing me?

457
00:44:47,725 --> 00:44:49,000
No, I’m not.

458
00:44:54,454 --> 00:44:55,263
You know?

459
00:44:57,293 --> 00:45:03,216
You are the only source of motivation for me to improve my life.

460
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:06,937
Without you,

461
00:45:08,321 --> 00:45:10,808
I have no idea why I should make my life better.

462
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,279
Because you will not see it anyway.

463
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,299
I don’t have health insurance.

464
00:45:20,755 --> 00:45:24,160
That kind of hospital requires money.

465
00:45:24,979 --> 00:45:26,643
Hundreds of thousands, at least.

466
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:29,892
But you have money in your saving.

467
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:34,875
I know you have a fixed deposit account.

468
00:45:35,872 --> 00:45:39,110
That is a legacy I'm leaving you.

469
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:44,221
It’s not enough anyway.

470
00:45:45,552 --> 00:45:46,835
I already talked to them.

471
00:45:47,506 --> 00:45:48,936
We can pay what we have first.

472
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,102
I will get a job and pay the rest later.

473
00:45:54,895 --> 00:45:55,723
Don’t.

474
00:45:56,562 --> 00:45:58,175
I don’t want to be your burden.

475
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,309
You’re already more struggling than other kids.

476
00:46:05,525 --> 00:46:07,693
Don’t go into debt because of me.

477
00:46:11,865 --> 00:46:12,540
Dad,

478
00:46:14,155 --> 00:46:17,892
thank you for always doing good things for me.

479
00:46:19,551 --> 00:46:21,719
But please, for once,

480
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:24,096
don’t do it for me.

481
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:26,665
Do it for yourself.

482
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:29,402
I want to stay with you longer.

483
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,105
Give me a chance to repay a favor.

484
00:46:34,054 --> 00:46:35,047
Please, Dad.

485
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:53,216
My dad is coming tomorrow.

486
00:46:57,978 --> 00:46:58,831
That’s good.

487
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,610
You can be less worried now.

488
00:47:14,177 --> 00:47:14,768
Pisaeng.

489
00:47:23,285 --> 00:47:25,072
I want to talk to you about last night.

490
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:47,504
Whoa!

491
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:56,022
Holy shit.

492
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:02,541
You live in this kind of place?

493
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,317
Choose which one you want to borrow.

494
00:48:08,817 --> 00:48:09,990
I think this is good.

495
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:11,938
Suitable for a meal with elders.

496
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,038
Are you borrowing my shirt or planning to steal stuff in my place?

497
00:48:29,391 --> 00:48:30,741
Wow.

498
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,704
I’m so jealous.

499
00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:38,930
Will you change your mind then?

500
00:48:40,908 --> 00:48:41,752
Change my mind about what?

501
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,334
Accept my feelings.

502
00:48:45,385 --> 00:48:46,526
I’ll take you in right now.

503
00:48:52,253 --> 00:48:53,720
But I still like Pearmai.

504
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:55,710
I know.

505
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,102
But I’ll wait.

506
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:01,140
I’m a patient kind of guy.

507
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:03,725
Yeah?

508
00:49:13,926 --> 00:49:18,674
(I just don’t know anymore where this fixing the past will lead me.)

509
00:49:18,674 --> 00:49:21,956
I just want to be your comfort zone.

510
00:49:21,956 --> 00:49:24,137
(I’ve come way further than I expected.)

511
00:49:24,273 --> 00:49:25,015
Pisaeng.

512
00:49:25,854 --> 00:49:27,133
Will you keep me company?

513
00:49:27,562 --> 00:49:29,562
(Don’t leave me just yet, guys.)

514
00:49:29,562 --> 00:49:31,069
(Stick around for the next episode.)
