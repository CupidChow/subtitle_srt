Pisaeng.

5
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:21,131
I want to talk to you about last night.

6
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:21,909
Whatever happened–

7
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:23,772
Take care of the thing with your dad first.

8
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:25,483
Don’t worry about other things now.

9
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:28,379
My dad agreed to take your dad as his patient.

10
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:32,869
Dad, can you come to Bangkok tomorrow?

11
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,840
I just found you a new doctor.

12
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,809
You’re saying it like I’m dying in two days.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,614
I want to stay with you longer.

14
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:37,691
My dad is coming tomorrow.

15
00:01:42,422 --> 00:01:43,209
That’s good.

16
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:47,071
You can be less worried now.

17
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,271
Pisaeng.

18
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:02,581
I…

19
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,461
I want to talk to you about last night.

20
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, I just…

21
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:14,088
I told you.

22
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:16,128
You don’t need to worry about this.

23
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,565
No.

24
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:20,963
I don’t want to leave it unsolved.

25
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:22,357
It won’t be good for you

26
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:24,270
and me.

27
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:25,477
Well…

28
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:26,370
Hey.

29
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,354
Just forget it.

30
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:30,634
You were drunk.

31
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:35,232
People have no idea what they do when drunk.

32
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:40,942
If you’re worrying about this,

33
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,513
don’t.

34
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:48,261
What you should focus on now is your dad and Pear.

35
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:53,110
If your life is going well, then keep going.

36
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:58,089
I just…

37
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:02,789
want to be your comfort zone.

38
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:04,740
That’s all.

39
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,514
Thank you so much, Pisaeng.

40
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:19,878
Thank you for everything.

41
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,573
Your health condition is much more severe than I thought.

42
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:43,043
To be safe, I recommend that you have surgery right away.

43
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:45,204
As soon as possible.

44
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:52,247
What if I don’t get surgery, sir?

45
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,853
If you don’t get surgery,

46
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,043
I'm concerned we won’t be able to hold it for a month.

47
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,045
If you do,

48
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:04,396
you have a greater probability of being recovered.

49
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:17,541
Surgery, please.

50
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,000
What do you say, sir?

51
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,318
Do you agree?

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,920
Let’s do as he said, Doctor.

53
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:33,813
He’s the one making the decision.

54
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:42,399
[Kawi: My dad is getting emergency surgery.]

55
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:45,585
[Max: I’m going to the hospital right after work.]

56
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,496
So your father needs emergency surgery, right?

57
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,418
Pear’s father said it’s an emergency case.

58
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,606
The surgery must be done immediately.

59
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:18,401
But this is good.

60
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:23,035
His condition will get worse in a few days.

61
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:26,321
The surgery must take place now.

62
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:28,488
It’s the right thing.

63
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:32,858
Um.

64
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,980
I just came to check in on you.

65
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,595
I guess Pear is coming to keep you company.

66
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:44,597
Pisaeng.

67
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,609
Will you keep me company for now?

68
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:30,000
Today, we will work on our verbal skills.

69
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:33,057
There’s the key to speaking.

70
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:37,275
First of all, we must clear our minds.

71
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:41,210
If it’s not clear, we won’t be able to speak positively.

72
00:06:42,304 --> 00:06:43,320
So are we ready?

73
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:44,581
I am.

74
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:48,807
[Pisaeng: Kawi's father is undergoing urgent surgery.]

75
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:50,556
Pear.

76
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,495
Are you all right?

77
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:04,117
If there’s something on your mind, you can take a break for today.

78
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:07,966
No, it’s okay.

79
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:10,370
I won’t be able to help much anyway if I go.

80
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:13,264
I’ll just go after finishing this workshop.

81
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:22,929
Okay.

82
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:24,218
As I said earlier,

83
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:28,120
we must clear off our mindset first.

84
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:39,341
Kawi.

85
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:42,777
The surgery went well.

86
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:51,203
However, he must remain in the ICU in order for us to monitor his condition.

87
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,670
Thank you so much, sir.

88
00:07:55,524 --> 00:07:56,603
Thank you.

89
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,109
Kawi.

90
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:00,130
Pear.

91
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:05,500
Sorry I’m late.

92
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:08,574
You’re fine, Pear.

93
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:15,283
Thank you very much, Pear.

94
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:17,345
I’m truly thankful.

95
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:26,797
From now on, you don’t have to worry about anything.

96
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:39,538
(I can now call what happened to me a miracle.)

97
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:46,208
(And this miracle aided me in making everything better.)

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,838
(This good-for-nothing son

99
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:56,615
helped save his father’s life today.)

100
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:04,857
Hi, guys. We’re Favorite L.

101
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:09,502
Tonight is special as we’re introducing you to our new vocalist.

102
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:13,478
He might not be as handsome as me but let’s check out his voice first.

103
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:14,755
Introduce yourself.

104
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:20,113
Good evening, everyone. My name is Bodkawee.

105
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:21,516
My nickname is Kawi.

106
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:27,331
Fluke told me to go by my first name as it’s easier.

107
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:29,824
It’s more common.

108
00:09:29,824 --> 00:09:30,624
You don’t have to say that.

109
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,511
Well then.

110
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:36,139
Let’s enjoy this nice song together.

111
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:43,061
(From someone who’s never been proud of himself to someone special.)

112
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:09,640
(And the most significant change is that I’m in love.)

113
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:12,636
(I don’t have to live a lonely life anymore.)

114
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:22,054
(I guess my life is complete now.)

115
00:11:08,773 --> 00:11:09,451
Kawi.

116
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:20,190
Kawi.

117
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:27,001
I tried to call you but I couldn’t reach you.

118
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:29,777
What?

119
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:49,637
The upcoming show will feature a brand-new single

120
00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:52,402
from the hottest artist of the hour.

121
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,560
I’m gonna be honest here. I’m one of his fans too.

122
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,615
Hold on.

123
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,060
Can you explain more of what you just said?

124
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,353
Well, he’s so cute and adorable…

125
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:03,912
Hey.

126
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:06,260
Are you okay?

127
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,254
Max?

128
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:11,862
Are you all right?

129
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:16,717
He began his singing career as the lead singer of the band Favorite L.

130
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:20,505
I'm sure many of you have heard the songs from this indie band before.

131
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:24,361
But after the band members decided to walk their own path,

132
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:30,070
he returned as a solo artist with lots of musical endeavors.

133
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:32,903
Mr. Kawi,

134
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,711
please stand by.

135
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,165
Okay. I’m ready.

136
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:43,680

Hi, guys.

155
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:01,995
Thank you so much. How cute!

156
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:02,639
It’s huge, right?

157
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,667
It’s very cute.

158
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:05,677
Thank you. What is this?

159
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,056
Thank you.

160
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,080
Thank you.

161
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:12,267
Let’s give the artist time to rest now.

162
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:13,884
Bye-bye.

163
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:15,355
See you. Take care.

164
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:25,116
Why the heck are you smiling?

165
00:14:25,254 --> 00:14:25,852
What’s wrong with you?

166
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:30,945
Well, I never thought I’d get to this point one day.

167
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,321
Hey, this way.

168
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,316
Where are you going?

169
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:02,374
Well, open it.

170
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:03,726
Don’t you see my hands are full?

171
00:15:03,726 --> 00:15:05,160
Oh, right.

172
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,384
Hey!

173
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,761
Whose room is this?

174
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:19,118
Right.

175
00:15:19,762 --> 00:15:20,781
Mine.

176
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:25,926
Your brain’s stopped functioning, I guess.

177
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:27,016
Seriously.

178
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,914
How cool.

179
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:48,585
You have a song-promoting tour tomorrow starting at 9.

180
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,400
The last program will be the radio station interview at 10 p.m.

181
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,505
Are you hearing what I’m saying?

182
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:01,520
Uh-huh.

183
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:06,244
You said you’d quit drinking.

184
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,632
You’re not going to, are you?

185
00:16:09,192 --> 00:16:10,824
Quit complaining, all right?

186
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:12,635
I drink just a little.

187
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,529
Just a little, my ass.

188
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:18,323
Your hands shake whenever you don’t get to drink.

189
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:23,696
(Hi, guys.)

190
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:27,649
(I’m back again late at night with Entertainment Gossip.)

191
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:29,001
Kawi.

192
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:32,586
I’m warning you as a friend.

193
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:39,322
Your life is getting better.

194
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:42,179
Can you not ruin it again?

195
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,817
Oh, please.

196
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,714
How can it be ruined?

197
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:48,347
I’m basically living my dream life.

198
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:52,681
If my dad was still here, he’d be so proud of me.

199
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:22,559
Hey.

200
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:24,404
Kawi, are you okay?

201
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:33,057
My dad is still dead.

202
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,494
And Pear is still getting married.

203
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:42,630
Just move on.

204
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,245
Pear has made her decision.

205
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:06,699
That asshole Not.

206
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:15,268
Who are you calling?

207
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:16,439
Who do you think?

208
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,995
Pisaeng, of course.

209
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:22,464
Why can’t I reach him?

210
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,098
Is he at the wedding?

211
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:25,029
He’s not.

212
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,302
Nobody has seen him in a while.

213
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:31,534
Huh?

214
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:36,257
Pisaeng has cut himself off from friends for a year.

215
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,892
Why do you want to reach him?

216
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,790
Kawi.

217
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:51,363
Kawi.

218
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,476
Kawi!

219
00:18:53,931 --> 00:18:54,804
What?

220
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,414
Are you coming with me?

221
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:57,587
If you are, get in the car.

222
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:58,843
I’m not.

223
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:00,834
And I’m not letting you go either.

224
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:05,341
Why are you even going?

225
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:07,779
You and Pear broke up for almost a year.

226
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:09,332
But it isn’t supposed to be like this.

227
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:10,903
How is it supposed to be then?

228
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,948
Everything happened because of you.

229
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:18,788
Just admit it.

230
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:22,100
Ever since you and Pear got together,

231
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:24,836
her life hasn’t got better just a bit.

232
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:28,044
I know Not is an asshole.

233
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:32,781
But at least Pear is happier with him than with you.

234
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,350
Okay.

235
00:19:40,821 --> 00:19:42,542
Then I’ll go to congratulate them.

236
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:10,261
Please don’t do this.

237
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,360
Let’s just talk first.

238
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:14,956
What’s left to talk about?

239
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,163
Just admit it.

240
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:23,320
We getting together is a mistake.

241
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:33,599
Hey.

242
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:35,116
Kawi.

243
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:41,236
Come here.

244
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,352
It’s Kawi here.

245
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,650
Wow. I didn’t think you’d come.

246
00:20:51,222 --> 00:20:52,326
This is so you.

247
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:56,188
You didn’t join the ceremony but showed up at the party to drink.

248
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:56,986
Right?

249
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,318
Hey.

250
00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:02,128
Can you sing for us tonight?

251
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:14,131
Why are you two looking at each other like that?

252
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:16,111
You guys still have an unsolved business or what?

253
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:26,796
No.

254
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,534
I just came to express my congratulations.

255
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:34,625
Congrats, Not.

256
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:38,401
Congrats, Pear.

257
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:46,324
Will you excuse me now?

258
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,340
[Kawi: Pisaeng, answer my call.]
[Kawi: Can you please not disappear like this?]

259
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,477
(Where the heck are you?)

260
00:22:39,035 --> 00:22:40,506
(Do you still exist in my life?)

261
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,360
Pear.

262
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,248
Kwan.

263
00:23:45,265 --> 00:23:46,135
Kawi.

264
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:49,086
Why are you sitting out here?

265
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:53,107
What about you? Didn’t you just arrive?

266
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:54,795
Why leaving so soon?

267
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:00,661
Same reason, I guess.

268
00:24:09,703 --> 00:24:13,695
Honestly, I have no clue how I feel

269
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:16,268
or how I should feel.

270
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Should I be worried about Pear?

271
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:24,565
Should I be mad at her?

272
00:24:25,351 --> 00:24:27,956
Or should I just blame myself for this?

273
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:28,570
Kwan.

274
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:31,043
Why would you blame yourself?

275
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:39,426
Honestly, you and I are in the same position.

276
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:46,414
We’re two people who shouldn’t have shown up here.

277
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:50,911
We just couldn’t help it, could we?

278
00:24:53,022 --> 00:24:54,644
But your situation is better than mine, Kawi.

279
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:59,764
At least Pear broke up with you, right?

280
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:06,129
But Not…

281
00:25:10,394 --> 00:25:13,050
He never even thought of doing that to me.

282
00:25:16,835 --> 00:25:17,846
What do you mean?

283
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:25,995
Don’t tell me he was dating Pear and you at the same time.

284
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:31,616
He never admitted he was with me.

285
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:34,958
Does Pear know about this?

286
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:42,850
Is it my fault for letting him do that to me?

287
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:51,240
Is it my fault for letting this wedding happen when I should have told Pear the truth?

288
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,286
Kawi.

289
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:55,258
Kawi!

290
00:25:58,147 --> 00:25:58,885
Kawi.

291
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:00,147
Not!

292
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:02,912
Hey!

293
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,581
Why does a nasty bastard like you always get good chances in life?

294
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:11,773
You’re nothing but an asshole.

295
00:26:11,773 --> 00:26:12,762
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

296
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:15,903
You don’t deserve anything.

297
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:18,080
You never change.

298
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,779
Damn it!

299
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,330
I’m going to talk to him.

300
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:27,596
Let go of me!

301
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:32,080
What’s the matter with you?

302
00:26:32,302 --> 00:26:33,005
You should just go.

303
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:33,571
No.

304
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:35,802
I’m going to talk to him.

305
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:37,200
Don’t, Kawi!

306
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:39,458
Just don’t.

307
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:44,555
You can just talk to me.

308
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:48,440
You two can go check in on Not.

309
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:53,586
Pear.

310
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:54,290
What are you doing?

311
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:56,626
What do you want?

312
00:26:58,769 --> 00:26:59,547
Pear.

313
00:27:00,893 --> 00:27:05,137
Do you know when he was dating you, he refused to break it off with Kwan?

314
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,733
Do you even know you’ve been fooled?

315
00:27:14,725 --> 00:27:16,044
You do, don’t you?

316
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:18,932
- Then why–
- I’m pregnant.

317
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:24,481
I can’t cancel this wedding.

318
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,513
Things have come this far.

319
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:31,717
There’s no turning back for me.

320
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:35,827
But don’t you worry.

321
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:41,417
Not promised me he won’t associate with Kwan again.

322
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:44,263
Why Pear?

323
00:27:45,473 --> 00:27:46,494
Why?

324
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:48,347
At least Not offers me my future.

325
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,360
Today, I’m getting married.

326
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,852
And soon, I’m having my own family.

327
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:01,567
What about you?

328
00:28:03,836 --> 00:28:05,252
What can you offer me?

329
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:15,441
How many times did I tell you when we were together?

330
00:28:16,107 --> 00:28:17,628
I told you I wanted to get married.

331
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:21,650
Did you ever care?

332
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,160
But I told you I wasn’t ready.

333
00:28:26,152 --> 00:28:28,757
You know how hard I tried to come to this point.

334
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:31,800
I just signed with a big company two years ago.

335
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,711
That’s right.

336
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,348
Your life is going great and you don’t want me to get in your way.

337
00:28:40,925 --> 00:28:42,849
But mine is the opposite.

338
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:46,694
I’m nearly jobless.

339
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:52,985
And am I so wrong to look for the future for myself?

340
00:28:58,554 --> 00:29:00,050
But does it have to be Not?

341
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:05,732
When we were younger,

342
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,574
we all hoped our lives would be better.

343
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,758
But as we grew older, lived our lives, and continued to make mistakes,

344
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,848
we'd have to accept that this was the farthest we could achieve.

345
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:52,053
You’re lucky everyone was friends there.

346
00:29:53,116 --> 00:29:55,242
Or you’d be condemned by the whole nation now.

347
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:00,827
And your big attempt to bring yourself this far would be in vain.

348
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:04,533
So my work will not be affected, right?

349
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:16,440
Can’t you see yourself, really?

350
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,975
Trust me, Kawi.

351
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:26,024
Take a break and go to alcohol rehab.

352
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:29,560
See a psychiatrist too.

353
00:30:34,495 --> 00:30:36,117
So where is Pisaeng exactly?

354
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,424
(Sorry, the number you've dialed cannot be connected…)

355
00:30:48,424 --> 00:30:49,654
Why can’t I reach him at all?

356
00:30:49,654 --> 00:30:50,363
Kawi.

357
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:52,148
Let him go.

358
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:56,020
Why do you even want to see him now?

359
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:58,033
Do you have his mom’s number?

360
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:58,917
Damn it!

361
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,037
How long will you make him suffer because of you?

362
00:31:07,804 --> 00:31:09,249
What do you mean by that?

363
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:13,170
You know all too well.

364
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:26,873
But you do know where he is, don’t you?

365
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,972
Pisaeng.

366
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:04,820
What the hell are you doing here?

367
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:09,348
And you?

368
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:12,018
What the hell did you do at Pear’s wedding?

369
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:21,470
Why are you mad at me?

370
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:26,727
Turn around and talk to me.

371
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:46,220
Why do you think I’m mad at you?

372
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:49,468
Why would I be?

373
00:32:50,075 --> 00:32:52,075
Why did you disappear on me then?

374
00:32:55,377 --> 00:32:56,379
Did I?

375
00:32:57,715 --> 00:33:00,480
If I did disappear, would you be able to find me?

376
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,735
Why didn’t you answer my Line messages?

377
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:06,890
I’m not using it anymore.

378
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,349
Whatever you want to say, you can call me.

379
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,821
I tried but I couldn’t reach you.

380
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:16,677
What number did you call?

381
00:33:18,694 --> 00:33:19,750
Your number, of course.

382
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:32,041
I stopped using that number ages ago.

383
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,863
I also told you that.

384
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:36,416
But you just forgot.

385
00:33:38,431 --> 00:33:41,187
I thought the number I had was your new number.

386
00:33:41,835 --> 00:33:42,891
It isn’t?

387
00:33:49,749 --> 00:33:51,046
How did I forget?

388
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:55,441
Am I really sick like Max said?

389
00:33:58,347 --> 00:33:59,767
Maybe I should get treatment.

390
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:02,301
I should go see a doctor, right?

391
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,062
Hey.

392
00:34:04,196 --> 00:34:05,146
Calm down.

393
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,221
What’s wrong with you?

394
00:34:10,735 --> 00:34:12,200
Is it because you can’t get over Pear?

395
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,296
Why?

396
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:21,712
Why is everything so messed up?

397
00:34:23,642 --> 00:34:24,300
Huh?

398
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,642
Why is everything messed up?

399
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,291
Why?

400
00:34:35,434 --> 00:34:36,419
Why?

401
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,947
Why is everything so messed up?

402
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:04,723
You disappeared for months.

403
00:35:06,113 --> 00:35:07,710
This is how you’ve lived your life?

404
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:11,493
Are you on break or what?

405
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,446
Don’t you have to go back to work?

406
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:15,546
I just got here.

407
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:17,388
Are you shooing me away now?

408
00:35:20,395 --> 00:35:23,857
I’ve just never seen you available in the past three years.

409
00:35:28,052 --> 00:35:29,876
Max canceled all my work.

410
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,500
He said I’m sick and need to be treated.

411
00:35:38,463 --> 00:35:40,463
Do you think I’m really sick as he said?

412
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:45,842
I don’t know.

413
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:48,472
You’re the only one who knows the answer.

414
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:52,829
But honestly,

415
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,666
in this world these days, who isn’t sick?

416
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,834
We’re either slightly sick or severely sick.

417
00:36:11,422 --> 00:36:12,089
Hey.

418
00:36:12,694 --> 00:36:13,548
Let’s get in the water.

419
00:36:14,411 --> 00:36:14,911
Huh?

420
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:16,366
Come on.

421
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:17,420
Let’s go.

422
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:18,618
Woo!

423
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:19,783
Go!

424
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:20,410
Woo!!

425
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:24,876
Woo!!

426
00:36:28,323 --> 00:36:29,023
Wait.

427
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,735
You call this get in the water?

428
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:32,780
Yes.

429
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,413
It’s already fun like this.

430
00:36:34,616 --> 00:36:35,260
Come on.

431
00:36:37,025 --> 00:36:39,037
You want to get in the water but are afraid of getting wet?

432
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,085
Seriously?

433
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,237
Why?

434
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:43,514
I can do this.

435
00:36:43,514 --> 00:36:44,250
It’s fun already.

436
00:36:44,476 --> 00:36:45,468
It’s enough for me.

437
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:49,298
Hey!

438
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:49,990
No!

439
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,709
Don’t.

440
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,127
No!

441
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:58,086
Damn you!

442
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,713
I’m all drenched now.

443
00:37:03,676 --> 00:37:04,281
You!

444
00:37:05,676 --> 00:37:06,520
Hey!

445
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:12,805
Here. Get this!

446
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:05,454
Hey.

447
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:06,578
Let’s eat.

448
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,240
You’re still my fan?

449
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:14,372
Right.

450
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:16,517
Not cool at all, am I?

451
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:33,847
Here.

452
00:38:35,588 --> 00:38:37,275
Wow. It looks yummy.

453
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,064
It’s hot.

454
00:38:44,883 --> 00:38:45,579
It’s so good.

455
00:38:50,218 --> 00:38:51,385
You can eat.

456
00:38:51,737 --> 00:38:52,570
You’re probably not sick.

457
00:38:53,841 --> 00:38:57,499
Though I’m dying, I will never quit eating.

458
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:12,390
How long are you gonna stay here?

459
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,138
None of your business.

460
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:18,335
Hey.

461
00:39:18,812 --> 00:39:19,768
I asked you nicely.

462
00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:23,625
I don’t know.

463
00:39:24,454 --> 00:39:25,543
I might stay on

464
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:27,658
until I know where to go next.

465
00:39:28,114 --> 00:39:29,045
Then I’ll move.

466
00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:40,240
I’m happy here.

467
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:41,354
Okay?

468
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:44,378
Are you?

469
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,829
You should stop.

470
00:40:06,098 --> 00:40:07,672
How many cans have you had?

471
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:08,858
Don’t let yourself get drunk.

472
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,672
Just let me drink.

473
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:13,132
I will just fall asleep if I’m drunk.

474
00:40:13,675 --> 00:40:14,431
That won’t hurt.

475
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:28,475
Pisaeng.

476
00:40:35,086 --> 00:40:36,636
I’m truly glad

477
00:40:38,775 --> 00:40:40,423
to have you in my life.

478
00:40:45,418 --> 00:40:46,275
Now you’re drunk.

479
00:40:47,788 --> 00:40:49,822
But I know what I’m saying.

480
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:56,227
It’s me who’s glad to have you.

481
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:01,481
Why would you be?

482
00:41:03,864 --> 00:41:07,526
You’re the one who has helped me with lots of things.

483
00:41:09,538 --> 00:41:13,383
I, however, can’t help you with anything.

484
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:18,049
Who told you that?

485
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,305
You helped me with one thing.

486
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:27,363
It’s very huge and important.

487
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,249
What is it?

488
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:34,489
Not telling you.

489
00:41:35,898 --> 00:41:37,531
Hey, spill it.

490
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:39,028
You don’t need to know.

491
00:41:52,073 --> 00:41:52,632
Here.

492
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:55,066
What?

493
00:41:55,771 --> 00:41:57,618
Sing for me. I want to hear you sing.

494
00:41:58,304 --> 00:41:59,038
No.

495
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:01,000
You’re a singer. You sing for me.

496
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,340
But I wanna hear you sing.

497
00:42:02,672 --> 00:42:03,260
Take it.

498
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,011
No.

499
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:05,118
Please. Just a little.

500
00:42:05,118 --> 00:42:06,051
Please.

501
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,403

Just go to bed.

527
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:56,539
Here.

528
00:44:59,689 --> 00:45:00,251
What?

529
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,893
Don’t ask. Just take it.

530
00:45:22,243 --> 00:45:23,331
What’s the occasion?

531
00:45:28,388 --> 00:45:30,240
You’re still making a big deal about today, huh?

532
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,085
It’s the anniversary.

533
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,240
It must be special, mustn’t it?

534
00:45:36,171 --> 00:45:37,303
It’s the 8th anniversary.

535
00:45:38,753 --> 00:45:39,932
You’re nuts.

536
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:45,240
I’ve never seen anyone keep track of their love confession date.

537
00:45:45,702 --> 00:45:46,362
Well, look at yourself.

538
00:45:46,983 --> 00:45:48,634
You have anniversaries for everyone.

539
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:50,864
Your dad’s death anniversary.

540
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:52,166
Your anniversary with Pear.

541
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,060
Your band anniversary with Fluke.

542
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,584
Can't I just have one day as my day?

543
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:00,907
It’s been 8 years.

544
00:46:02,545 --> 00:46:03,488
The feelings are still there?

545
00:46:14,124 --> 00:46:18,342
You’re a patient guy, indeed.

546
00:46:29,817 --> 00:46:31,817
I will set everything right.

547
00:46:32,554 --> 00:46:34,927
I thought I wouldn’t get to see you ever again.

548
00:46:36,115 --> 00:46:36,830
Therefore,

549
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:40,830
will you go out with me?

550
00:46:42,605 --> 00:46:46,097
(Next week, let’s see how much my life will get better.)
