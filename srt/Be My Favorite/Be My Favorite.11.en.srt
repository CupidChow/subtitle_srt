Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:18,720
If it weren't for you and your dad, today wouldn’t have happened for me.

5
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:20,477
How dare you say that?

6
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:26,460
You traded Dad’s pain and my heartache for the path you chose.

7
00:00:26,813 --> 00:00:34,125
Pear, the more you forgive, the stronger you get.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,689
Two people falling in love shouldn’t be judged as something wrong.

9
00:00:39,148 --> 00:00:40,357
You don’t need to worry anymore, okay?

10
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:43,156
I just wanted to spend the night with you here.

11
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:47,453
You'll have sex with someone eventually.

12
00:00:47,453 --> 00:00:50,264
How lucky you are to get a chance to do it with someone you love.

13
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:52,973
I feel like you didn’t enjoy today very much.

14
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:56,161
Whatever I did wrong today, you can tell me.

15
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:57,588
No, Pisaeng.

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,608
Today was great.

17
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:01,758
I’ve been having a great time.

18
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,816
What an honor it is for a low-profile man like me

19
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:07,750
to share a meal with a renowned female tycoon.

20
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:09,859
Phong,

21
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,200
when will you stop teasing me?

22
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:13,901
Daow,

23
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:18,240
people get teased from time to time

24
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,115
so that we won’t get overly stressed out.

25
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,503
You usually don't have much time.

26
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,072
Why did you want to meet up all of a sudden?

27
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:33,703
It’s about our children.

28
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:37,720
We haven't spoken since that messy issue.

29
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:39,428
I don’t see any issues now.

30
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,284
The kids are on good terms.

31
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:44,699
They are all happy.

32
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,394
Sometimes, I wish I could be as good as you.

33
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:53,066
Given that you had plenty of family problems as well.

34
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:54,844
Don’t think of it that way.

35
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:59,238
I don’t think we can compare one parent to another.

36
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:02,455
We're all doing our best.

37
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,355
Lucky you.

38
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:09,547
You’re still able to help your child.

39
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:16,463
I, on the other hand, not only can’t help him but also his obstacle.

40
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,916
Who says that?

41
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:25,291
I don’t think I help my child in any way.

42
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:28,581
I just learn to let go.

43
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:30,609
It’s her life.

44
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:32,747
She’s a grownup.

45
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:37,013
Whatever she wants to do, I just let her.

46
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:40,000
We can't possibly know their lives better than they do.

47
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,139
There.

48
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:47,193
That’s why I said you’re good.

49
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:52,611
I have no clue when I’ll be able to do it like you do.

50
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:55,341
Daow,

51
00:03:55,855 --> 00:04:01,355
I think parenthood is more than just raising children.

52
00:04:02,302 --> 00:04:05,232
We have to grow alongside them as well.

53
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:09,016
Drink.

54
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:14,507
Okay.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,716
Cheers.

56
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:46,409
Pear.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,520
I know it’s the last day of your exhibition,

58
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:02,865
so I just wanted to stop by.

59
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:10,540
I have something for you.

60
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:29,785
I made it a long time ago.

61
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:32,520
It’s schoolwork.

62
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,747
I got 10 out of 10.

63
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:46,807
At first,

64
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:50,583
I had no intention of giving it to you.

65
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:56,529
But on second thought,

66
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:01,227
I want you to have it.

67
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,435
Pear.

68
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,357
It’s my fault.

69
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:14,226
And I have no excuses.

70
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:17,511
All I thought about was myself.

71
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:21,493
And I didn’t sacrifice enough.

72
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:26,573
Everything is my fault.

73
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:33,078
If you want to be angry at me, you have all the right.

74
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:45,927
I admit that I was upset you didn’t stay with me.

75
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,774
However,

76
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,647
I’m glad you’re happy.

77
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:12,556
Thank you so much, Pear.

78
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:13,733
Thank you.

79
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,990
What’s being displayed inside today?

80
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:28,587
It’s the last day today

81
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,064
so I just wanted it to be a bit more special.

82
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:33,936
I asked my friends to come and read poems together.

83
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:36,778
That’s nice.

84
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:44,146
Can I read it too?

85
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,335
Are you sure?

86
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:32,981
Dear Friends,

87
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,912
You have the right to sail along and glide

88
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,430
To venture into the woods in the dead of night

89
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:51,397
To revel in the joy of a gentle breeze's sway

90
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:20,190
To sing your song with the harvested rice

91
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:26,309
To grin at the stars above shining bright

92
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:34,720
To gaze upon the grass with tears in your eyes

93
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:43,239
To absorb as much bitterness as desired

94
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:51,363
To be cheerful as a swan soaring free

95
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:56,859
To vent it out with the top of the pine tree

96
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,139
To plant glee in the hearts of people

97
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:08,923
To take in as much misery as you’re able

98
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:17,472
To live for someone you love dearest

99
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:24,682
To battle until your body turns into ashes

100
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:32,988
To achieve what you strongly desire

101
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,958
To pursue fairness for humankind

102
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:46,908
For the sickle, the crescent moon, your dear friends

103
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,607
For the swaying bamboo trees and the mountains

104
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,937
For the abundant rice in the paddy to remain

105
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:05,710
For the golden skyline to come once again

The first-prize lottery number is 930255.

113
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,093
The last time I found only the last two-digit prize.

114
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:19,365
This time, I won’t miss the first prize.

115
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:27,589
Holy..!!

116
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,577
I came to visit.

117
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:40,902
Did you just come back from the future?

118
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,501
So?

119
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:45,880
Is your life better there?

120
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:47,405
No.

121
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,303
If it was, you wouldn’t have come back.

122
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:52,570
Come on, Uncle.

123
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:55,755
I need more time.

124
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:57,276
You said it yourself,

125
00:14:57,548 --> 00:15:01,814
“Life can be changed but you must take it step by step.” Like that.

126
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:03,325
Is that so?

127
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:09,484
That’s why you travel back and forth to do this kind of thing?

128
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:12,134
Come on.

129
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:17,080
In order to change my life, money is key, right?

130
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,169
Oh yeah?

131
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:21,712
Is winning the lottery the only way to get rich that you can think of?

132
00:15:24,606 --> 00:15:25,344
Fine.

133
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:28,823
If this is your dream, go ahead.

134
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:29,946
But…

135
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:32,280
Do you want a spoiler?

136
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,823
I will win it, right?

137
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:36,920
Go search for it. Buy as many tickets as you want.

138
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,635
Keep looking everywhere.

139
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:42,091
No matter how hard you try, you won’t find it.

140
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,840
You won’t find any tickets that win any prizes. Let alone the first prize.

141
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:50,226
But I won the last two-digit prize last time. I got 20,000 baht.

142
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:51,551
Right.

143
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,646
And you’ve already used up all your luck in life.

144
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:56,349
How come?

145
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:02,048
Because gambling is about luck.

146
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:06,588
And you can’t destine luck.

147
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:10,077
If you were destined to win the lottery and become rich,

148
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:13,520
that luck should have been with you from the get-go.

149
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,800
You wouldn’t have to travel in time back and forth like this.

150
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,910
But your life isn’t destined that way.

151
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,322
What?

152
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:33,193
If my life is all planned, what’s the point of time traveling then?

153
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:41,970
Are you really a university student?

154
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:46,040
Where is your ability to perform in-depth analysis?

155
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,196
That’s harsh.

156
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:59,665
That crystal ball empowers your desire to improve your life.

157
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:09,503
However, no matter how much power you have, you can only control certain aspects of your life.

158
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,235
Not everything.

159
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:16,276
Don’t waste your time on something beyond your power.

160
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:20,011
Right your wrongs.

161
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:24,219
That’s the most important thing you should do.

162
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:02,785
(So that was the story of my miracle.)

163
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:10,485
(I traveled back in time hoping I’d succeed in love.)

164
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:13,022
(Today, I’ve achieved that.)

165
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:16,161
Eat all you want. This meal is on me.

166
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,790
So good.

167
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:30,712
(However, the miracle in life isn’t about time travel.)

168
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:34,679
(It’s about bravery to choose to do the right thing

169
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,976
and live today the best you can.)

170
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:44,315
(University life is short.)

171
00:18:45,737 --> 00:18:47,737
(But it’s the happiest time for me.)

172
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,334
(My time here was well spent.)

173
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:54,379
(I opened my eyes and mind.)

174
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,311
(I enjoyed everything

175
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:00,500
and grew up alongside my friends.)

176
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:08,473
(Although there was some foolishness that occurred,

177
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:11,301
I have no regrets whatsoever.)

178
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:15,634

Your dad’s picture,

198
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,853
you can hang it.

199
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:56,780
Can I?

200
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,572
Of course, you can.

201

She won’t.

205
00:21:18,238 --> 00:21:20,078
She moved back to the house.

206
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:24,440
She gave us this place as a graduation gift.

207
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:25,870
Wow!

208
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:30,727
I’m so jealous of a rich boy.

209
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,219
Isn’t good?

210
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,683
You don’t have to pay the rent.

211
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:37,330
And we get to live together.

212
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:45,429
Seriously,

213
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:49,040
I still don't get you.

214
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,583
Why do you like someone like me?

215
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:55,664
I told you.

216
00:21:56,403 --> 00:21:57,212
You’re cute.

217
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:03,037
Be honest.

218
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,006
Can you give me the true reason for once?

219
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:07,735
I want to know.

220
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:10,539
How is my answer not true?

221
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,872
Come on. Be serious.

222
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:16,465
There are lots of cute people out there.

223
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:18,344

Stop. It’s ticklish.

227
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,151
I ordered food.

228
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:57,240
I’ll go get it.

229
00:22:57,648 --> 00:22:58,514

00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:55,811

00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,053
Are you sick?

00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:16,134
I’m feeling like I have a fever.

294
00:28:23,115 --> 00:28:23,758
Hey.

295
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:26,138
You have a temperature.

296
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,114
Want to go see a doctor?

297
00:28:29,956 --> 00:28:31,223
No, it’s fine.

298
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:34,697
It’s just a fever.

299
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:37,328
I’ll be okay after taking pills and getting some rest.

300
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:40,184
Are you sure?

301
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,422
Yeah.

302
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:46,513
Go to sleep then.

303
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:48,939
Don’t stay up so late yourself.

304
00:28:54,503 --> 00:28:55,242
Good night.

305
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:26,544
Take off your shirt.

306
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,227
I’ll give you a tepid sponge.

307
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:40,916
I hate it when I’m sick.

308
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:43,969
Nobody likes it.

309
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:46,611
Don’t.

310
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:47,910
I’ll do it.

311
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,739
Just stay put.

312
00:29:51,536 --> 00:29:52,269
Hey.

313
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,332
Don’t get too close or you’ll catch the fever too.

314
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:58,385
If that’s the case, I should have been sick already.

315
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,347
We are always together.

316
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:02,671
Here.

317
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:32,201
Do you think I’ll die?

318
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,170
What are you saying?

319
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:40,717
Don’t say that.

320
00:30:41,694 --> 00:30:43,119
It’s just influenza.

321
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:47,128
Lots of people die because of it.

322
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:53,341
Kawi,

323
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,074
if I die,

324
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:57,680
don’t cry.

325
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:02,519
If you want to get a new boyfriend,

326
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:04,847
find someone better than me.

327
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,427
It’s not funny.

328
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,683
Come on.

329
00:31:12,922 --> 00:31:13,845
I’m kidding.

330
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:22,044
I won’t die.

331
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:25,443
I’ll stay with you for a long time.

332
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,535
Kawi,

333
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:58,109
I’m off to work.

334
00:32:58,608 --> 00:33:00,680
I took many days off. I don’t know what I’m facing today.

335
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,355
Um.

336
00:33:03,876 --> 00:33:05,018
Aren’t you getting up?

337
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:08,753
You mentioned you have a meeting today about a commercial soundtrack.

338
00:33:11,435 --> 00:33:13,212
You don’t want to be late.

339
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
I think I’m going to postpone the meeting.

340
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:28,834
What’s the matter?

341
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:31,111
A bit of a headache.

342
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,825
I think I have a fever.

343
00:33:34,898 --> 00:33:36,379
You caught the flu from me for sure.

344
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:38,623
You want to see a doctor?

345
00:33:41,256 --> 00:33:42,360
No. It’s okay.

346
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:45,289
I should be fine after taking a rest.

347
00:33:46,015 --> 00:33:47,737
Let’s decide again if it’s still bad.

348
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:49,815
You can go to work.

349
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,039
Are you sure?

350
00:33:55,418 --> 00:33:56,559
I am.

351
00:33:57,529 --> 00:33:59,723
If you get better, I can as well.

352
00:34:00,993 --> 00:34:02,235
Worry about your work.

353
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:03,796
Go.

354
00:34:04,204 --> 00:34:05,069
I’ll sleep.

355
00:34:08,952 --> 00:34:09,773
I’m off then.

356
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:11,731
Call me if you need anything.

357
00:34:42,055 --> 00:34:43,367
Is it influenza?

358
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:46,288
Just what I thought.

359
00:34:46,841 --> 00:34:48,674
He must have got it from me.

360
00:34:49,126 --> 00:34:51,126
But why does he seem a lot worse than me?

361
00:34:52,471 --> 00:34:55,200
Based on the x-ray result, we discovered a virus in his lungs.

362
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:57,813
It causes Pneumonia in the patient.

363
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:02,842
We will first treat him with medications and monitor his condition for complications.

364
00:35:03,192 --> 00:35:06,172
Are you the patient’s family member?

365
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,762
I’m his boyfriend.

366
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:15,271
Is there anyone in his family we can contact?

367
00:35:17,988 --> 00:35:19,124
He lives with me.

368
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:23,013
What about his relatives?

369
00:35:25,866 --> 00:35:26,517
No, sir.

370
00:35:27,414 --> 00:35:28,346
He has only me.

371
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,166
The patient’s condition is getting much worse.

372
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:27,291
We had to transfer him to the ICU and open a hole in his windpipe to allow him to breathe.

373
00:36:28,427 --> 00:36:30,219
Will my friend get better?

374
00:36:30,503 --> 00:36:34,881
We need to continue monitoring for a period of time.

375
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:35,838
What is this, doctor?

376
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:37,110
Isn’t it just influenza?

377
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,120
He’s still young and healthy.

378
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,122
And he must have got it from me.

379
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:43,306
Why am I okay?

380
00:36:43,306 --> 00:36:43,877
Hey.

381
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,027
Calm down.

382
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,034
He shouldn’t be this bad.

383
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,318
Why is his condition more severe than others, doc?

384
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:52,041
Pisaeng.

385
00:38:47,775 --> 00:38:50,338
You can’t blame it all on yourself like this.

386
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,695
The air is filled with germs.

387
00:38:53,377 --> 00:38:54,597
Besides, it’s the rainy season.

388
00:38:55,098 --> 00:38:57,088
It’s a seasonal disease.

389
00:38:57,641 --> 00:38:59,641
Kawi might have got it from someone else.

390
00:39:00,152 --> 00:39:00,926
Probably not you.

391
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,970
Who else would it be if not me?

392
00:39:13,923 --> 00:39:16,653
Ever since he got admitted, have you got any sleep?

393
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,545
You should go back and get a good sleep.

394
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:24,664
Or you might be worse than Kawi.

395
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:27,137
I’ll stay here with him in the meantime.

396
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:41,153
Pisaeng.

397
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:45,269
I know you’re worried about him.

398
00:39:47,115 --> 00:39:49,115
But he’s now under medical care.

399
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:33,254
The truth is…

400
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:36,123
I came from the future.

401
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,257
The crystal ball music box in my room,

402
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:43,652
that’s what sent me back here.

403
00:41:43,273 --> 00:41:45,774
From "Khop Fa Khlip Thong" by UCHANEE (Prakin Chumsai Na Ayutthaya)

404
00:41:57,755 --> 00:41:58,483
No.

405
00:41:58,858 --> 00:41:59,588
I won’t get on it.

406
00:41:59,956 --> 00:42:01,476
You can go alone if you want to.

407
00:42:02,015 --> 00:42:03,368
I’ll just wait here.

408
00:42:18,488 --> 00:42:19,080
Look.

409
00:42:19,977 --> 00:42:20,477
See?

410
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,995
Will you stop making that face?

411
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:28,069
Who wanted to come here exactly?

412
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:37,994
Don’t take my photo. No!

413
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:40,353
A photo of my boyfriend.

414
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:42,323
I’ll post it and people can get jealous.

415
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:44,525
Don’t post it.

416
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:45,159
Don’t.

417
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:45,945
Give me that.

418
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:46,961
Give it to me.

419
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:49,389
You posted it already?

420
00:42:51,955 --> 00:42:54,000
Why would you take photos if you don’t post them?

421
00:42:54,308 --> 00:42:55,870
I look ugly here.

422
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,807
You don’t.

423
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:58,012
I’m deleting it.

424
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:58,849
Wait.

425
00:42:58,974 --> 00:42:59,663
No.

426
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:01,250
I did.

427
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:20,069
I feel like today happened already.

428
00:43:20,568 --> 00:43:23,069
I turned your crystal ball and it took me back here.

429
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:27,317
Have you thought about how you’d fix it?

430
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:30,474
All I know is I don’t want you to get sick.

431
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:32,393
I don’t want you to die.

432
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,057
What’s the plan in your head exactly?

433
00:43:37,236 --> 00:43:40,112
(How will the story of Pisaeng and me play out?)

434
00:43:40,112 --> 00:43:41,224
(Please stay tuned.)
