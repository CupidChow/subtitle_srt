Can’t you see yourself, really?

12
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:36,080
So where is Pisaeng exactly?

00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,439

00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:16,454
Pisaeng.

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,538
Don’t follow me.

32
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:22,796
If you follow me again,

33
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:27,375
I’ll vanish from your life for good.

34
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:35,000
What if I wait right here?

35
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:39,654
Will you come back?

36
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,596
Yes, it’s true as stated on the news.

37
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:27,007
Pear and I officially separated.

38
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:30,124
We’re both sad. I must admit.

39
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:33,662
But we talked and agreed that we should move on.

40
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:36,755
There’s a rumor saying you guys broke up because you found yourself.

41
00:04:36,755 --> 00:04:38,467
Is that true?

42
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,835
That’s right. Please answer this question.

43
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:43,912
Can you explain that?

44
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:47,299
There are always photos of you and your male friend who never leaves your side.

45
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:50,421
So people think there’s something going on between you guys.

46
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:51,868
Can you talk about it?

47
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:57,253
I’m sorry.

48
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,901
Why are you apologizing?

49
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:03,881
This is not your fault.

50
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:19,072
But you didn’t slip out anything about me to anyone, did you?

51
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:22,801
What do you mean?

52
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:29,106
You don’t trust me or what?

53
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,340
It’s not that.

54
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:37,610
It’s just maybe when you’re out drinking,

55
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,366
you accidentally say something to your friends.

56
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:43,747
I never said anything to anyone.

57
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:48,776
Yeah, just forget it.

58
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:53,326
We shouldn’t be seen together in public if not necessary.

59
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:55,938
I don’t want to answer those questions.

60
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,165
They should focus on my work instead of invading my private life.

61
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:03,294
I feel like I’m being harassed somehow.

62
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:43,457
(Sorry, the number you've dialed cannot be connected…)

63

Bodkawee, my favorite singer, is here with us once again

64
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:09,731
after his new single was sent up to the top of every chart on every music streaming platform…

65
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:58,724
(I’m sorry to leave you like that.)

66
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:01,373
(It was my fault.)

67
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,233
(I was being too dramatic.)

68
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:08,899
(Don’t feel guilty. Just live your life.)

69
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:12,511
(Release new songs for me to listen to.)

70
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:15,000
(Appear on TV shows for me to watch.)

71
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:17,511
(Let’s just say…)

72
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,921
(I’ll be watching you from somewhere on Earth.)

73
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,259
(Don’t worry about me.)

74
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:51,860
You said you’d come back if I didn’t follow you.

75
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:39,702
(My life has been a lot better.)

76
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:41,976
(But is it good enough yet?)

77
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:45,388
(I’ve achieved my career goal.)

78
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:50,000
(But the one who should be most proud of me isn’t here anymore.)

79
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:55,696
(I was finally able to find love, but I couldn’t keep it.)

80
00:10:56,548 --> 00:11:01,771
(I’m surrounded by a bunch of people, but I feel lonely just the same.)

Kawi!

84

Pisaeng.

85
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:02,910
Are you all right?

86
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:05,474
You were looking distant.

87
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:10,737
Are you okay?

88
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:50,144
I thought I wouldn’t get to see you ever again.

89
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:52,801
What are you talking about?

90
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:58,603
The hospital tried to reach you but they couldn’t.

91
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,655
You’re crying because you already knew, right?

92
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:40,934
Cardiac arrhythmia is a complication that can happen after an operation.

93
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:43,935
It’s the cause of his death.

94
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,500
I’m so sorry, Kawi.

95
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:56,219
That’s okay, sir.

96
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:00,780
You did your best.

97
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:18,292
I’ll go there in two days for work.

98
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:20,086
I’m thinking of buying a house there.

99
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,670
You just told me I had time to think it through.

100
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:25,232
And you’re buying a house already.

101
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,660
It’s my friend’s house.

102
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,673
She is in need and wants to sell it.

103
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:34,732
When you broke up with Dad,

104
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:38,449
I remember you fought so hard to bring me back here.

105
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,261
Why do you want me to live close to him again?

106
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,590
Because I’m gay?

107
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:46,897
Because I think living there is better than living here.

108
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:50,559
Besides, you already have the nationality.

109
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,061
Why?

110
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:56,409
So you don’t have to witness my way of life that might annoy you?

111
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:58,809
I’m not at all disgusted by you.

112
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,311
I’m just performing a mom’s duty,

113
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:04,185
providing the best thing for you.

114
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:12,529
At least, over there, you will have the same rights as those normal people.

115
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:21,240
You will be able to start your own family and get married.

116
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,766
Isn’t that what you want?

117
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:35,499
If you ask me now, the answer is no.

118
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,049
I want to live here.

119
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:37,823
Why?

120
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:39,085
Because of Kawi?

121
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:45,386
Pisaeng,

122
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,917
there are still many chances for you to fall in love.

123
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,396
Are you willing to throw away your future just for one person?

I’m okay.

132
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,276
congratulations on the title.

133
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:34,285
Um.

134
00:16:37,282 --> 00:16:39,654
Are you free this evening?

Wondering if you want to have dinner with me.

136
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:49,029
I am.

137
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,556
Yeah.

138
00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:53,809
I will let you know right after I picked the place.

139
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:54,582
Sure.

143
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:28,620
Do you want me to stay with you here?

144
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:33,639
No.

145
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:35,591
Just go back to study.

146
00:17:39,796 --> 00:17:41,908
I need time to think about something.

147

But…

148
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:44,947
If you really want to help me,

149
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:02,991
I’d like you to read this.

150
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:11,636
I want you to trust me that everything in this diary is true.

151
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,020
And we will talk again after I’m back there.

152
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:39,489
You read it, didn’t you?

153
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:50,913
Yes, but I still don’t get it.

154
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:56,589
Is this a novel you wrote or what?

155
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:58,195
I know it’s hard to believe

156
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:03,846
or you might think I’ve lost my mind.

157
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,624
But I just want to tell you what I’ve faced all my life.

158
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:14,248
I’ve lived my life until I reached 30.

159
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:17,177
Then I came back in time

160
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:20,432
and changed many things.

161
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:23,866
Not only my life,

162
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,590
but also other people’s,

163
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,662
especially yours.

164
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:39,104
You don’t believe me, do you?

165
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:42,712
You might be thinking I’ve gone nuts

166
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,265
or sick.

167
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:47,009
Something like that, right?

168
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,059
No.

169
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:49,489
But I…

170
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,346
How can anything like this happen?

171
00:19:54,378 --> 00:19:55,819
Haven't you wondered why

172
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,125
your life just changed in a way you never planned it?

173
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:04,489
The reason for those changes is me.

174
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:08,168
Well, it’s true if you put it that way.

175
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:09,612
But…

176
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:12,748

00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:16,961
And eventually, Pear is marrying Not?

178
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:30,918
After graduation,

179
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:34,369
you will have a big fight with your mom

180
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,225
as she wants you to live abroad.

181
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:41,327
But you insist on not going.

182
00:20:43,262 --> 00:20:44,104
Right now,

183
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:47,359
there are only you and your mom who know about this.

184
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:50,293
How do you think I knew that?

185
00:20:58,262 --> 00:20:59,029
Okay.

186
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:02,544
It’s fine if you don’t believe me.

187
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:08,421
Let’s just say it’s a nonsense story I wrote.

188
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:15,017
You can just…

189
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:18,805
forget it.

190
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:23,256
Okay.

191
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:24,078
I believe you.

192
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:31,628
And if that’s true, what are you trying to tell me here?

193
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,562
If you believe what I wrote,

194
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,815
you’ll see that if we get off on the wrong foot,

195
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:45,824
no one is going to be happy in the future.

196
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:49,503
Especially you.

197
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:55,617
And I don’t want you to get hurt because of me anymore.

198
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:00,006
I told you.

199
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,784
You don’t have to care about me.

200
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,231
I will set everything right.

201
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:09,464
So, please.

202
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:16,619
Please trust me and do as I say.

203
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,515
What do you want me to do?

204
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:30,661
Well…

205
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:34,137
I…

206
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,026
I just…

207
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:39,667
I…

208
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:41,929
I want to–

209
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,489
Okay. I get it.

210
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,667
You’re uncomfortable with me around

211
00:22:46,743 --> 00:22:47,710
because you’re afraid Pear will get the wrong idea.

212
00:22:48,023 --> 00:22:49,660
You don’t want problems with her, right?

213
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:51,266
Don’t worry.

214
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:52,661
Rest assured.

215
00:22:58,823 --> 00:23:00,935
[Pear: See you there at 7 p.m.]

216
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:06,273
Pisaeng.

217
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,679
Please help clear off my stuff in the office.

218
00:23:13,782 --> 00:23:16,900
And check if everything is okay.

219
00:23:17,391 --> 00:23:18,296
Don’t forget it, all right?

220
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:21,404
I don't think I’ll stop by the office anymore.

221
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:23,998
I’ll see you at the airport.

222
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:26,359
What’s the flight time again?

223
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,506
10 p.m.?

224
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:30,821
Okay. I’ll see you then.

225
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:34,489
You’re flying tonight?

226
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:38,360
That’s right.

227
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:43,865
Are you coming with me?

228
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:55,039
You’re home so early today.

229
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:57,561
I’m here to store my stuff.

230
00:23:59,652 --> 00:24:01,652
Can you eat by yourself tonight?

231
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:04,060
Of course, I can.

232
00:24:04,806 --> 00:24:06,231
Why are you asking me that?

233
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:11,771
Because I’m going out to have dinner with Kawi.

234
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,409
Hm?

235
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:14,391
Pear,

236
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:16,537
did you forget something?

237
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:21,212
Your mom is having her exhibition at the gallery.

238
00:24:22,264 --> 00:24:24,264
You told me you would come.

239
00:24:52,748 --> 00:24:53,521
Pear.

240
00:24:58,613 --> 00:24:59,641
That’s fine.

241
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,318
I understand.

242
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,273
Hey! Don’t apologize.

243
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:06,155
Okay.

244
00:25:40,263 --> 00:25:44,675
I'd like to ask society to see humans as humans.

245
00:25:45,018 --> 00:25:47,416
Our blood is all red when it bleeds.

246
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:56,201
There are no members of the LGBTQIA+ community who have purple or pink blood.

247
00:25:56,514 --> 00:26:07,191
However, we suffer discrimination and unfair treatment, both socially, professionally, as well as legally,

248
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:12,791
which should be the basic right we all deserve.

249
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:18,221
Nonetheless, LGBTQIA+ people do not have the same rights as straight men and women do.

250
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:23,473
We are not asking for more rights than others.

251
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:32,386
We are just asking for the basic rights that we are entitled to as humans.

252
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:39,824
So, please give us back our dignity to live as humans.

253
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:41,216
Thank you so much.

254
00:26:59,063 --> 00:27:01,063
So? What happened?

255
00:27:01,462 --> 00:27:03,462
You said you were meeting Pear.

256
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:05,223
How did you end up here with me?

257
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,703
Pear got something urgent to do.

258
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:13,613
So you lost another chance to ask her to be your girlfriend, huh?

259
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:16,982
Wait.

260
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:21,033
Isn’t that what you planned to do?

261
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:30,061
Max, you’re up next.

262
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:31,100
Please get ready.

263
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,847
Of course.

264
00:27:52,944 --> 00:27:53,712
Max.

265
00:27:55,154 --> 00:28:05,883
What if the change you’re fighting for doesn’t come so easily?

266
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:08,613
Will you keep on fighting?

267
00:28:14,515 --> 00:28:16,341
Between fighting and not fighting,

268
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:19,263
which one can give you the worse result?

269
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:22,956
Nothing comes easy.

270
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:26,135
But so?

271
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:29,797
Fighting is better than giving up anyway, right?

272
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:50,666
Thank you so much for helping me realize I should stay here and keep fighting,

273
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:53,755
not running away to somewhere else.

274
00:29:03,054 --> 00:29:04,017
You’re up.

275
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:04,880
Please.

276
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:06,404
Okay.

277
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:23,613
Good evening, everyone.

278
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:31,937
I strongly believe that love is what brought you all here.

279
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:37,650
Whether it’s love for your body,

280
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:40,416
your soul,

281
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,780
or even love for someone.

282
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:48,882
But sometimes,

283
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:53,171
our love is judged as something wrong.

284
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,839
And that makes us afraid to love

285
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:01,656
or scared to love.

286
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:04,570
Anyways,

287
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:08,239
love is love.

288
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:11,582
Once it happens,

289
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:16,681
we have the right to nourish and grow it.

290
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:23,812
Love has no right or wrong.

291
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:26,639
[Kawi: What are you doing?]

292
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:27,968
[Pisaeng: Why?]

293
00:30:28,053 --> 00:30:32,119
No one has the right to judge love.
[Kawi: I just wanna know. If you’re free, you can come join me and Max.]

294
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:32,921
[Pisaeng: Aren’t you with Pear?]

295
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:35,441
[Kawi: Pear is busy. Tell me where you are.]

296
00:30:35,824 --> 00:30:37,071
[Pisaeng: I’m headed to the airport.]

297
00:30:39,483 --> 00:30:40,236
Huh?

298
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,183
[Kawi: Now?]

299
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,316
Hey!

300
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:51,892
Hey!

301
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:56,574
(Is it because I gave him my diary? That’s why this change happened.)

302
00:30:56,574 --> 00:30:59,940
(He decided to live abroad even sooner.)

303
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:04,556
Pisaeng, let’s hit the road.

304
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:07,213
My secretary is waiting at the airport now.

305
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:08,505
Come on.

306
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:14,281
[Pisaeng: Yes. Why?]

307
00:31:24,574 --> 00:31:25,375
Where is it?

308
00:31:32,013 --> 00:31:33,088
Come on. Turn on.

309
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:38,076
Turn on.

310
00:31:53,002 --> 00:31:54,505
Hello. What’s up?

311
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:55,344
Hello, Pisaeng.

312
00:31:55,344 --> 00:31:56,335
I’m not letting you go.

313
00:31:57,021 --> 00:31:57,825
What did you say?

314
00:31:58,024 --> 00:31:58,933
Damn you.

315
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:02,341
The last time we talked, it wasn’t even clear yet.

316
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:03,543
Hold on, Kawi.

317
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:04,783
What are you talking about?

318
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:09,433
I gave you the diary so that you know I don’t want things to turn out like that.

319
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:11,782
I said I wanted to set everything right

320
00:32:11,782 --> 00:32:13,782
but that doesn’t mean I want you out of my life.

321
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:18,288
I already knew how painful it was to lose you.

322
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:20,113
Why would I want to lose you again?

323
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:26,944
I was meeting Pear to let her know I can’t be with her.

324
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:30,306
Why not?

325
00:32:30,813 --> 00:32:31,941
Because…

326
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,613
Can you come back first?

327
00:32:38,613 --> 00:32:39,445
We’ll talk later.

328
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:44,312
Hello, Pisaeng.

329
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:45,415
Can you hear me?

330
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:51,136
Damn it!

331
00:32:54,318 --> 00:32:55,516
Kawi, hello.

332
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:06,119
(The number you've dialed cannot be connected…)

333
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:42,010
(Even when I knew what to do, I couldn’t do it in time.)

334
00:33:45,385 --> 00:33:49,076
(In the end, I still lost him.)

335
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:35,773
Pisaeng.

336
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,485
What’s wrong with you?

337
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,771
You look like you’re seeing a ghost.

338
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:46,417
And your damn phone has such a shitty battery.

339
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,554
I think you should get a new one.

340
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:49,233
You can borrow my money.

341
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:52,159
It’s freaking annoying. The call always gets cut off.

342
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,931
How many times already?

343
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:54,973
Didn’t you fly to another country?

344
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:56,194
Fly what?

345
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:59,045
I was just seeing my mom off.

346
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,034
Hey.

347
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:07,833
What are you doing?

348
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:08,609
You asshole.

349
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:10,769
You’re freaking me out.

350
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:11,948
Stop it.

351
00:35:13,393 --> 00:35:14,423
What’s the matter with you?

352
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:18,426
I’m the one freaking out because I have no idea what’s going on.

353
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:24,295
I thought you already left to live abroad.

354
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:25,477
Huh?

355
00:35:27,874 --> 00:35:30,247
What made you think I’d go tonight?

356
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:42,201
Honestly, after we talked today,

357
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:48,235
I was hesitant about whether I should do as my mom told me to.

358
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,733
But that’s set for after graduation.

359
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:54,904
I don’t know.

360
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,911
Maybe I was scared.

361
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:02,068
Scared of what?

362
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:05,740
I don’t know.

363
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:13,325
You didn’t make it clear when we talked on the phone.

364
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,370
Say whatever you want now.

365
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,269
I…

366
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,673
I don’t remember.

367
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:32,176
You said you couldn’t be with Pear anymore.

368
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:33,884
I asked you why.

369
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:35,520
You haven’t answered me.

370
00:36:50,212 --> 00:36:51,201
If you don’t say it,

371
00:36:51,897 --> 00:36:52,908
I’ll leave then.

372
00:36:54,552 --> 00:36:55,955
Because I don’t like Pear.

373
00:36:55,955 --> 00:36:56,877
I like you.

374
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:04,495
What did you just say?

375
00:37:08,614 --> 00:37:10,614
When I said I wanted to set things right between us,

376
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,118
I meant…

377
00:37:16,824 --> 00:37:18,824
I meant can you and I get together?

378
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:45,501
Are you really saying you want to be with me?

379
00:37:52,953 --> 00:37:53,674
Um.

380
00:37:58,339 --> 00:37:59,311
I have no idea...

381
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,154
...when the feelings for you started.

382
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:12,117
Without realizing it,

383
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:16,847
you’ve become an important part of my life.

384
00:38:20,604 --> 00:38:21,676
It’s the part...

385
00:38:24,712 --> 00:38:26,436
that I can’t lose ever again.

386
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:37,527
When…

387
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:41,652
When I didn’t have you by my side,

388
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,905
I knew right away

389
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:54,872
that it was the biggest mistake of my life.

390
00:39:03,288 --> 00:39:04,072
I can’t…

391
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:07,768
let that happen again.

392
00:39:16,744 --> 00:39:17,532
Therefore,

393
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,056
I will set everything right.

394
00:39:28,258 --> 00:39:29,999
Will you go out with me?

395
00:39:52,052 --> 00:39:52,834
No.

396
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:22,246
If you want to set everything right,

397
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:29,138
you must let me hit on you first.

398
00:40:34,686 --> 00:40:36,160
I haven’t hit on you yet.

399
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:47,859
What are you even saying?

400
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:49,644
Hold on.

401
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:51,238
Where are you going?

402
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:53,053
Let me hit on you first.

403
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:00,315
It looks so good.

404
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:05,248
Hitting on someone like you is so easy.

405
00:41:05,873 --> 00:41:06,825
Just take you out to eat.

406
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:08,613
Yeah?

407
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,868
Nice mouth.

408
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,609
A while ago, you were having a sad puppy face.

409
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:22,187
Hey!

410
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:24,244
I better not.

411
00:41:25,493 --> 00:41:26,580
I think I’ll quit drinking.

412
00:41:28,413 --> 00:41:29,085
Why?

413
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:36,680
Come to think of it, liquor helps in a way.

414
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,308
It helps make my life more fun.

415
00:41:41,357 --> 00:41:43,912
With it, I do things I’m not brave enough to do.

416
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:52,270
Even so, if I use it too often, it comes back and hurts me.

417
00:41:56,924 --> 00:41:57,554
That’s good.

418
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,373
Whoa!

419
00:42:10,726 --> 00:42:11,335
Let’s eat.

420
00:42:11,335 --> 00:42:12,152
Sure.

421
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,217
It’s so good.

422
00:42:31,543 --> 00:42:32,340
Good, huh?

423
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:34,448
What’s this fish, chef?

424
00:42:37,443 --> 00:42:38,388
I have no idea.

425
00:42:53,147 --> 00:42:56,239
(The number you've dialed cannot be connected…)

426
00:43:37,733 --> 00:43:38,381
Young man.

427
00:43:41,491 --> 00:43:42,373
What’s wrong with your car?

428
00:43:46,113 --> 00:43:46,992
I’m not sure.

429
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,391
I’m calling the mechanic.

430
00:43:50,706 --> 00:43:52,132
Looks like you’re in a hurry.

431
00:43:53,307 --> 00:43:54,452
Do you want me to help look?

432
00:43:56,581 --> 00:43:57,492
In case I can fix it.

433
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:07,244
That’s okay.

434
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:08,475
I think I can manage.

435
00:44:08,766 --> 00:44:09,373
Thank you.

436
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:22,371
I just want to cuddle you all day.

437
00:44:24,374 --> 00:44:24,931
Kawi.

438
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:27,373
We are now together.

439
00:44:27,627 --> 00:44:28,283
What?

440
00:44:28,283 --> 00:44:29,627
You said you’d hit on me first.

441
00:44:29,943 --> 00:44:30,765
Kawi.

442
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,165
What?

443
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:33,904
Can I get a kiss?

444
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:38,325
I believe that the future will be as good as it can get.

445
00:44:38,782 --> 00:44:42,966
No matter what happens, we will hold hands and get through it together.
