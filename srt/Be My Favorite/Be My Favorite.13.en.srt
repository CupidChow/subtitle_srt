1
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,770
I graduated without any close friends.

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,230
My dad died.

3
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,980
Work hard to pay off my debt.

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,290
Of course. It’ll be right on time.

5
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,520
And…

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,800
I’ve always had a crush on you, Pear.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,970
But there’s already someone I like.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,930
Heartbroken.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,670
All of my dooms are because of this guy.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,280
Oops.

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,330
Hey!

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,670
Pearmai’s secret buddy, please reveal yourself.

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,760
That’s me.ง

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,790
I’m Pearmai’s secret buddy.

15
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,360
Why did you take over as Pearmai’s secret buddy?

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,770
Because you didn’t freaking show up.

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,120
I didn’t want her to be sad.

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,450
Pisaeng, the guy who ruins my life.

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,730
If you could fix it, what would you do with it?

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,800
I want to give it to someone.

21
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,170
In the first episode, Bodkawee has absolutely no friends.

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,240
He’s all alone.

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,380
Even in his graduation photo, he’s standing there all alone in the corner.

24
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,420
Everyone else has their photos taken with friends.

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,810
But in episodes 2 and 3, we will start to see some changes.

26
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,460
We will see that he’s having more friends.

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,540
He clears things out with Max.

28
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:29,760
He talks to his classmates more, like Not and the others.

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,610
Bodkawee’s life is slightly changing.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,190
At the beginning, Kawi travels back in time to try hitting on Pearmai.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,520
Pisaeng sees that he’s trying to give her a gift and do things for her.

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,410
He eventually tells Pisaeng he likes Pearmai.

33
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,410
So Pisaeng tries to help Kawi out.

34
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,570
He brings Kawi to eat with her and introduces them,

35
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,820
giving him a chance to hit on her.

36
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,680
Kawi.

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,440
I invited Kawi along.

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,830
Hope you don’t mind.

39
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,240
I don’t.

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,330
I’m just curious about when you two became close.

41
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,960
Pear, I’ll step outside to use a phone.

42
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,320
You two continue.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,280
I think everyone can tell.

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,370
I like Pisaeng.

45
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,370
The truth is…

46
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,560
I never think of you as more than a friend.

47
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,840
I actually got the hint.

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,630
I was just waiting to hear from you directly.

49
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,820
He actually tells me he never thinks of me that way.

50
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,060
I’m okay with it.

51
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,350
And I decided to continue being a good friend to him, anyway.

52
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,610
We will have to see if they still get married in the future.

53
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,120
Pearmai’s character since episode 1 until now,

54
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:17,610
I think everyone can sense her positive energy, her liveliness, her friendliness,

55
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,820
and her kindness to everyone.

56
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,720
She looks at things in a positive way.

57
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,160
Everyone in the faculty, in the university,

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:39,260
including Kawi and Pisaeng thinks this girl is nice. She is a good person.

59
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,150
My dad is out of town. If not open the bottle now, then when?

60
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:53,880
But in episode 5, we will start seeing that we’ve always looked at her from one side only.

61
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,670
She is gradually revealing the other side of her.

62
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,320
The audience will see that no one is a pure angel.

63
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,620
There must be something bad about her.

64
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,730
Looking for something?

65
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,440
You’re dumb not to lock it.

66
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,800
- Give me that.
- No.

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,880
You’re blocked.

68
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,130
Blocked.

69
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,490
I didn’t think this is how you truly are, Kawi.

70
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,690
How am I?

71
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,480
So what?

72
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,610
What are you gonna do?

73
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:34,770
Everyone knows that in episodes 1, 2, and 3, we serve romantic comedy.

74
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,640
There’re fight scenes, touching moments, and jokes being played.

75
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,910
“Blocked. You’re blocked.”

76
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,260
We are given the story’s background first, ready to go into the intense part later on.

77
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,400
After this, we’ll see more drama and fantasy in the series.

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,020
So it’s getting more and more intensive.

79
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,660
From episode 5 to the end,

80
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,580
it’s not going to be like the first 3.

81
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,740
It won’t be cute and lovey-dovey. No.

82
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,800
It’s about living a life.

83
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,460
There will be a question; if we travel back in time and change the past,

84
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:18,030
but as a result, everyone else’s life is ruined but yours is great,

85
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,080
will you still accept it?

86
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,730
Or after traveling back in time, everyone else’s life is great but yours is ruined,

87
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,730
will you accept it?

88
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,410
Something like that.

89
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,800
It’s about making a mature decision.

90
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:37,060
I think you will see Bodkawee, Pisaeng, and Pearmai slowly grow up as the number of episodes goes up.

91
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:46,480
Kawi goes back to the present to see if he changes anything at all.

92
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,370
But it turns out he doesn’t.

93
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,960
More importantly, I, Pisaeng, seem to fall in love with him.

94
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,580
Things start to get more complicated.

95
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,860
They don’t go as he plans it.

96
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,520
Everytime Bodkawee travels back in time, there’s a butterfly effect.

97
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,200
Whatever he changes, the future somehow shifts.

98
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,520
If he fixes a small thing, the future might not be affected so much.

99
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,540
If he fixes a bigger thing, the future might be affected more greatly.

100
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,160
Sometimes, after he changes a certain thing,

101
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
it turns out that Pisaeng and Bodkawee end up marrying each other.

102
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,130
However, in a different timeline, things aren’t like that.

103
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,100
They are changed to something else.

104
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:35,000
I’d like the audience to see if the relationship between these three people will develop into any other type of relationship.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,220
The love drama is there, for sure.

106
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,840
But then there’s this issue about his father.

107
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,130
What is he going to do to help his father?

108
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,370
Can he help him? Will he let him go?

109
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,380
Because sometimes traveling back in time doesn’t prevent death, right?

110
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,820
You must tune in and see.

111
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,900
After fixing the thing with his dad,

112
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,770
he must fix his love life too.

113
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,290
Because he’s still alive and has to live on.

114
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,520
Let’s see how he’s going to fix the thing between him and Pisaeng.

115
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:11,020
After this, we will see a clearer relationship between Bodkawee and Pisaeng.

116
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,810
In the first episodes, he’s a bit afriad of Pisaeng as he knows Pisaeng likes him, right?

117
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:24,740
Also, now Pisaeng is accepting more and more of who he is and how he feels.

118
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,380
When we started filming this series,

119
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,410
we only knew the storyline up to episode 9.

120
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,400
We didn’t know what’s gonna happen after that, in episodes 9-12.

121
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,370
That means when I played this role, I could sense the childishness of Bodkawee.

122
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,620
But from episode 9 on,

123
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,850
I knew this character was a lot more mature.

124
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,680
Well, Bodkawee is a actually 30-year-old man traveling back in time.

125
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,920
But he’s still a silly 30-year-old man.

126
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,210
Then he is slightly changed by Pisaeng, by his classmates,

127
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,580
by people around him, and by Pearmai.

128
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,200
Then he grows more mature.

129
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,650
His decision-making, his thoughts, his emotions, and his problem-solving skills are better.

130
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,080
As time goes by, the characters are growing and turning into adults,

131
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,540
they have more things to think about.

132
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:20,960
Their work, family, money, and future.

133
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,610
Every character, not just Pearmai and Bodkawee, will learn more.

134
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,920
They might be flat characters before, showing only one side,

135
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,450
we will see different sides of every character.

136
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,600
You’re honest about what you want.

137
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,320
You know what you want in life.

138
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,420
And you’re bringing yourself to that point.

139
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,130
To me, that’s not annoying at all.

140
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,270
It’s something you should be proud of.

141
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,780
Thank you for your support, Kawi.

142
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,490
What about you?

143
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,350
What do you want to do in the future?

144
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,200
Me?

145
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,620
Nothing much.

146
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,410
I’ll be just a subtitler, just the same.

147
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,440
No way.

148
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Nobody always stays in the same spot.

149
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,720
We must step ahead.

150
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:20,390
My talent…

151
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,250
I like writing songs.

152
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,700
Hey. That’s cool!

153
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,300
Sing us a song that you wrote.

154
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,960
♪ Everyday source of energy ♪

155
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,640
♪ Comes from someone’s smile so pretty ♪

156
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,230
♪ That someone is you ♪

157
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,560
I don’t see how I’m a good match for you.

158
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,460
You’re cute.

159
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,460
Does this reason sound enough?

160
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,960
Kawi’s father is having heart disease.

161
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,770
It’s pretty severe.

162
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,210
Is that so?

163
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,480
He’s waiting to get treatment in a public facility.

164
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,370
It should be some time before he is treated.

165
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,800
Ah.

166
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,160
Can you…

167
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,890
take Kawi’s dad as a patient under your care?

168
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,750
Why did you tell Pear about my dad?

169
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,860
I just wanted to help.

170
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,570
You’re finding a way to treat your dad, aren’t you?

171
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,500
If I waited for you to tell Pear yourself,

172
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,600
it’d be too late already.

173
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,660
This is actually so challenging to me.

174
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,920
People might say the way Kawi eats is like mine.

175
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,860
The way Kawi throws a tantrum is like mine.

176
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,210
His gestures or expressions might be like mine

177
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,180
but there’s nothing alike on the inside.

178
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,720
For example, people help him but he gets angry at them.

179
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,250
Whatever help he gets, he becomes mad. He’s angry and runs away from the helper.

180
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,570
He chooses to keep his distance instead of talking things out nicely.

181
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,130
At first, I just didn’t get Bodkawee at all.

182
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,130
That makes it hard to express things from Bodkawee’s point of view.

183
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,130
Because I didn’t quite understand him.

184
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,780
But then I got to read the script of episodes 8-11.

185
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,000
It’s exactly what P’Waa said.

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,530
Every character does things because they have their own reason.

187
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:44,550
Please don’t jump to the conclusion that Kawi is silly or always problematic yet.

188
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,120
Keep watching and you will understand this character more.

189
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,650
Staff: What are you doing?

190
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,020
(I don’t know.)

191
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,730
(We will see.)

192
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,880
I usually read my lines one more time before coming to the filming set.

193
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,800
But I’m so sleepy today.

194
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,080
Can I take a nap first?

195
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,400
You won’t get any useful information from me.

196
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,370
I ordered my own breakfast today.

197
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,370
What did we have here on set?

198
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,680
Staff: Stewed Pork Leg on Rice.

199
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
German Pork Hocks.

200
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,970
Staff: Thai Style Stewed Pork Leg.

201
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,120
Ah, it’s Thai Style Stewed Pork Leg, not German.

202
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,550
Really? I love Stewed Pork Leg.

203
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,890
I’m not sad.

204
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,960
I’m sleepy.

205
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,740
I arrived at 6 and will stay on until the last scene.

206
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,100
And…action!

207
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,230
Kawi.

208
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,080
Kawi.

209
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,510
Wow.

210
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,930
I’m so jealous.

211
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,150
Will you change your mind then?

212
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,870
Change my mind about what?

213
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,030
Accept my feelings.

214
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,020
I’ll take you in right now.

215
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
But I still like Pearmai.

216
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,980
I know.

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,330
But I’ll wait.

218
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,910
I’m a patient kind of guy.

219
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,710
Yeah?

220
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,490
I feel lucky to have P’Krist as a working partner.

221
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:36,470
Because I feel like he can advise me on lots of things as he has more experience.

222
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,810
I can always consult him.

223
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,140
I feel like he quite opens up to me.

224
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,690
The same goes for me.

225
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,200
It’s like we were willing to be open-minded the first time we met.

226
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,720
I’m glad to have met him.

227
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,060
So glad to meet Gawin,

228
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,650
to work with him.

229
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:01,320
And I’m glad his interests and lifestyle match mine perfectly.

230
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,550
We don’t have to look for anything we can do together because we already like the same stuff.

231
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,600
Pisaeng.

232
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,420
You’re up.

233
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,630
Want a coffee?

234
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,560
Hey. I…

235
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,160
I was so drunk last night.

236
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,200
And I…

237
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,400
All right.

238
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,630
I know.

239
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,620
I don’t know what happened.

240
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,620
But you and I kissed.

241
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,620
- Was that real or just a dream?
- Kawi!

242
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,730
Good morning.

243
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,370
How matching are these two?

244
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,420
They have the same interest which is music.

245
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,090
When they are on breaks or after the shooting,

246
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,280
they would just talk about music.

247
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,660
It’s like their thing.

248
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,010
♪ How much pain you want me to go through ♪

249
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,480
♪ Go ahead, I will endure ♪

250
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,840
♪ Just one thing I won’t do ♪

251
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,640
♪ Won’t do it for you ♪

252
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,120
♪ Is to stop loving you ♪

253
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,120
We’re at the beach now.

254
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,870
We’re in Sattahip district.

255
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,280
This is the last queue of Be My Favorite.

256
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,680
How you do feel?

257
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,720
I feel like it’s fast.

258
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,820
Right.

259
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,570
Time went by so fast.

260
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,570
Here we are shooting the last queue.

261
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,220
Please don’t forget to watch the series, guys.

262
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,980
Let’s see how it goes today.

263
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,410
We both are not social media addicts at all.

264
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,450
It’s our little problem as the fans always want to see us and meet us online.

265
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,810
They want to see a bit of our moments.

266
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,720
Unfortunately, we’re both mysterious.

267
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,440
But we will try.

268
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,030
I got only one shot to get wet.

269
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,900
Well, there’s a bit more to shoot actually.

270
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,160
But my shoes are okay.

271
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,490
At the beginning, we were quite awkward when playing romantic scenes,

272
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,660
sweet scenes, or those flirting scenes.

273
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,040
We were tense and blushing.

274
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,380
I’m not that professional.

275
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,490
I was quite shy in workshops.

276
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,210
And a little shy when shooting.

277
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,600
But we talked to each other.

278
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,840
We agreed that we’d go full-on and get it over with.

279
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,370
High five. Let’s go.

280
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,560
We’ve arrived.

281
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,180
This is the first time I walk home.

282
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,080
I just knew that we could walk quite far when walking with a friend.

283
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,180
I’m sorry I don’t have a car to drive you home.

284
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,270
Hey. It’s totally fine.

285
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,910
This is fun.

286
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,240
Let’s walk together again next time.

287
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,010
Okay.

288
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
I’ll just get inside.

289
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,650
Get home safe, Kawi.

290
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,450
This is the first time I work with Aye.

291
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:51,710
I’m so impressed with her acting skills in each scene.

292
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,640
Aye is so good at playing drama scenes.

293
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,920
And there are quite a lot in this series.

294
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,250
I think the series suits Aye pretty well.

295
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,340
Pearmai is quite a perfectionist.

296
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,760
She must be perfect. She does things in patterns.

297
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,930
I think Aye is pretty much like that too.

298
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:19,600
I think Aye is a female actress in the company I work with the most.

299
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,100
I’ve shot three consecutive series with her.

300
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,300
No breaks. Three consecutive.

301
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,970
The War of Flowers, Good Old Days, and Be My Favorite.

302
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,980
So glad to have worked with this little sister.

303
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:37,450
The first time I met her with her Sizzy members, I felt like Aye was the most unreachable one.

304
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,960
I wasn’t sure how to approach and talk to her.

305
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,180
She looks elegant and divine, you know?

306
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,900
She’s a perfect girl.

307
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,840
I was like, ‘Will we be able to talk and get along?’

308
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,090
But after three series with her, I’m telling you she’s so lovely.

309
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,920
I’m so glad to work with her again.

310
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,100
We’re used to each other now.

311
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,610
When I meet her, I feel like I’m meeting a little sister.

312
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,900
I’d like to thank her because Pearmai is a difficult character to play.

313
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,230
Very difficult.

314
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,260
But Aye pulls off Pearmai’s character so perfectly.

315
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,590
I talked to her and she told me the hardest scene for her was when she must act happy.

316
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,730
Happy like, “Woo! I’m so happy!”

317
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,570
Aye doesn’t excel in that.

318
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,250
She is a master of drama scenes.

319
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,920
She loves playing dramatic and sad scenes.

320
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,140
But Pearmai is extremely lively.

321
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,900
So I think it’s hard for her.

322
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,020
Anyway, she pulls off Pearmai in such a lovely way.

323
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:31,970
I read the audience’s comments. They all said Aye was cute and lively as Pearmai.

324
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,780
So yeah, our Aye just is great.

325
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,340
I feel like I work with P’Krist a lot.

326
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,860
That’s why I’m comfortable.

327
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,020
We kind of know each other’s working style.

328
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,330
So our collaboration flows nicely.

329
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,460
I know P’Krist’s acting style.

330
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,410
I know how we should act together in the scenes.

331
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,530
That can help us get work done faster.

332
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,450
We aren’t awkward around each other anymore as it’s been many series together already.

333
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,410
There aren’t that many characters in this series.

334
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,920
Sometimes, we shot all day with only 2-3 characters.

335
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,040
At first, since the very first queues,

336
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,040
I’ve always thought P’Fluke and P’Krist balance each other so well.

337
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,370
P’Krist do things fast and is full of energy.

338
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,600
P’Fluke, on the other hand, is slower.

339
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,380
So it’s as if there’s one leader and one follower.

340
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,420
Also, they are both musicians and singers.

341
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,690
That makes them match even better.

342
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:39,140
Be My Favorite is a bit in contrast to the reality as Pisaeng looks more like a leader.

343
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,890
Bodkawee seems like a follower.

344
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,860
Pisaeng always gives suggestions and advice, taking Bodkawee to do this and that.

345
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,700
When acting together, however,

346
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,840
they still make a good match even though they switch roles.

347
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,890
I think when they’re together, it’s good, cute, balanced, and suitable.

348
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,230
Staff: Taking a nap while waiting.

349
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,880
This is Japanese food.

350
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,440
What is it?

351
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,250
Look Chin. (*Trying to make it sound like a Japanese word.)

352
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:15,960
Look Chin?

353
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,630
Look Chin Siab Mai.

354
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,060
Yes, it means Pork Ball on Stick.

355
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,450
Don’t be confused.

356
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,960
No, I won’t.

357
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,400
If you want to, you go by yourself.

358
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,900
It’s pretty fun.

359
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,330
We went in to see dinosaurs.

360
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,370
I’ve never seen dinosaurs before.

361
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,830
Open your mouth.

362
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,090
Let’s try again.

363
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,730
There are only two queues left for today.

364
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,090
And we’re finishing up the shooting for Be My Favorite.

365
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,350
It’s been so short and so fun shooting this series.

366
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,290
I don’t want you guys to miss it.

367
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,770
We’re here at the wedding scene.

368
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,210
I’m telling you, you must…

369
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,160
What is this?

370
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,190
Staff: Poke your eye?

371
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,900
Guess again.

372
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,760
What is this?

373
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,680
Staff: Cover your eye?

374
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,360
Not cover your eye.

375
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,680
Go again.

376
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,420
Staff: Catch your eye. (Thai idiom meaning ‘Tune into’)

377
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,320
Yes, please tune into it.

378
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
The wedding scene is really something, I’m telling you.

379
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,140
Let’s see how things play out and who is going to end up with who.

380
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,090
Will Pear marry Bodkawee?

381
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,640
He cries because he always ruins relationships,

382
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,960
whether between him and his friend, someone he likes, or even his dad.

383
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,330
He talks badly to his dad even though he has good intentions.

384
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,690
He doesn’t want his dad to sacrifice so much for him.

385
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,560
But he doesn’t say it in a nice way.

386
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,970
He regrets what he did.

387
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,810
You know how lucky you are to have this chance?

388
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,260
Why don’t you make use of it?

389
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,180
Your words hurt me.

390
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,850
I also have a heart.

391
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,180
The crystal ball can only take you back in time.

392
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,730
but if you want to better your life, you must take action.

393
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,220
How was it?

394
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,890
He plays a mysterious man with magic power.

395
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,780
Look at our outfits. Do we look like father and son?

396
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,730
We dress like father and son.

397
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,210
He gives me the magic power that helps me travel back in time.

398
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,170
But I ruin my life.

399
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,360
I complain to him and blame him for ruining my life.

400
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,150
I adore and am bonded with him because I’ve been watching him since he was young.

401
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,770
That’s my interpretation.

402
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,660
I’ve been watching him for years since he was young.

403
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:06,040
There was a time when I was busy with something else.

404
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,860
During that time, he causes so many messes.

405
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,430
So I have to come back.

406
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,740
To give me advice.

407
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,860
To give him advice.

408
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,500
But I also let him learn his lesson.

409
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,110
If he doesn’t learn from his experience, he can never be successful.

410
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,540
I saw Uncle Pu’s drama since I was young.

411
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,810
I thought his acting is so dramatic.

412
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,310
When he is acting, he expresses it through his entire body.

413
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,770
For example, when he says “Why are you doing this?”

414
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,890
His whole body is shaking.

415
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,490
I saw that since I was young.

416
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,190
When I have a chance to work with him in this series,

417
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,060
It’s very fun.

418
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,280
When he’s acting, he uses his entire body.

419
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,150
So it’s fun when we are interacting in a scene.

420
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,790
He is nice and friendly.

421
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:52,270
I felt nervous to talk to him because he is much older than me.

422
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,810
But when I talked to him, I really enjoyed it.

423
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,470
He’s very nice.

424
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,370
I’m glad that I have a chance to work with him for the first time.

425
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,020
I’ve seen him since I was young.

426
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,160
Dad, don’t worry.

427
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,450
Everyone who got surgery at the hospital,

428
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,980
They all recovered well.

429
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,570
I’m proud of you.

430
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,610
Cut.

431
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,210
Acting with P’Kob is amazing.

432
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,790
He plays my father.

433
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,290
This scene is dramatic.

434
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,100
I can feel the powerful energy of the veteran actor from him.

435
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,100
The power of a musical actor.

436
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,890
His eyes expression,

437
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,580
It’s incredible.

438
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,810
Daddy, Daddy.

439
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,750
This is my father.

440
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,340
This is P’Kob.

441
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,660
I came to the filming set at 6 am.

442
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,670
We came at 6 am.

443
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,690
It’s not 8 am yet.

444
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,750
Right now, it’s 7.50 am.

445
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,340
We finished the filming.

446
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,140
I have worked with P’Kob many times on different projects.

447
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,720
I worked with him on a few drama series such as “Who Are You”

448
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,710
Our paths have crossed several times.

449
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,100
He is easygoing but very serious when it comes to work.

450
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,230
Everyone in the drama set knows it.

451
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,830
If he is scheduled to come to the filming set at 9 am,

452
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,730
he will arrive at 8.00 - 8.30 am.

453
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,990
He usually arrives early.

454
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:18,050
He often said the reason that he arrived early was that he wanted to avoid traffic jams.

455
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,020
He said he came early because he wanted to work.

456
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,070
Everyone thinks he is amazing.

457
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,030
He has been working in this business since I was young.

458
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,660
But he is still hard-working.

459
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,490
He gives me energy.

460
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,420
He once told me not to feel nervous when acting.

461
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,030
He said it was like we were playing table tennis.

462
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,420
He told me not to be afraid if I would do well or not.

463
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,970
Acting is like playing table tennis.

464
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,890
If we don’t help each other, we both will look bad.

465
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,620
Thank you, P’Kob, for your advice.

466
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,450
Cut.

467
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,500
It’s good.

468
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
It’s good.

469
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,330
I’m not going out tonight if that’s what you’re asking me.

470
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,340
I don’t have as much money as you to party every night.

471
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,340
No.

472
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,060
I’m not asking you to go anywhere.

473
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,740
I’m just sick of Not’s group.

474
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,720
And Kaawi is eating at Pear’s.

475
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,590
I didn’t know who to go to.

476
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,890
Are we friends already?

477
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,730
Hey!

478
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,910
Aou has a magic power.

479
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,770
When we feel fired or out of energy,

480
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,580
He will boost our energy.

481
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,450
He is bright and lively.

482
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,290
After talking to him, I think we get along well.

483
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,180
The important thing is I want to thank him for playing Max.

484
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,230
Max is not an easy role.

485
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,740
The character has many details that will be revealed after this.

486
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,560
You’re going to humiliate yourself in front of the crowd.

487
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,960
♪ To someone who frequently smiles ♪

488
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,790
Hey.

489
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,090
Is that the sound of a mosquito flying?

490
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,110
Today is the student rep voting day, isn’t it?

491
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,290
Aren’t you going?

492
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,830
Of course.

493
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,460
I’m waiting for Kawi.

494
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,670
Good luck.

495
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,100
I hope you are selected.

496
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:16,220
Title plays a friend that I was closed with in high school.

497
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,670
We were close when we were in high school.

498
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,330
After getting into university,

499
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,370
We are drifting apart.

500
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,610
Many things Not does and Pisaeng doesn’t like.

501
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,450
So they have many disagreements.

502
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,360
Cut.

503
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,740
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw people laughing.

504
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,750
But I have to hold it in.

505
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,970
I don’t know why this scene has turned into a comedy scene.

506
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,660
Everyone was laughing hard.

507
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,470
I don’t know what happened but everyone was laughing.

508
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,770
Staff: But you have to…

509
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,000
I have to act like I am mad.

510
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,800
So I am mad that everyone is laughing.

511
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,830
I am the leader who takes P’Krist to hang out with girls.

512
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,740
He is the wingman for approaching girls.

513
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,530
Yes.

514
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,990
The next morning, he will recap things that happened last night.

515
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,660
This is the first time that I work with Title.

516
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,250
He is quiet, shy, and timid.

517
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,250
He is diffident.

518
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,930
Tittle is reserved.

519
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,030
His personality is contrasting with his character, Not.

520
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:23,740
There is a scene where he picks up a fight with me which will be revealed later.

521
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,100
The way he grabbed my collar was very cute.

522
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,420
He was afraid that he might hurt me.

523
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,940
So he gently grabbed my collar.

524
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,060
Then he pulled it up.

525
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,100
He didn’t yank it.

526
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,510
He is very considerate and nice.

527
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:43,000
Not is a bully who is rude and bad-mouthed.

528
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,770
Title is nothing like that.

529
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,190
They are totally different.

530
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,060
He did a great job in playing this character.

531
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,210
Let go of me.

532
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,230
I don’t want to leave yet.

533
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,700
I was having fun.

534
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,590
You’re drunk.

535
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,690
Don’t you know what you’re doing?

536
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,600
I do.

537
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,380
Director: put your hand up and speak to the palm.

538
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,090
The hospital tried to call you but they couldn’t reach you.

539
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,810
Director: Speak and make sure that the air reaches your palm.

540
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,620
The hospital tried to call you but they couldn’t reach you.

541
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,510
Director: Use this voice.

542
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,350
Director: Don’t yell.

543
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,760
Director: You just need to say it out.

544
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,640
Director: I want you to say it loudly.

545
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,150
Are you okay?

546
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,960
I saw you zoning out.

547
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,290
Director: In this scene, the focus is on him.

548
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,340
Director: You need to observe how he is acting.

549
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,690
Director: This scene is hard for him. You need to help him.

550
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,750
Director: Do you get it?

551
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,910
Director: It’s okay. Try to observe him.

552
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,420
Director: If you are going to ask him if he’s okay, you need to ask faster.

553
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,020
Director: If you can’t find the right timing, you don’t need to say it.

554
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,830
Director: He is the center of this scene.

555
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,290
Director: If you want to ask, you need to be faster.

556
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,940
The staff in this series is very nice.

557
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,300
If I want something,

558
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,940
The staff can manage it quite well.

559
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,030
The director is quite a perfectionist.

560
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:14,270
He has a picture in his head of how he wants each scene to look like.

561
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:26,230
He gave me advice on small details such as the angle when I turn my head or the movement of my body.

562
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,460
He always gave me advice on these details.

563
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,490
The director and the staff are taking good care of me.

564
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,450
For me, they are professional.

565
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:41,020
Both Gawin and I have learned many things from him.

566
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
I want to thank the director.

567
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,590
Without him, our acting wouldn’t be as good as you see on the screen.

568
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:53,660
The director can bring out the true potential of every actor in the series,

569
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:02,250
P’Krist, Gawin, Aye, P’Title, P’Judge and I get along very well.

570
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,610
We work well together.

571
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,250
First of all, I feel comfortable working with them.

572
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,860
I know that the result will come out well.

573
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:20,910
But in the early stage, I needed to adjust to get in tune with the director.

574
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,490
I need to figure out how the director wants me to portray Pearmai.

575
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,930
My interpretation of the character may be different from his.

576
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,590
In the early stage, we need to adjust to each other.

577
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,460
Is my portrayal of the character as lively as he wants her to be?

578
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:42,190
Later in the story when my character goes through something which has a great impact on her,

579
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,390
We worked together to design how much my character should change.

580
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,860
After working and getting to know the director for a while,

581
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:55,290
I feel comfortable working with him and believe that he can bright out a great result.

582
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,980
I feel quite sad.

583
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,810
This is my last filming.

584
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,430
There is one more scene.

585
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,610
It’s P’Krist’s scene.

586
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,540
I’m okay.

587
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,710
Hello, everyone.

588
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,180
This is a wrap for this series.

589
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,800
Yeah! This is a wrap.

590
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:54,650
[“REDO” BY KRIST PERAWAT]

591
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,040
“Redo” is an original soundtrack of this series.

592
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:40,980
If you watch this series, you will notice that it has Japanese anime vibes.

593
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,220
The story and the acting have animation vibes.

594
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:51,400
The lyrics talk about chasing your dream, making changes, and adventures.

595
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,720
The outcome is “Redo”

596
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,820
I think the song goes very well with the series.

597
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:06,330
[“UNABLE” BY GAWIN CASKEY]

598
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:30,380
“Unable” is a soundtrack that you will hear in the latter episodes.

599
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,970
The song is played in scenes where the story enters a dark phase.

600
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,950
It’s when Kawi goes back to the present time.

601
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,850
He finds out that everything is a mess.

602
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:49,710
The relationship between Pisaeng and Kawi is not good.

603
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,080
His relationship with Pearmai is not good.

604
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
His relationship with other friends is not good.

605
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,600
It’s one of the dark scenes in the drama.

606
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,860
P’Kangsom and P’Amp are the production team of this song.

607
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,830
Please listen to it.

608
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:13,700
I think the song goes well with the story and mood in the scene.

609
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,030
Some of you may have heard the song in the early episodes.

610
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,990
But it’s the instrumental version.

611
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,080
Please listen to it and see what kind of song it is.

[“THANKFUL” BY KRIST]

614
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,710
“Thankful”

615
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:27,420
It’s my song that is known among my fans, Yuyu.

616
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,460
I wrote this song for my fans when I first started working as an actor.

617
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,260
I felt thankful that they were always supporting and being there for me.

618
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,600
They were helping me in both my personal and work life.

619
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,350
So I wanted to express my gratitude to them through this song.

620
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,150
The song was known only among my fans.

621
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,680
It was never officially released.

622
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,880
I kept the song to myself.

623
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,070
While working on this series,

624
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,160
I think the lyrics match Pisaeng well.

625
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,700
He is doing everything to help Bodkawee.

626
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
He helps Bodkawee solve all his problems.

627
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,100
I think this song is a message to him.

628
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,370
I want to thank him for being there for me.

629
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:12,330
I played the guitar and sang this song to the director to listen.

630
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,240
I didn’t expect that he would select it to be the series’ soundtrack.

631
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,470
He liked it because the lyrics matches the story well.

632
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:22,520
That’s how the song is chosen to be a soundtrack of the series.

633
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:53,480
The key message of this series is about going back in time.

634
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,970
There’s a line in the drama stating not everybody has this kind of chance.

635
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:05,060
No one in the world can turn back time.

636
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,530
The message that the series wants to communicate is that you should always do your best every day.

637
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:16,040
If there’s something that will improve your life, you should do it right away.

638
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,750
Because we can’t go back and change it.

639
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:25,390
The first thing that the viewers will get from the series is joy and excitement.

640
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,680
When they watch Kawi going back in time,

641
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,230
they will wonder what he will do to change his life.

642
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:35,950
Lastly, whether we have the ability to turn back time or not,

643
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,140
One thing that will happen for sure in our life is changes.

644
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,770
We need to accept that.

645
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:46,630
Many people want to choose the best choice for their life.

646
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
But there’s no such thing as the best choice.

647
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,000
This is what I learn from the series.

648
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,990
I don’t think there’s such a thing.

649
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:01,930
It depends on your choice of how you balance your happiness and desire.

650
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,070
That’s all we can do.

651
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,820
No matter how many times Kawi goes back in time,

652
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,450
There are things that he can’t control.

653
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,310
So I don’t think there’s such a thing as the best choice in life.

654
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,730
It depends on your choice and decision at the moment.

655
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:25,880
Those who watch this series may have introspection on how they should balance their happiness and desire.

656
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:34,700
The lesson we can learn from the series is that we should do our best every day.

657
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:39,870
Because we can’t go back in time to fix our past like in the series.

658
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,310
Even though the character can go back in time to change his past,

659
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,310
There are many things that he can’t fix.

660
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,160
We need to do our best every day.

661
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,150
This drama has all the flavors.

662
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,360
It’s fun.

663
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,730
It has comedy and romantic elements.

664
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,030
It talks about friendship.

665
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,780
Later in the story, it talks about family relationships.

666
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,380
There are many lessons the viewer can learn from it.

667
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:11,070
Some dialogue lines in the series are written from a well-thought plan by the scriptwriting team.

668
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:16,430
These lines have hidden messages.

669
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,800
I hope you enjoy all the flavors expressed through every character in the drama.

670
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:24,630
The story in the latter part of the series will be more intense.

671
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:32,180
You will see the development of each character.

672
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:39,540
You will find out what conclusion is waiting for Kawi and Pisaeng.

673
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,180
The series is halfway through.

674
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,530
The story will get more intense in the latter half.

675
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,670
If you want to see an intense story,

676
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:55,740
If you want a flavorful story,

677
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,190
Don’t miss the latter half of the series.

678
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,770
The story will get intense and dramatic.

679
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:05,740
Then it will come a calm after the storm.

680
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,140
Everything will turn out okay.

681
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,800
I think everyone will be happy with the ending.

682
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,080
Don’t miss it.

683
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,860
I’m really grateful to have you in my life.

684
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,820
I believe nothing is more right than us being together.

685
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,680
Why do you like me?

686
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,510
I don’t see how I’m a good match for you.

687
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,920
You’re cute.

688
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,580
Does this reason sound enough?
