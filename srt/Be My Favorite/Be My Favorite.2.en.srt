4
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:15,214
Is this crystal ball yours?

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,103
What would you do with it if it could be fixed?

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,000
I’d like to give it to someone.

7
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:23,571
Hold on.

8
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:24,702
Stop.

9
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:26,526
Stop here.

10
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:27,456
I’m tired.

11
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,571
I didn’t think you’d be this bold.

12
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:46,052
You started a fight when you couldn’t even fight.

13
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,262
I never wanted to start a fight.

14
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:50,835
But you saw he hit that girl.

15
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:54,436
If you didn’t step in, you’d feel bad for the rest of your life

16
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,450
for not doing the right thing.

17
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:10,894
Why do I feel sleepy in my own dream?

18
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:13,964
Damn it.

19
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,602
You can’t just sleep here.

20
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:17,873
Why can’t I?

21
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:19,577
I told you this is my dream.

22
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:20,582
You’re not dreaming.

23
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:22,071
You’re drunk.

24
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:38,887
You’re actually a nuthead.

25
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,658
I never thought you’d be this kind of person.

26
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,420
Why don't you show this side of yours at university?

27
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,526
So that no one is hesitant to approach you.

28
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:53,071
Who would want to approach me?

29
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,552
I’m not someone like you.

30
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:57,374
Why?

31
00:02:58,197 --> 00:02:59,079
What do you mean by someone like me?

32
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:01,521
You’re hot.

33
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:04,574
Unlike me.

34
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,930
People pay attention to me only when I make mistakes.

35
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,641
You’re right about one thing.

36
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:16,177
I’m hot.

37
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,918
But the rest, you just made it up in your head.

38
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:25,760
People don’t care about you or it’s you who doesn’t care about them?

39
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:29,624
Isn’t it you who always disappears after class?

40
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:31,835
You don’t join any activities.

41
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:39,803
It’d be nice if my life is as simple as other people’s.

42
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,056
We have the same 24 hours.

43
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:47,990
But we’re born with different conditions.

44
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:51,704
Someone like you wouldn’t comprehend.

45
00:03:53,374 --> 00:03:55,123
That’s why I’m lonely.

46
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:01,559
I may not understand your difficulties,

47
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,610
but if you're feeling lonely,

48
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:10,583
know that you're not the only one in the world who feels that way.

49
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:14,987
You’ve felt lonely?

50
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:17,261
I just said that.

51
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,072
No way.

52
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:24,742
Not possible for you.

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,480
You’re always surrounded by people.

54
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:30,771
How can you possibly be lonely?

55
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:37,042
If you only look at the surface and make quick judgments about people,

56
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,028
then I’m not talking to you.

57
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:42,396
Well.

58
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:45,000
You’re right.

59
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,565
I’ve been all alone.

60
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:51,457
I don’t make friends.

61
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,029
So I judge people based on my own views.

62
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:11,382
Now what are you going to do about Pear?

63
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:13,492
You’re wasted.

64
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:17,162
If you’re going to see her. I think we…

65
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:37,446
What are you looking at?

66
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:39,970
At you.

67
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:41,116
Do you need to ask?

68
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:50,589
Can you open the trunk, please?

69
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,105
Hey!

70
00:05:56,277 --> 00:05:57,260
What the hell are you doing?

71
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,284
Don’t you want to nap?

72
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:01,320
You can do so here.

73
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:04,220
Asshole.

74
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:05,843
I’m human, not luggage.

75
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:19,400
Will I get to go in in this lifetime? Hurry up!

76
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,440
You could’ve just dropped me downstairs.

77
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,285
Why came up here?

78
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,920
You have a thing for me or something?

79
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:29,952
I do.

80
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:36,251
I think you’re cute.

81
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:39,447
I like you.

82
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:44,025
Are you being serious?

83
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,963
Hell, no!

84
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:55,000
I want to pee. I need to use your bathroom.

85
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:56,646
Come on.

86
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:57,599
Or I’ll just pee right here.

87
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,827
Okay.

88
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,000
Hold on.

89
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,377
Hurry up!

90
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:06,608
You got it.

91
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:12,623
The bathroom is there.

92
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:27,423
Hey, I’ll just…

93
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:19,796
I already slept.

94
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:23,283
But why am I still in a dream?

95
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:26,695
Is it not a dream?

96
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:31,069
Did I travel back in time?

97
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:18,745
Wait.

98
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:24,892
What?!

99
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,811
Gosh!

100
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,120
Holy shit!

101
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:57,748
People say

102
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:03,305
if you fall off a high place in your dream,

103
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:04,811
you’ll wake up.

104
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:10,675
Do it.

105
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:16,573
Argh!

106
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:41,073
It’s not a dream.

107
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:47,486
[Incoming Call - Pisaeng]

108
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:49,601
Hey.

109
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,254
When did I have his number?

110
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:04,043
Hello.

111
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:05,257
Where the heck are you at?

112
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:06,851
Why are you not here yet?

113
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:08,690
The morning ceremony is about to start.

114
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:12,906
Today is Pear’s wedding.

115
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:16,797
Ah…

116
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,428
I’ll just attend the evening ceremony instead.

117
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:20,617
Damn it, Kawi!

118
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:23,798
Come on.

119
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:26,286
I’m not that important.

120
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,806
You’re the best man.

121
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:31,550
What?

122
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:34,006
You’re the one handing me the ring.

123
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:37,585
Hey. Why me?

124
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:39,355
You hurry here now, jackass.

125
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,653
Wait–

126
00:13:57,847 --> 00:14:01,901
[A pre-wedding party without the groom and the bride.]

127
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,879
So this is how much I’ve changed.

128
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:19,962
[Pisaeng: Were you drunk last night? That’s why you slept in.]

129
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:21,014
[Pisaeng: Come here now. You must do pushups for me.]

130
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,881
I got a chance to go back and fix the past.

131
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,314
But what kind of fixing that got me to be your best man?

132
00:14:56,393 --> 00:15:01,112
(There are many things in this world we don’t understand and can’t find any explanation for.)

133
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:04,211
(I have no clue what is happening to me.)

134
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,988
(Magic or miracle.)

135
00:15:07,503 --> 00:15:13,610
(But I’ll take it as a chance to make everything better.)

136
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,938
[1. Tell Pearmai about the secret buddy.]
[2. Make friends with and impress her.]
[3. If there’s a good chance, make a love confession.]

137
00:15:56,328 --> 00:16:00,787
[Dad, when is your next doctor's appointment? Don’t forget it. I’ll go with you.]

138
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:05,112
(So the missions of this time travel are…)

139
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:08,389
(One, tell Pearmai about the secret buddy.)

140
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:11,675
(Two, make friends with and impress her.)

141
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:15,272
(Three, If there’s a good chance, make a love confession.)

142
00:16:58,177 --> 00:16:58,866
Pear.

143
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:02,086
Pear.

144
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,311
Is this seat taken?

145
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:15,986
No.

146
00:17:15,986 --> 00:17:16,970
You can take it, Kawi.

147
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:19,440
Thanks.

148
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:32,958
Pear…

149
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:39,499
Pear.

150
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:49,646
Pear!

151
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,862
I…

152
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:03,356
I…

153
00:18:03,356 --> 00:18:04,178
Pisaeng.

154
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,833
You almost didn’t make it.

155
00:18:08,162 --> 00:18:09,323
Why are you late?

156
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:10,541
Did you want to cut class?

157
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:13,131
If you didn’t remind me, I’d really cut it.

158
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,069
Have you eaten?

159
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,199
I have.

160
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,691
What did you do?

161
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,306
Hello, class.

162
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:24,200
Are we all here?

163
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,705
Is your friend here?

164
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:31,190
Okay. Let’s resume with William Shakespeare.

165
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,030
Turn to page 54.

166
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:37,823
Have you told Pear the truth yet?

167
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:39,456
Don’t butt in.

168
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:42,388
You’re butting in.

169
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,114
That’s the seat Pear reserved for me.

170
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:46,905
Why did you take it?

171
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:52,109
So?

172
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:54,046
Your family owns this university or what?

173
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:58,246
We can buy it if we want.

174
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:02,023
We’re just not interested in this line of business.

175
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:10,041
Tell her already.

176
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:13,141
She keeps asking me when I’ll treat her to a meal.

177
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:15,603
Don’t tell me you agreed to that already.

178
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:17,045
You two over there.

179
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:20,807
How about you take your conversation outside?

180
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:29,865
So the characteristics of Shakespeare’s early-age plays were…

181
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:32,605
I will tell Pear at the end of the class.

182
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:39,295
The words didn’t originate in the characters’ minds or from their roles.

183
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:43,467
His narration was rich with beautiful metaphors.

184
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:48,995
The language he used was like a fair speech…

185
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:58,392
What happened?

186
00:19:59,173 --> 00:20:00,142
no idea.

187
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:06,849
Pear, I got something to tell you.

188
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,583
Pear, I got…

189
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:19,038
Pear, I got something to tell you.

190
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:31,028
Pear, I got something to tell you. Pisaeng isn’t your secret buddy. I am.

191
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:33,701
So, instead of liking him, why don't you like me?

192
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:36,761
I can’t say that.

193
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:39,840
Why is it so hard?

194
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:10,156
Max.

195
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:12,675
Max.

196
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:14,693
Max!

197
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:19,188
Why are you calling my name?

198
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,310
You’re studying abroad.

199
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:25,321
Aren’t you going to tell me that at all?

200
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:29,212
Why do you care?

201
00:21:31,306 --> 00:21:32,612
I’m not your friend anymore.

202
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:36,486
If you don’t want to talk to me, that’s fine.

203
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:38,723
But quitting university–

204
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:39,577
Stop.

205
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:41,802
I’ve made up my mind.

206
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:45,656
Max.

207
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:48,159
Believe me.

208
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,963
This decision won’t make you happy in the future.

209
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,269
You’re saying it as if I’m happy now.

210
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:22,647
[Dad: I’m not going. It’s a waste of time and money to travel there. It’s tiring. I’ll just take the pills.]

211
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:27,384
[Kawi: You can’t. What if it’s bad?]

212
00:22:30,904 --> 00:22:34,639
[Dad: People die when it’s time. We can’t do anything about it.]

213
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:53,491
(Traveling back in time doesn’t mean I can fix everything.)

214
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:03,815
(All right then.)

215
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:06,116
(I’ll just fix what I can first.)

216
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,050
(At least I can do something about Pear.)

217
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:13,539
(Wait!)

218
00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:19,636
(If this crystal ball takes me back and forth in time and I give it to Pear,

219
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:24,486
I can’t travel back to the present.)

220
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:39,859
Pisaeng.

221
00:23:40,756 --> 00:23:43,435
Have you decided on a place to eat yet?

222
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,164
Oh, about that…

223
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:46,923
Hello!

224
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:48,974
Are you two going out or what?

225
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,687
Where will your date take place?

226
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:57,726
Whatever they do doesn’t concern you, Not.

227
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:00,639
What’s the problem?

228
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:02,001
We’re all friends here.

229
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:04,240
So?

230
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:07,224
Where will you go?

231
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,958
Pear, you have a meeting at the club on selecting student representatives.

232
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,188
That’s right.

233
00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:21,562
The meeting should be done around 4.

234
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:24,312
Leave me a message where.

235
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:26,933
See you.

236
00:24:32,026 --> 00:24:32,692
Hey.

237
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:35,935
Let me know whether you score her or not tonight.

238
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:41,044
Do you think he will?

239
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,413
Damn right, he will.

240
00:24:56,126 --> 00:24:56,900
Come on.

241
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,527
Hello.

242
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:08,916
(Where the hell are you?)

243
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:12,913
Pisaeng.

244
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:16,389
How did you have my number?

245
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:18,298
I could find it, all right.

246
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:19,486
Where are you?

247
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:21,535
At my dorm.

248
00:25:21,806 --> 00:25:23,086
When did you leave?

249
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:24,804
What are you going to do?

250
00:25:24,804 --> 00:25:27,366
You said you’d tell Pearmai after class.

251
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,679
I…

252
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:34,428
I don’t know!

253
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:47,973
Kawi.

254
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:52,329
If you don’t open the door, I’ll break it through right now.

255
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,810
Been watching too many TV shows or what?

256
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,077
You really think it will open if you kick it?

257
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:15,843
You made a big deal trying to get me to tell Pear.

258
00:26:16,114 --> 00:26:17,651
What’s happening now?

259
00:26:18,096 --> 00:26:19,662
Why didn’t you make it clear to her?

260
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:21,640
I changed my mind.

261
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:24,095
You can be Pear’s secret buddy.

262
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:28,018
What’s wrong with you?

263
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:35,704
Leave me alone.

264
00:26:40,238 --> 00:26:41,978
Whatever it is, say it.

265
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:45,256
What’s the matter?

266
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:46,313
Will you speak or not?

267
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,179
Leave!

268
00:26:49,683 --> 00:26:52,376
If you don’t say it, I’ll just wait right here.

269
00:26:54,804 --> 00:26:56,804
Go ahead and test my patience.

270
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:08,443
I can’t with you, Kawi! What do you freaking want to do?

271
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:10,200
I don’t have money!

272
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,101
I don’t have money to buy a nice gift for her.

273
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,166
I won’t dare say that I’m her secret buddy.

274
00:27:19,196 --> 00:27:20,486
That’s your gift.

275
00:27:20,715 --> 00:27:22,165
You carried it around last night.

276
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:30,858
I can’t give that to Pear.

277
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,295
It’s too plain.

278
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:41,504
Seriously,

279
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:44,614
does your brain contain any good thoughts at all?

280
00:27:45,388 --> 00:27:47,301
Friends don’t mind the price.

281
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,286
Easy for you to say.

282
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,017
You’re handsome.

283
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,659
Even if you give her soil, she’ll think you’re funny. You did great.

284
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:58,541
But I don’t look good enough.

285
00:27:58,686 --> 00:27:59,816
I’m not rich enough.

286
00:27:59,816 --> 00:28:01,156
Not charming enough.

287
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,621
If I do something bad, people will just think I’m a clown.

288
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:08,039
People judge other people by outer appearances.

289
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:16,941
Now I’m not surprised why you don’t have friends.

290
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,984
Are you trying to pick a fight?

291
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:27,106
I’ve never seen anyone judge you yet.

292
00:28:27,794 --> 00:28:30,083
It’s only you who judges the rest of the world.

293
00:28:38,787 --> 00:28:41,481
Actually, I was glad you came and talked to me yesterday.

294
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:45,480
Because it’s a chance for me to get to know you.

295
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:51,648
And today, I saw you in trouble and I wanted to help

296
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,495
because I thought I was your friend already.

297
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
We’ve only known each other last night.

298
00:29:04,448 --> 00:29:06,998
People become friends so easily just like that?

299
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:10,186
How long should it take then?

300
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:17,017
I don’t know.

301
00:29:24,202 --> 00:29:25,855
Do whatever you want then.

302
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:28,098
I’m meeting Pear this evening.

303
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:31,352
If you don’t want to be her buddy, fine.

304
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,838
I’ll be it.

305
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:51,514
I got a chance to go back and fix the past.

306
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,744
But what kind of fixing that got me to be your best man?

307
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,314
Pisaeng, wait.

308
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:03,533
Wait.

309
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:04,931
Pisaeng.

310
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:05,641
Wait up.

311
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:06,637
What?

312
00:30:14,001 --> 00:30:14,907
Okay.

313
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,229
I’ll tell you the truth.

314
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:30,734
I like Pear.

315
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:33,133
Huh?

316
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:40,565
Since we’re close friends now–

317
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:41,531
Hold that.

318
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,249
Close friends?

319
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:44,936
Of course.

320
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:52,126
You said it yourself friendship wasn’t about time.

321
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,342
So you’re my close friend now.

322
00:30:56,393 --> 00:30:58,393
Your confidence is bigger than mine.

323
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,046
You must step back and let me hit on Pear.

324
00:31:04,426 --> 00:31:07,155
If we’re true friends, do that for me.

325
00:31:08,684 --> 00:31:09,727
Why would I need to step back?

326
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:11,447
I don’t have feelings for Pear.

327
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:12,701
Huh?

328
00:31:13,673 --> 00:31:14,425
Come on.

329
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,547
That can’t be true.

330
00:31:16,189 --> 00:31:18,639
You have the same theory as others.

331
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,699
I don’t like Pear that way.

332
00:31:22,272 --> 00:31:22,980
Hey.

333
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,606
But one day, you will…

334
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:26,134
Will what?

335
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:30,434
Nothing.

336
00:31:31,336 --> 00:31:31,908
Forget it.

337
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:34,037
Ah, I see.

338
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:40,317
You’re making a deal out of this silly buddy game because of this.

339
00:31:40,924 --> 00:31:41,886
Heck, yeah.

340
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:44,923
I want to impress Pear.

341
00:31:45,621 --> 00:31:47,621
But my gift is a cheap one.

342
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:50,064
Don’t worry.

343
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:54,826
Advice from someone who’s known Pear since young,

344
00:31:55,643 --> 00:31:57,166
if you want to hit on her,

345
00:31:57,676 --> 00:32:01,168
the first thing you need is the guts to talk to her.

346
00:32:04,504 --> 00:32:09,489
Are you saying I have a chance to be her boyfriend?

347
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:10,636
Yes, why?

348
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:13,283
You’re a human too.

349
00:32:18,514 --> 00:32:20,254
Now what are you gonna do about the buddy thing?

350
00:32:21,762 --> 00:32:22,262
Okay.

351
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:25,099
I’ll tell Pear the truth about it.

352
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,240
Good.

353
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:29,232
Then I’m done here.

354
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:30,846
Hold on.

355
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:31,801
Not so fast.

356
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:34,218
What now?

357
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,416
Since we’re close friends,

358
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:45,451
a friend should help a friend, right?

359
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:47,494
What?

360
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:52,645
Can I borrow your money?

361
00:32:54,963 --> 00:32:55,991
Please.

362
00:33:00,252 --> 00:33:02,252
Wow!

363
00:33:07,992 --> 00:33:09,281
This is so cute.

364
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:22,335
Money.

365
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:23,886
Quickly.

366
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:40,108
Oh, please. You have a lot to throw away.

367
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,121
Rich doesn’t mean I should get robbed by you.

368
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:44,312
Come on.

369
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:45,962
I’ll pay you back.

370
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:49,552
I’ll win the lotto and pay you back.

371
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:52,542
Don’t take it too seriously.

372
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,939
You know?

373
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:57,687
The last time I spent this much money on someone,

374
00:33:59,096 --> 00:34:00,627
I got a lot in return.

375
00:34:04,395 --> 00:34:05,632
What do you want from me then?

376
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:14,705
Miss, I don’t want that anymore.

377
00:34:14,705 --> 00:34:15,773
Hey, hold on.

378
00:34:16,382 --> 00:34:17,886
I haven’t said anything yet.

379
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:25,054
When you win the lotto, you can return me the money.

380
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:28,947
I know.

381
00:34:33,509 --> 00:34:34,677
Thank you, sir.

382
00:34:43,062 --> 00:34:44,148
I reserved a table at 5.

383
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:45,473
Huh?

384
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:47,777
You did?

385
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,682
Yes.

386
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,896
Once you tell her the truth, I’ll sneak out

387
00:34:53,632 --> 00:34:55,302
and let you two talk privately.

388
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:56,249
Okay?

389
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:58,411
Sounds good.

390
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:01,177
So?

391
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:03,046
Am I just the best friend?

392
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,678
But it’s not even 3 yet.

393
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:09,599
You want to go back and take a nap first?

394
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:14,886
What am I gonna do?

395
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:27,897
Yes.

396
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,145
I’ll get it for sure this time.

397
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:33,889
Both sides are the same.

398
00:35:35,522 --> 00:35:36,216
Don’t kill the vibe.

399
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:38,737
Come on.

400
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:43,692
A little more.

401
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:44,909
Go.

402
00:35:45,638 --> 00:35:46,146
Hey.

403
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:46,976
Hey!

404
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,506
Come on.

405
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,813
I almost got it.

406
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:00,125
What?

407
00:36:01,622 --> 00:36:03,048
Please.

408
00:36:03,446 --> 00:36:05,377
I almost got it.

409
00:36:05,377 --> 00:36:06,183
Enough.

410
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,573
I told you that’s all you’d get.

411
00:36:09,048 --> 00:36:10,285
Come on.

412
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:10,925
It was close.

413
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:12,791
I almost picked it up.

414
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:13,689
That one.

415
00:36:13,689 --> 00:36:14,561
Don’t be dumb.

416
00:36:15,523 --> 00:36:16,714
If you want it, buy it.

417
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:18,911
Why waste money on this claw machine?

418
00:36:19,563 --> 00:36:20,420
No one gets it.

419
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:22,569
Yeah!

420
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,018
You’re so great.

421
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,143
Darling, look. It’s cute.

422
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:29,652
Thank you.

423
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:32,802
There.

424
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:34,742
They got one.

425
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:37,104
We will get it too. That was so close.

426
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:39,327
Look at its face.

427
00:36:40,002 --> 00:36:41,568
It’s calling us.

428
00:36:41,974 --> 00:36:43,198
It’s beckoning us.

429
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:44,886
Come. Come. Come.

430
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:46,229
Stop it. It’s almost 5.

431
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,095
Let’s go.

432
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:48,643
Not yet.

433
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:49,702
Hey.

434
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:51,271
It was close.

435
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:54,160
One more game.

436
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:54,891
Hey!

437
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:56,148
Coming?

438
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,908
Come on. It was this close.

439
00:37:01,363 --> 00:37:02,137
What should I do?

440
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:04,310
Little Kawi.

441
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:06,794
Damn it.

442
00:37:15,148 --> 00:37:15,753
Wow.

443
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,943
Pisaeng, you dine in this fancy restaurant every day?

444
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:21,697
Not every day.

445
00:37:22,082 --> 00:37:23,659
Just whenever I want.

446
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:26,518
Boy.

447
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:31,984
I’ve been working until I’m 30, yet I’ve never walked into this kind of place.

448
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:34,511
30 what?

449
00:37:35,205 --> 00:37:35,710
What?

450
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:38,157
Nothing.

451
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:39,372
This looks good.

452
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:42,025
Hey, don’t eat it like that.

453
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,630
Let me show you, little bro.

454
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:46,080
I’ll teach you.

455
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,047
Not your little bro.

456
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:48,680
You are, little bro Kawi.

457
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:49,744
Look.

458
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:51,559
Spread it on the bread.

459
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:53,100
I know how to do it.

460
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,608
You do?

461
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:54,162
Yes.

462
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,062
Pisaeng.

463
00:38:00,432 --> 00:38:00,982
Hey.

464
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,458
Kawi.

465
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,944
I invited Kawi along.

466
00:38:13,245 --> 00:38:14,066
Hope you don’t mind.

467
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,069
I don’t.

468
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:22,942
I’m curious about when you two became close.

469
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,044
Last night.

470
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:27,077
He drank at the bar where I work.

471
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,890
He drinks too?

472
00:38:29,102 --> 00:38:33,374
Pear, let me tell you. He might seem quiet…

473
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:38,722
(Even in this weird situation, Pear is still nice to everyone.)

474
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:39,841
He even started a fight.

475
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:41,454
Invite me next time. I wanna see that.

476
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:43,303
(I really fell for the right person.)

477
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:47,434
You’re a badass.

478
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,333
I’m hungry. Let’s order more.

479
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:50,920
Sure.

480
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:51,848
Kawi.

481
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:53,646
Kawi.

482
00:38:54,841 --> 00:38:55,477
What?

483
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:56,249
Why are you calling me?

484
00:38:56,762 --> 00:38:57,694
(Buddy.)

485
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,410
Right.

486
00:39:02,537 --> 00:39:03,161
Pear.

487
00:39:05,146 --> 00:39:06,734
I have something important to tell you.

488
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:09,326
What is it?

489
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:12,156
Actually, I’m your secret buddy.

490
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:17,770
The day we revealed it, I got caught up in something so I didn’t go.

491
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:20,784
So Pisaeng went instead.

492
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:25,412
Can you please…not be mad?

493
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:32,011
It is what he said.

494
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:33,892
Sorry, Pear.

495
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:39,934
It’s okay.

496
00:39:39,934 --> 00:39:41,375
You don’t have to worry. Not a big deal.

497
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:49,688
Oh, right.

498
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:51,840
It’s a gift from your buddy.

499
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:05,731
Wow.

500
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:08,029
Thanks.

501
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:09,850
I like it so much, Kawi.

502
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:14,185
Next time, it doesn’t need to be this pricey.

503
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:15,568
I feel bad.

504
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:16,974
It’s okay.

505
00:40:16,974 --> 00:40:17,702
No problem at all.

506
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,546
Pear, I’ll step outside to use a phone.

507
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:25,017
You two continue.

508
00:40:33,462 --> 00:40:34,229
Are you hungry?

509
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:45,525
Thank you.

510
00:40:46,484 --> 00:40:47,363
Kawi,

511
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:50,950
why don’t I see you at all at the faculty in the evening?

512
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,572
Ah.

513
00:40:54,865 --> 00:40:57,143
I have work to do every day.

514
00:40:58,866 --> 00:41:00,866
But I plan to reduce it.

515
00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:03,750
I want more time to make friends with people.

516
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:05,397
That’s great

517
00:41:05,975 --> 00:41:07,737
because I want to know you better.

518
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,457
Now let’s check out the result.

519
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,752
It’s like nothing changes at all.

520
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:23,710
Pisaeng!

521
00:42:24,558 --> 00:42:25,650
What are you doing here?

522
00:42:26,158 --> 00:42:27,541
Why are you not at your wedding?

523
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:42,056
Hey!

524
00:42:42,885 --> 00:42:44,019
Are you drunk?

525
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:29,898
Damn it!

526
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,530
What did I do with the past?

527
00:44:38,033 --> 00:44:39,650
(The first time fixing the past was already a failure.)

528
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:40,664
Don’t worry, Pear.

529
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:43,251
I will make everything better.

530
00:44:44,091 --> 00:44:44,895
What will you do after class?

531
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:45,879
Want to play basketball with me?

532
00:44:46,254 --> 00:44:46,944
I don’t play basketball.

533
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:48,485
I just finished running.

534
00:44:48,616 --> 00:44:49,872
Can I take a nap at your place for a bit?

535
00:44:49,872 --> 00:44:50,520
No.

536
00:44:51,112 --> 00:44:53,266
(How did everything turn out this way?)

537
00:44:53,598 --> 00:44:54,172
Do you like me?

538
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,176
(What will I do next?)

539
00:44:57,219 --> 00:44:58,795
(See you in the next episode.)
