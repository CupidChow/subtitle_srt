Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:14,673
I can’t marry Pear.

5
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:15,967
I like someone else.

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,174
Who do you like?

7
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,243
What did I do with the past?

8
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:21,720
Don’t worry, Pear.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,437
I will make everything better.

10
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:27,098
I just don’t know what you’re trying to do here, Kawi.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,669
I want you to be close to Not again so you won’t be close to me.

12
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:33,400
Next time, just tell me honestly.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,908
Take it.

14
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,622
Pisaeng might seem like that on the outside,

15
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:37,981
but he’s a lonely guy.

16
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:42,971
Now that I see Pisaeng is close to you,

17
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,061
I’m so okay with that.

18
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,079
Hey, Kawi.

19
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:57,019
Our faculty is having this get-together thing.

20
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:58,795
Are you joining?

21
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,019
Get-together?

22
00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:05,888
It’d be fun if you could come.

23
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:12,944
What?

24
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,467
You like Pear?

25
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,930
And she’s asking if you’re going to that get-together.

26
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,077
Then go.

27
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:26,334
The one who has a crush on me is coming too.

28
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:30,000
And the one having a crush on you…

29
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:32,334
is who?

30
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:38,047
It’s better if you don’t know.

31
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:43,973
Kawi.

32
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,939
I’m talking to you again to basically spy on your secrets.

33
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,155
Humor me.

34
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:04,438
Kawi.

35
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:09,784
Seriously, it’s not that complicated.

36
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,912
There are only two things you can do about Pear.

37
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:18,395
Make her fall for you or you get over her.

38
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:22,853
As for someone who likes you but you have no affection for,

39
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:25,434
make it clear.

40
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:26,883
Tell that person to get over you.

41
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,279
You can’t run away from problems all the time.

42
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,695
I’m running away?

43
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,574
Especially, when it comes to relationships.

44
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:50,658
Max.

45
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,766
Thank you so much.

46
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,395
I shouldn’t have let a good friend like you disappear from my life.

47
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:04,831
Forget it.

48
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:07,108
I understand.

49
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:11,990
I know you hate it when people think I’m your boyfriend.

50
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:16,641
It’s not about that at all.

51
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:23,533
I have many issues.

52
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:28,717
Work,

53
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:30,000
money,

54
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,930
university environment I can’t quite adjust to yet,

55
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,409
and my dad’s illness.

56
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:40,514
I was so exhausted that I was angry with everyone.

57
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:41,985
I put the blame on everything else.

58
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,673
I buried myself in my own thoughts.

59
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,658
So when I learned you were upset with me,

60
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:52,631
I just let you go.

61
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,145
And that’s wrong.

62
00:04:58,023 --> 00:04:58,741
Max.

63
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:02,517
I don’t want you to quit just because of this.

64
00:05:04,282 --> 00:05:07,440
You’re not the reason I quit.

65
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,941
I had a fight with my family.

66
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:14,808
And…

67
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:18,146
I just want to leave this country.

68
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:21,778
Don’t blame it on yourself.

69
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:33,012
By the way, we stopped talking for 4-5 months only.

70
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:35,360
You don’t have to be so dramatic.

71
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,042
Please.

72
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,265
It didn’t feel like 4-5 months to me.

73
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:43,706
It’s like you disappeared on me forever.

74
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:50,350
I never want to lose a good friend like you again.

75
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:51,347
All right.

76
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:52,909
Enough already.

77
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:54,502
I’m getting goosebumps.

78
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:11,996
Hello.

79
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:13,131
What’s up, Kawi?

80
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:15,706
Hi, Dad.

81
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:23,936
Come on.

82
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:27,436
I’m okay now. I don’t need to go to the hospital.

83
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:35,136
Well…

84
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:37,903
How are you doing?

85
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,274
(Have you eaten?)

86
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:45,642
I have.

87
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:48,789
Are you tired today?

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,218
(So-so. Just the same.)

89
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,052
Are you going out anywhere today?

90
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,803
(Max was right.)

91
00:06:57,492 --> 00:07:02,639
(For this time travel, I must fix relationship problems.)

92
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:14,407
[The follow-up appointment]

93
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,774
[Two, convince Dad to get medical treatment.]

94
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:39,340
It must be fun.

95
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:08,207
Here.

96
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,831
Sorry I asked you to return them now.

97
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:13,433
I just want to read them over there.

98
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:15,000
That’s all right.

99
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:15,908
No problem at all.

100
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:16,777
Thank you.

101
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,670
Pear,

102
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:19,243
Do you have a portable phone charger?

103
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,822
It’s in my bag.

104
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:21,773
Let me get it for you.

105
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:22,514
Okay.

106
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:28,073
So…

107
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:32,118
Aren’t you going on the trip?

108
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,244
Why?

109
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:35,000
Do you want me to go?

110
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,341
It’s up to you then.

111
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:55,454
Thank you, Kawi.

112
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,369
Get on the bus.

113
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:03,606
Hey,

114
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:05,258
Pear.

115
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:12,100
It's a tradition to start the trip with a welcome drink.

116
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:14,343
Choose the one you want,

117
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:16,626
juice or alcohol.

118
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,106
I’ll go with juice, please.

119
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,535
Of course.

120
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:21,843
Quickly.

121
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:24,535
You’re slow.

122
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:26,160
Here is a cup of juice for you.

123
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:32,040
Good?

124
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,932
Good.

125
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,016
Now please get on.

126
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:34,516
Thank you.

127
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,451
Hello.

128
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:36,370
Hello.

129
00:09:36,932 --> 00:09:38,144
May I get a cup of juice too?

130
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:40,797
Juice, he said.

131
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:43,036
Sure.

132
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,570
Hold on.

133
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,466
Girls can choose.

134
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:49,884
But boys…

135
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:52,107
Pour it.

136
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:53,321
Keep pouring.

137
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:55,214
Oh.

138
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:56,762
Very strong.

139
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,703
Come on.

140
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:01,361
Drinking alcohol this early?

141
00:10:01,512 --> 00:10:02,347
Hey.

142
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:04,411
We can drink anytime.

143
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,389
Or do you want just alcohol alone?

144
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,004
No, please.

145
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:09,676
I’ll drink this.

146
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:10,910
Yes.

147
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
That’s it.

148
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:18,634
Guys, cheers.

149
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:20,004
Cheers!

150
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:23,474
Let’s drink.

151
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,198
Hey, Kawi.

152
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:28,750
Sit over here.

153
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:30,650
Come here.

154
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:34,551
Kawi, come on.

155
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,939
Okay.

156
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:38,347
Quickly.

157
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,650
That’s right.

158
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,198
Give him a bottle.

159
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:46,095
You can always hit on Pear when we get there.

160
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:47,779
But now…

161
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:49,127
drink with us.

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Cheers.

163
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:00,597
Kawi is one of those guys?

164
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:02,505
Did I read him wrong?

165
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:11,993
(Did I even make the right decision here?)

166
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:23,584
Wake him up.

167
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:24,683
Kawi.

168
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,098
Kawi.

169
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,355
Huh?

170
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:31,596
We’ve arrived.

171
00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:32,745
Come on.

172
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:38,323
Ow!

173
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,956
Here. You take the small one.

174
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:43,126
Okay.

175
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:48,441
Kawi.

176
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:49,924
Let’s go.

177
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:53,600
Hey, where are you going?

178
00:11:55,623 --> 00:11:59,450
The seniors said it’s traditional for guys to carry bags for girls.

179
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,960
You take all three.

180
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:04,722
Hey, you don’t have to carry mine.

181
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,784
I can do it myself.

182
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:06,727
Pear.

183
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,743
It’s a game.

184
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:08,694
You should stay out of it.

185
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:10,053
What game?

186
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:12,304
You’ll find out later.

187
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:17,455
Listen up.

188
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:27,705
It's a faculty gathering tradition for guys to race carrying suitcases.

189
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:35,296
At the finish line, you’ll be welcomed by your friends and seniors here.

190
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:37,430
However,

191
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:40,371
if you’re the last one,

192
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:42,960
you’ll be punished.

193
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:46,280
The fun is coming.

194
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:47,089
Ready?

195
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes.

196
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,960
If you’re ready,

197
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,209
three, two, one, go!

198
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:05,150
Quick! Quick!

199
00:13:08,191 --> 00:13:11,508
Go! Go!

200
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:15,892
Go! Go!

201
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
Yeah!

202
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:25,796
Come. Come. Come.

203
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:27,261
Run. Run.

204
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:29,086
Hey!

205
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:30,815
Can you handle it?

206
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:33,052
Keep going.

207
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:44,871
And we have the lucky one who finished last.

208
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:46,390
Who is he?

209
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,068
Bodkawee!

210
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:51,304
You know what to do, guys.

211
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:53,436
Let’s go.

212
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:53,936
Hey.

213
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:55,348
Are you serious?

214
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:57,324
Don’t.

215
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:18,603
Yeah!

216
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:32,172
Let’s go.

217
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:36,487
Go ahead.

218
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:46,696
Kawi.

219
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:52,720
Thanks.

220
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:28,674
Kawi,

221
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,978
this is your keycard.

222
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:32,361
Thank you.

223
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,667
Pear, I left yours with Kwan.

224
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,018
Got it.

225
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,232
Excuse me.

226
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:41,602
Who am I sharing the room with?

227
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,039
I actually put you in the same room with Pisaeng.

228
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,587
But he didn’t come.

229
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:47,382
You have the room all to yourself.

230
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:52,090
It’s good he isn’t here.

231
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:57,581
Or I won’t be able to look at him all night.

232
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:06,138
[Max: How’s it going? Got a chance to hit on Pear?]

233
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:21,955
Kawi.

234
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:23,376
Can we have a quick chat?

235
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:23,969
What?

236
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:24,868
Just come.

237
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:25,894
What is it?

238
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:27,162
Walk.

239
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:32,999
Come on.

240
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:33,559
What is it?

241
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,130
Just come.

242
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:36,748
Hi.

243
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:38,430
You’re here.

244
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,627
What’s going on here?

245
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,352
I just told the seniors you like Pearmai.

246
00:16:46,445 --> 00:16:47,211
Not!

247
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:48,902
I told you not to tell anyone.

248
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:49,433
Hey.

249
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:51,620
He meant well. It’s okay.

250
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:53,629
Right.

251
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:58,882
They told me there are first-year students confessing to each other at the faculty’s get-together every year.

252
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,239
There have been many couples from this event.

253
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:02,663
Right.

254
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,983
This year it’s you who succeeds the tradition.

255
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,960
Tonight, every one of us will help you with the love confession.

256
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:16,512
Kawi,

257
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:18,763
are you okay with that?

258
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:20,889
Of course, he is.

259
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,169
What day could be better than today?

260
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:26,130
True.

261
00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:32,632
If you confess today, the chance of success is 99.99%.

262
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:35,464
Let’s do it.

263
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,273
Yeah?

264
00:17:37,654 --> 00:17:39,461
Tell her, Kawi.

265
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:50,569
Tell her.

266
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:53,361
Okay.

267
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:56,620
Yeah! That’s my man.

268
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:58,821
You.

269
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,972
Kawi agrees to do it.

270
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:04,273
So don’t ruin it by telling Pear.

271
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:08,227
Hey, don’t worry.

272
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:09,840
We will help you.

273
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:16,551
(What?)

274
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,321
(Why did they even get involved?)

275
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:23,562
The seniors want to create some shitty lovey-dovey scene at this gathering.

276
00:18:25,323 --> 00:18:28,012
I’m glad I didn’t go with you.

277
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,313
Each activity sounds like crap.

278
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,941
(If I was forced to do those stupid things, I’d just hitchhike home.)

279
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:42,059
Actually, they asked for my voluntary participation.

280
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:44,510
It wasn’t exactly forcing.

281
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:47,068
Yeah?

282
00:18:47,802 --> 00:18:52,533
Then I hope you and Pear to be the new pair from the faculty get-together.

283
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:55,155
Yes.

284
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,028
I’ll try my best.

285
00:18:57,028 --> 00:18:58,281
Damn you. That was sarcastic.

286
00:18:58,281 --> 00:18:59,897
That’s all. I’m closing the café.

287
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:00,959
Bye.

288
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:02,917
Hey, Max.

289
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:17,369
[Not: Where the heck are you? Come!]

290
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:30,177
Guys, let’s cheers.

291
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:36,101

292
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:40,829

♪ Be with you throughout the night, you only ♪

295
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:49,379
You seem a bit drunk.

296
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:55,502

297
00:19:55,631 --> 00:19:59,920

♪ I want to spend them all with you ♪

300
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,020
Kawi, why are you so quiet?

301
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,740
You sing the next one.

302
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:24,838
Right.

303
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:25,898
I better not.

304
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:27,725
Hey, don’t be shy.

305
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:28,845
Choose one song.

306
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:29,879
Come on.

307
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:32,217
I’m not good at singing.

308
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:34,210
I don’t want to give you guys a nightmare.

309
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:47,204
Pear.

310
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:49,345
I’ll go get more snacks.

311
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:51,179
Sure. I’m going with you.

312
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,284
That’s all right.

313
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:52,975
I’ll help her.

314
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:04,954
I’m having a stomach ache.

315
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:07,501
Hey, is the board game in your room?

316
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:08,608
Yeah.

317
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:09,847
- I’ll go with you.
- Come on.

318
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,625
I’ll go get more beer.

319
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,625
Right. They are out.

320
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:46,228
I don’t think he’s bold enough.

321
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:47,997
This is going to be fun.

322
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,299
So entertaining.

323
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:51,452
Hey.

324
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,702
You said you wouldn’t come.

325
00:21:58,342 --> 00:21:59,100
No.

326
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,302
I just had something to do earlier.

327
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:01,453
I intended to come.

328
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:05,678
You came at just the right moment.

329
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:07,340
What?

330
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:24,825
Pear.

331
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,081
What did you eat at dinner?

332
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,822
We had the buffet just the same.

333
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:40,639
Right.

334
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:44,315
We ate together at dinner.

335
00:22:47,512 --> 00:22:48,602
[Not]

336
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,030
What is Kawi even saying?

337
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:55,569
When will he get to the point?

338
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:56,863
Right.

339
00:22:57,683 --> 00:23:00,052
I would have left him at the faculty if I had known.

340
00:23:00,951 --> 00:23:03,960
What makes him think he can land the faculty's hottest girl?

341
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:11,138
I don’t think we have any right to eavesdrop on people’s conversations.

342
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,930
And why do you have to ruin the fun?

343
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:15,981
This happens every year.

344
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,665
And Kawi is willing to do it.

345
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:18,644
Willing to do what?

346
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:21,704
To let you guys eavesdrop on what he’s saying?

347
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:26,249
Not, didn’t you tell him?

348
00:23:28,994 --> 00:23:31,649
I just told him a little. I didn’t explain the whole thing.

349
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:33,821
Well, I did tell him.

350
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:34,661
See?

351
00:23:37,512 --> 00:23:38,505
(Pear.)

352
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,009
(I’ve got something to tell you.)

353
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:44,456
(What is it?)

354
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:48,850
You know?

355
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:53,107
You’re one of the first people in the faculty who are nice to me.

356
00:23:55,196 --> 00:23:56,630
You help me.

357
00:23:58,408 --> 00:23:59,817
You care for me.

358
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:04,038
I’m really thankful for that, Pear.

359
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:11,944
What I want to say is…

360
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:22,163
(I’ve always had a crush on you.)

361
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:28,309
He’s awesome.

362
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:30,086
He did say it.

363
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:44,776
Those guys forced you to do something weird again, didn’t they?

364
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:49,068
No, they didn’t.

365
00:24:51,855 --> 00:24:53,215
I really like you, Pear.

366
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:05,153
Thank you so much, Kawi.

367
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:10,431
I appreciate your kind thoughts about me.

368
00:25:12,623 --> 00:25:14,623
(It’s not that I dislike you or anything

369
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:18,877
but I don’t think I can go out with you.)

370
00:25:21,762 --> 00:25:22,547
What?

371
00:25:23,974 --> 00:25:24,943
I knew it.

372
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,260
There’s already someone I like.

373
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:32,571
It wouldn't be fair to you

374
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:36,742
if we talked while someone was still in my heart.

375
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:43,891
Hey.

376
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:46,620
That’s okay.

377
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:08,228
Who’s the one you like?

378
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:15,372
Is it Pisaeng?

379
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:23,255
(Right.)

380
00:26:39,338 --> 00:26:40,848
I’m sorry, Kawi.

381
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:49,058
I never want to disappoint you.

382
00:26:57,156 --> 00:26:58,246
No. You’re fine.

383
00:27:00,663 --> 00:27:03,844
I actually knew your answer.

384
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:07,912
You said you wouldn’t come.

385
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:10,189
Why did you just pop here?

386
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:12,579
I didn’t say I wouldn’t come.

387
00:28:12,782 --> 00:28:13,675
You just made it up.

388
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,131
Hey.

389
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:24,435
About Pear, don’t overthink it. I will–

390
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:25,943
Don’t talk to me about that.

391
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:28,045
I don’t want to hear it.

392
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:29,967
Especially, from you.

393
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,898
Why can’t we talk nicely?

394
00:28:34,322 --> 00:28:35,485
I’m just worried about you.

395
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:36,852
But I don’t want that.

396
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:38,686
Why?

397
00:28:39,424 --> 00:28:42,689
Do I look like I need your sympathy and empathy all the time?

398
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:53,076
Oh, please, Kawi.

399
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:54,419
Are you going to bed already?

400
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:56,612
Not yet.

401
00:28:56,957 --> 00:28:57,754
What is it?

402
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:00,621
I’m going to the nightclub nearby.

403
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:01,993
Wanna come?

404
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:03,138
It’s late.

405
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:04,103
No.

406
00:29:04,988 --> 00:29:05,846
Yes, I’m coming.

407
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,972
Are you headed out now?

408
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:09,129
I’m coming with you.

409
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,249
That’s my boy.

410
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:14,819
What about you?

411
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,388
Coming with us

412
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,253
or just staying all alone here?

413
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,246
Here we go.

414
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:40,353
Drink and forget all the sadness.

415
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:43,435
She’s just a girl. Don’t be sad.

416
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:45,918
Cheers.

417
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:48,649
Come on.

418
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:51,069
Bottoms up.

419
00:30:02,241 --> 00:30:03,842
Let me tell you something.

420
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:07,620
There are a bunch of girls in this world.

421
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,727
You will get a new girl in no time.

422
00:30:11,031 --> 00:30:11,904
Right?

423
00:30:11,904 --> 00:30:12,963
Right.

424
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:14,694
You’re wrong, Not.

425
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,314
You’re saying it all wrong.

426
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:19,303
What did I say wrong?

427
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:26,249
No girl wants to talk to someone like me.

428
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,401
Think about it.

429
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:32,742
I’m this old,

430
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:37,057
yet I’m still a virgin.

431
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:38,223
Gosh!

432
00:30:40,044 --> 00:30:41,468
Kawi, stop.

433
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:44,863
You’re really a virgin?

434
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:46,509
Damn right.

435
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:51,902
I am a virgin, damn it!

436
00:30:57,758 --> 00:31:01,013
Well, I will take care of that for you tonight.

437
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:02,684
Take care of what?

438
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,769
Can I drink this?

439
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:19,382
Kawi, enough already.

440
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:25,396
That one over there.

441
00:31:51,112 --> 00:31:52,134
Cheers.

442
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:38,201
Ow!

443
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:39,418
Kawi and I are leaving.

444
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:41,033
Hey, where are we going?

445
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:42,170
No.

446
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:42,950
Let’s go.

447
00:33:43,152 --> 00:33:44,405
I’m not going.

448
00:33:44,794 --> 00:33:46,202
Let’s stay.

449
00:33:46,202 --> 00:33:46,943
Hey.

450
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,077
Let go of me.

451
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:53,689
Let go.

452
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:55,828
I don’t want to leave yet.

453
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:57,242
I was having fun.

454
00:33:57,431 --> 00:33:58,251
You’re drunk.

455
00:33:58,251 --> 00:33:59,658
Don’t you know what you’re doing?

456
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:00,685
I do.

457
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:04,715
I know you just love to ruin my happiness.

458
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,745
For the first time in my life,

459
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:10,458
a girl is flirting with me.

460
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:12,757
Why do you have to ruin that?

461
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:20,085
Are you so happy to have a stranger gliding on you like that?

462
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:21,910
This is what you’re like?

463
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,881
You said you like Pear.

464
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,645
So what if I like her?

465
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,454
So what?

466
00:34:27,995 --> 00:34:29,649
Pear doesn’t like me back.

467
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:32,356
It doesn’t mean you can flirt around with some other girls.

468
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,176
Be clear about your feelings, will you?

469
00:34:36,939 --> 00:34:39,454
If you really like Pear, keep fighting.

470
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:40,446
Fight what?

471
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:42,026
Fight who?

472
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,515
Who are you to say that?

473
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,139
You told me to be clear about my feelings.

474
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,258
What about you?

475
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:54,000
Are you clear about anything at all?

476
00:34:54,731 --> 00:34:56,525
You know Pear likes you.

477
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:59,407
I’ve told you many times I don’t like her.

478
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:00,646
Have you told her that?

479
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:02,196
Have you ever been honest with her?

480
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:04,616
How long are you gonna let her suffer because of you?

481
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:07,337
You’re drunk, Kawi.

482
00:35:07,749 --> 00:35:09,213
What you’re saying doesn’t make sense.

483
00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:12,017
Asshole.

484
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:14,668
You’re selfish.

485
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:16,906
Damn you.

486
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:18,992
Let go!

487
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,168
Let me go.

488
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:23,346
Pisaeng, you asshole.

489
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,137
Enough!

490
00:35:25,806 --> 00:35:26,657
You piece of shit.

491
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,550
Pisaeng!

492
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:31,027
I told you to stop!

493
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:07,757
Don’t.

494
00:36:12,056 --> 00:36:13,131
What are you doing?

495
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:18,133
Nothing.

496
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:20,458
I’m doing nothing.

497
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:25,549
Pisaeng.

498
00:36:27,403 --> 00:36:28,606
I’m serious.

499
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:31,691
Stop avoiding your own feelings

500
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,651
before you hurt more people.

501
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,226
Pisaeng.

502
00:37:55,044 --> 00:37:55,876
Pisaeng.

503
00:37:59,996 --> 00:38:01,481
Hey, Pear.

504
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,262
Why are you sleeping right here?

505
00:38:12,268 --> 00:38:13,959
I just dozed off last night.

506
00:38:14,856 --> 00:38:18,272
I thought you were here watching the sunrise.

507
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:20,643
Who would have thought?

508
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:23,135
Were you drunk last night?

509
00:38:25,813 --> 00:38:26,726
Yeah.

510
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:42,671
Can I ride with you this evening?

511
00:38:47,301 --> 00:38:48,683
I don’t want to ride the bus anymore.

512
00:38:57,654 --> 00:39:00,349
I’ve told you many times I don’t like her.

513
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:01,453
Have you told her that?

514
00:39:01,493 --> 00:39:03,081
Have you ever been honest with her?

515
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:06,622
Stop avoiding your own feelings

516
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:08,937
before you hurt more people.

517
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,261
Pear.

518
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:23,646
I know what you think about me.

519
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:36,834
The truth is…

520
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,229
I never think of you as more than a friend.

521
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,924
Not at all?

522
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:53,796
Not at all.

523
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:02,665
And it will never happen.

524
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:14,232
Why are you telling me now?

525
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:17,834
You should’ve told me ages ago.

526
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,301
I just didn't want to hurt you.

527
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:25,233
I’m not that fragile.

528
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:31,735
I actually got the hint.

529
00:40:34,383 --> 00:40:36,486
I was just waiting to hear from you directly.

530
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,552
Can I ask you something?

531
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:08,590
Um.

532
00:41:10,212 --> 00:41:12,178
You finally told me

533
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:15,889
because you like someone else, right?

534
00:41:26,038 --> 00:41:26,648
Um.

535
00:41:29,428 --> 00:41:30,458
I guess so.

536
00:41:45,057 --> 00:41:49,194
The story of Kawi getting heartbroken in front of everyone is gonna be told forever.

537
00:41:49,235 --> 00:41:51,235
I will never shut up about it.

538
00:41:51,938 --> 00:41:53,938
Do you want the voice clip when he talked to Pear?

539
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:54,942
I’ll send you that.

540
00:41:55,982 --> 00:41:56,730
You even have it?

541
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,420
Yes. Do you want it?

542
00:41:59,035 --> 00:42:00,458
You recorded it?

543
00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:02,538
That’s too evil, Not.

544
00:42:02,538 --> 00:42:03,458
Delete it.

545
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,621
Why would I?

546
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,498
It’ll amuse me for the next 10 years.

547
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:09,689
Having so much fun messing with people?

548
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:12,672
Seriously.

549
00:42:13,676 --> 00:42:15,117
No one is messing with anyone.

550
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:17,179
It’s just tradition, Pear.

551
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:20,797
You violate other people’s secrecy and gossip about it.

552
00:42:20,797 --> 00:42:22,126
You laugh about it.

553
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:23,721
You call that tradition?

554
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,378
Tell me honestly.

555
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:32,347
Is this really the university society you’re so proud of?

556
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:37,669
I thought a society full of well-educated people like us

557
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:41,511
should be very respectful of one another.

558
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,714
Or maybe we’re just a group of stupid people.

559
00:42:47,227 --> 00:42:48,609
Pear, please calm.

560
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:51,403
We just wanted the event to be fun.

561
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:52,975
Don’t think too much.

562
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:55,661
Maybe you should start thinking more.

563
00:42:57,094 --> 00:42:59,377
You call yourself an intellectual. Act like one.

564
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,870
Kawi.

565
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:21,116
Here.

566
00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:24,136
Okay.

567
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:31,955
Where’s Kwan?

568
00:43:32,315 --> 00:43:33,399
She left with her family.

569
00:43:33,605 --> 00:43:34,521
Her dad picked her up.

570
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:36,720
Okay.

571
00:43:37,647 --> 00:43:39,427
Can I sit with you?

572
00:43:40,459 --> 00:43:41,996
I don’t want to sit alone.

573
00:43:42,223 --> 00:43:43,368
Sit with me?

574
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:49,578
Will you be uncomfortable?

575
00:43:50,805 --> 00:43:51,572
No.

576
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:53,703
Why?

577
00:43:54,649 --> 00:43:55,772
Are you uncomfortable?

578
00:43:56,184 --> 00:43:57,061
No.

579
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,497
Not at all.

580
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:00,473
Let’s go.

581
00:44:33,334 --> 00:44:35,772
If I go back to the present now,

582
00:44:37,606 --> 00:44:39,606
will everything be better?

583
00:44:44,578 --> 00:44:50,285
Do you know what the most effective approach for bettering your future is?

584
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,920
What is it?

585
00:44:54,134 --> 00:44:56,618
Think less about the future.

586
00:44:57,551 --> 00:44:59,860
Make the most of the present.

587
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:07,477
But you should first be sure where your present is.

588
00:45:50,255 --> 00:45:52,332
(The get-together gave a better result than expected.)

589
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,491
(Pear is taking more interest in me.)

590
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:54,141
Kawi.

591
00:45:54,288 --> 00:45:56,031
You said you wanted to read this book.

592
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:57,068
And I happen to have it.

593
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,175
(But Pisaeng…)

594
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:01,005
Pisaeng.

595
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:04,216
I have something important to say to you as well.

596
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:08,394
(What should I do with this guy?)
