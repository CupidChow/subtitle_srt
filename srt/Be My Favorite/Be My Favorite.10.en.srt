4

Kawi.

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,327
Can I get a kiss?

6
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:21,215
Of course, it’s true.

7
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:22,113
I saw it with my own eyes.

8
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:24,091
They might be just drunk and messing with each other.

9
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,336
I know how you feel about me.

10
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:28,273
But I don’t like you that way.

11
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,722
Pear, I have something important to tell you.

12
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:33,997
There’s no need.

13
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:35,845
Pisaeng told me everything.

14
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:39,192
So that means, aside from ours,

15
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:41,116
everyone else's life is miserable.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,849
I think the only thing we can do is

17
00:00:43,263 --> 00:00:47,560
no matter what happens, we hold hands and get through it together.

18
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:55,280
I don’t know what makes you believe only bad things will happen in the future.

19
00:01:56,302 --> 00:01:57,492
I’d like to believe otherwise.

20
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:07,452
I believe there’s nothing more right than us being together.

21
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:20,030
Not.

22
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:25,440
I know how you feel about me.

23
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,994
But I don’t like you that way.

24
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,931
Pear.

25
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:47,525
Hold on.

26
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:52,866
Why?

27
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:56,203
Why can’t you like me?

28
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:58,533
What’s the reason?

29
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:03,152
You've just encountered disappointment.

30
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:07,207
Okay.

31
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,723
If you want the reason,

32
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,636
I’ll give you that.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,520
Kwan is my friend.

34
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:21,082
And I will never betray my friend for a guy like you, Not.

35
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,124
Sorry for being straightforward.

36
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:27,370
Though I’m disappointed,

37
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:30,617
I’m not that desperate.

38
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:49,439
Kwan.

39
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:51,925
Why did you do that?

40
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:57,225
Why did you tell Pear about us?

41
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:02,803
Well, I asked you

42
00:04:03,022 --> 00:04:04,496
but you didn’t listen.

43
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:07,400
So I needed to protect my friend.

44
00:04:08,412 --> 00:04:10,320
I just told her the truth.

45
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:13,063
But I had nothing to do with the decision she made.

46
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:14,059
That’s bullshit!

47
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:15,011
Not!

48
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:16,007
F*ck off.

49
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:17,830
Kwan, let’s just go.

50
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:33,299
Actually,

51
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:37,343
you have a lot of positive traits.

52
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:44,639
But if you want to show off only the filthy ones and think you’re so cool,

53
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:46,689
that’s your call.

54
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:31,385
Have you eaten anything, honey?

55
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,740
Are you all right?

56
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:07,963
It’s okay, baby.

57
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:26,875
Do you know

58
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:30,372
what exhausts me the most?

59
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:38,778
It’s when I have to always understand

60
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:44,538
and forgive those who let me down.

61
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:50,000
I’ve been asking myself all along

62
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:53,921
if I need to do that.

63
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:58,287
Do I have the right to get angry,

64
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:01,107
to not understand,

65
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:05,000
or to not forgive them?

66
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:09,006
You have the right to do anything.

67
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,207
But let me tell you something.

68
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:18,882
When your mom asked for the breakup,

69
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:21,824
I was furious.

70
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:28,513
I was so angry with her that I forbade her from seeing you for a few years.

71
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:31,869
But in the end,

72
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:39,735
anger doesn’t lead your life anywhere.

73
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:47,797
It may make you seem tougher in the short term,

74
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:56,253
but it weakens you on the inside in the long run.

75
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:02,553
Pear,

76
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:11,028
the more you forgive, the stronger you get.

77
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,140
I just want my life to be as perfect as possible.

78
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:29,689
But nothing in this world is static.

79
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:32,884
You, too.

80
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:35,905
As you live on with your life,

81
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:45,840
what you think is right today may not be the same in the future.

82
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:58,465
I think that a life willing to embrace all changes,

83
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:05,879
even if it’s not always in your best interest, can make you happy.

84
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:15,471
That, I believe, is the closest thing to the term perfect.

85
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:31,253
It’s okay.

86
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:33,735
I’m right here.

87
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:13,103
Don’t worry, Dad.

88
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:19,145
Most people who get cardiac surgery recover.

89
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:25,882
The doctor is great.

90
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,240
Don’t you worry.

91
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:36,692
I’m sorry for troubling you.

92
00:10:39,427 --> 00:10:41,001
It’s no trouble at all.

93
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:44,874
You’re the one going into the operation room, not me.

94
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:52,530
A dad’s duty is to take responsibility and take the best care of his child.

95
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:58,267
But I fail.

96
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:03,928
I’m even holding you back.

97
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:11,625
I’m sorry for not being able to perform my duty better.

98
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:17,053
If I had a chance, I’d love to redeem myself.

99
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:22,534
If I could go back in time,

100
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:28,112
I’d want to do better,

101
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:32,168
to take better care of you.

102
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:38,714
So you could be proud of me.

103
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:43,788
Who says I’m not proud of you?

104
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:52,302
I’m glad to be your son.

105
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:56,800
You don’t fail at all.

106
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:05,000
Who says what a good father should be

107
00:12:06,848 --> 00:12:08,748
or what a good father should do?

108
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,837
It’s my fault to blame everything on you.

109
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:25,168
You’ve done your best.

110
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:30,420
You don’t fail just one bit.

111
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:45,800
Promise me.

112
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:52,776
If the surgery doesn’t turn out as expected,

113
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,979
you must live a good life.

114
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:03,556
Don’t let me hold you back again.

115
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:07,959
Come on, Dad.

116
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:09,779
Promise me.

117
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:17,518
You must live a life that you’re proud of and be happy.

118
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,323
Because if you are happy,

119
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,244
the happier one is me.

120
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,672
Yes.

121
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:51,294
Okay, Dad.

122
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:56,504
I will do as promised.

123
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:23,928
Pear,

124
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:27,352
I truly am sorry.

125
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:30,639
You can hate me all you want.

126
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:36,611
But please know that I never intended to trick you or let you down.

127
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:38,639
I swear.

128
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,176
Pear,

129
00:14:41,223 --> 00:14:42,626
if you want to be angry,

130
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:43,837
be angry with me.

131
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,960
I should’ve told you a long time ago.

132
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:49,626
I’m the one you trust the most

133
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,622
but I didn’t have the guts to tell you.

134
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:55,147
It’s not Pisaeng’s fault.

135
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:56,783
It’s mine.

136
00:14:57,432 --> 00:14:59,432
You can blame it all on me, Pear.

137
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,060
Stop saying you are wrong.

138
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:08,548
There’s nobody in this world who's never done anything wrong.

139
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:15,809
And two people falling in love and getting together

140
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,042
shouldn’t be seen as something wrong.

141
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:25,489
I, as a friend, should even be happy for you.

142
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:31,046
Don’t be afraid I’ll get mad.

143
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,171
I know you two well.

144
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,162
I know you will never want to hurt me.

145
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:45,573
And I know it must be hard for you two as well.

146
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,611
Right?

147
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:57,668
Therefore, I promise

148
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:02,301
to support you guys, be a good friend,

149
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:05,991
and stay right by your side.

150
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,163
You don’t need to worry anymore, okay?

151
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:13,661
Thank you, Pear.

152
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,510
I’m really thankful to you, Pear.

153
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:22,605
Even though I can’t be the one for you,

154
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:29,107
I promise whenever you’re down or lonely,

155
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:35,897
I, as a friend, will always be there for you.

156
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:41,614
Thanks, Kawi.

157
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:01,893
Max.

158
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,932
Please stop being mad.

159
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:08,680
What do you think I’m mad at you about?

160
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:12,156
About you and Pisaeng dating and I’m the last to know?

161
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,136
Well, what can I do?

162
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,760
I’m just nobody to you.

163
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,798
Please don’t say that.

164
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,020
That’s not true at all.

165
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:24,951
Things were so messy at the time.

166
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:27,938
It all went out of the plan I made.

167
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:29,186
All right.

168
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:39,690
But actually,

169
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:44,960
I could tell from the start that you’d fall for Pisaeng.

170
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:46,607
What?

171
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:49,475
Was it that obvious?

172
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:51,988
Of course. I’m not stupid.

173
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,480
If you already knew, then why are you upset with me for telling you late?

174
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:59,625
Learning it myself and learning it from you are different.

175
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:09,668
But that’s okay.

176
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:19,054
You are very brave to accept your feelings and allow yourself to love.

177
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:24,882
I’m happy for you to experience this.

178
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:32,423
Um.

179
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:36,069
I hope there’s no more problem coming our way.

180
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:40,329
What problem?

181
00:18:41,316 --> 00:18:43,624
Didn’t you already patch things up with Pear?

182
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:53,700
I’ve decided not to buy that house.

183
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,643
I inspected it and didn’t like it.

184
00:18:57,673 --> 00:18:58,875
I’ll look for a new one later.

185
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:10,149
Kawi and I are dating now, Mom.

186
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,264
Therefore,

187
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,325
I don’t think I’ll move there.

188
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:27,889
Kawi has something he wants to do here

189
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,691
and I don’t want to be far from my boyfriend.

190
00:19:35,246 --> 00:19:37,480
There are still many years until you graduate.

191
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,904
We can discuss this again then.

192
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:42,351
Anything can happen.

193
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:46,102
What do you mean?

194
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:48,339
Pisaeng,

195
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:50,722
don’t be so naive.

196
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,373
This is the first time you’ve been with anyone.

197
00:19:55,888 --> 00:20:00,481
How do you know how long you’re going to be with him?

198
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,579
Don’t even mention 1-2 years.

199
00:20:05,457 --> 00:20:07,831
Make it through the next 3-6 months first.

200
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:12,681
You’re right, Mom.

201
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:15,602
No one knows what the future holds.

202
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:19,861
But instead of thinking it will turn bad,

203
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:23,091
why don’t you think it might be good?

204
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,467
You just don’t accept what I chose, do you?

205
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:53,273
How many times do I have to tell you before you believe me?

206
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:56,051
It’s not like I don’t accept you.

207
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:05,503
You don’t have to say anything.

208
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:11,417
Just show me.

209
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,474
Support me.

210
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:18,199
Do this for me just once.

211
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:27,412
It is a mother's responsibility to shield her child from misery.

212
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,049
But what I want

213
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:37,800
is to be happy.

214
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:06,824
[Incoming Call - Pisaeng]

215
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:13,683
Hey.

216
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:20,717
What’s wrong?

217
00:22:24,363 --> 00:22:25,468
My mom is back.

218
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:28,208
We had a fight right after she came.

219
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:35,203
Can I crash here tonight?

220
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:53,236
What was the fight about?

221
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:55,375
Huh?

222
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,422
You ran out of toothpaste.

223
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:05,153
I’ll go buy it for you.

224
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:17,200
Why don’t you have anything in the fridge at all?

225
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,644
You forgot to buy some or you already ate all of it?

226
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:26,480
Are you listening to me?

227
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,376
I am.

228
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:41,323
So what were you fighting with your mom about?

229
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:44,328
Never mind.

230
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:45,477
You don’t need to know.

231
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:49,254
Was it about me?

232
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,000
Don’t worry. I’ll handle it.

233
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,555
Can’t you just let me know?

234
00:24:00,442 --> 00:24:02,442
In case I can help.

235
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:08,672
If you want to help,

236
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:14,279
help me with something else.

237
00:24:15,077 --> 00:24:15,997
With what?

238
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,520
Help make me happy tonight.

239
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,225
Hey!

240
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,366
I’m taking the trash out.

241
00:24:44,502 --> 00:24:45,255
Bye.

242
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:11,772
Hello.

243
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:13,964
Hello, ma’am.

244
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:16,898
(What is it?)

245
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:19,340
Well…

246
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:26,854
I know you don’t like the idea of Pisaeng and I getting together.

247
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:31,750
I know you care so much about Pisaeng

248
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,520
and you’re disappointed that his life doesn’t go as you expect.

249
00:25:36,693 --> 00:25:38,693
But can you please give us a chance?

250
00:25:39,113 --> 00:25:42,883
I promise to do my best with him.

251
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,716
I really love Pisaeng.

252
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,318
What did Pisaeng tell you?

253
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,480
What do you mean?

254
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:58,968
I already cleared things up with Pisaeng.

255
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:14,427
I might be worried too much about you.

256
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:20,404
You might be right.

257
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:28,686
I judge your life based on my own experiences.

258
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:52,520
Whoever makes you happy…

259
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,884
makes me happy too.

260
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:21,252
What?

261
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:25,680
Why is Pisaeng being so dramatic then?

262
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:29,520
He just told me he wanted to spend the night with you.

263
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:33,413
Seriously,

264
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:38,749
can’t you see the trick he’s using with you?

265
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:11,024
Ouch!

266
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:12,785
What?

267
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:16,800
I talked to your mom.

268
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:18,393
Huh?

269
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,656
Ow!

270
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:20,653
Ow!

271
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:22,067
Why did you lie?

272
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:23,880
Having so much fun?

273
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:27,137
I didn’t lie.

274
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:29,346
We did have a fight.

275
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:32,190
But everything was settled.

276
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,960
I just didn’t tell you the whole story.

277
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:38,417
Ouch!

278
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,088
I was worried sick.

279
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:42,538
Damn you.

280
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:49,253
I just wanted to spend the night with you here.

281
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,524
Hugging you makes me feel happy already.

282
00:28:55,623 --> 00:28:56,449
Oh, please.

283
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,676
Go take a shower.

284
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,985
Fine.

285
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:04,608
I’ll go wash up and smell great.

286
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,122
Hey!

287
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:12,887
What are you doing?

288
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:14,099
Why are you taking your clothes off here?

289
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,883
You told me to take a shower.

290
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,060
You can do it in the bathroom.

291
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,142
Can’t you see me sitting right here?

292
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:24,479
Why do I have to see you unclothing?

293
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:30,213
What’s a boyfriend for if I can’t get naked in front of him?

294
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:32,790
You…

295
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:35,591
Take the towel with you.

296
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:36,600
I know.

297
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,064
Wanna shower with me?

298
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:49,952
No!

299
00:30:10,782 --> 00:30:12,782
Why are you asking me about this?

300
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:17,676
If I don’t talk to you about this stuff, who else would?

301
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:22,959
Max.

302
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:23,701
Hm?

303
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:31,590
Do you think it’s possible for two people dating

304
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:34,974
to have no sexual activity at all?

305
00:30:36,115 --> 00:30:37,745
Personally,

306
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:39,763
no.

307
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:44,337
I even have sex with them before I agree to be with them.

308
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,128
Kawi.

309
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,684
You already crossed that line.

310
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:57,026
What else are you afraid of?

311
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:01,713
I’m not afraid.

312
00:31:04,874 --> 00:31:07,028
I just don’t think it’s that significant.

313
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:12,296
Right. The word from someone who’s never experienced sex before.

314
00:31:15,223 --> 00:31:18,057
Let me tell you something.

315
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:22,602
This thing doesn’t only help your relationship,

316
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:25,793
but it also helps you to know yourself better.

317
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:30,369
You'll have sex with someone eventually.

318
00:31:31,804 --> 00:31:35,208
How lucky you are to get a chance to do it with someone you love.

319
00:31:38,821 --> 00:31:41,940
Are you going to sleep next to each other holding hands forever?

320
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:44,076
That’s good.

321
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,137
Well, if Pisaeng thinks the same way, it won’t be a problem.

322
00:32:51,211 --> 00:32:52,043
Kawi.

323
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:53,584
Fell asleep already?

324
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:45,426
Gosh!

325
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:05,061
Are you faking your sleep or your death?

326
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:17,725
Ouch. You’re heavy.

327
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:18,995
Heavy?

328
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:21,109
Would you like to get on top instead then?

329
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:26,690
Hey, go away.

330
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:29,432
What?

331
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:32,562
I’m gonna go buy some congee.

332
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:03,031
What are you looking at?

333
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,119
Why?

334
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:05,520
I can’t look at my boyfriend or what?

335
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,504
You’re watching me eat.

336
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,134
Why?

337
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:13,003
Because you’re the cutest when you eat.

338
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:33,304
Come to think of it,

339
00:36:33,773 --> 00:36:36,320
we’re now boyfriends, we should stop using rude pronouns to call each other.

340
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,033
Let’s use some other words.

341
00:36:38,801 --> 00:36:39,529
Like what?

342
00:36:42,472 --> 00:36:42,972
Babe.

343
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:43,770
Stop it!

344
00:36:45,762 --> 00:36:46,490
No way.

345
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:53,760
Don’t you have anything to do today?

346
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:02,719
Don’t you have anything to do today, sir?

347
00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:06,918
No.

348
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,893
I’m free today.

349
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:13,955
Aren’t you going out?

350
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:16,690
No.

351
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:20,994
We should just stay in and do something fun.

352
00:37:22,727 --> 00:37:23,426
What fun?

353
00:37:24,457 --> 00:37:26,027
There’s nothing freakin’ fun in my room.

354
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:29,923
Right.

355
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,567
There’s nothing fun to do here, sir.

356
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:38,055
There is.

357
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,025
Let’s go out.

358
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:59,151
Please.

359
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,255
Let’s go out.

360
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:02,425
Do something fun.

361
00:38:05,274 --> 00:38:06,038
Fine.

362
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:08,678
Where do you want to go?

363
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:25,221
This is the place you wanted me to take you?

364
00:38:27,236 --> 00:38:28,232
It is.

365
00:38:29,395 --> 00:38:30,926
I’ve always wanted to come here since I was a child.

366
00:38:30,926 --> 00:38:32,180
Never been here.

367
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:35,083
Let’s get inside.

368
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:39,533
Come on.

369
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:40,108
Quickly.

370
00:38:53,434 --> 00:38:53,960
Here.

371
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:56,084
Eat something.

372
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:57,464
No.

373
00:38:57,651 --> 00:39:01,459
Come on. The plane is coming.

374
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,040
Yum!

375
00:39:07,003 --> 00:39:09,003
Aren't you so lovely?

376
00:39:11,673 --> 00:39:15,143
If you just wanted to eat, why did you ask me to take you to a theme park?

377
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,950
I just wanted to get the vibes.

378
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:24,538
The thing that can make me the happiest is eating.

379
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:32,968
This is not right.

380
00:39:33,882 --> 00:39:35,960
A theme park isn’t a place to eat.

381
00:39:39,773 --> 00:39:40,273
Let’s go.

382
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:41,457
Go where?

383
00:39:41,457 --> 00:39:42,637
Let’s go. Get up.

384
00:39:42,637 --> 00:39:43,457
Hold on.

385
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:56,451
This is too much. Not this ride.

386
00:39:58,415 --> 00:39:59,175
Come on.

387
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:00,689
Let’s try it first.

388
00:40:01,313 --> 00:40:02,359
No.

389
00:40:03,174 --> 00:40:03,969
I don’t like it.

390
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:04,947
You haven’t tried it yet.

391
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:06,334
How do you know if you like it or not?

392
00:40:07,186 --> 00:40:08,609
You said you’d never been to a theme park.

393
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:13,306
If you don't try it, it's the same as if you've never been here.

394
00:40:23,992 --> 00:40:26,628
If you’re scared, just hold on to my hand.

395
00:40:27,065 --> 00:40:27,650
Okay?

396
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:39,324
No.

397
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:40,325
I won’t get on it.

398
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:42,311
You can go alone if you want to.

399
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:43,951
I’ll just wait here.

400
00:41:14,968 --> 00:41:15,983
What are you doing?

401
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:17,763
Creating a mood.

402
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:20,535
Get the breeze and chill.

403
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:23,396
Do you think we’re in a TV series?

404
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:24,693
No.

405
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:25,451
Close it.

406
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:28,382
Close it.

407
00:41:28,992 --> 00:41:29,720
It’s hot.

408
00:42:00,156 --> 00:42:00,780
Kawi.

409
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:08,931
I feel like you didn’t enjoy today very much.

410
00:42:11,171 --> 00:42:13,171
Despite the fact that you’re the one who wanted to go out.

411
00:42:16,193 --> 00:42:18,193
I must have killed your mood somehow.

412
00:42:20,345 --> 00:42:24,292
Whatever I did wrong today, you can tell me.

413
00:42:26,094 --> 00:42:27,136
So that on our next date,

414
00:42:28,447 --> 00:42:29,449
I can do better.

415
00:42:56,846 --> 00:42:57,807
No, Pisaeng.

416
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:01,628
Today was great.

417
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,793
I’ve been having a great time.

418
00:43:14,617 --> 00:43:15,544
Thank you so much.

419
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:41,587
Are you sure?

420
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,793
Um.

421
00:45:48,729 --> 00:45:52,239
Then why is Pisaeng acting so dramatic, ma’am?

422
00:45:52,672 --> 00:45:55,268
And he said he was having a fight with you.

423
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:59,308
Can’t you see the trick he’s using with you?

424
00:45:59,788 --> 00:46:01,109
What do you mean?

425
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:04,730
You should ask him what he wants.

426
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:07,270
(Why is he acting like a lost puppy?)

427
00:46:08,136 --> 00:46:10,037
(That’s what my son is like.)

428
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:11,946
Kawi.

429
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:14,093
Yes.

430
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:16,963
Please take care of him, son.

431
00:46:22,263 --> 00:46:22,912
Yes, ma’am.

432
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,242
I still don’t get you.

433
00:46:30,385 --> 00:46:31,988
Why do you like someone like me?

434
00:46:32,442 --> 00:46:33,141
You’re cute.

435
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:35,249
There are a bunch of cute people out there.

436
00:46:35,249 --> 00:46:36,711
So you like everyone that’s cute?

437
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,684
But there’s only one with this kind of cute.

438
00:46:41,268 --> 00:46:42,056
Pisaeng.

439
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:45,274
Thank you for asking me to move in.
