Let me go!

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,252
I told you to stop!

7
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,985
Pisaeng, stop avoiding your own feelings

8
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:25,788
before you hurt more people.

9
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:26,823
Pear.

10
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:28,962
I never think of you as more than a friend.

11
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:31,064
Because you like someone else, right?

12
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:25,790
Damn you, Kawi.

13
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,574
I was trying to get you a girl last night.

14
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:29,838
But you just disappeared.

15
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:32,643
Oh, please.

16
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:35,574
You don’t have to be so serious about that, Not.

17
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:39,803
Where did you sleep last night by the way?

18
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,654
My room.

19
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:43,866
Why?

20
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:45,306
He failed.

21
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,861
The girl ditched him.

22
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:49,654
He danced all night and got nothing.

23
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,337
Kawi.

24
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:07,354
Can I have a word with you?

25
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:22,354
I thought about what you said last night.

26
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:28,613
You might be right.

27
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:31,673
I’m not being clear about my relationship,

28
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:36,005
both with Pear and with someone else too.

29
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:51,029
It could be because I'm afraid.

30
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,909
Not only am I afraid of unintentionally hurting people.

31
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:00,955
But I’m afraid…

32
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:08,454
I don’t know what I’m afraid of.

33
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:13,769
Have you talked to Pear?

34
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:20,000
I told her I didn’t have feelings for her.

35
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:25,967
What about you?

36
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:35,168
What about me?

37
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you really like Pear?

(Thanks to time travel,

41
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:26,621
I am able to resume writing

42
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:29,827
after neglecting it for years.)

43
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:37,226
(Although its first purpose was just to keep records of the missions,

44
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:44,764
doing something I hadn't done in a long time fills my heart with joy.)

(At the beginning of my time travel,

46
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:55,200
I assumed there was nothing a man who’d previously lived like me couldn't change.)

47
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,430
Miss, do you have the lotto tickets with these numbers?

48
00:04:56,778 --> 00:05:00,674
(In fact, no matter how much magic power I have…)

49
00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:01,664
I did have them.

50
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,380
These numbers, exactly.

51
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,520
They were all sold.

No, bro. These are all I have.

You said you wanted to read this book.

59
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:39,063
I happen to have it. You can borrow mine.

Hey.

61
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,513
Thank you, Pear.

62
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:47,473
And this one is my favorite.

63
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,264
Give it a try.

(Though the thing between Pear and me hasn’t met my expectation yet,

65
00:05:57,586 --> 00:05:59,734
it’s going pretty well.)

71

I will not go back and check until I’ve completed all the missions.)

That’s it.

74
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:58,988
Okay. Sure.

75

Is she showing signs she might ditch you?

Pear doesn’t say that’s bad, right?

187

Not smooth at all.

Again.

189
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,112
Here they are, separate.

190
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:24,084
Ow!

191
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,537
Why is it so hard?

192
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:40,982
What are you doing?

193
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:43,398
Aren’t you going home?

194
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:47,084
Waiting for Pear to finish her personality workshop.

195
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:09,084
If it’s so hard and not your specialty,

196
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:11,715
why are you wasting your time on it?

197
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,290
I must find something to input in the application.

198
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:18,762
Trust me.

199
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:22,461
No one reads that. You can just fill in whatever you want.

200
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:25,389
Paper plane origami, tongue rolling, whistling, anything.

201
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,920
You don’t need to think too much.

202
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:30,338
Easy for you to say because you’re so privileged.

203
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:34,084
The seniors won’t mind whatever you put in.

204
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:36,009
I’m not you.

205
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:40,103
If I want to compete, I must really be good at something.

206
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:42,531

207
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:53,667
Why aren’t you showing what you’re good at?

208
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:55,980
Because there’s none.

209
00:16:59,084 --> 00:16:59,795
There is.

210
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,411
I remember the day we had the interview with the seniors...

211
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,698
Stop it.

212
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,034
Don’t talk about it.

213
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:08,377
I forgot all about it.

214
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:09,537
Hey.

215
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:11,287
You guys are here.

217
00:17:14,953 --> 00:17:15,990
Excuse me, Pear.

218
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:17,152
I got something to do.

219
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:31,681
What now?

220
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:33,285
Are you gonna say it or not?

221
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:35,706
Stop walking back and forth. It’s annoying.

222
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:42,044
I don’t know what to do with someone that likes me.

223
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:44,561
Tell me who it is first.

224
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:46,126
Or we’re not talking.

225
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,514
Come on, Max.

226
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:49,575
Just tell that person you’re not interested.

227
00:17:54,593 --> 00:17:55,677
I can’t.

228
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:58,964
That person hasn’t confessed to me yet.

229
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,054
What?

230
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:02,223
Then how did you know that person likes you?

231
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:07,714
I know, all right.

232
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:12,296
What kind of guy friend likes to follow me around like that?

233
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:16,388
Shit.

234
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,357
Did I just slip out he’s a guy?

235
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:25,845
Forget the sexual orientation.

236
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,693
But as far as I know, I don’t think the problem is with him.

237

(On the day I realized that we were just small human-beings

Everyone must give you a chance.

271
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:18,142
But think about this.

272

When it’s your turn to give people chances,

273
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:24,760
you just somehow learn that he might like you,

274
00:23:25,782 --> 00:23:27,782

00:24:54,087 --> 00:24:55,047
Yeah.

305
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,093

Everyone needs encouragement.

314
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:33,284
And it doesn’t even cost that much.

315
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:36,955
I don’t get why it’s so hard for people to give each other that.

316
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,600
Last night, when you saw me,

317
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,403
I was just there to take a look around.

318
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:04,797
I was there for a second and left.

319
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:07,975
You’re not going to tell anyone, are you?

320
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,533
And why would I tell anyone that

321
00:26:15,964 --> 00:26:17,964
when I’m barely talking to people in the faculty?

322
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,754
What are you afraid of?

323
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:22,158
Nothing.

324
00:26:22,158 --> 00:26:23,006
I’m not afraid.

325
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,782

There are wars going on around the world.

330
00:26:45,983 --> 00:26:46,748
Our politics are crap.

331
00:26:47,284 --> 00:26:49,882

Are you that important?

336
00:26:58,871 --> 00:27:03,552
Why do you even think other people would care where you go or what you do?

337
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:07,579
You’re right.

338
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:10,874
It’s just what I do.

339
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:14,115
It’s nothing important.

340
00:27:25,592 --> 00:27:26,542
I’m sorry.

341
00:27:29,692 --> 00:27:30,742
I didn’t mean to.

342
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:34,545
I was just…being irritated.

343
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:39,734
I was wrong.

344
00:27:40,622 --> 00:27:42,203
I shouldn’t have judged you so quickly.

345
00:27:45,516 --> 00:27:50,532
If you have something to tell me, you can.

00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:53,912
Though we aren’t close,

347
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,291
I can listen.

348
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:02,405

349
00:28:04,037 --> 00:28:09,657
to find the answer to what is happening to me.

350
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,369
Um.

351
00:28:13,463 --> 00:28:14,390
Did you find it?

352
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:23,668

00:30:47,656 --> 00:30:49,656
(It’s our duty

372
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:53,843
to be nice to other people.)

373
00:30:55,483 --> 00:31:01,795
(Or at least be nice to ourselves.)

374
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:08,163
The names I just called are those who have been selected.

375
00:31:08,163 --> 00:31:09,089
Please stay on.

376
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:12,385
As for those whose names weren’t called, you’re free to leave this room.

377
00:31:12,897 --> 00:31:14,674
Every one of you did great.

378
00:31:14,845 --> 00:31:16,622
Thank you so much for applying.

379
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:21,413
Pear.

380
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,284
Congrats.

381
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:30,171
Are you okay, Kawi?

382
00:31:31,176 --> 00:31:32,658
Of course, I am.

383
00:31:32,942 --> 00:31:34,564
It’s not like they can choose everyone.

384
00:31:43,082 --> 00:31:45,082
[Pisaeng: Come see me at the faculty building rooftop.]

385
00:31:50,006 --> 00:31:50,608
Pear.

386
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:52,163
Give me a call when you’re done.

387
00:31:52,163 --> 00:31:53,197
I need to go now.

388
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,308
Pisaeng.

389
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:48,934
How did it go?

390
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,562
What’s the result?

391
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:54,959
I didn’t pass.

392
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,013
Yeah?

393
00:33:13,355 --> 00:33:14,134
Pisaeng.

394
00:33:18,446 --> 00:33:19,399
I’m sorry.

395
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:31,270
I told you to act normal

396
00:33:32,522 --> 00:33:38,454
but actually, it’s me who doesn’t act normal.

397
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,436
I’m sorry.

398
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:52,819
Kawi.

399
00:33:56,885 --> 00:33:59,212
I have something important to say to you as well.

400
00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:10,638
I have no idea when it happened.

401
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,153
But it happened.

402
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:23,019
Get it out,

403
00:34:26,256 --> 00:34:27,988
if it’s going to make things easier.

404
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:32,819
I will listen.

405
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:35,775
And I promise I won’t be mean to you anymore.

406
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:49,974
I like you.

407
00:35:09,751 --> 00:35:12,071
I have something important to say to you as well.

408
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:19,021
I like you.

409
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:29,199
I really don’t know when this feeling started.

410
00:35:30,939 --> 00:35:32,092
But it did.

411
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:36,893
And I understand if you want to stay away

412
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:40,240
and don’t want anything to do with me anymore.

413
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:49,844
But I can’t stop my feelings.

414
00:35:52,124 --> 00:35:54,215
Though I know you will reject me no matter what,

415
00:35:56,138 --> 00:35:57,320
I want to say it.

416
00:36:01,134 --> 00:36:01,952
I’m sorry.

417
00:36:06,776 --> 00:36:08,136
Don’t apologize to me.

418
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:18,403
Liking someone isn’t something wrong.

419
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:24,273
But you know what’s bad?

420
00:36:27,215 --> 00:36:32,481
It’s when you like someone and don’t say it.

421
00:36:34,674 --> 00:36:37,405
Thank you for telling me honestly.

422
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,795
But I think you know I can’t accept your feelings.

423
00:36:50,044 --> 00:36:51,533
I can be your friend though.

424
00:36:55,903 --> 00:36:56,833
If that’s okay with you.

425
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:08,390
I’m okay.

426
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:40,082
[Pear: Where are you, Kawi? Should I go to you instead?]

427
00:37:40,773 --> 00:37:42,293
Pear, sorry. Did I keep you waiting?

428
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,047
Not at all.

429
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,662
Here.

430
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:50,103
Oops.

431
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:51,773
Thanks.

432
00:37:55,657 --> 00:38:00,832
(I used to believe what people wanted the most was miracles.)

433
00:38:01,894 --> 00:38:08,256
(When in fact, chances are more crucial.)

434
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:13,034
(Chances to realize,

435
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,458
to understand,

436
00:38:22,397 --> 00:38:26,093
and to embrace everything that happens to them.)

437
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:48,217
We’ve arrived.

438
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,613
This is the first time I walk home.

439
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:57,511
I just knew that we could walk quite far when walking with a friend.

440
00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:06,577
I’m sorry I don’t have a car to drive you home.

441
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:09,758
Hey. It’s totally fine.

442
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:11,462
This is fun.

443
00:39:14,842 --> 00:39:17,420
Let’s walk together again next time.

444
00:39:21,378 --> 00:39:22,311
Okay.

445
00:39:28,253 --> 00:39:29,617
I’ll just get inside.

446
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,577
Get home safe, Kawi.

447
00:40:04,379 --> 00:40:05,241
This is Fluke.

448
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:06,699
He’s a guitarist from the bar.

449
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:08,773
Do you remember him?

450
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:13,261
I do.

451
00:40:13,261 --> 00:40:17,667
On the student reps selection date, he was helping out backstage.

452
00:40:18,203 --> 00:40:19,609
He heard you sing.

453
00:40:20,613 --> 00:40:22,699
So he wants to ask if he can add the melody to the song you wrote.

454
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:23,415
What?

455
00:40:25,015 --> 00:40:25,909
My song?

456
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:27,015
Yes.

457
00:40:27,377 --> 00:40:30,313
I’ve been wanting to produce a new song.

458
00:40:30,313 --> 00:40:33,118
I just couldn’t come up with any idea.

459
00:40:33,118 --> 00:40:35,716
But once I heard your song, I knew it.

460
00:40:35,716 --> 00:40:37,096
It hit hard.

461
00:40:37,096 --> 00:40:39,272
Besides, your voice is pretty nice.

462
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:42,013
Are you interested to be my band’s vocalist?

463
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:42,871
Are you?

464
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:48,924
Come on.

465
00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:52,248
Me?

466
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:53,468
Yes.

467
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:54,433
You.

468
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:57,342
I can’t sing all the time. My voice can’t bear it.

469
00:40:57,342 --> 00:41:01,108
If you join us, trust me, we will be famous.

470
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:03,764
It’s true. We will go so far.

471
00:41:05,316 --> 00:41:06,270
Me?

472
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:07,795
I’m going to make your band famous?

473
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:08,936
Hell, yes.

474
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:09,864
Listen to me.

475
00:41:09,978 --> 00:41:12,505
Your song is okay. Your voice is nice.

476
00:41:12,505 --> 00:41:13,702
Give me ‘Do.’

477
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:17,498
Do…

478
00:41:18,046 --> 00:41:19,053
Do, do…

479
00:41:19,745 --> 00:41:20,572
Do, do…

480
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:21,745
There it is.

481
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,256
That’s it. Your voice is great.

482
00:41:23,374 --> 00:41:24,917
And the most important thing is…

483
00:41:30,897 --> 00:41:31,888
Your face.

484
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:33,194
You’re such a cute boy.

485
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:34,245
Girls will scream for you.

486
00:41:34,245 --> 00:41:35,157
Boys will, too.

487
00:41:35,157 --> 00:41:36,195
I’ll even scream for you.

488
00:41:39,255 --> 00:41:40,364
Believe me.

489
00:41:45,945 --> 00:41:47,214
Do you think it’s okay?

490
00:41:49,588 --> 00:41:51,268
I’m not sure.

491
00:41:53,003 --> 00:41:54,341
You mean him, right?

492
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:56,563
No.

493
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:57,814
I mean me.

494
00:42:00,712 --> 00:42:01,893
Give it a try.

495
00:42:02,258 --> 00:42:04,173
If it doesn’t work, you can always back off.

496
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:20,037
Yes.

497
00:42:20,677 --> 00:42:21,493
I’ll try.

498
00:42:21,493 --> 00:42:22,403
Yes!

499
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:24,947
Awesome.

500
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:26,893
We’ll be famous.

501
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:27,813
So famous.

502
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:04,288
Hold on.

503
00:43:05,384 --> 00:43:06,267
Are you worried or something?

504
00:43:07,656 --> 00:43:09,199
Don’t be. All right?

505
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,400
Just have fun.

506
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:11,409

So damn boring.

526
00:45:10,134 --> 00:45:11,301
Let’s hit a gaming café.

527
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:12,612
Max.

528
00:45:14,021 --> 00:45:15,124
I’ll wait downstairs.

529
00:45:15,786 --> 00:45:16,592
Yeah.

530
00:45:23,706 --> 00:45:24,943
Are you Bodkawee?

531
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:29,612
I’m Pisaeng.

532
00:45:32,478 --> 00:45:33,062
Okay.

533
00:45:34,093 --> 00:45:34,665
Hey,

534
00:45:34,939 --> 00:45:37,633
the seniors suggested that freshmen pair up and take turns taking each other home.

535
00:45:38,448 --> 00:45:39,973
No. My dorm is just nearby.

536
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:44,239
Our classmates will have dinner together. You coming?

537
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:44,974
No.

538
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,594
Pisaeng, I have something to tell you.

539
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:07,870
(Things have finally come to this point.)

540
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:11,053
(Do you want to know how Pisaeng and I will be?)

541
00:46:11,507 --> 00:46:13,507
Why do you like me?

542
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,402
(I want to know as well.)
