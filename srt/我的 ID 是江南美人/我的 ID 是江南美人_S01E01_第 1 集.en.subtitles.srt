1
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,245
Double eyelid surgery
and all-round canthoplasty.

2
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,967
A nose job, face contouring surgery,
fat injections, and lip fillers.

3
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,594
75 out of 100.

4
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,572
Double eyelid surgery,
epicanthoplasty,

5
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,033
a nose job,
the V-shape face contouring surgery.

6
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,411
HER FACE IS OBVIOUSLY WORKED ON,
BUT SHE IS SATISFIED.

7
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,830
70 out of 100.

8
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,763
85 OUT OF 100

9
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,142
THE BEAUTIFUL FACE YOU DREAM OF!

10
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,061
ALL PRETTY GIRLS KNOW!

11
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,439
I'd be happy even with an average face.

12
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,816
65 OUT OF 100

13
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,236
72 out of 100.
Will I be able to get there?

14
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,992
I'll go over
what you and the doctor discussed.

15
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,328
Double eyelid surgery through incision
and all-round canthoplasty.

16
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,123
Also a nose job, a noble surgery,
full face contouring

17
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,834
and fat injections
all over the face. Is that correct?

18
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,919
83 out of 100.

19
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,226
SURGERY AGREEMENT

20
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,062
Noticeable puffiness and bruises will last
for about a month.

21
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,609
Post-procedural complications may result
in bleeding or infections.

22
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,446
Such cases are rare, but if necessary,
she can receive a blood transfusion.

23
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,824
Well, that doesn't happen often, does it?

24
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,951
No, not often.

25
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,370
-It's rare, but it can happen.
-I see.

26
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,706
It usually doesn't happen.
Please don't worry.

27
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,000
-The surgery will go well.
-I see.

28
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,426
SURGERY CONSENT FOR A MINOR
PARENT APPROVAL FORM

29
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,803
NA EUN-SHIM, MOTHER

30
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,224
AS A MOTHER, I AGREE TO THE SURGERY
SPECIFIED IN THIS CONSENT.

31
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,776
Don't worry about the surgery costs.

32
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,402
SURGERY CENTER

33
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,155
It'll be a whole new world
when you wake up.

34
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,823
Yes.

35
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,039
So this is the last time
I can see this face of yours.

36
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,585
Mom...

37
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,172
Oh dear, don't cry.

38
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,261
-You know that I love you, right?
-Yes.

39
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,805
-I love you very much.
-I know.

40
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,890
Please come in.

41
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,685
Go on in.

42
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,650
You can't cry during the surgery.

43
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,652
You got this, Mi-rae!

44
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,521
You'll start feeling sleepy.

45
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,254
-Hey, Fatty!
-Hey, Fatty!

46
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,091
-You pig!
-You pig!

47
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,268
-Mi-rae is a pig!
-Mi-rae is a pig!

48
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,018
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

49
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,109
THE PIG

50
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,504
What are you looking at?
The pig.

51
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,880
Oink-oink.

52
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,050
That was seriously so funny.

53
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,845
She really looked like a pig earlier.

54
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,314
-No, wait!
-Stop it!

55
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,566
-Stop!
-Don't do this!

56
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,526
-Come on!
-It hurts!

57
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,778
-Let go of this.
-Get off me.

58
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,491
I was a brave girl and I didn't stay quiet
when the other kids made fun of me.

59
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,120
-But every time I fought back...
-Open the door!

60
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,665
-...they'd always do something worse.
-Hurry up and open the door!

61
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,667
-Open it!
-You're strong.

62
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,961
Just break the door open.

63
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,423
Open the door!

64
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,592
Open it!

65
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,719
I said, open the door!

66
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,857
Winning the fight isn't what victims want.

67
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,154
All they want is to stop being the victim.

68
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,533
They just don't want to be victimized.

69
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,598
I'm not going to eat.
I said, I'm not going to eat!

70
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,187
But I took out all the bones for you.

71
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,732
You can't leave with an empty stomach.

72
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:49,278
Up until then, I thought I still had
a chance to become pretty.

73
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,281
Because I heard the best makeover is
to lose weight.

74
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,367
You'll only end up gaining weight again!

75
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,378
But I didn't gain my weight back,

76
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,089
because I was very determined.

77
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,263
Someone in our class got the highest score
in the entire grade.

78
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,806
Mi-rae, congratulations.

79
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,564
No one made fun of me for a while,

80
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,109
so I thought
I had finally become a normal student.

81
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,378
What is it that you need to say?

82
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,882
Here. I made a list
of expected questions on the exam.

83
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,676
I'm only giving this to you.

84
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,053
Why?

85
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:57,847
Because...

86
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,808
I like you.

87
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,934
What?

88
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,477
Are you crazy?

89
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,564
Why...

90
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,816
What do you mean?

91
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,700
Hey, Kang Orc.

92
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,331
I'm talking to you, Kang Orc.

93
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,876
Don't you know your nickname?

94
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,502
You were joking, right?

95
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,087
Tell me you were joking.

96
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,590
-Yong-cheol.
-Hey, Kang Orc.

97
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,217
I'll kill you if you tell anybody
that you like me.

98
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,345
You better keep it a secret.

99
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,396
I never

100
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,567
ended up becoming pretty.

101
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,917
Why don't you just do her a favor
and go out with her?

102
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,919
You go out with her, you jerk.

103
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,629
-What are you saying?
-Kang Orc.

104
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,673
Yong-Cheol changed his mind.

105
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,757
What are you saying?

106
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,104
Okay, let's take a photo.
In 1, 2, 3.

107
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,066
-Okay, that was great.
-Nice.

108
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,486
Okay, it's time for Group Three.
Get over here and pose.

109
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,656
Hey, hurry up. Okay, nice.

110
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,325
Now, everybody, pose.

111
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,412
Okay, nice.
Let's do this in one go. In 1, 2, 3.

112
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,331
Okay. No, wait.

113
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,377
Hey, you over there.
You need to show your face.

114
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,338
-My gosh.
-What's wrong with her?

115
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,007
She's embarrassed because she's ugly.

116
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,009
Gosh, it's hot. So annoying.

117
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,761
Okay, let's take one more photo.

118
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,847
Everybody, smile. Let me see your teeth.

119
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,933
Okay, let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

120
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,562
I never got...

121
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,357
to lead a normal life.

122
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,218
I can't even love anyone
like everyone else,

123
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,139
because...

124
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,561
I'm an orc.

125
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,822
This place really must be famous.

126
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,157
Look at all these people.

127
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,711
Don't worry about anything else

128
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,423
and just focus on resting here
before you start school. Okay?

129
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:09,849
Mi-rae, just focus on taking in
all the good energy from this mountain

130
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,392
and becoming pretty.

131
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,278
Let's take in all the good energy
from this mountain

132
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,991
so that Mi-rae can become pretty!

133
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,495
Just as the bear hid in a cave for 100
days and became the beautiful woman,

134
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,999
I also started becoming pretty
while staying here.

135
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,251
Here's your new ID.

136
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,799
Thank you.

137
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,430
Are you looking for any specific perfume?

138
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,516
I'd like to get this one, Pomelo.

139
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,394
You're feminine and beautiful,
so it'll suit you well.

140
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,608
I guess you have a date today.

141
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,734
Pardon me?

142
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,445
Well...

143
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,242
I have to attend
college orientation tomorrow.

144
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,707
I've become pretty.

145
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,753
The difference is really amazing.

146
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,172
But the thing is...

147
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,549
BIG, ROUND EYES,
WELL-DEFINED, FEMININE NOSE

148
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,010
...it's a bit obvious
that I got plastic surgery.

149
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,304
I'd say 79 out of 100?

150
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,896
"TAXICAB DRIVER'S PERMIT
KANG TAE-SIK"

151
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,442
Hasn't the weather gotten much nicer?

152
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,027
Yes.

153
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,282
-That must be your daughter.
-Yes.

154
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,494
She's majoring in chemistry
at Hankook University. A freshman.

155
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,996
She must've had good grades.

156
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,333
When I tell people that she never had
a tutor or took after-school classes,

157
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,584
no one believes me.

158
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,128
You don't either, do you?

159
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,797
Kids who just aren't cut out for studying

160
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,632
must find different paths early on.

161
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,135
Kids should not go through
such tough ordeals.

162
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,347
My daughter studied all by herself
and graduated at the top of her class.

163
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,475
Top of the whole school,
not just her class!

164
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,854
Anyway, she always studies so hard.

165
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,897
Right after the college entrance exam,

166
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,233
she went to the Philippines
to study English.

167
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:14,241
Frankly, I always thought it'd be nice
for her to become a model.

168
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,160
She's tall and slim.

169
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,664
She's not that pretty,

170
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,207
but she has such a cute face.

171
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,879
Doesn't she look like that actress?
Wasn't her name Kim Go-eun?

172
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,382
Kim Go-eun?

173
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,094
Some say that my daughter is ugly,

174
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,514
but she's prettier
than Kim Tae-hee to my eyes.

175
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,518
You sure love your daughter a lot.

176
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,911
A new face and a new life.

177
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:04,333
I want to be really happy
during my undergraduate years.

178
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,048
Hey, university student.

179
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,967
What's up, university student?

180
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,304
Shall we take a photo
to commemorate this historic moment?

181
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,149
Shall we?

182
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,529
I brought my selfie stick
for this very moment.

183
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,697
-Nice.
-Hey, come closer.

184
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,659
1, 2, 3!

185
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,995
Hyun-jung and I have been best friends
since middle school,

186
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,248
but we didn't have
a single photo together.

187
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,707
Let's take it again.

188
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,418
1, 2, 3.

189
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,587
Isn't it so nice here? Come on.

190
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,673
Let's take one here.

191
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:56,969
Because my ugly face looked
even uglier in photos.

192
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,346
1, 2, 3.

193
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,639
1, 2, 3.

194
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,350
What are you doing? Get it right.

195
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:07,146
Hey, you look pretty in photos now.
Look, you're so pretty. One more time.

196
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,856
1, 2, 3.

197
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,569
What are you doing? Come on.

198
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,195
-Okay.
-Look at the camera.

199
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,828
Don't you think people keep looking at me?

200
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,001
I hope it's not because I still look ugly.

201
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:33,172
Gosh, do you want to hear me saying
it's because you're pretty? From me?

202
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,174
Excuse me.

203
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,594
Can I get your number
if that's okay with you?

204
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,347
You're totally my type.

205
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,726
Here.

206
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,733
You're totally my type.

207
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,820
-Hey.
-Yes?

208
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,323
Come on, he's asking for your number.

209
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,702
Oh...

210
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,662
Well...

211
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,456
The thing is,

212
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,792
I don't have a phone number.

213
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,297
Gosh, you can just say no.

214
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,549
You did not have to embarrass me.

215
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,927
You idiot.

216
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,263
You don't have a phone number?
What kind of nonsense is that?

217
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,556
I know.

218
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,517
That didn't make sense at all.

219
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,437
Hey, do you know what he just said to you?

220
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,607
He said you're totally his type.

221
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,777
What type am I?

222
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,072
What do you think? You're the pretty type.

223
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,952
Gosh, you needed some time to adjust
 yourself to your new, pretty face.

224
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,788
Hey, Kang Mi-rae.
Pull yourself together.

225
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,082
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

226
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,043
Let's go!

227
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,300
Hey, are you going to give
that guy your number?

228
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,764
Come on.

229
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,062
-Why did you go that way?
-I don't know.

Thank you.

234
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,543
You are chemistry major.

235
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,587
I have to say hi to her.
You're Yoo Eun, right?

236
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,632
-The repeater.
-Yes, for three years.

237
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,009
Talk to me casually.

238

NATURALLY DOUBLE EYELIDS

-80 out of 100.

242
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,351
I'd give her 85 when she's dressed up.

243
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,519
I'm Lee Ji-hyo.

244
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,980
Gosh, I told you guys
to just talk casually.

245
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,524
I'm Choi Jung-boon.

246
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,360
Are you that...
Oh, my goodness.

247
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,905
-I didn't even recognize you.
-Whatever.

248
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,158
-I look just like my photo.
-70 out of 100?

249
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,577
-A cute, friendly face.
-You want to argue with me.

250
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,536
My goodness.

251
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,748
Kim Sung-woon.
You look nothing like your photo.

252
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,791
DOUBLE EYELID SURGERY
FILLER IN NOSE

253
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,545
90 out of 100.
She's pretty. She'd be popular among guys.

254
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,672
-You little...
-What? You jerk.

255
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,936
Hello, I'm Kang Mi-rae.

256
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,772

-Kang Mi-rae?

258
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,068
Are you the one with no profile photo?

259
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,736
Well...

260
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,571
-Yes.
-No, that can't be.

261
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,865
She must be an X Man.

262
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,492
Hey.

263
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,496
-You are an X Man, aren't you?
-X Man? What is that?

264
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,415
Those in senior year fool freshmen
at the beginning of the semester.

265
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,709
You are, right? I bet you are an X Man.

266
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,754
No, I'm not. I am a freshman too.

Gosh, she was born in 1999 indeed.

270
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,855
I guess I look older than my age.

271
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,274
No, it's not that.
You're drop-dead gorgeous.

272
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,693
No girl in first year is
this pretty and slim.

273
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,530
-Am I right?
-Yes, you're right. Totally.

274
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,657
What is this awkward tension?

275
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,575
Will I be an outsider?

276
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,910
Hello.

277
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,413

You're all better-looking in person.
I almost didn't recognize anyone.

00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,714
I'm Jang Won-ho.

281
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,591
I'm the cutie-pie, Kim Sung-woon.

282
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,261
-I'm Lee Ji-hyo.
-I'm Choi Jung-boon.

283
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,638
-I'm Yoo Eun.
-100 out of 100.

284
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,723
A super rare natural beauty.

FLAWLESS SKIN
SMALL FACE

286
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,353
She really is divinely beautiful.

287
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,149
Oh, are you Kang Mi-rae?

288
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,235
Yes. Hi.

289
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,946
Oh, my. You're so stylish.

290
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,073
Let's be friends.

291
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,660
The subtle scent of soap
that smells like baby powder.

292
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,413
This can't be from perfume.

293
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,500
She's pretty and cute.
All guys will fall in love with her.

294
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,296
Why is my heart fluttering for a girl?

295
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,423
-I know 100 good restaurants.
-Hello.

296
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,716
-Hello.
-Hi.

297
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,928
Hey, what are the girls
in first year like?

298
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,098
Take a look for yourself.
Those two are drop-dead gorgeous.

299
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,477
Those girls. Those two over there.
The one on the right and...

300
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,022
Who is that guy?

301
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,155
This year's freshmen are so good-looking.

302
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,827
-Hey, what's her name again?
-Sorry? Who?

303
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,662
Oh, that girl is...

304
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,555
Follow everyone.

00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:12,654
Today is a great day for all of you.
I'd like to congratulate everyone.

320
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,489
I'm opening an Indian restaurant
with my name.

321
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,949
LUCKY
ECONOMICS (2001 FRESHMAN)

322
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,118
And I very much enjoy my life in Korea.

323
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,912
This is all because I was able to learn

324
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,332
Korean and Korean culture
at Hankook University.

325
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,043
I wish you all happiness
and the best of luck.

326
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,302
Hello, I'm actress Lee Young-ae.

327
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,556
I'd like to congratulate all of you
on your admission.

328
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,391
LEE YOUNG-AE
German (1990 FRESHMAN)

329
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,894
A university is a place
where you can search and find

330
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,022
what you truly wish to do.

331
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,191
I hope you all enjoy your university lives

332
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:55,864
and use your time here to find
what you really wish to do in the future.

333
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,701
Once again, congratulations
on your admission to Hankook University.

334
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,871
And I hope you all enjoy your life
as university students.

335
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,081
Again, congratulations.

336
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:09,085
FRESHMAN ORIENTATION

337
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:14,966
Now, you'll all be spending time
with the students of your major.

338
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,593
Let's move to the next location.

339
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,430
You're so skinny. I envy you.

340
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,766
You're skinny too.

341
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,768
I need a normal weight to look pretty.

342
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,478
I have the body of a little kid.

343
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,688
Do you not gain weight?

344
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,733
I don't know, but I really enjoy eating.

345
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,235
Hey, he has something to say to you.

346
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,657
I was wondering
if you'd like me to carry that for you.

347
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,576
No, it's okay. Thanks, Won-ho.

348
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,996
-You remember my name?
-Of course. You're Jang Won-ho.

349
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,874
You had a nice voice
when you said hi to me earlier.

350
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,920
Do you not remember my name?

351
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,964
What are you talking about?
Of course I remember.

352
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,217
You're Sua. Hyun Sua.

353
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,803
You have good memory.

354
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:04,099
Gosh, don't waste your time.
I'm sure she's fussy about guys.

355
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,351
Are you talking about me? That's not true.

356
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,478
Everyone says that.

357
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,564
I'm telling the truth.
Why would you think that way?

358
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,024
Just bring that over.

359
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,988
Gosh, he's so good-looking.

360
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,366
He's extremely handsome.

361
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,452
What? Yes, you're right.

362
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,459
I'm Ko Ye-na, and I'm a sophomore.

363
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,880
I really like watching movies.

364
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,844
And I can always treat you to a meal,
so call me.

365
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:41,886
Next.

366
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,974
Hello, I'm Noh Min-ah, a sophomore.

367
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,270
Hello, I'm Song Jung-ho, a sophomore.

368
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,692
I'm Kim Chan-woo.
I entered this university in 2013.

369
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,903
I may be hard to approach
as I'm way older than you,

370
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,908
but you can always come to me
if you need advice.

371
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,665
Lastly, I'm Koo Tae-young,
the student president.

372
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,334
I'd like to welcome you all
to the chemistry department.

373
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,883
Now, the freshmen can start
introducing themselves.

374
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,342
Please come out.

375
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,180
-I'm so nervous to introduce myself.
-Me too.

376
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,108
I'm Do Kyung-seok.

377
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,486
Do Kyung-seok?

378
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,574
I like working out, and I like drinking.

379
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,284
Call me when you drink.

380
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,119
-You're good-looking.
-How handsome.

381
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,044
No way.
He can't be the Do Kyung-seok I know.

382
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,885
That's enough.

383
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,805
I'm really nervous.

384
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,058
Hello, I'm Hyun Sua, a freshman.

385
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,935
She's the prettiest girl.

386
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,354
She's going to be the most popular girl
this year.

387
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,566
I know it's important
to study hard as a university student,

388
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,319
but I also want to make a lot of friends.

389
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,322
I hope we can all get along well.

390
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,865
I'll become your friend.

391
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,742
Let's be good friends.

392
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,912
I have a question.
Do you have a boyfriend?

393
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,624
No, I don't. This is embarrassing,
but I've never dated anyone before.

394
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,794
-Come on. Don't lie.
-No way.

395
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,546
-Such a lie.
-Unbelievable.

396
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,130
No way. That can't be true.

397
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:45,468
The next girl is really pretty,
so I'll just end it here.

398
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,888
Mi-rae, it's your turn.

399
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,265
Me?

400
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,563
Okay, let's move
onto the next pretty girl.

401
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,106
The next pretty girl?

402
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,484
That makes it sound like
I'm as pretty as her.

403
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,449
I've never seen a girl
with plastic surgery done.

404
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,035
I like girls like her.

405
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,332
I'm so nervous.

406
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,711
Hello, I'm Kang Mi-rae.

407
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,636
I also hope that we'll all get along.

408
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,138
Do you have a boyfriend?

409
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,141
-No.
-Come on.

410
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,058
Let's be honest.

411
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,311
I really don't have one.

412
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,688
Do girls think
those kind of faces are pretty?

413
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,443
I look forward to
getting to know all of you.

414
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,575
It's nice to meet you.

415
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,661
Let's move onto the next pretty girl.

416
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:54,871
Who's next?

417
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,584
Come on. Cheers.

418
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,336
-Cheers.
-Cheers. You too.

419
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,379
Sua, which part do you like?

420
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,881
-Do you like drumsticks?
-Me?

421
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,341
Let's see. Here's one.

422
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,636
-Here you go, Sua.
-No, it's okay.

423
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,095
Can you drink, Sua?

424
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,057
Yes, I can. Let me pour you a drink first.

425
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,060
-Thanks.
-What's she doing?

426
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,480
I'll pour you a drink, too.

427
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,148
Gosh, thank you.

428
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,983
You can call me casually.

429
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,819
Give me that. I'll pour you a drink, too.

430
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:27,987
Thank you.

431
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,989
She seems to have a great personality.

432
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,241
I know. She's really friendly.

433
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,786
-Let's all clink our glasses.
-Okay.

434
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,205
-Welcome.
-Bottoms up.

435
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,083
-Cheers.
-Let's do this.

436
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,503
-What did you do after taking the CSAT?
-I had fun.

437
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,838
-With your girlfriend?
-No.

438
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,217
Don't you have a girlfriend?

439
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,886
-No.
-Did you break up with her?

440
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,638
When did you break up with her?

441
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,474
I'm not interested in girls.

442
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,811
Do you drink well?

443
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:02,063
I enjoy drinking. What about you?

444
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,838
It's him.

445
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,424
I think it's him.

446
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,429
Mi-rae, I envy you so much.

447
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,390
-What?
-Your name is as pretty as your face.

448
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,893
My name is Jung-boon. It's so tacky.

449
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,229
How am I supposed to respond to this?

450
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,189
What am I supposed to say?

451
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,400
No, you're prettier. Don't say that.

452
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:50,486
Gosh, come on. That's too big of a lie.

453
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,656
You look like an actress. Right?

454
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,075
You kind of look like an announcer, too.

455
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,247
Can you guys drink?
We should start drinking as well.

456
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,373
Okay.

457
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,625
What?

458
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,296
-What?
-What's this?

459
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,341
How dare a freshman drink water?

460
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,304
If I catch you acting all shy,
I'm going to have to scold you.

461
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,221
So manly.

462
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,265
-Let's fill our glasses.
-Let's do it.

463
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,226
Yours is empty.
Jung-boon, I'll pour you a glass.

464
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:25,772
Mi-rae, you too.

465
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,234
Here we go. Bottoms up.

466
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,325
Mi-rae,
do you really not have a boyfriend?

467
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,744
What? No.

468
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,414
Then can I be your boyfriend?

469
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,874
Pardon?

470
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,337
♪ Love, love, love ♪

471
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,379
Bam!

472
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,757
You're not as energetic as you used to be.

473
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,300
Let's all fill our glasses.

474
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,385
-Let's fill them up.
-Pour the drinks.

475
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,306
Now, it's time for the games.

476
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,102
Ready, go.

477
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,648
-Kim Sung-woon!
-Kim Sung-woon!

478
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:12,777
-Kim Sung-woon!
-Kim Sung-woon!

479
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,661
Do Kyung-seok, you can do it!

480
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,334
Wow!

481
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,753
Do Kyung-seok!

482
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,881
Even if he's that Kyung-seok,
so what?

483
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,425
He won't recognize me anyway.

484
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,137
Let's do it again.

485
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,930
Finish drinking.

486
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,310
-"Starry Night" by Mamamoo.
-"Starry Night" by Mamamoo!

487
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,437
Correct, Choi Jung-boon!

488
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,734
"Don't Know You" by Heize.

489
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,987
Me! The answer is
"Don't Know You" by Heize.

490
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,865
-Correct.
-What's with her?

491
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,041
"Road Fighter" by Sechs Kies.

492
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,877
"Road Fighter" by Sechs Kies.

493
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,923
-Bingo. Oh, my.
-My goodness.

494
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,717
My gosh, how did she know?

495
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,805
-"Bboom Bboom" by Momoland.
-"Bboong Bboong" by Momoland!

496
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,932
Again.
The pronunciation has to be precise.

497
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,392
"Bboong Bboong."

498
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,603
Wrong. It's not a fart.
What's the song?

499
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,271
"Bboom Bboom"!

500
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:34,775
Correct. Now, it's dance time, everyone!

501
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,494
-Wi-Fi.
-Correct!

502
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,414
Senior Koo Tae-young,
you got the correct answer.

503
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,836
-Final exam.
-Final exam, correct!

504
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,339
Congratulation!
Next.

505
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,634
-Me! "The pot calling the kettle black."
-Bingo!

506
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,304
Pass.

507
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,473
Gosh, wrong. Wrong answer!

508
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,644
-Mirror.
-Looks like I'm looking at myself?

509
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,524
Give me a big hand for all the hard work!

510
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,446
NATURAL SCIENCE DIVISION
AT HANKOOK UNIVERSITY

511
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,617
The winning team at the moment is...

512
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,248
Team 1 and Team 3 are
in first place together.

513
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,547
The final match will be a talent
competition between the team leaders.

514
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,220
-Me?
-Yes.

515
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,305
You guessed all the songs correctly.

516
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,557
I saw you could dance like this.

517
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:53,020
She did?
My goodness, you must've partied a lot.

518
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,774
Kang Mi-rae, you will be our team leader.

519
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,361
No, I can't do things like that.

520
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,780
-Don't worry. Just do it.
-Yes.

521
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:06,993
-Kang Mi-rae, Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae, Kang Mi-rae!

522
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,663
What should I do? They want me to dance
as the team's leader.

523
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,457
Then you must do your best
as the team leader.

524
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,959
No...

525
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,045
Why does it have to be me? Why me?

526
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,256
You're a great dancer.

527
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,591
You couldn't resist flaunting your talent.

528
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,678
Whatever happened already happened,
and you're a team leader.

529
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,430
You must give it your all.

530
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:31,392
If you get shy and don't do your best,
they will think that you're acting coy.

531
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,270
With that face,
it'll come across as so obnoxious.

532
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,523
I just want to run away.

533
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,650
Hey, Kang Mi-rae.

534
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,111
Don't be such a coward, okay?

535
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,947
Nothing will change
if you keep avoiding challenges.

536
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,742
You don't want to live like you used to.

537
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,454
You finally have the chance
to flaunt your charms, girl.

538
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,497
Show them what you've got.

539
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,127
Will I...

540
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,465
be able to do a good job?

541
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,842
Of course. You're my friend after all.

542
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,428
Go and have as much fun as you want.

543
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:11,766
"This is how you should dance.
I am Kang Mi-rae, the dancing queen."

544
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,392
Show them what you can do.

545
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,983
I have to go.

546
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:26,155
Hey, actually, I have to rap
as a leader of my team as well.

547
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,784
Let's talk later. Peace.

548
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,034
KANG MI-RAE

549
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,222
I wanted to show people

550
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,807
that I can do a good job too.

551
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,046
I wanted to show everyone.

552
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,173
-Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae!

553
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,883
Like everyone else,

554
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,886
I wanted to be loved.

555
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,889
-Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae!

556
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,432
I wanted to

557
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,228
be loved in an ordinary way.

558
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,231
-Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae!

559
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,152
For Mi-rae!

560
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,404
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

561
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,447
Gosh, Mi-rae is so cool.

562
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,913
Mi-rae, you're awesome.
You're like an idol singer.

563
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:07,543
-Were you in a dance club?
-No, I practiced alone by watching TV.

564
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,837
It's even more impressive then.

565
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:13,674
Whatever. Let's drink a shot
with our arms crossed, Mi-rae.

566
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,556
-Do it.
-Do it.

567
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,808
-Do it.
-Hurry.

568
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,519
-Do it.
-Do it.

569
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,314
-Do it.
-Do it.

570
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,608
Here. Like this.

571
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,569
Mi-rae of the chemistry department is
our MVP!

572
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,612
Mi-rae.

573
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,616
It seems like
she's too drunk to drink.

574
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,327
Please excuse me.

575
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,332
How dare she try to act weak
in front of her senior?

576
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,501
How about we do it together instead?

577
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:50,878
Oh, no.

578
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,281
I wish they wouldn't make me drink.

579
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:45,099
-Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae!

580
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:49,186
-Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae!

581
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,882
Hi, Mom.

582
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,635
What's wrong? Did something happen?

583
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,848
Mom...

584
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,940
Nothing.

585
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,735
I'm having fun.

586
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:42,322
People like me, Mom.

587
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,870
I got startled. I thought
something happened to you.

588
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:49,830
Really?

589
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,042
I'm happy that you're having fun.

590
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:01,550
I'm getting a call.
Have fun. I'll call you again later.

591
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,740
Gosh, I shouldn't cry,
or my eyes will get red.

592
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,763
You're really good at drinking.
Did you start in high school?

593
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,227
That's cool.

594
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,941
Don't you think it's a little hot in here?

595
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,860
How about we go out for some fresh air?

596
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,112
You can go alone.

597
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,539
Where are you going?

598
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,124
To get some fresh air.

599
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,047
He's chic.

600
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,434
You were really good at drinking
back there.

601
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,652
Sorry.

602
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,487
I think I'm drunk.

603
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,618
I'm so foolish, don't you think?

604
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,246
I get drunk after only a few shots.

605
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,625
Excuse me.

606
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,132
Does anyone have anything to sober her up?

607
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,259
She says she's drunk.

608
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,307
-Sua.
-Drink this.

609
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,559
-It's best for sobering up.
-Get on my back.

610
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,145
-I'll carry you on my back.
-It's really effective.

611
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,104
Drink this.

612
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:08,779
What are you doing?

613
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:09,947
FROM: HYUN-JUNG

614
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,114
I'm outside.

615
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,201
They keep telling me to drink
when I'm in there.

616
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,622
Do you remember Do Kyung-seok?

617
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,707
In our department...

618
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,167
Oh my gosh!

619
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,045
Hello?

620
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,139
Hello?

621
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,311
Hello?

622
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,231
I'm sure I called my daughter's number.

623
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:46,817
Who's there?

624
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,860
Oh, well...

625
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,157
I'm Mi-rae's senior.

626
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,579
I see.
Why do you have her phone by the way?

627
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,039
Well, that's...

628
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,503
Freshmen are not allowed to use
their phones during the event.

629
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,547
So we collected them for the time being.

630
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,882
Oh, I see.

631
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,885
-I'm sorry.
-Not at all.

632
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:16,930
I'm sorry.

633
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,307
It's okay.
Well, goodbye then.

634
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,188
Dad...

635
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,324
You're home early.
Have you eaten dinner?

636
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,580
What's wrong? Did something happen?

637
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,499
She was just like Mi-rae.

638
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,671
Did you talk to her on the phone?

639
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:53,300
She looked pretty with round eyes
and a sharp nose.

640
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,803
Well, that's...

641
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,057
Ever since she graduated middle school,

642
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,101
she wanted to do a plastic surgery
on her eyelids.

643
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,144
What?

644
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,813
She got so stressed out
because of her face.

645
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,523
There you go again.

646
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:12,486
What's wrong with her face
that you keep stirring up her mind?

647
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,071
I already said no.

648
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,699
Did I mishear because I miss my daughter?

649
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,577
Her female senior took my call.

650
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,997
Her voice sounded exactly like Mi-rae's.

651
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,583
No way.

652
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,253
She should've visited us first.

653
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,923
Why did she have to go straight
to the orientation?

654
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:49,815
Are you okay?

655
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,650
What?

656
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:55,445
Well...

657
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,990
I'm okay.

658
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,451
I just feel a little sick.

659
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,080
Drink this.

660
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,001
Thank you.

661
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,223
Do you want to go rest
if you're too drunk?

662
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,017
You might have to drink again
if you go back inside.

663
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,436
There's a lounge with a sofa over there.

664
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,232
Is there a place like that?

665
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,776
Thank you.

666
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,789
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

667
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,555
I should get some rest, too.

668
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,481
Why are you standing there? Sit down.

669
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,110
Okay.

670
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,170
Aren't you uncomfortable?

671
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,506
Sit down here comfortably.

672
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:21,841
I'm okay.

673
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,637
Why? Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

674
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,223
Should we switch?
I'll sit over there.

675
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,141
No, there's no need.

676
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:32,560
Then I'll sit here.

677
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,505
You're very pretty.

678
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,928
Are you okay?

679
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,097
I'm okay.

680
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,352
I'm curious.

681
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,105
Do you really not have a boyfriend?

682
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,067
-No.
-Why?

683
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,447
I just don't have one.

684
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,032
I see.

685
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,832
Then is it okay if  I like you?

686
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,501
Looking at you playing games
and dancing earlier,

687
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,129
I fell in love.

688
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,553
Is this a confession?

689
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,849
Don't think too seriously about it though.

690
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,688
Oh, right.

691
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,443
People might look for me
if I stay gone for too long.

692
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,323
Who?

693
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,372
No one else is more interested
in you than I am.

694
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,921
They're busy having fun,

695
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,215
so don't bother.

696
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:39,813
Hey.

697
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,941
Help me up already!

698
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,493
What are you doing?

699
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:54,911
What are you doing?

700
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,541
It's none of your business.

701
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,045
You came this way,
so I wondered what kind of place it was.

702
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,258
What do you mean? It's no special place.

703
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:12,595
She seemed too drunk, so I took her
so that she could rest for a while.

704
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,142
Why did you open the door
when I was leaning on it?

705
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,979
You were blocking the door.

706
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:26,693
Are you drunk?

707
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,779
Look at you being rude to your senior.

708
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,830
I'm letting it go
because you're drunk, all right?

709
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:44,961
Mi-rae. Let's go.

710
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,736
Are you okay?

711
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,824
Yes, I'm good.

712
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,667
Rest here if you want to.

713
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,887
Kang Mi-rae.

714
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,529
By any chance,

715
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,824
did you go to Jaryong Middle School?

716
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:08,753
What?

717
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,898
Kyung-seok treats you differently
from others.

718
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,441
Do you go out with him?

719
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,652
-She's already so famous.
-She's so pretty.

720
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,653
Mi-rae.

721
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,573
You and Mi-rae might get along
with each other very well,

722
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,199
though I feel a little bad.

723
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,034
I haven't done any plastic surgery.

724
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,703
Mi-rae hasn't either.

725
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:42,996
You think it's funny?

726
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,539
Do you go to this university?

727
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,207
I'm your daughter, Mi-rae.

728
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,710
Gosh, you plastic monster.

729
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,461
What have I done?

730
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:53,339
Do you have a crush on him?

731
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,846
