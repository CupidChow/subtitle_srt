1
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,631
Take it easy. Have a good day.

2
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,719
Take it easy.

3
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,767
Why did they send you?

4
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,602
-A little higher.
-Is this good?

5
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,895
FUN TIMES WITH CHEMISTRY

6
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,271
A little higher.

7
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,356
This is the pub of chemistry department.

8
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,984
Come visit our pub!

9
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:08,985
Come visit us!

10
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,695
We've prepared many fun things.

11
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,447
Everyone, come visit us!

12
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,449
We'll have food, too.

13
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,659
What's taking the girls so long?

14
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,829
-They're getting ready.
-Gosh, I can't wait to see them.

15
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,044
I wish I was born as a pretty girl
so that I could just take orders.

16
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,228
That's the uniform?

17
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,231
-I don't like it.
-Me, neither.

18
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,691
You picked the design with them.

19
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,151
BASED ON THE WEBCOMINC
MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY BY KI MAENG-GI

20
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,071
Well, Jung-yeob and Jung-ho said
it was nice, so I just went along with it.

21
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,491
The skirt looked a bit longer
on the photo.

22
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,578
What do you think?
Will you be okay?

23
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm a bit...

24
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,542
You don't like it?

25
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,294
Let's not wear this
if she doesn't like it.

26
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,587
Why are you putting it on me?

27
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,214
Are we allowed to not wear it?

28
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,842
What are you doing?
It'll begin soon.

29
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,803
Our bar will be packed.

30
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,305
You girls look exactly as I imagined.

31
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,558
None of us imagined this.

32
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,686
Is it a bit too short?

33
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,730
It's not.
I've seen many girls in skirts like this.

34
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,067
What should we do?

35
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,861
You all look great in it.

36
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,445
Stand right there.

37
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,533
I'll take a nice photo of you
to remember this moment.

38
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,450
Strike a pose.

39
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,035
-Customers will be...
-Come on.

40
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,913
All right, 1, 2.
Smile, please.

41
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,290
Here we go.
1, 2.

42
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,876
You all look gorgeous.
All right, one more time.

43
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,419
1, 2.

44
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,382
Oh, the chemistry department?
I'll definitely come by.

45
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,968
I wonder which bar has the hottest guys.

46
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,554
A pancake
and a serving of assorted skewers.

47
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,556
-A pancake and assorted skewers?
-Yes.

48
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,057
-Sure.
-Water, please.

49
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,767
Sure. Just a moment, please.

50
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,729
-Anything else you need?
-No, we're good.

51
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,647
-Your food will be out soon.
-Okay.

52
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,817
Excuse me. We'd like a pancake.

53
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,694
Sure, I'll bring it over shortly.

54
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,572
Hey, we already ordered one
just a minute ago.

55
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,451
-Another pancake.
-To tell you the truth...

56
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,369
I was going to tell you. Gosh.

57
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,997
-Actually, this was the reason.
-Seriously.

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,291
-Because of this?
-You always...

59
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,501
Jung-boon has many guy friends.

60
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,254
She knows a lot of people.

61
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,089
She knows everyone from her school.

62
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,762
Oh, boy. Why do you even live?

63
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,934
I've never had a guy friend in my life.

64
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,772
Excuse me, where can we sit?

65
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,357
Oh, this way...

66
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,113
Hey, Kang Orc.

67
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,241
I'm calling you, Kang Orc.

68
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,702
You don't know your nickname?

69
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,204
You're lying, right?

70
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,789
Tell me that it's a lie!

71
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,250
-Yong-Cheol.
-Kang Orc.

72
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,794
I'll kill you if you tell anybody
that you like me.

73
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,545
You'd better not tell anyone.

74
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,215
I didn't think...

75
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,343
I'd see him ever again.

76
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,269
-Hey, you made it.
-Yes, hi.

77
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,313
-Is he your friend?
-Yes, my new friend.

78
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,564
Through Instagram.

79
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,945
The pretty friend I mentioned.
You saw her in my photo.

80
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,283
Park Yong-cheol and his friends.

81
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,076
Kang Mi-rae and Lee Ji-hyo.

82
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,744
Hi, nice to meet you.

83
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,791
Nice to meet you.
I should get back to work.

84
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,376
Kang Mi-rae?

85
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,170
What's wrong?

86
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,089
I know someone with the same name.

87
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,258
Really? A friend of yours?

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,385
My middle school alumna.

89
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,267
Have a seat here.

90
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,162
-Did you call the police?
-I did, as I was firing her.

91
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,831
I feel too apologetic towards Jung-boon.

92
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,791
You should apologize to her then.

93
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,878
I mean, I feel too sorry to apologize.

94
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,880
Then apologize
for being really sorry.

95
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,466
Let's go.

96
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,426
Go where?

97
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,471
Our department's bar.
Jung-boon should be there.

98
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,931
Will you be with me?

99
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,642
-Are you a kid?
-Gosh.

100
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,979
What are you doing? Let's go.

101
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,732
So which school do you go to?

102
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,444
I'm studying psychology
at Hankook University.

103
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,491
Psychology at Hankook University?
Your grades must've been very high.

104
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,408
Gosh, no.

105
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,079
By the way, why didn't you choose
practical music?

106
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,958
I'm a huge fan of Tiger JK.

107
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,544
I saw him on a TV show, and he said

108
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:23,216
he recommends choosing something else
for your major if you want to be a rapper.

109
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,812
Tiger JK, she's a huge fan of yours.

110
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,939
-Hello.
-Hello.

111
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,902
She's a student,
but she wants to be a rapper.

112
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,071
I asked her to come by.

113
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,323
Okay, then could you show us?

114
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:48,699
Sure.

115
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,457
-Ready?
-Yes.

116
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,834
I'll drop the beat.

117
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,835
Okay.

118
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,850
I wear mismatching shoes
And I start running backwards

119
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,726
People tell me I'm imperfect

120
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,854
But no, I'm perfect

121
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,648
I have my own way of survival...

122
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,819
A life that's lacking is imperfect...

123
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,322
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,658
It's okay.
Give it a try one more time.

125
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,662
Okay, I'm sorry.
I should've practiced a bit more.

126
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,997
I'll try one more time.

127
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,832
-One more time, let's go.
-Let's go.

128
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,044
Here's the beat.

129
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,440
-That's why you can't do it.
-Gosh.

130
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,195
Jung-boon, can we talk for a minute?

131
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,696
Do you know him?

132
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,406
-Who is he?
-Who is he?

133
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,117
-Is there something wrong?
-No, I'll be right back.

134
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,285
Don't take too long.

135
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,286
Excuse me.

136
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,579
Let's drink.

137
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,539
-Cheers.
-He's out of alcohol.

138
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,416
Pour him a drink.

139
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,834
You're better-looking.

140
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,631
Tae-young, I have something to tell you.

141
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,593
-What is it?
-I'm not feeling so well.

142
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,929
Can I take a short break?

143
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,430
Do you feel sick?

144
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,059
-I'm just a little tired.
-Oh, really?

145
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,103
Someone will have to take your place.

146
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,440
I'll do it.

147
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,155
Kyung-seok?
I thought you didn't want to.

148
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,448
I'll take your place.

149
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,539
I guess you're loyal after all.

150
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,042
Huh? He said he wasn't going to come,
but he did.

151
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,753
You said you didn't want to do it.

152
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,880
Are you here as a customer?

153
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,132
No, I'm here to serve.

154
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,384
Glad you're here.

155
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,302
He is not too disloyal, I guess.

156
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,391
-Let's go.
-It smells here.

157
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,524
-Are there green onions in here?
-Green onions?

158
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,695
What if Yong-cheol recognizes Kyung-seok?

159
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,618
Is he in your major?

160
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,870
Who? Kyung-seok?

161
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,999
-He used to go to my middle school.
-Really?

162
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,834
Mi-rae wen to the same one as well.

163
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,545
Oh, the pretty girl you saw earlier.

164
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,047
Mi-rae and Kyung-seok are
from the same middle school.

165
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,521
Do you feel sick?

166
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,985
No, I'm just tired.

167
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,280
Thank you.
I'm going to go get some rest.

168
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,906
Mi-rae.

169
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,242
Just a second.

170
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,244
What? Why?

171
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,079
Kyung-seok.

172
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,459
Can you help me carry this? It's so heavy.

173
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,253
Hey, I'll carry it for you.
You shouldn't.

174
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,463
Kyung-seok.

175
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,800
Hello. Do you need anything?

176
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,430
-Since when were you friends with her?
-He's so manly.

177
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,688
Yong-cheol went to the same school as you.

178
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,488
Are you Kang Mi-rae
from Jaryong Middle School?

179
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:00,868
Yes.

180
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,828
I'm Park Yong-cheol.
You remember me?

181
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,498
Yes.

182
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,958
So you guys do know each other.

183
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,627
This is so cool.

184
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,632
-What a joke.
-Why?

185
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,842
What? No, it's nothing.

186
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,432
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,894
You took that thief's side
and treated me like a liar.

188
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,522
To be honest,
I don't really know you that well.

189
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,483
Then how well did you know her?

190
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,778
I'm too naive to make the right judgments.

191
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,656
I couldn't see what a brat she was.
You're so nice...

192
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,327
Gosh, I'm such a stupid jerk.

193
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,871
I'm the one to blame.
I shouldn't have done that.

194
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,753
You just laughed, didn't you?
I think I saw you laugh.

195
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,384
Thank you so much.

196
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,469
And I'm sorry.

197
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,597
People can make mistakes.

198
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,099
Will you forgive me, then?

199
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,685
Well, you keep apologizing,

200
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,978
so I should forgive you.

201
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,733
My gosh, I seriously had trouble
breathing earlier.

202
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,776
I can finally breathe now.

203
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,486
Thank you.

204
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,113
And I'm sorry.

205
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,176
You guys must be really glad
to see each other.

206
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,261
What a small world.

207
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,347
I should've been nicer to you
if I knew you'd become pretty.

208
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,349
My gosh.

209
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,019
Are you guys not working?

210
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,105
Just give us a minute.
They're from the same school.

211
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,358
That's so cool. How amazing.

212
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,237
I hope you guys all have a great time.

213
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,201
I hope you guys have fun.

214
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,286
Do you still hate me?

215
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:09,914
Kyung-seok.

216
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,793
I heard he went to the same middle school
as you.

217
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,464
Did you do something wrong?

218
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,176
I can already guess what happened.
He must've had crush on her.

219
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,762
It was actually the opposite.
She liked me a lot.

220
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,350
Have you gone mad?

221
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,935
She told me that she liked me.

222
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,561
Didn't you?

223
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,858
You should go now.

224
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,778
How can you tell me to leave?
I'm a customer.

225
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,447
-Just leave.
-Come on, I'm really glad to meet...

226
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,076
-Kang Orc again.
-Hey.

227
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,328
-She's the orc?
-She's the orc?

228
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,795
-She's the orc I told you about.
-Hey!

229
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,430
Follow me.

230
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,433
I just talked about the good old days.
Are you upset?

231
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,064
-Yong-cheol.
-I said, follow me.

232
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,692
How scary. Hey, Mi-rae.

233
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,528
Don't flatter yourself.

234
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,035
Yes.

235
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,707
After I changed, I could finally see...

236
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,793
that people like you were worthless jerks.

237
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,420
What?

238
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,800
You didn't change at all.

239
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,347
You look down on people
based on their looks and harass them.

240
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,644
You better remember this
every time you remember "Kang Orc."

241
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,230
To me, you were just...

242
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,816
a piece of trash.

243
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,444
What did you say?

244
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,085
Hey, you totally ruined the mood.

245
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,422
Hey, wait.

246
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,258
Hey, scumbag.

247
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,597
-What?
-Scumbag.

248
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,684
Pay for your food.

249
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,896
Shit.

250
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,484
Sua, I'll call you again later.

251
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,196
How could you do that to your old friend?

252
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,552
It was a failure.

253
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,847
What's wrong with your voice, by the way?

254
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,849
What?

255
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,811
Who? Park Yong-cheol?

256
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,897
Why did he come all of a sudden?

257
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,818
How many surgeries did she do
that he didn't even recognize her?

258
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,778
Didn't Kyung-seok recognize her?

259
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:32,491
No, come to think of it,
he didn't recognize her at first either.

260
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,202
So nothing on her face is original?

261
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,872
It must've changed
because she got surgeries.

262
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,919
Did she not recognize Yong-cheol either?
Or did she act like she didn't know?

263
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,465
Anyway, it's the worst nickname
I've ever heard of.

264
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,467
How could he call her orc?

265
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,435
She's the orc I told you about.

266
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,479
Don't flatter yourself.

267
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,649
My face may change,

268
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,360
but my past never changes.

269
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,653
Mi-rae.

270
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:26,253
I shouldn't have invited people
I barely knew.

271
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,675
They came to see me at the cafe I work at,

272
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,678
so I only invited them to the festival.

273
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,973
I didn't know he was such a jerk.

274
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,350
Sorry.

275
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,020
It's not your fault.

276
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,355
No, I'm really sorry.

277
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,901
This wouldn't have happened
if it hadn't been for me.

278
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,655
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

279
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,699
I want to worry about it.

280
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,661
I want to be better to you.

281
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,292
You see,

282
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,962
I actually had a prejudice...

283
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,215
about plastic surgeries.

284
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,595
Why would they want to become prettier
than others that much?

285
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,347
I thought it was too vain.

286
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,976
But I realized...

287
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,147
that some people could be desperate
for it.

288
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,861
That some might be in pain
due to their faces.

289
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,161
Do you think you can go back and work?

290
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,748
I'll tell Tae-young
if you think you can't.

291
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,220
I can't see Sua anymore because of you.

292
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,681
Why can't we?
We can see her without him.

293
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,100
Guys, you are excluding me
just for a girl?

294
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,310
Hey, Park Yong-cheol.

295
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,650
You remember me?

296
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,443
Oh Hyun-jung, Mi-rae's friend.

297
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,487
So what?

298
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,324
I just can't understand
why you showed up here.

299
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,535
You bullied her enough in middle school.

300
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,371
I had no idea.
I only came because Sua invited me.

301
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,792
Why would she invite someone like you?

302
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,045
Hey, she asked me to be friends first.

303
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,548
She visited my Instagram
and liked my pictures.

304
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,133
You saw it too, right?

305
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,342
Hold on.

306
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,055
See?

307
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,103
COMMENTS

308
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,444
So she left?

309
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,989
I told her to go
and that I'd explain to you.

310
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,325
It can't be helped then.

311
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,036
But I have to go
to my part-time job now, too.

312
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:04,953
Really?

313
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,499
Can you walk around the school
to promote our bar before you go?

314
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,335
Okay, thank you.

315
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,920
-Thanks.
-Tae-young.

316
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,504
I think I have to go, too.

317
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,798
Who's going to serve then?

318
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,343
I mean, think about it.

319
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,511
It should be done by the girls.

320
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,308
Park Yong-cheol, that guy is really weird.

321
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,811
How could he say such a thing
to an old friend?

322
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,605
It's upsetting.

323
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,982
COME VISIT THE CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT BAR

324
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,150
You brought him here.

325
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,738
I didn't know he'd be like that.

326
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,451
Who on earth came up with that nickname?

327
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,995
How could they do that to a girl?

328
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,290
She wouldn't have been that ugly.

329
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,418
She was cute.

330
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,425
Mi-rae was cute.

331
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,776
I actually had a prejudice...

332
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,861
about plastic surgeries.

333
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,656
But I realized...

334
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,660
that some people could be
desperate for it.

335
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,997
That some might be in pain
due to their faces.

336
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,132
MS. NA HYE-SUNG

337
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,722
Hello, ma'am.

338
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,266
I got the candles.

339
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,101
My employees said

340
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,478
their scent was amazing.

341
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,024
What are you doing right now?

342
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,734
I have time right now.

343
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,903
No, not in front of the school.

344
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,239
I'll go to your company.

345
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,663
Okay. Then I'll go to your house.

346
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,833
Okay.

347
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,722
-Did Ye-na leave?
-She left for her appointment.

348
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,558
The okay-looking girl left.

349
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,019
Make the boys do the job instead.

350
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:37,147
Girls should serve at the bar.
No one's interested if guys do.

351
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,649
We should be enough.
It's almost over.

352
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,569
Not every girl can be considered
a real woman.

353
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,823
It would've been nice if you prepared
for a situation like this like I advised.

354
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,786
Even if we put the uniform aside,
your looks aren't qualified.

355
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,789
What did you say?

356
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,042
You first have to grow your hair
to look like a girl, Yoon-byul.

357
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,086
And I told you to lose weight.

358
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,672
And you should smile a bit.
Girls should do that.

359
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,591
Who are you to order me around?

360
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,967
Don't talk back, freshman.

361
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,471
I quit.

362
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,724
-Make food like you've been doing.
-I won't do that either.

363
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,977
-I won't do anything. Don't look for me.
-Where are you going?

364
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,523
Why do I have to do this
and put up with your crap?

365
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,901
I can't take your stupid remarks anymore.

366
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,404
Do you think we can't criticize you?

367
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,365
I simply didn't want to stoop
as low as you.

368
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,909
-Ugly punks.
-What?

369
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,869
-Let's go.
-Guys.

370
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,081
-What's wrong?
-They've suddenly become sensitive.

371
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,250
They're getting mad at our jokes.

372
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,544
Did we ever tell you that you're ugly?

373
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,254
I only gave you suggestions!

374
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,965
Stop it!
We don't want to hear your suggestions.

375
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,968
What's with you, Tae-hee?

376
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,806
"You'll look pretty when you lose weight"?
Are you saying that I'm a loser this way?

377
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,849
No...

378
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,977
"Do plastic surgeries, grow hair,
change your style, lose weight."

379
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,147
Should we get back at you the same?
You'll make all the fuss.

380
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,983
How could you twist his good intention?

381
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,485
He only meant
your face looks cute and pretty.

382
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,196
I didn't ask you to say that I'm pretty.

383
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,908
We're not products on display.
You judge us by our looks.

384
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,080
Keep such thoughts to yourselves.
How dare you say that bluntly to us?

385
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,208
I'm out, too.

386
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,668
I told you to stay put.

387
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,046
So do I have to do everything I'm told?

388
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,299
Who are you to order us around?

389
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,925
Let's quit and leave.

390
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,971
Hey. Goodness.

391
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,848
Hey.

392
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:40,937
I told them out of concern, and how could
they behave this way to their senior--

393
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,898
-Stop it.
-Think about their attitude.

394
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,899
That's enough.

395
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,277
Where are you going?

396
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,292
I'm sorry.

397
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,128
I should've scolded them earlier.

398
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,924
I let it slide because things were hectic
with the festival.

399
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,801
Sorry.

400
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,224
Please don't be upset.

401
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,518
You know what's more irritating?

402
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,898
I keep trying to fit myself
in their standards unconsciously.

403
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,234
I always tell myself to lose weight.

404
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,902
You don't need to.

405
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:33,198
They're doing that to see you flustered.
It is fun for them.

406
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,577
Besides, I don't like girls
who are too skinny.

407
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,709
There are many men who like
cute, chubby girls like you, like me.

408
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,635
Well, I'm not just talking about looks.

409
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,513
The way you talk and behave.
You're cute in many ways.

410
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,558
Anyway, you don't need to change.

411
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,227
Don't let it stress you out.

412
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,316
Feel better now?

413
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:10,944
I'll go, then.

414
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,068
Where are you?

415
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,991
I've always wanted to sit here
and eat ice cream,

416
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,745
but doing that alone would look weird.
I mean, this isn't coffee.

417
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,163
Right.

418
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,461
The favor I asked you
must've stressed you out.

419
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,004
I'm sorry.

420
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,381
No, it's okay.

421
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,009
I really wanted to do it for you,

422
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,720
but I couldn't persuade Kyung-seok.

423
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,598
Is everything well with him?

424
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,393
Yes, I think so.

425
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,229
Are you two close?

426
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,774
Yes, I guess...

427
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,859
we are pretty close.

428
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,320
We went to the same middle school, too.

429
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,321
Did you?

430
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,241
Which one? He transferred schools
during his middle school years.

431
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,161
Jaryong Middle School.

432
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,873
You have known each other since then.

433
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,544
We did know of each other,

434
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,963
but we weren't close back then.

435
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:00,053
What was he like in middle school?

436
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,971
He was very popular.

437
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,765
Was he?

438
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,851
He's very handsome, you know.

439
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,980
I guess I'm not the only person
who thinks that.

440
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,778
I saw him once from far away
when he was in middle school.

441
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,489
Only once...

442
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,283
for a brief moment.

443
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,370
I could see how much he had grown.

444
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,414
And he's all grown up now.

445
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,506
I actually met you
when I was in middle school.

446
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,633
Me?

447
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,593
Yes.

448
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,262
When?

449
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,807
You may not remember it though.

450
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:52,731
Even if you remember me from that day,
you won't recognize my face.

451
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,820
I had plastic surgery.

452
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,739
I got everything done.

453
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,203
By the way, where did we meet?

454
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,958
That day, I was so upset.

455
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,882
To tell you the truth,
I had a tough time growing up...

456
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,050
because of my face.

457
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,597
Even I thought...

458
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,017
that no one could be uglier than me.

459
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,937
Even I thought
that I looked like a monster.

460
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,176
Hey.

461
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,929
Are you having a hard time?

462
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,473
My classmates...

463
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,559
say that I'm too ugly.

464
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,649
They call me an orc.

465
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,069
They say that my face is worse
than garbage.

466
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,022
That must be so hard.

467
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,031
No matter what they say,

468
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,911
you are the most precious person
to yourself.

469
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,917
That's when I learned...

470
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,212
that kind words and nice scents...

471
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,673
can even save someone's life.

472
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,135
I remember.

473
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,013
You were that girl.

474
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,431
Why didn't you tell me?

475
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:36,352
You said you started to like perfume
because of the intangible beauty,

476
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,063
but my face is...

477
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,401
You've become much prettier.

478
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,282
Are things better now?

479
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,117
Are you okay?

480
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,916
I thought I'd be okay.

481
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,211
Anyone can tell
that I had some work done...

482
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,342
Why do you say that?
You look very pretty now.

483
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,927
You are beautiful.

484
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:15,266
It's embarrassing to hear that
from such a gorgeous lady like you.

485
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:19,979
You see,

486
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,110
I think my life could've been much easier

487
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,657
had I been born less pretty.

488
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,414
Did that sound obnoxious?

489
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,709
No, not at all.
I'm just not following.

490
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,340
I liked it when I was young

491
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,592
because everyone said I looked pretty.

492
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,804
-That's Hye-sung.
-Isn't she pretty?

493
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,264
The prettiest girl in our school.

494
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,016
Not just in our school.

495
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,061
-She's the prettiest in our town.
-Why are you so pretty?

496
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,021
My gosh, she's really stunning.

497
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,147
I know...

498
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,276
Girls envying me and guys being nice to me

499
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,362
were just something I was used to
in my life.

500
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,532
There's this saying, you know.

501
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,035
"A beautiful woman is like someone
who passed the 3 major national exams."

502
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,415
Beauty certainly gives women power.

503
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,792
People respect you wherever you go.

504
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,585
Hye-sung.

505
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:32,844
And that's why I thought
the world would be my oyster.

506
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,890
I was confident that I'd succeed
in both my career and love.

507
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,809
Ms. Na,

508
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,395
do you have a boyfriend?

509
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:43,980
She must have many.

510
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,607
Guys are lining up to get a date with her.

511
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,445
I know a very competent young man.
He's from a great family as well.

512
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,487
What do you say?

513
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:59,370
My husband had the best qualifications
out of all the guys I had dated,

514
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,330
and his family was rich and powerful.

515
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,292
My parents were fond of him as well.

516
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,254
If women are flowers,

517
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,674
you are the most beautiful flower...

518
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,010
I've ever seen.

519
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,098
"A beautiful flower".

520
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:24,645
Back then, I had no idea that those words
would end up shackling me down.

521
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:35,740
So did you have to quit your job
back then?

522
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,493
Yes, I did.

523
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:43,456
It was very hard for me
to get to where I am now.

524
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,875
I see.

525
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,003
I was wrong, too.

526
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:53,091
When people complimented my looks,
I thought they respected me.

527
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,721
I thought that I should be
able to have my way with any man.

528
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,016
I was foolish.

529
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,565
So you should try to date many guys.

530
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,985
And choose your husband wisely.

531
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,779
Got it?

532
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,449
Yes.

533
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,538
Jung-yeob, give us some sausages.

534
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,873
Hang on a moment.

535
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,252
What did you say
to make the girls all leave?

536
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,046
Are you seriously asking me that
right now?

537
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,137
Tae-young, what are we going to do
tomorrow without the girls?

538
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,889
We'll just have to do it by ourselves.

539
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,435
Sua, Ji-hyo.
Did the guys text you?

540
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,148
Yes, they asked
if I could make it tomorrow,

541
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,108
but I'm not available.

542
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,860
Me, neither.

543
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,779
We should let them struggle by themselves.

544
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,407
But that's not enough.
I'm still angry.

545
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,575
Should we take revenge?

546
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,909
Let's do that.

547
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,369
How?

548
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,631
Why did you come so late?
Where have you been?

549
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,508
-Well.
-Look at this.

550
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,219
What is it?
Did you take a photo with that rapper?

551
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,431
No, that's not it.
It's something important.

552
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,101
Sua commented on
Yong-cheol's social media page.

553
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,478
Do you see the time?

554
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,899
And he replied to Sua...

555
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,776
two hours later.

556
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,905
That means she contacted him first.

557
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:45,328
Look. His profile shows
which schools he went to.

558
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,954
Isn't something weird?

559
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,836
Do you think Sua did this on purpose
to harass you?

560
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,591
Come on. That's absurd.

561
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,323
COMMENTS

562
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,117
YOU LOOK GREAT

563
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,915
MOM

564
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,128
Hi, Mom.

565
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,381
I'm going to your place
to bring some food.

566
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,966
You can go to school.

567
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,010
You don't have class?

568
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,846
Then I'll get to see you today.

569
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,682
She's staying at home today.

570
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,063
Dad's going to go with me.
I can't carry all these by myself.

571
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,571
Welcome.

572
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,657
We already have so much food. Please.

573
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,702
We never got a cake for Mi-rae
after she got into college.

574
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,037
Come here and help me pick a cake.

575
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:19,213
I want this one.
The pretty one right here, please.

576
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,798
No.

577
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,759
We'll take the biggest one here.

578
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,018
I told you we should drive here.

579
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,896
Take a look around.
There's nowhere to park here.

580
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,483
It's just so heavy. That's all.

581
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,613
Shall I help you carry that?

582
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,325
No, it's okay.

583
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,119
Let me help.
Where are you headed?

584
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,205
We're going way over there.

585
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,124
Way over there?

586
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,879
-My gosh.
-Oh, it's heavy.

587
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,133
-Over there?
-Yes. Thank you.

588
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,302
Thanks.

589
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,013
-Come on.
-Yes.

590
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,478
It's right there.

591
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,104
Oh, okay.

592
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,567
-I'll get you something to drink.
-No.

593
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,402
You should go inside.

594
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,197
-My gosh.
-Thank you.

595
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,074
-Thank you.
-No problem.

596
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,661
My gosh, he's good-looking
and nice at the same time.

597
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,332
I hope we get a son-in-law like him.

598
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,626
Gosh, let's go inside. I'm so tired.

599
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,216
You brought a lot more
than I expected.

600
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,718
Ms. Na, it feels like Thanksgiving.

601
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,013
We should've taken you
to a nice restaurant.

602
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,892
It's our first meal together
since Mi-rae got into college.

603
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,020
Hurry up and eat.
The kids must be starving.

604
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,230
Okay.

605
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,774
You picked the biggest cake.

606
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,613
Thank you, Dad.

607
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,366
Yes, don't mention it.

608
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,326
Hyun-jung must be hungry.

609
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,412
-Let's blow the candle.
-Okay.

610
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,499
Please let these girls have a great time
in college.

611
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,335
1, 2, 3.

612
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,383
Thank you.

613
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,593
Let's eat.

614
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,805
Wait.

615
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,309
You don't have a photo at the entrance
ceremony, so you should take one.

616
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,436
You're right.

617
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,856
If I had a son, I would've made you
become my daughter-in-law.

618
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,941
-Would you?
-Yes.

619
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,484
Go sit over there.

620
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,986
Everyone, gather together.

621
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,446
Come here.

622
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:52,616
I think you guys should sit on the sofa.
It'll look way better.

623
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,744
Mr. Kang, sit closer to Mi-rae.

624
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,914
-Yes.
-A little closer.

625
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,416
That's nice.

626
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,751
Mr. Kang, I want you to give me
a big smile.

627
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,921
Okay. In 1, 2, 3.

628
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,673
Now, that's a nice photo.

629
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,842
In 1, 2, 3.

630
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,971
Look over here, Mr. Kang.
In 1, 2, 3.

631
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,766
Are you guys having fun?

632
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,685
Let's take a photo.

633
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,981
-Everyone, he's here.
-Hello.

634
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,609
-You're great.
-Thank you.

635
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,568
My goodness.

636
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,987
Hello, everyone.

637
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,531
-We're going to take a photo.
-Okay.

638
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,408
Okay, now.

639
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,160
Ma'am, you must be exhausted.

640
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,204
You should get on his back.

641
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,165
-He's right. Come on.
-Get on his back.

642
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,208
That's nice.

643
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,919
That looks nice.
You are like mother and son.

644
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,463
That looks perfect.
Everyone, smile.

645
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,132
Okay, I'm going to take a photo now.
In 1, 2, 3.

646
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:54,261
Let's take one more photo.
In 1, 2--

647
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,848
My gosh.

648
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,393
I hope you stay healthy.
I love you, ma'am.

649
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,062
Eat up, everyone.

650
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:07,233
Enjoy your food.
Thank you, everyone.

651
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,401
Let's go.

652
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,862
I just got a report from my junior.

653
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,656
She hasn't done anything yet.

654
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:19,119
She met up with a female student.
But they just had ice cream together.

655
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:26,544
Ms. Na has a very tight schedule, and
he's having trouble following her around.

656
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:33,634
Instead of wasting his time, he could just
follow Kyung-seok and Kyung Hee.

657
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,306
My goodness.

658
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,727
Do Sang-won!

659
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:48,399

Gosh, these jerks.

Hurry up and get out here.

665
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,528
-Come on.
-My gosh.

666
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,406
You guys, this is way too much.

667
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,743
-My gosh.
-What is this?

668
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,744
They're muscles.

669
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,829
Do you seriously want to be like this?

670
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,040
You guys should've worked out.

671
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,627
If you took care of your body
and worked out diligently,

672
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,378
you wouldn't need to wear these.

673
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,631
You can wear this instead.

674
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,549
You guys, this is too mean.

675
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,135
Exactly. You're making us look funny.

676
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:03,015
You should at least look funny. You aren't
good-looking enough to gather people.

677
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,516
Now, give us a funny pose.

678
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,436
-Come on. Don't take a photo.
-Gosh, forget it.

679
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,437
In 1, 2...

680
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,272
-Stop it.
-Don't take that photo.

681
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,774
What are you guys doing?

682
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,525
Woo-young.

683
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,658
You were a mess yesterday,
and again today.

684
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,411
-Who said you could work in that?
-They were being immature.

685
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,083
Well, they kept insisting that only
the pretty girls could serve,

686
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,459
and commenting on our looks.

687
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:35,798

-Well...

690
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,973
We decided to order skirts for uniform.

691
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,643
-But they were shorter than--
-Did you agree?

692
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,729
No, they made them wear it.

693
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,399
They didn't care
what the freshmen said.

694
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,361
This is nothing compared to
what they did to us.

695
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,946
Is that why...

696
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,949
Was this your only solution?

697
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,499
How is it that you guys haven't changed
at all?

698
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:14,253
If you're going to keep pulling this kind
of nonsense, just get rid of it.

699
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:15,838
I'm sorry.

700
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:17,965
Sorry.

00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,945
It'll be unfair to let someone like
Park Yong-cheol ruin it.

705
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,197
Shouldn't you be at your booth?

706
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,866
You said you were late.

707
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,201
Where are Yoo Eun and Jung-boon?

708
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,871
They're over there.

709
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,456
Go already.

710
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,709
Make sure you have some real fun, okay?

711
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,419
Okay.

712
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,503
Bye.

713
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:57,963
Bye.

714
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,344
-Go already.
-Bye.

715
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,064
Mi-rae.

716
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,901
What are you doing alone?

717
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,280
I'm just looking around.

718
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,034
-What about you?
-I'm waiting for Ji-hyo.

719
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,415
I worried a lot about you yesterday.

720
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,168
Are you okay?

721
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,467
By the way,

722
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:48,180
I went to Yong-cheol's Instagram,

723
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:53,185
and it said Jaryong Middle School
on his profile.

724
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,395
Didn't you see it?

725
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,816
I don't know.

726
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,570
Did you say you went to that school?

727
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,864
I don't really know the school name.

728
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:08,951
Is that right?

729
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,453
If I had known,
I would've told you beforehand

730
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,039
that I knew someone
from your middle school.

731
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,207
Don't you think so?

732
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,045
Sua.

733
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,630
Hey.

734
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:26,468
Surprising news. The guys got scolded
so much by Woo-young just now.

735
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,678
-Really?
-Yes.

736
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:29,680
Check this out.

737
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,307
Isn't it hilarious?

738
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,976
What's that?

739
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,395
This is even more hilarious.

740
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,230
-Check this out.
-Oh, my.

741
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,315
Goodness.

742
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,027
There's this one, too.

743
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,838
Are you still down?

744
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,051
Did you get scolded a lot?

745
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:09,761
Yes.

746
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,347
What we did was wrong.

747
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,474
-Don't say that.
-It was wrong.

748
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,769
Woo-young never scolds innocent people.

749
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,156
I feel better
whenever I eat something sweet.

750
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,622
Thanks.

751
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,206
You're the best, though.

752
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:40,918
What?

753
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,503
Among the guys.

754
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,426
Let's go out. It's festival time.

755
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,053
Okay.

756
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:56,934
What?

757
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,186
It won't open.

758
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,026
What's wrong?

759
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,698
Excuse me.

760
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,743
The door won't open,
so could you try opening it?

761
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,163
Thank you.

762
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,583
What's wrong with it? Tae-hee, come out.

763
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,007
Open the door.

764
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,718
It's working.

765
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,928
What's wrong with it?

766
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,138
-Maybe it's broken.
-When did it break?

767
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,062
It's not fun to be with just girls.
Please don't do that.

768
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,438
Do you have boyfriends?

769
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,025
It's best if you're single,
but it's okay if you're taken.

770
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,778
Give me just 10 minutes for this game.

771
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,071
Please come this way.

772
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,448
-What is it?
-Come, come.

773
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,787
Come this way. How pretty.

774
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:02,207
Please move inside.

775
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,667
Have a seat.

776
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,754
All right. Gosh, you guys are lucky.

777
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,049
You've met the prettiest girls
in our school.

778
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,136
-Hello.
-Hello.

779
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:18,640
Please hold for a second.
I'll go bring one more guy.

780
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,646
I'm dazed because we got dragged here
all of a sudden.

781
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,064
-Us, too.
-It's the same.

782
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,568
Anyone want a blind date?

783
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,361
Huh? Kyung-seok?

784
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,116
What should we do?

785
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:43,040
Gosh. When did he come take a seat?

786
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:47,210
You're so handsome.
I should come to my senses.

787
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,589
All right, guys.
Now that we have even numbers,

788
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:55,844
You can have conversation for 10 minutes .
You'll partner up with someone you like.

789
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,095
Can't we point out?

790
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,932
You sat here
because you have someone in mind.

791
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:05,103
Okay, who on earth is the girl
you have in mind?

792
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,067
Her.

793
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,866
If she says yes, they will be
the fastest couple created ever.

794
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:21,203
Will it become a group blind date
among four people?

795
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:24,414
Let's hear how she feels.

796
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,725
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

797
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,145
-I'm okay.
-You're all wet.

798
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,355
What should we do?

799
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,566
There must be extra t-shirts
in our department room.

800
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,610
Really?

801
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,321
Then I'll go first.

802
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,366
-I'll go with you
-I'll go with you.

803
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,549
I'll go with Kyung-seok.

804
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:21,972
Let's go.

805
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,145
Anyway, they've become a couple.

806
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,438
Excuse me. Take the prize.

807
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,356
Excuse me.

808
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,789
-You want to run?
-What?

809
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,418
If it's embarrassing, let's run.

810
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,341
Okay.

811
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,936
Don't try to calculate love
not to get hurt.

812
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,397
That'll only make you suffer even more.

813
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,233
-Okay.
-Good luck.

814
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:16,985
Thank you.

815
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,196
-You can do it.
-I can do it!

816
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,530
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

817
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,247
Hey, Woo-young.

818
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,667
Awesome. We should've done this stuff.

819
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:35,045
Not everyone can do this, you know.

820
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,839
Can you read my fortune?

821
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,341
Sure. Have a seat.

822
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,055
Okay, choose one of these.

823
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,810
I'll choose this one.

824
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,022
Huh? This is unexpected.

825
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,567
I thought you'd choose this one.

826
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,737
I know well about the future I want.

827
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,364
I see.

828
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,659
All right.
I'll start the psychological test now.

829
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,788
Let's say you went to buy
a cozy knitted sweater.

830
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:13,375
Choose what kind of sweater
you'd buy among four options.

831
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,834
-Okay.
-The first one is

832
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,920
a sweater with a big highlight pattern.

833
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,840
-The second one is a striped sweater.
-A sweater with stripes.

834
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:25,095
The third one is a plain sweater
in a bold color such as red or blue.

835
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:30,016
The fourth one is a plain sweater,
such as gray or black.

836
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,893
Gray or black...

837
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,440
-I'll go with the third one.
-The third one?

838
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,319
That means you want simple love.

839
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,824
You prefer an uncomplicated love
to an extremely passionate one.

840
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:50,662
You can keep your emotions in check
no matter how you feel.

841
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,622
It's pretty accurate.

842
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:59,462
It can look graceful,
but on the other hand,

843
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:03,091
your love may be seen as hypocritical
as well.

844
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,009
Hypocritical?

845
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,470
You should try to be honest
with your feelings.

846
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,974
When you're not honest with yourself,
you can't win someone's heart.

847
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,809
I'm very honest...

848
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,565
Right, I've been careful.

849
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,692
Why?

850
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,362
It's a secret.

851
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,449
Your secret will be safe with me.

852
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,537
She's a student in our department.

853
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,878
You mean, the chemistry department?

854
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,133
I see.

855
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,805
-Are we done, then?
-Yes.

856
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,058
Thanks. I'll see you around.

857
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,101
Okay. Bye.

858
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,885
-My gosh.
-There it is.

859
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,179
Did you find it?

860
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,393
-Here.
-Thanks.

861
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,685
I'll wait outside.

862
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:43,608
What's going on?

863
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,569
What's wrong?

864
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,032
You can't open it?

865
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:53,868
Let me try.

866
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:07,632
Hello?

867
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,803
Anybody outside?

868
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,323
Why isn't she picking up?

869
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,534
You should try calling other people.

870
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,661
I don't have my phone.

871
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,580
What?

872
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,582
Everyone is ready, right?

873
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:44,169
Then here we go. 1, 2, 3!

874
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,885
Sadly, we don't have a match.

875
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,804
-Then I can leave, right?
-Yes, you can leave.

876
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,983
Whose phone is this?

877
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,444
-It's not mine.
-It's not mine.

878
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,572
It must be Kyung-seok's.
You can give it to me.

879
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:13,948
Okay.

880
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:16,242
KANG MI-RAE

881
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,368
1 MISSED CALL

882
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,044
The person you're trying to reach is
unavailable. Please leave...

883
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,713
No one's picking up.

884
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,548
I guess I lost it.

885
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,261
Eun isn't answering.
Jung-boon isn't either.

886
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,555
Who else can we call?

887
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,643
Shall I try calling Sua and Ji-hyo?

888
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:44,854
Forget it.

889
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:49,108
-Just get changed first.
-What?

890
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,110
Or are you going to wait until it dries?

891
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,996
What's going on
between Kyung-seok and Mi-rae?

892
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,207
Could they be...

893
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,710
No, no way. That can't be.

894
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:12,507
Is Kyung-seok trying to make you jealous?

895
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,593
I don't know what you're trying to say.

896
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,429
That must be it.

897
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,307
Come on. Are you playing hard to get?

898
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,687
What are you talking about?

899
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,482
Do you think I have a crush on him?

900
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:46,708
-I won't look.
-You shouldn't, of course.

901
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,394
Are you done?

902
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,272
I'm not done.
I haven't even taken off...

903
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:16,946
Tell me when you're done.

904
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,960
-You were here together?
-What's going on between them?

905
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,129
Kyung-seok's father was a congressman.

906
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,299
-You dropped this yesterday.
-You're really the worst.

907
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:21,803
-Ms. Na's in the emergency room.
-In the emergency room?

908
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:24,013
Sua, didn't you say
you live in Dogok?

909
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,307
I moved out of my parents' place.

910
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,351
-Kyung-seok.
-I'm sorry I misjudged you.

911
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:31,396
You would've kept misjudging me
if it weren't for Ji-hyo.

912
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,647
Yes, Woo-young.

913
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,899
I'll have a party on Saturday.
Can you come?

914
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,150
You'll be home late?

915
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,610
A movie with Kyung-seok.

916
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,237
This is driving me crazy.
