1
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,646
Are you wearing it?

2
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,694
I used to hate this scent so much.

3
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,824
But it's growing on me now.

4
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,856
You smell nice too.

5
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,154
-I don't wear anything.
-I can smell it.

6
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,698
Your scent.

7
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,920
But what is this smell?

8
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,840
Which one?

9
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,219
Wait.

10
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,482
What should I do?
I'm screwed. It dried out.

11
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,904
Don't touch it.
It's still hot.

12
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,991
I'll clean it up.

13
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,371
And let's have cake.

14
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,884
-Why is it one candle?
-It's our first day.

15
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,389
-Blow it out?
-Okay.

16
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,434
One, two, and three.

17
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,146
BASED ON THE WEBCOMIC
MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY! BY KI MAENG-GI

18
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,156
-Bottoms up!
-Huh?

19
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,617
It's non-alcoholic.

20
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,505
Here.

21
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,301
-What's this?
-I bought it for you.

22
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,269
I wanted to thank you.

23
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,273
I turned you down twice,
but you waited for me.

24
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,150
Take a look inside.

25
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,788
Thank you.

26
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,517
-Hello?
-Where you at?

27
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,687
-Huh?
-Are you okay? Did it go well?

28
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,983
-Why are you talking so loudly?
-It's crowded here.

29
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,152
So what happened with her?
Didn't go well?

30
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:44,033
Well, it did... go well.

31
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,495
Hey! Then you should've told me first.

32
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,080
Who is she?

33
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,794
I'll catch you later. Bye.

34
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,839
Hey, wait.

35
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,634
Ah, I don't get it.
Why won't he tell me about her?

36
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,433
It's Yoo-jin. He was there
when we had drinks.

37
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,102
What if...

38
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,438
he finds out about us?

39
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,939
He probably won't say much.

40
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,442
He will be happy for us.

41
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,780
Don't worry. I won't tell.

42
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,036
I'm still scared of people
finding out about our relationship.

43
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,413
But...

44
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,875
if we have to keep dating
secretly like this,

45
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,378
it'll be sad.

46
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,548
I'm sorry to keep you staying in
all the time.

47
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,593
I'm fine with that.

48
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,222
Should we just tell them?

49
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,103
I want to.

50
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,817
Hyun-jung, Woo-young, and Ms. Na.
We have already three people on our side.

51
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,739
Isn't it enough to have those three?

52
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,990
Don't push hard.

53
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,117
I'm okay.

54
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:10,828
No.

55
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,414
I think I can do this.

56
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,173
Alright, Mi-rae.
I can do this.

57
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,801
Hang in there.

58
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,563
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

59
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,023
Nothing.

60
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,248
Oh, you two arriving together?

61
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,376
-I'm in a hurry, my stomach.
-We are...

62
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,591
Is it a weird timing to say
we're dating each other to him?

63
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,428
You don't have to tell them first.
If someone asks, then say.

64
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,471
Okay.

65
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,894
I don't think they will even ask.

66
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,442
I don't think they are interested in us
that much.

67
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,449
-Shall we go now?
-Yes.

68
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,956
-Hi.
-Hi.

69
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,003
Eun, are you a close friend of Sua's?

70
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,464
-Pardon?
-What do you think of her?

71
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,549
What is this about?

72
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,511
The other day, I saw her
alone with Tae-young.

73
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,012
I saw them.

74
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,472
What?

75
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:38,893
Jung-yeob and Chan-woo fought
over her last night. My god!

76
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,439
She says she likes Kyung-seok.
But she hit on everyone.

77
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,982
Isn't it weird?

78
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,904
Well... I'm not really sure.

79
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,740
We need to ask Sua directly.

80
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,244
If we do so, do you think
she's going to tell the truth?

81
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,664
Tae-young doesn't pick up my calls.

82
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,585
Sua, where are you now?

83
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,807
Sua, you are like a model
whenever I take your photos.

84
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,644
I hope you stop taking photos
without asking me first.

85
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,147
Taking photos without consent
is illegal, isn't it?

86
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,649
See you.

87
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,126
-What do you want to say?
-Are you still stalking me?

88
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,628
-What?
-You took my photos secretly.

89
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,965
And you posted them online, didn't you?

90
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,049
You got me wrong.

91
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,846
I shared them only on my group chat.

92
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,185
Do you want me to report you
and get you thrown into prison?

93
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,273
-Into prison?
-Liking me, and talking back at me...

94
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,569
You are more pathetic
than I thought you are.

95
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,195
Hey.

96
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,116
Is there something wrong here?

97
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,493
No, we're fine.

98
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,503
Delete all the photos.

99
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,757
-And don't tell anyone.
-What?

100
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,600
Jeez, I can't believe this.

101
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,319
DELETE

102
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,237
DELETE

103
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,575
DELETE THE PICTURE?
CANCEL / DELETE

104
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,630
Hey, Sua.

105
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,134
You didn't like Kyung-seok, right?

106
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,345
Did you?

107
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,722
What is he saying?

108
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,809
Jesus, what's wrong?

109
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,781
So far, we've searched
for our own personal scents.

110
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:44,954
On the basis of it, today we're going
to make our own perfumes. Let's try.

111
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,122
Okay.

112
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,543
Don't think too much.
Simply try mixing your favorite ones.

113
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,672
Actually,

114
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,967
I don't think I'm really fond of perfumes.

115
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,385
Why not?

116
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,054
I prefer natural scent from skin.

117
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,766
Something natural is better
than something artificial.

118
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,936
Well, people have different tastes.

119
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,690
You're allowed to take the perfumes
you make today.

120
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:18,070
After three weeks,
your perfume will deliver deeper scents.

121
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,998
You guys can also try making one
as a couple.

122
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,999
Pardon?

123
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,507
Did I misunderstand?

124
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,509
Sorry, I got it wrong.

125
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,556
No.

126
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,187
-You were right.
-She's my girlfriend.

127
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,149
Right? I thought I was wrong.

128
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,735
Oh, my gosh.

129
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,875
Tell me!

130
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,543
Since when?

131
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,504
It hasn't been that long.

132
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,633
Awesome! Now I see.
That's why you were coming together.

133
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,176
Since when?

134
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,596
-Not been long.
-You've always been together.

135
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,891
You came with Mi-rae
when I was with Yoon-byeol?

136
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,351
Right.

137
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,814
You could've just told us the truth.
You got surprised for nothing.

138
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,691
I thought you guys were dating.
You look good together.

139
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,110
Good together?

140
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,324
-I'm so jealous.
-I'm jealous, too.

141
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,081
I can't understand.

142
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,376
How come he dumped you
and dated Mi-rae?

143
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,213
Hah, do they really mean
that they look good together?

144
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,551
What bullshit.

145
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,982
So, this is it.

146
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,068
You didn't have to be worried.

147
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,372
You wanted to come outside
to hold my hand, didn't you?

148
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,373
Huh?

149
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,170
-Any other reason?
-Well...

150
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,549
I thought Sua might feel uncomfortable
around us there.

151
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,722
Why do we have to even care?

152
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,225
-But still.
-I've been thinking.

153
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,686
I want you to be less nice.

154
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,899
I'm not as nice as you think.

155
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,234
-Only idiots are nicer than you.
-What?

156
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,654
-Hey, don't.
-See? It doesn't hurt at all.

157
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,911
-Sorry. Did it hurt?
-See? Not strong enough.

158
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,376
-Stop.
-What do you want to eat?

159
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,211
Well...

160
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,966
-There!
-Okay.

161
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,811
Are you all right?

162
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:43,317
-What do you mean?
-I just wondered if you were eating well.

163
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,780
I didn't even date him.
I'm perfectly fine.

164
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,699
Yes, you're right. All is fine.

165
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,160
He seems to have low standards.

166
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,668
-What?
-Can you stop saying such stuff?

167
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,470
I'm impressed with her ego.

168
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,682
She's weirder the more I look at her.

169
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,206
It ended up being nothing.

170
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,585
-I'm sorry to have made you uncomfortable.
-No, don't be.

171
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,682
-This is good.
-Yes.

172
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,727
He took mine.

173
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,480
What's wrong?

174
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,316
Nothing.

175
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,111
Is it exam week?

176
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,155
How can they be here now?

177
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,619
I used to get jealous of such things.

178
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,170
Hanging out together with boys
after school looked cool.

179
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,593
It doesn't mean I wanted
to hang out with boys.

180
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,638
Just... I couldn't get a chance.

181
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,392
-Then do it.
-What?

182
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,728
Do it. Do you still have
your school uniform?

183
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,191
-Did you throw it away?
-Well...

184
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,320
I don't think I did.
But school uniforms?

185
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,655
I think I have mine at home, too.

186
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,325
-You also want to?
-How can I let you do that alone?

187
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,091
I think something happened to your Dad.

188
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:17,262
I'm going to take care of Kyung-hee.
I hope you take care of yourself well.

189
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,349
You can drop by whenever you want.

190
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,571
MAYOR DO SANG-WON'S DAUGHTER DOES
A SHOW-OFF STREAMING.

191
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,532
HE BOUGHT HIS DAUGHTER
AN EXPENSIVE BAG.

192
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,790
There he comes!

193
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,671
Mr. Mayor is not around here now.
So please leave.

194
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:54,091
-Where is he now?
-Did he ever know about her video?

195
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,136
Did she buy the brand-name bags herself?
Or were they gifts?

196
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,889
-Could you give us an answer?
-Tell us something!

197
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,737
I can't stand it any more.

198
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,448
I need to ask her why she met him.

199
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:22,870
She will never tell you the truth.
Do you think she'll admit that?

200
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,332
People will think you're venting anger
after your breakup.

201
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,171
But I want to at least hear her excuses.

202
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,382
Wait.

203
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,002
What is she doing?

204
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,435
Is she trying to throw up?

205
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:32,564
She doesn't get fat because
she throws it all up after eating.

206
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,816
I wondered about that.

207
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,028
She never gained weight,
even after heavy meals.

208
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,114
She used to go to the restroom
right after lunch.

209
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,574
To puke.

210
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,369
My gosh, I can't believe it.

211
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,412
Hi.

212
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,082
I think you're mistaken.

213
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:56,338
The other day, I heard that
she used to have digestion problems.

214
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,840
I also have the same problems.

215
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,551
No, she checked out the stalls
to see if anyone was inside

216
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,388
before trying to throw up.
I saw it all.

217
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:16,066
Oh, my. Did you see her face just now?

218
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,651
Creepy.

219
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,743
Sua, please wait.

220
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,585
Don't worry. No one will...

221
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,673
You're driving me nuts.

222
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,011
-Do you feel pity towards me?
-No, I'm just...

223
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,180
Now that you're dating him,
you think your class has gone up?

224
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,976
Do you think you're a winner?

225
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,941
Hilarious.

226
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:04,156
Do you believe you could've met him
if you didn't have the surgery?

227
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,578
Even when he liked you first
you must have avoided him.

228
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,375
You fixed your appearance, and now
you pretend not interested in beauty?

229
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,587
You should be honest.

230
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,924
And stop worrying about me.

231
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,595
I'm not worried about you.

232
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,935
And how dare you judge
how much I care about him.

233
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,899
How would you know that
I would've given up on him?

234
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,863
What if I do?

235
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,965
Hi!

236
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,930
Sua.

237
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,520
She was caught while vomiting.

238
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,438
It must be embarrassing.

239
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,441
You guys always stick together
but you didn't know?

240
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,653
She threw up each time
she went to brush her teeth.

241
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,036
Sua.

242
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,664
Hyun Sua!

243
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,151
-I warned you, delete them.
-Delete what?

244
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,570
-Just delete them!
-What are you talking about?

245
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,161
We were taking photos of ourselves,
as today is our last day here.

246
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:23,628
Sua, do you think I still like you
and stalk you?

247
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,549
I deleted all three photos of yours.

248
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,010
And I deleted my group chat.

249
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,137
Happy now?

250
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,182
Kyung-seok was right.

251
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,351
I'm happy that he chose Mi-rae over you.

252
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,273
Why are you so harsh on him?

253
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,484
He liked you so much.

254
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,404
Are you venting your anger
after getting dumped by Kyung-seok?

255
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,413
So it wasn't him?

256
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,166
He'll never admit it.

257
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,554
How strange.

258
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:01,685
The uniform can't be here with this.
Oh, I was wrong.

259
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,744
I never wanted to see this uniform again.

260
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,499
Ah, so sweaty.

261
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,349
Yes, she stocked up.
Good girl.

262
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,062
Gosh, I ate too much.

263
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,233
Welcome home!

264
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,695
Why are you sweating?
Did you work out?

265
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,824
Yes, I did some stretching a bit.

266
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,701
Feels like I'm gaining weight.

267
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:03,872
Hey, you are tall. One or two kilograms
will make no difference.

268
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,584
My body changes instantly,
even with 500 grams.

269
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,416
Why are you here?

270
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,211
You wanted to see me suffering?

271
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,255
DAEJIN DAILY

272
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,008
Your mom really got back at me.

273
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:02,389
All this wouldn't have happened,
had Kyung-hee not run away from home

274
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,516
and removed her mask.

275
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:10,980
She never studied, just stayed in
and uploaded those videos.

276
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,233
Actually I pitied her.

277
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,778
-What?
-I was sorry for her.

278
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,702
-What are you talking about?
-She wanted attention and love.

279
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,954
But I couldn't do it for her.

280
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,292
Mom is not to blame.

281
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,045
You did all this.

282
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,926
I don't want to listen any more. Leave!

283
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,352
Good night.

284
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,242
-Didn't have dinner?
-No.

285
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,787
-Are you guys already having a fight?
-No.

286
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,748
Then why didn't you have dinner with him?

287
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,251
Kyung-seok said he needed to go somewhere.

288
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,967
Hey, actually...

289
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,720
-I told everyone.
-About what?

290
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,388
That I'm dating him.

291
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,933
Really? What did they say?

292
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,896
Well, nothing really in front of me.

293
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,689
They congratulated us.

294
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,693
Thank goodness.
Now, I can be relieved.

295
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,700
I have always been a burden to you.

296
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,285
No way.

297
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,038
You had a hard time because of me, too.

298
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,873
You taught me math.

299
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,042
Right!

300
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,128
I had to solve one problem three times.

301
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,881
Hey, not three times. Twice.

302
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:03,885
-Sometimes, it was five times.
-Try remembering it correctly.

303
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,859
Be quiet.

304
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,779
Be quiet.

305
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,584
What am I doing, just to make
my stupid childhood wish come true?

306
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,273
You look like a school uniform model.

307
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,441
You, too.

308
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,319
Pretty.

309
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,076
I didn't know
you could make such a remark.

310
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,249
-Why did you come out so early?
-Before Hyun-jung wakes up.

311
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,252
She will tease me.

312
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,257
By the way, where are we going to?

313
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,555
Although now everyone knows we are dating
it will be a bit awkward to run into...

314
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,226
-How about going to our middle school?
-What?

315
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,103
I wanted to visit at least once.

316
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,772
You did?

317
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,610
I have no good memories from school.

318
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,282
You don't want to go?

319
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,453
Any place you want?

320
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,540
Let's just go.
I want to go there.

321
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,972
A lot has changed, hasn't it?

322
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,515
Yes.

323
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,852
Some have changed while others have not.

324
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,025
Did we ever bump into each other
on the streets?

325
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,195
I rarely went outside.

326
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,239
I was stuck in my room after school.

327
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,493
I was, too.

328
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,961
Let's walk around a lot today.

329
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,798
Can we do this in our uniforms?

330
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,635
I see lots of students these days
holding hands.

331
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,679
It's true.

332
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,646
Wow, he's so handsome.

333
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,648
Which school uniform is that?

334
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,525
I don't think it's near here.

335
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,611
That girl is from
Jaryong high school.

336
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,572
Is she really a high school student?

337
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,949
I guess so.

338
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,117
Something wrong?

339
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,202
See someone you know?

340
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,121
No.

341
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,081
No one can recognize me.

342
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:28,840
Students seem to have finished exams.
They're all out here.

343
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,527
-You don't like hamburgers?
-Yes, I do.

344
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,404
Then why are you eating like that?

345
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,492
It is too big.

346
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,584
I won't look at you. Just eat.

347
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,628
I'm not looking.

348
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,800
Okay.

349
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,559
Did you eat?

350
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,311
Yes.

351
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,531
Was that your one bite?

352
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,619
Cute.

353
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,543
Jung-yeob and the Mop
fought over Sua.

354
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:53,341
Sua is just out of control now.
Okay, see you. Bye.

355
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,136
-Chan-woo.
-Yes.

356
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,431
I heard you were beaten up
by Jung-yeob, too.

357
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,059
Who said that? Jung-yeob?

358
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,646
-I beat him more.
-Now everyone knows.

359
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,607
You fought over Sua with him
at the Berlin pub.

360
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,566
Stop.

361
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,069
By the way, what did Sua do?

362
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,738
She made Tae-young
and Tae-hee break up.

363
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,908
-What? For real?
-Yes.

364
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,994
It was a huge fight.
He broke all the glasses.

365
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,080
-Wow.
-Whoa...

366
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,166
I never thought
she was hitting on everyone.

367
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,502
I never knew that she threw up.

368
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,087
-Throw up?
-Yes.

369
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,257
She threw it all up
to pretend she doesn't easily get fat.

370
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,010
You were her best friend.
How can you say such things?

371
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,138
Hey, I'm also annoyed.

372
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,057
People might think I'm weird
because I'm her friend.

373
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,811
You are already weird on your own.

374
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,187
Wait, what?

375
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,370
She threw up.

376
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:09,041
She pretended to not get fat easily.
She lied!

377
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,460
Jung-yeob and the Mop fought over her.

378
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,464
She's so out of control now.

379
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,564
YOO EUN

380
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,302
I'm Eun. What's up?

381
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:06,057
-Why did you call me?
-Just to have lunch with you.

382
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,558
It's okay.

383
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,686
Please leave me alone.

384
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,815
Then, can I just see you for a minute?
Where are you? Home?

385
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,946
What do you want to hear from me?

386
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,614
Nothing really.

387
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,700
If you want to say something, I'll listen.

388
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,665
If I don't do anything right now,
I know I'll regret it.

389
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,084
Sorry if I bothered you.

390
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:51,978
-This is where you were cleaning.
-Yes. It's when I misunderstood you.

391
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,230
I made you misunderstand me.

392
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,610
Have you ever seen me in other places
besides here and the bus stop?

393
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,446
-Many times.
-Really?

394
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,074
You were always alone.

395
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:06,826
I was, too.

396
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,958
Why did you hang around alone
without Hyun-jung?

397
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,168
I was sorry.

398
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,133
She used to fight many times with friends
because of me.

399
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:27,263
That's why I didn't get along with her
at school.

400
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,103
So we played at each other's homes.

401
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,355
Sometimes we studied together.

402
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,277
When I was with her,
I felt the most comfortable.

403
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,573
I'd better be nicer to her.

404
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,909
Like how?

405
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,706
Buy some lunches?

406
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,670
She's on a diet
to make a boyfriend.

407
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,218
The classrooms must be empty now.

408
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:21,567
Nothing's changed.

409
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,864
Of course. It's only been six years.

410
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,501
KANG ORC

411
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,795
Really, nothing changed.

412
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,049
-Did we have a basketball court there?
-Huh?

413
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:49,845
Where?

414
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,146
I couldn't do that either.

415
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,190
What?

416
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,822
You know, girls shout on the side
when boys are playing basketball.

417
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,075
I also wanted to join and watch.

418
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,077
But I couldn't.

419
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,375
-You should do it, too.
-What?

420
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,753
Let's go. You can cheer for me.

421
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,258
You're going to play basketball?

422
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:28,926
Right now?

423
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,720
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

424
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,225
Can I play with you guys?

425
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,018
Who is he?

426
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,145
Who's that?

427
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,400
-My gosh.
-He's so good-looking.

428
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,278
-Can I play with you guys?
-Sure.

429
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,488
-Let's play with him.
-How should we split?

430
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,031
-Two against three?
-Sure.

431
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,576
I guess he's really going to play.

432
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,494
Pass.

433
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,246
Block him.

434
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:00,958
Good job.

435
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,879
Don't you dare stop me.

436
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,424
-My gosh.
-He's so good.

437
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,843
Get the ball.

438
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,138
Come on. Block him.

439
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,102
Good job, Kyung-seok.

440
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,062
-No!
-Come on.

441
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,105
Nice!

442
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,441
Hey.

443
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,569
-Gosh, seriously.
-Do Kyung-seok!

444
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,529
Do Kyung-seok!

445
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,369
You were really good.

446
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,247
You cheered pretty well.

447
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,583
I know, right?

448
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,794
I didn't know I'd be so good at cheering.

449
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:47,713
Excuse me.

450
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,508
Is he your boyfriend?

451
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,009
Yes.

452
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,220
-I'm so jealous.
-Me too.

453
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,185
Shall we go now?

454
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,611
-Bye.
-Bye.

455
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:17,076
But didn't she call him Do Kyung-seok
just a while ago?

456
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,746
Wait, I think I heard it too.

457
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,083
So that's right.

458
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,086
He's the legendary handsome boy
from our school.

459
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,547
Awesome.

460
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,174
What should we do now?

461
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,680
Shall we eat and watch a movie?

462
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,098
A movie?

463
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,185
You'll be teased all day long
if you go back in that uniform.

464
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,854
You should go late when she's asleep.

465
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,274
You're right.

466
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,462
Sua.

467
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,681
Have you eaten?

468
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,016
What for?

469
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,184
I'd throw up after eating anyway.

470
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,355
I guess everyone thinks
I'm a psycho now.

471
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,066
I even lied to you.

472
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,901
My grandma is alive.

473
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,364
I once told Kyung-seok
that I had a grandma,

474
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,283
so you must've known.

475
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,577
He isn't the type who'd say such a thing.

476
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,579
Right.

477
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,498
He's not even interested in me.

478
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,084
He cares only about Mi-rae.

479
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,715
Do you hate her because of Kyung-seok?

480
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,304
I don't think it's because of him.

481
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,306
The way I see it,

482
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,975
you've hated her from the start.

483
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,356
That's right. I did.

484
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:12,691
Why?

485
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,863
Becoming pretty
isn't the only purpose of plastic surgery.

486
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,450
They do it because they want to do
something afterwards.

487
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,537
I had a close friend
when I was in middle school.

488
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,916
She was good to me,

489
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,668
like a servant.

490
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,295
She had an ordinary face,

491
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,173
but she got double eyelid surgery
as she entered high school.

492
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,841
She became really pretty.

493
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:43,347
And she dated a guy
whom I had a crush on,

494
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,393
even when she knew that I liked him.

495
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,104
But you hated Mi-rae from the beginning.

496
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,563
Because she's pretty.

497
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,318
I guess I hated her
because her surgeries were done so well.

498
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,245
Hey.

499
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,374
Did you post a picture of the beauty
in my department

500
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,543
-somewhere online?
-No.

501
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:16,088
I showed the picture to others,
but I never posted it online.

502
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,758
By the way, I saw some pictures
that looked like her on the Internet.

503
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,385
She wore the same clothes too.

504
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,345
What are you talking about?

505
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,485
Hello?

506
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,197
Hi, Won-ho. What's up?

507
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,950
I have something to tell you.

508
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,118
What is it about?

509
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,455
Now?

510
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,311
-Hello.
-Hi.

511
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,021
Did something happen?

512
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,690
I think so.

513
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,484
What is it?

514
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:22,821
-You know who Hyun Sua is, right?
-Yes, I do. What about her?

515
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,409
She said some strange stuff to me,
so I wondered what it was about.

516
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,457
I found this.

517
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,254
Who is this?

518
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,591
Her face isn't in the picture,
but it's Sua. I'm sure of it.

519
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:47,137
But she thinks I took this picture
and posted it online.

520
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,015
I took another picture of her before,

521
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,434
but it really isn't me.

522
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,314
Please help her.

523
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,992
We have to go catch the last bus
as soon as it ends.

524
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,702
Let's go right after then.

525
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,662
Okay.

526
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,040
I can't believe
those little punks are dating.

527
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:32,933
Don't mind it.

528
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,067
They won't make it to college like that.
Gosh.

529
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:08,093
Gosh, I hope my daughter isn't like that.

530
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,262
Goodness.

531
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,392
Whom did you mean just now?

532
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,232
I was talking to myself.

533
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,043
You've changed a lot.

534
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,964
I told you before.
I usually don't get intimidated.

535
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,864
Didn't you say
you don't usually get intimidated?

536
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,286
I'm not intimidated.

537
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,675
Why are you eating that alone?

538
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,274
It's gross.

539
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,151
Are you a beggar, Sua?

540
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:53,407
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors
and make the loser kiss Sua?

541
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,409
I might get sick.

542
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,537
I heard her parents abandoned her.

543
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,789
Poor thing.

544
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,749
But why?

545
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,251
-Because she's dirty?
-Because she's dirty?

546
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,003
-Telepathy.
-We thought the same.

547
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,588
How funny.

548
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,842
-I'd abandon her if I were her parents.
-Same here.

549
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,998
Don't you wash yourself?

550
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,238
Make sure you wash yourself.

551
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,620
You can go home alone, right?

552
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,874
Finish that before you go.

553
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,086
Don't go.

554
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,130
Don't abandon me again.

555
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:36,843
I can't do that.

556
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:40,931
Why?

557
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:47,562
You have no friends,
but I hope you do well.

558
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,481
Mom.

559
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,359
Mom.

560
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,788
Hey, is that Hyun Sua?

561
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,248
That's Hyun Sua?

562
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,208
My goodness.

563
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,918
It is her.

564
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,671
I didn't know she was so pretty.

565
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,382
I know, right?
Why did she look like that before?

566
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,925
I'm pretty?

567
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,927
Your skin is so fair.

568
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,096
-Are you wearing makeup or something?
-No.

569
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:24,349
Don't you think Sua is the prettiest girl
in the entire school?

570
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,892
-No, I'm not.
-You are.

571
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,894
Sua, this guy has a crush on you.

572
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,313
-Hey, cut it out!
-What was that about?

573
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,400
Hey, did you see that?

574
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,027
-Her face looked so cute just now.
-I know, right?

575
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,738
To be loved,

576
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,367
I must be pretty and cute.

577
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,704
At the same time,
I mustn't know that I'm pretty.

578
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:49,791
I must be obedient,
and I should never be too smart.

579
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,545
I must always smile and agree with others.

580
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,298
I must always be kind and friendly.

581
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,616
Let's go.

582
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,451
Right, the bus. We have to hurry.

583
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,338
We're two minutes late.

584
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,632
What should we do now?

585
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,302
-Should we take a taxi?
-All the way there?

586
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,680
Let me see how much cash I have on me.

587
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,228
I have 26,000 won. You?

588
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,773
If we're short,
I can bring money from home.

589
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,778
Then I'll call a taxi.

590
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,288
SEARCHING FOR A TAXI NEARBY

591
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,378
NO TAXIS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

592
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:19,339
-There are no taxis available.
-Then what should we do?

593
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,845
Then should we just go to a sauna?

594
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,138
A sauna?

595
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:31,059
Minors can't use our facilities
from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.

596
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,522
We're actually college students.
Can't we show you our school ID cards?

597
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,316
SAUNA
OPEN FOR 24 HOURS

598
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,736
I've only been here with my mom,
so I didn't think about that.

599
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,906
Are there any cars going to Seoul?

600
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,703
Okay, thank you.

601
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,252
Shall we just go to my parents' place?

602
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,840
It's not a good idea, right?

603
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,175
-You should go home.
-Then what about you?

604
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,387
I'll wait a few hours
and take the first bus.

605
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,307
-Then I'll wait with you.
-Just go home.

606
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,392
No, I don't want you to wait alone.

607
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,188
Let's just go to my parents' place.

608
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,816
We have no choice.

609
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,904
-Just go...
-Hi, Mom.

610
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,158
You're still awake?

611
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,038
Where are you?

612
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,291
We're at your grandmother's
70th birthday party.

613
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,169
We can't go home now
because your dad has been drinking.

614
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,546
-Who is it?
-Mi-rae.

615
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,340
My pretty daughter?

616
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,633
Mi-rae!

617
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,345
Dad sounds really drunk.

618
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,474
-Is something wrong?
-No, nothing's wrong.

619
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,142
Then when will you come home...

620
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,311
I mean, when will you go home?

621
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,563
Mi-rae, Mi-rae!

622
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,815
When can we go to karaoke again?

623
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,650
Go in. Go inside, okay?

624
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:07,113
By the way, why did you call me?
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

625
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,783
Yes, don't worry. Everything is fine.

626
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,785
Yes.

627
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:15,330
Then tomorrow, come home...
I mean, get home safely tomorrow.

628
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,084
Wait until Dad sobers up completely.
All right.

629
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,882
My parents aren't home now.

630
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:39,729
This is it.

631
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,946
Did you live here back then too?

632
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,658
Yes, we've been living here
since I was in elementary school.

633
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,788
Shall we go in?

634
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,943
This is where my family lives.

635
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,784
Have a seat.

636
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,494
Okay.

637
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:49,757
I'll go bring something to eat.

638
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,176
All right.

639
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,268
SQUID

640
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,062
This is squid.

641
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,441
This is also squid.

642
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,069
This is beef jerky.

643
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,324
Gosh, they're all bar snacks.

644
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,576
Are there any chips?

645
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,501
TOMATO KETCHUP

646
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,964
Soju.

647
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,555
Do you want some soju?

648
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:39,641
Sure.

649
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,612
I couldn't find many snacks to eat.

650
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,280
There's a lot here.

651
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,992
Isn't the uniform uncomfortable?

652
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,078
No, it's fine.

653
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,914
Yours must be more uncomfortable.

654
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:04,874
Get changed.

655
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,545
I'll be right back.

656
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,686
Hey!

657
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,065
Hey, you can't.

658
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,776
-Come on. You can't see that.
-Why not?

659
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:14,736
Give it back.

660
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,738
A quick look. I know your old face.

661
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,656
What's there to see? Give it back.

662
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,951
No, you can't see it. Gosh, give it back.
Give it back.

663
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,828
-Just...
-No, don't be like this.

664
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,153
Are you mad at me?

665
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,697
Yes, I am.

666
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,118
I'm sorry.

667
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,442
But there's something I'm curious about.

668
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:45,410
How can you like me
when you know how I used to look?

669
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:49,122
If I had kept that face,

670
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,209
would you still have liked me?

671
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,217
You're just you.

672
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,056
I'm saying it doesn't matter.

673
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,771
But...

674
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,609
I do miss your old face.

675
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,131
Then just for a moment...

676
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,887
You can see it for like a split second.

677
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:51,684
No, it's okay. I don't have to see it
if you don't want me to.

678
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:28,012
Just for three seconds.
No more than that, okay?

679
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,181
Here we go.

680
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,979
One, two...

681
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,565
Three.

682
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,200
If you still like me after seeing this,

683
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,788
that means you really like me.

684
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,479
I had my first kiss.

685
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:42,813
-Who's he?
-Mi-rae's boyfriend.

686
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,483
That guy is super handsome!

687
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:47,902
Her phone is still off.
I can't get a hold of her.

688
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:50,905
It was obviously taken without consent.
Why can't you delete it?

689
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:54,075
A victim? No, I don't want people
to think weirdly of me.

690
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,869
I think Kyung-seok likes you more.
Am I right?

691
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,205
This would be a nice spot
to propose later on.

692
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,749
You said hi to me first. You smiled at me.

693
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:04,502
-Do you know what this is?
-Have you seen Sua today?

694
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:05,920
What did you do?
