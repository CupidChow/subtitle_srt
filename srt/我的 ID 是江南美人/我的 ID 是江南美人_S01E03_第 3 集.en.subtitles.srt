1
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,891
Hey! Gosh!

2
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,777
BASED ON THE WEBCOMINC
MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY BY KI MAENG-GI

3
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:16,910
You flirted with me first.
How dare you act like this, wench?

4
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,370
Did you think
things would work out for real?

5
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,748
People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

6
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,127
Gosh, you plastic monster.

7
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,429
How dare you swear at me?

8
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,640
What did I do so wrong?

9
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,142
What did I do?

10
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,479
What a crazy...
Do you want to die?

11
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,980
That crazy witch. Hey!

12
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,748
It's you, Mi-rae.

13
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,253
Why are you sitting here alone?

14
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,921
Did you drink a lot?

15
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,926
Don't you remember me?

16
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,056
The TA?

17
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,895
Hello.

18
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,814
Is the party already over?

19
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,315
No.

20
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,695
Did something happen?

21
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,116
I'm just feeling a little queasy.

22
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,578
Do you want some water?

23
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,839
Have some water.

24
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,508
You're really pretty.

25
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,594
Gosh, you plastic monster.

26
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,638
It's okay.

27
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,309
Kang Mi-rae.

28
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,269
What are you doing?

29
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,689
I'm heading home.

30
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,150
All right, then.

31
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,943
Let's go.

32
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:14,986
What was your name?

33
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,906
Come on, let's go.

34
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,705
-What are you doing now?
-Mind your own business.

35
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,249
Why are you going with her?
I don't get it.

36
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,793
What are you trying to do
with a girl who's drunk?

37
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,590
What on earth are you thinking?

38
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,927
You're the one who's trying to take her.

39
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,767
I don't know how close you are to her,
but this can be considered violence.

40
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,482
Cut it out. Let's go.

41
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,608
Let go.

42
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,033
You can't just touch me whenever you like.

43
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,428
Thank you.

44
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,269
You didn't have to take me home.

45
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,063
We must make sure
all freshmen get home safely.

46
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,944
Why did you guys come? I'm fine.

47
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,779
We must look after each other.

48
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,074
Hey, we came with her.
You had no reason to worry.

49
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,993
That's why we were worried.

50
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,832
Then get home safely. Thank you.

51
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,584
-Guys, get home safely.
-Okay.

52
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,754
-See you, Sua.
-Bye.

53
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,506
Bye.

54
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,804
Wow, she lives here?

55
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,932
I thought she seemed very well-off.

56
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,101
Her family must be rich.

57
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,790
People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

58
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,501
Gosh, you plastic monster.

59
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,173
I just wanted to be normal.

60
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,760
All I wanted was a normal life
like everyone else's.

61
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,472
Is it something that I can never have?

62
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,186
-What are you doing here?
-My gosh!

63
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,897
Why are you so surprised?

64
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,191
It's me. Don't you remember me?

65
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,194
Do I know you?

66
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,780
What are you talking about?

67
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,865
We met yesterday at the club.

68
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,867
I guess you were really drunk.

69
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,286
I have no idea what you're talking about.

70
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,580
What's going on? Who's this guy?

71
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,791
I don't know.

72
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,209
Oh, no.

73
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,715
Well, aren't you Yu-ri?

74
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,134
You got the wrong person.

75
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,097
I'm sorry.
You look so much like the girl I know--

76
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,057
Look carefully, will you?

77
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,351
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

78
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,811
My apologies.

79
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,941
What was that about?

80
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,652
Mi-rae, are you all right?

81
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,747
He called me a plastic monster.

82
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,499
What?

83
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,212
He said that girls like me are
everywhere in Gangnam.

84
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,297
Who said that? That jerk?

85
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,148
Hey, you should report him.

86
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,525
But I hit him too.

87
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,278
The one who attacks first should be
punished.

88
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,114
What started the fight though?

89
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,326
Him calling me a plastic monster?
Or talking about Gangnam?

90
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,662
It will just end up
with another mean nickname.

91
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,997
This is crazy.

92
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,377
I got plastic surgery done to enjoy
what everyone else enjoys.

93
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,837
What's wrong about it?

94
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,508
Do you think I was too greedy?

95
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,093
You know what?

96
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,429
Hyun Sua? She's ridiculous too.

97
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,097
You said you two are close.

98
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,767
How could she say such a thing
in front of everyone?

99
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,354
She said she didn't know.

100
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,775
What if someone asks me
if I got work done?

101
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,694
I should tell the truth, right?

102
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,322
If you lie and say
that you got nothing done,

103
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,534
you are just obnoxious.

104
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:58,037
Then shall I tell people
that I only got my eyes and nose done?

105
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,083
Gosh, no. That makes it sound like
you wanted to get more done.

106
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,586
Take out "only".
Just say you got your eyes and nose done.

107
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,630
My, you sure are a psychology major.

108
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,468
How about I tell them about
the face contouring and all the rest?

109
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,637
No, that's not necessary.

110
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,098
Right?

111
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,601
Getting plastic surgery isn't something
to brag about.

112
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,312
Hey, you should still be confident.

113
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,189
Just don't overreact.

114
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,275
Yes, I know.

115
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,361
They'll probably look down on me
if I cause a fuss about it.

116
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,322
People had no respect for me
because I was ugly.

117
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,658
Now, they'll have no respect
because I had plastic surgery.

118
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,288
I'm neither ugly nor pretty.

119
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,207
But then, I'm not average either.

120
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,088
I don't even know myself anymore.

121
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,008
Which category should I adjust myself to?

122
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,469
If you have to choose, you should
adjust yourself to being pretty.

123
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,179
Don't you remember?

124
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,765
A guy told you that you're his ideal type?

125
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,144
That's probably
because he thought I was easy.

126
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,396
Forget it.

127
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,149
Drink up.

128
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,742
Mom.

129
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,538
My son, you came to pick me up.

130
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,545
Hello?

131
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,215
Ma'am, are you back in Korea?
You said you'll be back tomorrow.

132
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,885
We were going to go pick you up.

133
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,137
That's why I came early.

134
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,016
We would feel better
if you'd just let us do our jobs.

135
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,101
There's no need.

136
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,228
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

137
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,836
Do Sang-won will support your future!

138
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,257
You should play these kind of songs
to attract the young.

139
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,718
Trot songs are no longer effective
in Seoul.

140
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,888
Are you telling me
to dance like you just did?

141
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,556
No. If you dance like us,

142
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,726
they'll think you only practiced
dancing, not developing policies.

143
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,937
You only need to dance
during the chorus.

144
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,855
Do you think you danced well?

145
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,611
I'll leave the dancing to the promoters.

146
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,664
It'd be nice to have Kyung-seok
stand beside you.

147
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,624
But his birthday hasn't passed yet.

148
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,253
Ah-reum is the prettiest girl
among the politicians' families.

149
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,505
But nextÂ  to him,
she is just a squid.

150
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,049
Can you refrain from using
those kind of terms?

151
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,927
You need to focus
on the young voters to win.

152
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,640
If you become the mayor,Â your next goal
will be to become a governor.Â And then...

153
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,103
-Sir, you have a phone call.
-Who's calling?

154
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,063
She's the head of Hankook Kelun.

155
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,741
Hello?

156
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,451
It's been a while.

157
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,411
I'm back in Korea.

158
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,579
I know.

159
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,458
I know we're not close enough
to ask each other how we've been doing.

160
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,252
So I'll just cut to the chase.

161
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:37,673
Please tell Kyung-seok and Kyung-hee
that I wish to meet them.

162
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,968
Why would you meet them?
You don't deserve to see them.

163
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,679
I didn't call to ask for your permission.

164
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,558
I'm only trying to mind my manners,
since you have raised the kids until now.

165
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,269
I'm going to meet my kids,
so just keep that in mind.

166
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,233
She must be out of her mind.

167
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,859
"Can you get up for a second? There are
so many men who wish to date you."

168
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,821
"So I figured I should make you mine
as soon as possible."

169
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,489
"Because you're my girl."

170
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,158
-Do you want to die?
-I'm sorry.

171
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,536
Did I go too far?

172
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,415
Should I take a break this semester?

173
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,668
What? Are you going to go to the army?

174
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,171
Didn't I tell you last time?

175
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,633
You're the type who goes to the army
after breaking up with someone.

176
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,512
But you didn't even date anyone yet.
So why would you take a break?

177
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,765
Hi, you guys.

178
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,059
Why aren't you heading toÂ class?

179
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,733
Your legs look really long
when you sit like that.

180
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,151
What?

181
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,821
I'll see you later.

182
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:24,905
Okay.

183
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,247
I guess...

184
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,500
nothing really happened
between you and Sua last night.

185
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,918
Am I correct?

186
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,629
Why did she say, "I'll see you later"?

187
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,131
She meant in class.

188
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,926
I do have long legs.

189
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,930
When did she have the time to notice that?

190
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,392
I think you should go to the army
to get to your senses.

191
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,321
I don't understand Sua.

192
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,533
She should've gotten the message
when she saw Mi-rae hesitating to answer.

193
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,287
She obviously got her eyelids done
and a nose job.

194
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,372
Sua's so slow-witted, I guess.

195
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,499
By the way,

196
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,128
don't you want to know
how she used to look in the past?

197
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,089
Ye-na.

198
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,009
Hello.

199
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,344
Hi.

200
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,929
Kyung-seok.

201
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,599
Can we talk?

202
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,185
He's talking with me right now.

203
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,938
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,273
I need to talk to him
regarding a class.

205
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,361
We're in the same research team.
He's the leader. I'm the assistant.

206
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,113
Okay, then. I'll see you later.

207
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,116
By the way, Ye-na.

208
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,955
You have chili powder stuck
in-between your teeth.

209
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,220
Oh my gosh!

210
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,437
Don't you want to know
how she used to look in the past?

211
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,657
Shouldn't we resolve our misunderstanding?

212
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,951
We're in the same research team.

213
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,166
I apologized to Mi-rae yesterday.

214
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,420
She told me that she was fine.

215
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,797
But I still feel really sorry.

216
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,216
She must've been so flustered.

217
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,762
Every time I saw her,

218
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,558
I was always envious
of how pretty she looked.

219
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,271
I said that because I didn't know
she'd had any plastic surgery.

220
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,274
I'm so slow-witted.

221
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,234
Then why did you ask?

222
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,195
What?

223
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,614
If you didn't know
she got plastic surgery,

224
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,491
why did you ask if she did or not?

225
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,039
I just said that...

226
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,333
without really thinking much about it.

227
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,502
You don't look that thoughtless.

228
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,883
Did you tell Chan-woo that you like him
without thinking as well?

229
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,596
But then again,
you might actually like him.

230
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,182
Well...

231
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,102
I just wanted the seniors to like me.

232
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,188
Do you have more to say?

233
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,442
-What are you guys doing?
-Huh?

234
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,694
Talking about last night.

235
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,912
What happened?
Did Kyung-seok apologize?

236
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,539
Yes, kind of.

237
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,250
I guess he was bothered
by how he treated you.

238
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,006
I told him that I'm okay
and that he shouldn't worry.

239
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:13,926
Something's fishy.

240
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:15,886
What?

241
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:19,056
Why would he cause trouble
and see you in private like this?

242
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,391
Is he playing a tsundere?

243
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,144
Sometimes acting cold just to be nice?

244
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,522
Why would he do that?

245
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,816
I guess you're right. He's not Won-ho.

246
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,028
But if Kyung-seok asks you out,
you might not be able to reject him.

247
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,489
-You're the one who's weird.
-What?

248
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,242
You seem very interested in him.

249
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,035
Do you like him?

250
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,538
What are you talking about?

251
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,290
I prefer guys who are nicer
and approachable.

252
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,045
Kyung-seok is way too cold-blooded.
He's ice cold.

253
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,385
But seriously, why are you so slow-witted?

254
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,138
"Mi-rae didn't do
any plastic surgery either"?

255
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,057
It's so obvious.

256
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,286
-Didn't she get too much done?
-I know, right? It's a bit much.

257
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,663
-Seriously?
-She just stared at us.

258
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,084
-Gangnam Beauty.
-Yes, the typical Gangnam face.

259
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,924
So, this happened again.

260
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,634
Again.

261
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,353
KANG MI-RAE

262
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,074
Why are you here?

263
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,910
What?

264
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,369
I'm in this class.

265
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,004
Are you the overly self-conscious type?

266
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,276
Spare me a minute... Let's talk.

267
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,786
You somehow keep getting involved
in my problems.

268
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,413
I hope you stop overreacting.

269
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,168
With the TA and Sua too.

270
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,257
Don't get the wrong idea.
Sua really didn't know.

271
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,933
Anyone could tell that I got work done
on my face, but anyway...

272
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,226
Why did you do it?

273
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,770
What?

274
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,233
Why did you get plastic surgery
on your face?

275
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,784
It's okay, Jung-boon.

276
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,244
I can do it by myself.

277
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,122
Don't be like that. We should take turns.

278
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,749
Being the class representative
shouldn't be a punishment.

279
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,716
Hey, you're
the freshmen representative, right?

280
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,134
Yes.

281
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,722
What do you mean,
why did I get plastic surgery?

282
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,640
You really don't know?

283
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,144
You know that I had no choice
but to get plastic surgery.

284
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,940
What exactly do you mean by that?

285
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,609
Who says it's a must
for some and not for others?

286
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,112
Well, I just meant that...

287
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,620
You know what I used to look like.

288
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,293
I never even dreamed of becoming
as pretty as Sua.

289
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,880
Not even Ji-hyo.

290
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,966
But just like Jung-boon or Eun.

291
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,470
Had I looked like them,
I would've never done it.

292
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,349
But my face was far below the average.

293
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,727
Do you...

294
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,356
grade other people's faces?

295
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,781
You needed surgery
on your unhealthy mindset, not your face.

296
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,500
What did you just say?

297
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,254
It's none of your business.

298
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,674
Why do you even care about what I think?

299
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:21,149
That jerk. What does he even know?
He has no clue.

300
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,331
You needed surgery
on your unhealthy mindset, not your face.

301
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,960
What did you say?

302
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,342
Kyung-seok, where are you going?
Are you headed home?

303
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,885
Yes.

304
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,971
I must say, you're so gutsy.

305
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,974
The seniors told us to gather,
but you totally ignored it.

306
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,267
You're brave.

307
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,271
-Why do they want us to gather?
-You didn't know?

308
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,731
Don't you check the group chat?

309
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,984
Chan-woo told
all freshmen to assemble.

310
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,944
I wonder what he's up to this time.

311
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,991
Did one of us do
something wrong yesterday?

312
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,285
He must've called the girls too, right?

313
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,121
I wonder if Sua is coming.

314
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,957
He should be embarrassed
that he hasn't graduated yet.

315
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,625
Why did he come to the party?

316
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,920
I'll say something to him.
Gosh, what a hassle.

317
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,885
Hey, you flirted with me first.

318
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,137
How dare you act like this, wench?

319
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,389
You thought
things would work out for real?

320
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,766
People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

321
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,941
It must be because of me.

322
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,194
I bet he wants to get back at me.

323
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,199
CHOI JUNG-BOON

324
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,205
Hey, Jung-boon.

325
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,168
Yes, I saw it.

326
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,629
He said that he'll teach us
a serious lesson.

327
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,422
I have no idea what it's about.

328
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,175
Well, Eun didn't do anything wrong.

329
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,565
Do you guys think I'm a joke?

330
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,734
Where's everyone else?

331
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,195
Well...

332
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,280
Many have already gone home.

333
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,866
You are the rudest freshmen
in our entire history.

334
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,201
You know that, you jerks?

335
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,748
Is Kyung-seok not here?

336
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,711
It's all of your responsibility.

337
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,632
Get ready for some real punishment.
You're all dead meat.

338
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,635
Gosh, has he lost his mind?
What's all this about?

339
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,303
In push-up position.

340
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,390
-Sorry?
-I said, in push-up position!

341
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,225
Do I have to repeat myself?

342
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,476
You little...

343
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,728
Chan-woo!

344
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,608
-What is it? Why are you here?
-What are you doing?

345
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,820
What will you do if someone
posts a video of this?

346
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,493
All of you,
run over there in 10 seconds, now.

347
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,038
All of you must give your phone
to Jung-ho.

348
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,082
Hold on to my bag and be on the watch.

349
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,298
-That crazy jerk.
-He'll hear you.

350
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,928
Hurry up!

351
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,936
In push-up position!

352
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,272
What?

353
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,649
Is the space too tight?

354
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,655
Girls can leave.

355
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,741
I never punish girls.

356
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,993
Get out!

357
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,296
Except for you, Mi-rae.

358
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,971
Girls who think they can get pretty
by getting surgery need a serious lesson.

359
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,599
Your face is a reflection of your heart.

360
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:24,934
Am I wrong?

361
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:25,977
Answer me.

362
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,397
Then I'll stay too.

363
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,192
What?

364
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,821
I'll stay here with her.

365
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,657
Sua, why...

366
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,910
This has nothing to do with you.
Why would you do that for her?

367
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,496
Then what did I do wrong?

368
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,039
What did you say?

369
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,376
And what did these guys do wrong?

370
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,295
Guys, leave us.

371
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,255
Get out!

372
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,019
You should really be begging me
for forgiveness.

373
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,522
How dare you say
that you've done nothing wrong?

374
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,442
Shall I make your face go back
to how it used to look?

375
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,861
-Don't do this, Chan-woo.
-Get lost!

376
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,447
-Chan-woo, calm down.
-Shut up.

377
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,949
-Chan-woo, please.
-Hey.

378
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,868
Get out, all of you. Get lost!

379
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,333
Hey.

380
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,337
You're the one who told all freshmen
to call me SOB, right?

381
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,172
It was you, wasn't it?

382
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,425
I know it was you!

383
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,432
You and Kyung-seok are
the cockiest ones in your year.

384
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,978
Fine, I'll punish you
for Kyung-seok not showing up as well.

385
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,689
Hey.

386
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,357
Hey.

387
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,322
You crazy jerk.

388
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,244
You must be out of your mind.

389
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,915
I'm going to kill you today.

390
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,793
Let go of this. Let go!

391
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,350
Are you okay?

392
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,332
-Hey, give me your cell phone.
-My gosh.

393
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,833
Hurry.

394
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,297
CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT OFFICE
TA: YEON WOO-YOUNG

395
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,549
Come in.

396
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,054
Hi. Please sit down.

397
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,935
It's hard being
the representative, isn't it?

398
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,312
No, it's okay.

399
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,360
I just heard that something happened.

400
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,570
Can you tell me everything?

401
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,494
Yes.

402
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,040
Yes, I think I'll be sleeping there.

403
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,044
Make sure to lock your door
before you sleep.

404
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,005
Okay, bye.

405
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,009
It's been four months.

406
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,305
Tae-sik, you've done enough.

407
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,309
If you want a child
to look exactly like you,

408
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,853
I'll give birth to another baby.

409
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,232
-Mom.
-What are you doing here?

410
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,650
What about class tomorrow?

411
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,527
I'll just get up a little early.

412
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,030
Here. I bought you dumplings.

413
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,658
How nice. I was feeling hungry.

414
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,704
She even bought dumplings for her dad.

415
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,372
Where's Dad?

416
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,918
He went to the funeral
of his friend's father.

417
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,339
-Does that mean he's not coming home?
-Probably.

418
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:11,512
He's feeling a lot better now,
so don't worry too much.

419
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,225
Really?

420
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,853
Yes, he's almost over it.

421
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,690
You didn't come
because something happened?

422
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,152
No, everything's fine.

423
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,820
I'm going to take a shower.

424
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,572
Okay.

425
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,122
Why did you bring your car?
We're going to drink.

426
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,958
I'll just call a chauffeur service.

427
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,168
You live nearby.
That's a waste of money.

428
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,671
Please give us a lot of side dishes.

429
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,465
He'll be buying.
His daughter goes to Hankook University.

430
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,383
Okay.

431
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,387
Show me her entrance ceremony photos.
It's the most prestigious university.

432
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,680
I don't have any photos.

433
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,098
Didn't you take any?

434
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,433
My wife took it with her cell phone.

435
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,519
Then ask her to send them to you.

436
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,729
Let's just drink. Here.

437
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,651
Isn't Mi-rae going to take us on a tour
around the campus?

438
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,987
That's a good idea.
We should pay her a visit.

439
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,489
We won't be able to tour the campus
without Mi-rae.

440
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:15,410
University students are busy.
She doesn't even have time to come home.

441
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,370
My gosh, you punk.

442
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:21,290
Look at how arrogant he's being
because Mi-rae goes to Hankook University.

443
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,792
You used to boast about her.

444
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,253
But now,
you're not even talking about her.

445
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,298
-I'm going to leave.
-Gosh, stop.

446
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,009
-Look at him.
-I was kidding.

447
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,301
He gets upset so easily.

448
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,013
I'm buying you drinks.
Come on, let's just drink.

449
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,265
-Come on.
-Congratulations.

450
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,435
I can't believe
she's a student at Hankook University.

451
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,312
I knew she'd get in.

452
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,780
You're a star, Mi-rae.

453
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,452
Gosh, stop watching it and sleep.

454
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,789
I'll watch it again
by myself tomorrow.

455
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,550
Are you having fun at school?

456
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,595
It's not bad.

457
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,472
My gosh.

458
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,558
I guess the money was worth it.

459
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,561
Now that you look pretty,

460
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,606
they're finally seeing yourÂ true value.

461
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,110
What's my true value?

462
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,448
You're cute, bright,

463
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,618
nice, and cheerful.

464
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,707
You've been cheerful
ever since you were a baby.

465
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:49,587
On your first birthday,
you danced so well

466
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,465
that everyone thought you'd grow up
and become a celebrity.

467
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,971
Now,

468
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,933
you should make a lot of friends

469
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,644
and have lots of fun.

470
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,646
Enjoy your life.

471
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,358
It'll be the best years of your life.

472
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,490
Mom, I'm sleepy.

473
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,493
Yes.

474
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,495
Okay. Let's go to sleep.

475
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,040
You need to wake up early
for school tomorrow.

476
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,396
Look at you acting like a baby
after hearing about your first birthday.

477
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:54,110
Mom, you must've had a hard time
because of me until now.

478
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,656
Life is...

479
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,952
all about fighting
through your struggles.

480
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,540
People might seem
like they're living a worry-free life.

481
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,627
But they're all just trying their best
to keep living.

482
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,469
I like how you smell, Mom.

483
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,015
Gosh, you're so sensitive to smell.

484
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,100
My cute little baby.

485
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,063
I'm so glad to hear
that you're doing well in school.

486
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,244
Sir, you can't enter
because you drank alcohol.

487
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,957
You have one new message.

488
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,878
Tae-sik, you've done enough.

489
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,632
If you want a child
to look exactly like you,

490
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,426
I'll give birth to another baby.

491
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,847
-Mom.
-What are you doing here?

492
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,184
-What about class tomorrow?
-I'll just get up a little early.

493
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,478
Here. I bought you dumplings.

494
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,106
How nice. I was feeling hungry.

495
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,944
She even bought dumplings for her dad.

496
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,695
Where's Dad?

497
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,245
VOICE MESSAGE

498
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,805
Did you hear a freshman beat up a senior?

499
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:46,722
Really?

500
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,268
The senior flew
from the first bathroom stall to the last.

501
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,271
-Means he flew at least eight meters.
-Exactly.

502
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,690
-The fight ended in two seconds.
-Come on.

503
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,527
He dodged the mop
and did a full 360 turn, then kicked him.

504
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,945
-Have you heard?
-What?

505
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,823
-His jaw and ribs are all broken.
-Seriously?

506
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,533
-That is crazy.
-My gosh.

507
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,288
Shouldn't we persuade him
to transfer to our department?

508
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,580
What's his name?

509
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,835
What was it... Was it Do Kyung-seok?

510
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,670
-Do Kyung-seok?
-Do Kyung-seok.

511
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:22,341
Why did he show up
when I was just about to kick him?

512
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,636
Just go to the military.

513
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,893
If I were him, I'd drop out of school.

514
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,813
Hey, get it out of my face.

515
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,773
Hey!

516
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,359
By the way, why did he do that
to Mi-rae?

517
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,070
Did that SOB ever need reasons?

518
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,781
I guess he wanted to have fun,
but it didn't go well.

519
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,284
But still, how could he do that
to a senior?

520
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,370
You call a mop your senior?
He doesn't deserve our respect.

521
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,040
So is Mop his new nickname now?

522
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,458
Isn't it so gratifying?

523
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,086
My, I'd love to be
as gutsy as Kyung-seok.

524
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,882
He's not only handsome,
he's charming, too!

525
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,096
Is she not coming to class today?
Shall I try calling her?

526
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,142
We still have some time
until class starts.

527
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,190
What if worse things happen?

528
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:23,027
What if Kyung-seok gets
in trouble because of me?

529
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,071
Mi-rae!

530
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,994
Are you okay?

531
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,752
Everyone thinks that Kim Chan-woo
is a total jerk, so don't worry.

532
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,714
I shouldn't have told everyone to come.

533
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,758
I'm sorry.

534
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,220
I deeply regret just standing there
and doing nothing.

535
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,764
I should've spoken up,
no matter how scared I was.

536
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,391
Don't say that.

537
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,601
I know that you had no choice.

538
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,603
I'm the one who should apologize.

539
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,271
It was all because of me.

540
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,856
Hey, that is not true.

541
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,652
It's my fault for not doing a good job
as the representative.

542
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:06,821
I'm sorry, Mi-rae.

543
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,617
You must've been terrified.

544
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,829
I felt so bad
that I couldn't even sleep last night.

545
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,998
Chan-woo, that jerk.
We should've taught him a real lesson.

546
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,250
That's what I'm saying.

547
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,794
We should've rubbed the mop
all over his face.

548
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,423
-I'm Kim Sung-woon.
-80 out of 100.

549
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,592
I'd give her 85 when she's dressed up.

550
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,262
Gosh, I told you guys
to just talk casually.

551
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,264
-I'm Choi Jung-boon.
-70 out of 100?

552
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,932
She has a cute, friendly face.

553
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,684
Are you the one that created...

554
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,269
You're right.

555
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,773
They're such nice people.
What on earth was I thinking?

556
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:47,653
I judged them by their looks
and graded their faces.

557
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,531
I'm sorry.

558
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,161
For what?

559
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,748
And thank you both so much.

560
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,588
I just did what anyone would've done.

561
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:10,176
It wasn't easy to volunteer
to stay behind with me in that situation.

562
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,180
I couldn't leave you alone there.
We're friends.

563
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,727
To tell you the truth,
I felt like I owed you an apology.

564
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:25,524
I wondered if Chan-woo was taking things
out on you... because of me.

565
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,321
He actually told me that he liked me,

566
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,282
but I rejected him
because it was so uncomfortable.

567
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:39,163
And, he asked if it was because of you.
He totally jumped to his own conclusions.

568
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,501
Then did you gossip to Sua
to stab me in the back?

569
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,504
She says she can't go out with me
because you like me.

570
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,297
What did I do?

571
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,716
What did you do? Hey!

572
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,345
You flirted with me first.
How dare you act like this, wench?

573
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,186
That's why I thought
he was taking it out on you.

574
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:03,938
I felt so bad.

575
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,440
No.

576
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,108
You did nothing wrong.

577
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,028
You obviously had to reject
a jerk like him.

578
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:15,449
Now, everyone calls him Mop
instead of SOB.

579
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,700
Really?

580
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,245
I think that nickname suits him better.

581
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,457
Mi-rae is quite brave.
She spoke up in that situation.

582
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,834
Whatever. Sua was the brave one.

583
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,838
I'm impressed that she stood up for Mi-rae
in that situation.

584
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,425
My gosh. She's pretty
and such a loyal friend as well.

585
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,803
She's pretty and thoughtful.

586
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,806
I didn't even do much.

587
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,810
Frankly, Kyung-seok was the one
who really came to rescue you.

588
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:53,487
I must say, it seems like
he gives you special treatment.

589
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,323
-Aren't I right?
-What do you mean?

590
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,159
Are you two going out, by any chance?

591
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,619
What?

592
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,915
Hey, I heard Kang Mi-rae came
to school today.

593
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,001
-Seriously?
-Yes.

594
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,461
I thought she'd take a few days off.

595
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,714
She's much stronger than I thought.

596
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,768
The time when I made that mistake
at our party, and this time too.

597
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,647
It's like he can't stand
seeing you in difficult situations.

598
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,482
Well, that's...

599
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,526
Or are you still flirting?

600
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,778
What? It's really not what you think.

601
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,907
No? But I've seen the two of you
talking about your secrets.

602
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,201
Secrets? When?

603
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:46,040
That day in front of the vending machine.
When you were with Eun and Jung-boon.

604
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,294
-Thanks for this.
-Mi-rae.

605
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,177
Let's have a quick talk.

606
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,933
What's going on? A secret chat
between just the two of you?

607
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,812
My perfume container...

608
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,065
He must've confessed
his feelings for you.

609
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,112
Does he have crush on you?

610
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,323
Hey, stop talking nonsense.

611
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,450
That's because we're alumni...

612
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,410
I must be out of my mind.

613
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,040
Alumni?
Did you guys go to the same school?

614
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,834
Yes.

615
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,461
Oh, really?

616
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:36,840
I had no idea.
Which school? High school?

617
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,467
No, middle school.

618
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,179
I asked Kyung-seok not to tell anyone

619
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,640
and ended up exposing my past myself.

620
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,694
I told you that wench
Kang Mi-rae hit me first.

621
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,822
Do you believe the freshmen's words
over my words?

622
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,281
Hey, Chan-woo.

623
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,744
Regardless of the reason,

624
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,789
if you bother freshmen one more time,

625
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,459
I'm going to do my best
to ruin your future.

626
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,502
You got that?

627
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:18,757
I'm going to talk to every single freshman
and expose every bad deed you've done.

628
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,677
I'll make sure
you get no reference letter.

629
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,679
If you manage to get a job without it,

630
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:27,391
I'll tell our alumni in the field
about everything you've done,

631
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,643
so brace yourself.

632
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,938
You know I can do anything
I set my mind to.

633
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,399
Hey, but still...

634
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,485
-We're friends--
-The fact that we're friends...

635
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,239
embarrasses me so much.

636
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,576
I really can't stand it.

637
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,413
I'm sorry.

638
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,583
You can leave now.

639
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,446
-Hey.
-Have you eaten yet?

640
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,655
-All right.
-What?

641
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,615
What?

642
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,659
Shall we eat together?

643
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,287
Yes.

644
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,627
It's on me.

645
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,504
Why?

646
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,589
Because I owe you.

647
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:41,965
You owe me?

648
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,344
Stir-fried spicy pork.
You?

649
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,721
You just pressed a button for pork cutlet.

650
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,226
STIR-FRIED SPICY PORK

651
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,652
-Awesome.
-Goodness.

652
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,655
-Did you find out just now?
-I didn't know either.

653
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,242
It's not a big issue,
so why didn't she tell us about it?

654
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:09,660
I know.

655
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,247
-Hi.
-Guys, check this out.

656
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,208
Mi-rae and Kyung-seok went
to the same middle school.

657
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,418
-Is that right?
-I knew it.

658
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,589
That must be why Kyung-seok got
all worked up yesterday.

659
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:27,177
But I don't think they were that close.
I heard he transferred to another school.

660
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:31,223
It's not like they aren't close.
I saw them have a meal together.

661
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,225
-By themselves?
-Yes.

662
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,768
Just saw them in cafeteria.

663
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,979
Seeing how he's so attentive towards her,

664
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,731
I guess Mi-rae wasn't that bad
before her surgery.

665
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,359
Maybe he had a crush on her in the past.

666
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,278
No way.

667
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,197
-I'm 100% sure.
-You have a point.

668
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,994
Are you forcing yourself
to eat pork cutlet?

669
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,621
-Because of me?
-No.

670
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,255
When you said you owed me,
was it about Chan-woo?

671
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,299
Yes.

672
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,344
Thank you.

673
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,476
I thought you'd be mad.
What is it that you want to say?

674
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,565
I hate myself for being like this too.

675
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,568
Judging people by their looks

676
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,194
and labeling them.

677
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,950
People who think you're a cool guy
who lives your own way don't understand...

678
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,328
a life like mine.

679
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,126
I'm sorry...

680
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,421
for talking harshly to you.

681
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,843
You know, what I said about your mindset.

682
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,721
I'm sorry about that.

683
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,640
Well...

684
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,310
What you said about me wasn't wrong.

685
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,900
By the way, do people think I'm cool?

686
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,569
Who said that?

687
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,492
Is that what you think?

688
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:14,868
No.

689
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,790
You were popular back in middle school.
Didn't you know?

690
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,542
I guess I was.

691
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,798
-You're annoying.
-Hey.

692
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,884
-What?
-Have you always thought I was annoying?

693
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,428
No, sorry.

694
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,515
I was just asking.
Are you intimidated again?

695
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,142
-What?
-You keep getting intimidated for nothing.

696
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,313
When did I?

697
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,149
I'm not the one
who easily gets intimidated.

698
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,945
Then live the way you originally were.

699
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,372
PART-TIMERS NEEDED

700
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,626
I've got my health certificate.

701
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,920
I can start working right away.

702
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,551
It's great. Everything is nice,

703
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,846
but your dialect is a bit...

704
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,724
I can fix it right away.

705
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,560
It's quite hard to fix your dialect.

706
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,521
No, I'm very good at speaking
in Seoul accent.

707
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,523
-Look.
-Yes?

708
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,608
There's a pretty girl
in your department?

709
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,819
-Who?
-Was her name Hyun Sua?

710
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:32,738
Sua?

711
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,700
Isn't she interested in working part-time?

712
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,623
I'm Hyun Sua, a freshman chemistry major
in Hankook University.

713
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,375
I see.

714
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,546
I might not be good at working
since it's my first time.

715
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,965
But I'll work hard and learn quickly.

716
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:56,720
There's nothing much to learn.
The way you are now is fine.

717
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,139
-What?
-Just...

718
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:00,974
as you are.

719
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,103
Can you start tomorrow?

720
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,939
Oh, thank you.

721
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,157
Scholarship is the best thing
you can do for your parents.

722
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,617
Let's go out.

723
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:25,749
Really?

724
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,834
Kyung-seok apologized to you first?

725
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,336
Yes.

726
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,161
Hey.

727
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,581
Are you wearing perfume?

728
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,086
Maybe you were mistaken about him.

729
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,922
He might not have laughed at you.

730
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,007
Even if that's the case,

731
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,052
he definitely asked me about the perfume
to pick on me.

732
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,263
I guess he became nice as he grew up.

733
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,100
He didn't tell anyone
that you went to the same school.

734
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,729
Phew, let's go in.

735
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,860
I don't fully get the situation,
but I'm sure he's on your side,

736
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,237
judging by how he taught the senior
a lesson.

737
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,120
What is it?

738
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,454
Is this for real?

739
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,332
I won a ticket to the perfume event.

740
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,168
I thought it was something serious.

741
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,795
Hey, it's awfully hard to win this ticket.

742
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,424
I can bring another person with me.
Let's go together.

743
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,675
No.

744
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,719
Guest performance by Junoflo?

745
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,929
Are you serious? Give me that.

746
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:08,476
It's for real. Hey, take me there.
You must go with me, okay?

747
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,312
No one else to go with anyway.

748
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,189
-You said no.
-Yes, I must go.

749
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,692
Take me for sure, okay?
I'll be your servant!

750
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:18,820
Kyung-seok.

751
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,615
You and Mi-rae went to the same school?

752
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,412
-Who said that?
-Mi-rae.

753
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,708
Sua said that she heard it from Mi-rae.

754
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,420
Why? Is it a secret?

755
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,677
What was that? Does he think
I speak to him because I like him?

756
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:46,932
Pay for this one too.

757
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,896
Did he just order us to pay for him?

758
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,773
Why that little...

759
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,484
He hasn't come to his senses yet.

760
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,779
Should I teach him a lesson?

761
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,449
I can teach him a better lesson
than Kyung-seok.

762
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:10,538
-Please wait.
-Didn't you say you'd treat me?

763
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,210
-Hello.
-I'll pay for theirs too.

764
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,426
Thank you for the food.

765
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,803
-Thank you.
-No problem.

766
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:25,845
Thank you.

767
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,724
That's the true example of a senior.

768
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,819
Annoying punk.

769
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,200
A heated flask is extremely hot.
Never touch it with your bare hands.

770
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,829
A student almost went blind
when heated acid splattered on his eye,

771
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,580
So be extra careful.

772
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,959
Now, come out and take the equipment now.

773
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,798
Those female students with long hair
must tie it up.

774
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,049
Okay.

775
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,838
You asked me not to tell others.

776
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,299
-I don't get it.
-Huh?

777
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,927
They know
that we went to the same school.

778
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,432
I know. They somehow found out.

779
00:55:55,810 --> 00:56:00,315
We converted the volume of Reactant A
to the mole of A.

780
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,985
Don't you think Sua and Kyung-seok
look great together?

781
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,988
Then we calculated the volume
of Reactant B that's needed.

782
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,657
Watch what you say in front of me.

783
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,425
Heat it up to 70Â degreesÂ Celsius
in hot water.

784
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,181
Goodness.

785
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:37,936
You burn your hand?

786
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,855
-No.
-Let me see.

787
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,735
-I'm okay.
-Then why are you hiding it?

788
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,612
Are you hurt?

789
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,782
-No, I just brushed up against it.
-Let me see.

790
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,077
-What happened?
-Did she get hurt?

791
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,914
-You have to be careful.
-Oh, no.

792
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,547
It seems okay,
but cool it down with cold water.

793
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,506
Okay.

794
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,134
I told you not to touch
the hot flask directly.

795
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,302
I'm sorry.

796
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,722
Focus and be careful, everyone.

797
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,391
-Be careful.
-Okay.

798
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,781
Good job today.

799
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,617
Put the equipment in each basket
and return them safely.

800
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,910
-Okay.
-Okay.

801
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,580
Check if we missed anything.

802
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,462
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

803
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,214
-No, I'm okay.
-Give me the flask.

804
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,301
Thank you.

805
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,553
-Give me that too.
-Okay.

806
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,645
Oh my goodness. Are you okay?

807
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,774
What is it?
Hydroxide solution?

808
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,861
Yes, I'm sorry.

809
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:13,072
-Go wash it off and go to the dispensary.
-Okay.

810
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,617
-Watch the glass.
-Hey!

811
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,459
I told you to be careful.

812
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,003
I'm sorry.

813
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,915
What if it was on her face?

814
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,083
Did you drop it?

815
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,418
Is it because of the earlier mistake?

816
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,254
You're so prickly. Impressive.

817
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,922
I can't beat you on that front.

818
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,507
Surprising news. Ta-da.

819
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,468
It's strange.
She isn't in the group picture either.

820
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,761
I wonder why.

821
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:17,679
Mi-rae.

822
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:22,100
Those who help you without
your knowledge are truly nice people.

823
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,686
How's Dad? He doesn't pick up my calls.

824
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,396
Tae-sik!

825
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:27,939
I'm at the perfume event.

826
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:31,276
I searched everywhere.
Kyung-seok and Kyung-hee are not here.

827
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,905
Dad said he'll send me to the States.
I might not miss Dad, but I'll miss you.

828
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,491
It's essential
you and Kyung-seok serve at the bar.

829
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,368
I heard a strange sound again.

830
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,036
Someone was following.

831
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,955
President Na Hye-sung of Kelun.

832
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,999
-She's our alumna.
-What?

833
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,875
She's that woman.

834
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,587
I have something to tell you.

835
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,589
Are you okay? I was worried about you.

836
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,216
-It's none of your business.
-I also hate those

837
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,094
who vent their anger on other people.
