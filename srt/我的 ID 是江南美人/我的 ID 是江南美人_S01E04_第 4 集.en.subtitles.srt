1
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,131
Good job today.

2
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,967
Put the equipment in each basket
and return them safely.

3
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,469
-Okay.
-Okay.

4
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,055
Check if we missed anything.

5
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,853
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

6
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:02,896
No, I'm okay.

7
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,689
Give me the flask.

8
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,275
Thank you.

9
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,195
-Give me that too.
-Okay.

10
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,120
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

11
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,249
What is it?
Hydroxide solution?

12
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,086
Yes, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,547
-Go wash it off and go to the dispensary.
-Okay.

14
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,258
-Watch the glass.
-Hey!

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,433
I told you to be careful.

16
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,019
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,708
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,836
It's okay. It was just a little shard.

19
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,754
Thank god
it wasn't on your face.

20
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,760
-Sua.
-Hey!

21
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,555
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,808
BASED ON THE WEBCOMIC
MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY! BY KI MAENG-GI

23
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,643
Thanks, Won-ho.

24
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:28,022
A box of bandages without ointment?
What was he thinking?

25
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,488
-Take it off carefully.
-I'll go pick up some ointment.

26
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,241
It's okay. The cut isn't deep.

27
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,275
You must love vending machines.

28
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,487
I heard you cleaned up
all the broken glass. I'm sorry.

29
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,114
I didn't do it for you.

30
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,535
You're always so prickly toward me.
I find it quite impressive.

31
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,040
Impressive?
I can't beat you on that front.

32
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,215
-It must be fun.
-What?

33
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,634
Having fun with the guy
who has a crush on you.

34
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,470
That's not what's going on.

35
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,181
-Sua.
-Hey, Sua.

36
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,601
-You got hurt?
-You want me to carry you?

37
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,771
-It's not a big deal.
-Come on, it's a big deal to me.

38
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,148
-Hey, get down.
-No, it's okay.

39
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,066
Get on my back.

40
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,735
-My back is broader.
-No, mine's broader.

41
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,819
-Sua!
-Sua!

42
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,031
Hey, it's fine.
She's fine. She's okay.

43
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,241
I'm okay.

44
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,327
-She's okay! Sua's okay!
-Nice!

45
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,453
Let's go eat.

46
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,251
How's your hand? Is it okay?

47
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,211
Yes.

48
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,547
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,844
-Are you really the one who broke it?
-I am.

50
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,942
Hiring an announcer or something?
Why can't a waitress have a dialect?

51
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,569
How can you fall in love at first sight?

52
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,072
What do you like about him?

53
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,658
He has a beautiful smile.

54
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,953
I didn't know that kind of smile was
considered beautiful.

55
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:52,292
The moment he smiled, I felt a rush
of dopamine spreading through my body.

56
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,671
Dopamine?

57
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,799
Eat up.

58
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,552
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

59
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,430
-No, I'm okay.
-Give me the flask.

60
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,308
Thank you.

61
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,693
Why aren't you eating?

62
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,821
Because of the mistake earlier?

63
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,823
No.

64
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,409
Because the TA yelled at you?

65
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,870
He didn't.
He just told her to be careful.

66
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,877
By the way,

67
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,256
Chan-woo didn't do anything to you
after that incident, did he?

68
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:41,883
No.

69
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:45,386
I wasn't going to tell you this
because it was a private discussion.

70
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,306
Woo-young called me
to his office that day.

71
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,851
Chan-woo gathered all the freshmen
from our year.

72
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,688
He had already heard about what happened.
So I just told him everything.

73
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,443
Well, I told you that wench,
Mi-rae, hit me first.

74
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,364
Do you believe the freshmen's words
over my words?

75
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,573
Hey, Chan-woo.

76
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:13,331
Regardless of the reason,
if you bother freshmen one more time,

77
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,793
I'm going to do my best
to ruin your future.

78
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,964
I'm going to talk to every single freshman
and expose every bad deed you've done.

79
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,301
I'll make sure
you get no reference letter.

80
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,011
Even if you manage to get a job,

81
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,223
I'll tell our alumni in the field
about everything you've done.

82
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,020
Just a moment.
Didn't you say you'll pay for this?

83
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,359
-Hello.
-I'll pay for everything.

84
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,158
Thank you.

85
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,078
-Thank you.
-Sure thing, I'll see you around.

86
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,456
That's the true example of a senior.

87
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,710
I was getting sick of being the rep
and coming to school because of Chan-woo.

88
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,631
But Woo-young made me feel
a lot more comfortable.

89
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,055
I guess I should've told you this.

90
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:21,023
Our one on one customer strategy
started going viral,

91
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,111
and a lot of celebrities promoted
our products via social media.

92
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,030
So we're getting positive results
quicker than expected.

93
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,951
Since our sales have become stable,
we're planning to strengthen

94
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,162
our marketing strategy
by hiring a model.

95
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:38,541
We're gonna increase our brand awareness
to expand our product line and sales.

96
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,420
That way, we'll be able to maintain
our current product costs

97
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,172
and increase sales at the same time.

98
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,090
That sounds great.

99
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:51,387
Perfumes rely on individual satisfaction
rather than other people's opinions.

100
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,223
So I want to keep the characteristics
of our products.

101
00:07:54,891 --> 00:08:00,480
Please continue developing our brand
without losing our brand's characteristic.

102
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,316
And consider making affiliate brands.

103
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,193
Okay.

104
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,072
Next, a briefing
about the perfume sampling event.

105
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,538
Let's go.

106
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,081
-Hello.
-Hello.

107
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,919
I can't believe you're a professor.

108
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,087
My gosh.

109
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:11,092
I still remember that you got scolded
for pretending to be MacGyver in the lab.

110
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,136
Yes, I remember.
You're the one who started it.

111
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,471
Really?

112
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,975
Let me see. You haven't changed at all.

113
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,810
You've become more cheerful.

114
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,603
I've aged a lot.

115
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,980
You look nice.

116
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,606
Hello, professor.

117
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,734
Hey, I'm glad I ran into you.

118
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,946
Remember the thesis I sent you last time?
He wrote it.

119
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,699
Oh, really?

120
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,702
Hello.

121
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:52,091
I was getting sick of being the rep
and coming to school because of Chan-woo.

122
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,261
But Woo-young made me
feel a lot more comfortable.

123
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,437
Hi, Mom.

124
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,106
You're eating lunch now?

125
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,359
I had a busy schedule.
Having a lot of work to do is good.

126
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,862
I'll do part-time jobs
for the surgery bills,

127
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,196
so don't work too hard.

128
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:20,036
Hearing you say that is more than enough.
Just focus on studying and have fun.

129
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,289
-What about Dad?
-What about him?

130
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,000
He doesn't pick up my calls.

131
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,794
-A combo menu, please.
-Okay.

132
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,800
-Mom?
-Right.

133
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,054
Don't worry.

134
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,098
He'll call you soon,
so give him some time.

135
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,852
Okay.

136
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,608
Hey, what are you doing here?

137
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,027
You're here.

138
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,571
-Hey.
-Yes?

139
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,073
Take a photo of me.

VOICE MESSAGE

141
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,551
Mi-rae told me
that she'll pay the surgery installment.

142
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,596
Hearing her say that almost made me cry.

143
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,183
Is this how you show your love
to your daughter?

144
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,773
I get that you're upset.

145
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,943
But what can you do?
What's done is done.

146
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,279
There is only so much I can tolerate.

147
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:42,243
You haven't sent me living expenses yet.
Are you just going to abandon your family?

Honey, honey! Tae-sik!

150
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,770
You should at least eat!

151
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,692
One bulgogi combo, please.

152
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,819
We have one bulgogi combo.

153
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,911

Are you kidding me?

158
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,925
Why did you upload the photo?

159
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,676
You hate taking pictures with me.

160
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,262
Only to gain more followers.

161
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,889
It's lame, but what can I do?

162
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,477
You don't smoke, right?

163
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,689
I should quit.

164
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,826
Do you actually smoke?

165
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,579
Did you buy that? You're so gullible.

166
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,041
Dad will send me to the States.

167
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,461
I obviously won't get
into the best colleges like you.

168
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,839
He'll send me
to some no-name school there.

169
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,883
-Did you tell him that you'd go?
-I can't disobey him.

170
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,427
Don't go if you don't want to.

171
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,682
Well, I don't really dislike the idea.

172
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,768
My allowance will probably go up
if I move there.

173
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,859
You know what though?
I might not miss Dad,

174
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,236
but I think I'll miss you.

175
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,904
NA HYE-SUNG APPOINTED
AS PRESIDENT OF HANKOOK KELUN

176
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,374
Hey, that is so cool.

177
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,126
Gosh, that hurts.

178
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,379
Forget those who act helpful to your face.

179
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,799
Those who help you without your knowledge
are truly nice people.

180
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,721
Did you just hear that?

181
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,264
Hear what?

182
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,433
There's someone behind us.

183
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,520
There's nobody.

184
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:40,940
I'm scared.

185
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,567
Why are you scared?
No one is following us.

186
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,737
That's why I'm scared.
I heard something, but there's no one.

187
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,322
Here we go again.

188
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,574
Hey, you smell poop
when there's no one?

189
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,576
And cigarette smoke
when you're alone?

190
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:59,041
You'd better take me seriously.
Be careful on your way home, okay?

191
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,543
What's with you these days?
Gosh, it hurts.

192
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,962
-Come on. Let's go.
-Gosh.

193
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:07,341
Jesus said he considers those who listen
to and live by God's word his family.

194
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,802
According to his teachings,

195
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,805
we must sacrifice ourselves
in and out of the church

196
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,474
like a grain of wheat
that gladly sacrifices itself.

197
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:20,479
We must also live the kind of life
where we can nourish our children.

198
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,898
In this day and age,

199
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,318
the tougher things get in life,
the more you need your family

200
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,654
who's there to support you.

201
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,283
With that said, I'd like to introduce
someone who's here.

202
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,747
He lets his faith lead and guide him
every single day.

203
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,835
It's Congressman Do Sang-won.

204
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,591
I'm sure some of you already know.

205
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,387
He's a single dad,
and the government keeps him busy.

206
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:59,852
But he's raised his two children
to be brilliant and polite.

207
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,540
Thank you very much for your kind words
about my family.

208
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:26,420
Good luck with the by-election.
I'll be praying for you.

209
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,007
I'm always so grateful for you.

210
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,634
I wouldn't be where I am now
without your prayers.

211
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,511
It is my absolute pleasure.

212
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,266
I heard your son got into
Hankook University. Congratulations.

213
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,728
We owe it all to Buddha's mercy.

214
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,606
The merciful Buddha.

215
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,151
So what is our religion?

216
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,571
What do you think?
Whichever is believed by more people.

217
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,673
Hello, welcome to our shop.

218
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,684
-Hello, welcome.
-Hello.

219
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,195
Hello, welcome to our shop.

220
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,780
-Hello.
-Hello.

221
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,492
Hey, come here.

222
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,122
Do you think each guest
is getting one of these?

223
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,083
We may be able to get another one
if we take one now.

224
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,794
We're poor students,
but let's not do that, okay?

225
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,304
-This is awesome.
-I know.

226
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,722
Hey, look. Isn't that...

227
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,266
Mi-rae.

228
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,855
-Hello.
-What are you doing here?

229
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,731
I won tickets to this event.

230
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,197
Oh, this is my friend.
He's our TA.

231
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,283
That cool guy?

232
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,828
-Hello.
-Hello, it's nice to meet you.

233
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,745
Woo-young.

234
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:39,011
Her doe eyes, perfectly defined nose,
and flawless skin.

235
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,972
She's a perfect natural beauty.

236
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,933
100 out of 100.

237
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,479
I did it again without even realizing it.

238
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,856
Hello.

239
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,566
Welcome.

240
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,613
Could she be...

241
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,709
Oh, she's a freshman at our school.
This is her friend.

242
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,464
This is Ms. Na Hye-sung,
the president of Kelun Korea.

243
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,841
-She's our alumna.
-What?

244
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,678
Hello.

245
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,097
It's nice to meet you.

246
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,309
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

247
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,620
-Yes.
-Sir, it's me, Young-mo.

248
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,579
Yes, what's up?

249
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,957
I'm tailing her at the moment.

250
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,333
Hey, hold on.

251
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,504
Yes, go on.

252
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,130
She's at a perfume event.

253
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,133
I looked everywhere
but didn't see Kyung-seok or Kyung-hee.

254
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,137
They're with me now.

255
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,017
Kyung-seok, can I use your phone?
My battery is dead.

256
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,603
Kyung-hee, how did you do
on your midterms?

257
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,522
It hasn't even begun yet.

258
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,651
Have you been studying English hard?

259
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,362
Yes.

260
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,782
NA HYE-SUNG APPOINTED
AS PRESIDENT OF HANKOOK KELUN

261
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,743
Wait, give it back for a second.

262
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,794
NA HYE-SUNG APPOINTED
AS PRESIDENT OF HANKOOK KELUN

263
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,929
Will you join a research lab
after completing your master's degree?

264
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,975
That was my plan, but I'm considering
becoming a patent attorney.

265
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,771
Independent labs keep shutting down.
Everything is owned by big companies.

266
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,773
It's okay to keep your options open.

267
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,275
Your heart will lead you
to the right path.

268
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,277
Yes.

269
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,995
Hello.

270
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,166
Thank you.

271
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,046
Thank you.

272
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,258
-I'm a fan.
-Hello. Thank you.

273
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,885
-What's your name?
-Hyun-jung.

274
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,139
TO HYUN-JUNG

275
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,975
It seemed like you knew how to rap.

276
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,728
Pardon? Oh, I like rap music.

277
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,022
Oh, really? That's what's up.

278
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,069
If I send you a mix tape,
would you listen to it?

279
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,155
Yes, of course. I'll have a listen.

280
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,532
-Okay, thank you.
-Thanks.

281
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,098
I heard you won the event ticket.

282
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,726
You must be interested in perfumes.

283
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:42,105
Yes. My dream is to become a perfumer.

284
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,734
Really? Is that why you decided
to major in chemistry?

285
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,402
Yes.

286
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,363
Really? I majored in chemistry
for the same reason.

287
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,240
Since when?

288
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,956
Ever since I read a magazine
in middle school.

289
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,128
I'd like to thank everyone
for attending today's event.

290
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,174
I'm Lee Soo-hyun,
the director of Kelun Korea.

291
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,219
Your payment is complete.
I'll call you once it's ready.

292
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,261
Okay.

293
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,766
One Americano, please.

294
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,100
-One Americano?
-Sua.

295
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,686
-You can sit down.
-Oh, thank you.

296
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,357
One Americano?

297
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,691
-Yes.
-Okay.

298
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,486
When do you finish?

299
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,488
I still have an hour left.

300
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,406
I have great news.

301
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,492
JARYONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

302
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,410
That's...

303
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,330
It's time
for President Na Hye-sung's speech.

304
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,046
Hello, I'm Na Hye-sung.

305
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,931
I thought about what I should say to you.

306
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,725
And thanks to a young lady I met just now,

307
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,729
I was reminded of what I wrote
in a magazine a long time ago.

308
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,150
"The true beauty of perfume lies
in the fact

309
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,987
that it can't be seen.

310
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:18,577
Scent is the one and only beautiful thing
that can be felt with your eyes closed.

311
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:23,707
I believe this intangible beauty will be
somewhat of a consolation

312
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,669
to those who are sick of this world
that only focuses on outer beauty."

313
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:35,552
I think we are blessed to be able to love
this intangible beauty called scent.

314
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,638
I hope you all enjoy your time.

315
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,559
And thank you so much
for coming to our event.

316
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,862
You did great.

317
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,323
-Hello.
-Welcome.

318
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,824
I really liked your speech.

319
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,952
Ta-da. Isn't this amazing?

320
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,331
Junoflo told me that he'll listen
to my mix tape if I send one.

321
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,751
What's wrong?

322
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,591
That's her.

323
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,385
KANG MI-RAE

324
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,180
Isn't it weird? She's not even
in the group photo.

325
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,098
Is it her?

326
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,685
Maybe she was absent on the day
they took photos.

327
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,813
Don't people normally hand in
another photo?

328
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,065
No one leaves it blank.

329
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,488
I think she used to hate taking photos.

330
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,573
I wonder why.

331
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,242
Maybe she used to look like a monster.

332
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,994
Gosh, come on.

333
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:51,378
Why don't you just tell her
that you're the one who wrote it?

334
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,922
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

335
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,178
I wrote that I was sick of the world
that only focused on outer beauty,

336
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,723
and that's why I came to like perfumes.

337
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:07,435
What would she say once she finds out
that I got plastic surgery done?

338
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,605
Mi-rae.

339
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,400
What's your plan for today?

340
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,568
I'd like to treat you to dinner.

341
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,615
I'm sorry. I'm a little busy today.

342
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,494
No, it's okay. Don't be sorry.
I'll see you at school then.

343
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,371
See you next time.

344
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,791
Hey, Woo-young.

345
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,211
I'm sorry for the last time.

346
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,587
What are you talking about?

347
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,759
You tried to help me that night
at the party, but I...

348
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:45,223
When you spilled water on me?
That's fine. Don't worry about it.

349
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,267
I'll see you guys.

350
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,690
-See you next time.
-I'll see you again at school.

351
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,567
I'm going to go home.

352
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,987
I need to write the lyrics
when I'm inspired.

353
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,949
Okay. You should write
about how I feel as well.

354
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,034
Bye.

355
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,919
I'll see you at work.

356
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,803
I could make a good speech
thanks to you. Thanks.

357
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:27,390
No, you're the one who wrote it.

358
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,767
That's why I'm grateful.

359
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,603
The first and last time I wrote
anything in a magazine,

360
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:35,690
but you remembered it until now.
Gosh, I'm so touched.

361
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,156
Would you like to eat dinner with me
if you're free?

362
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,741
Pardon?

363
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:48,703
Do you feel uncomfortable about it
when we just met today?

364
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,832
No, not at all.
I'd love to.

365
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,084
-Really?
-Yes.

366
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,129
Does the food street
in front of our school still exist?

367
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,218
Our school's surrounded by food streets.

368
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,767
I used to walk here like this.

369
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:11,976
Why?

370
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,063
Why do you think? Because I was drunk.

371
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,359
Do you drink, Mi-rae?

372
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,654
Just a little.

373
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,281
Then let's skip dinner
and go drink right away.

374
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,951
You can choose where we should go.

375
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,705
I don't know that many bars.

376
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,041
I don't mind going anywhere.

377
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,841
I'm busy, and I'm also really lonely.

378
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,718
I don't have a girlfriend.
Show me some pity.

379
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,346
You need to do this alone
to reduce labor costs.

380
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,016
That's not for you to say.
You get paid a lot.

381
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,561
Just get over here.

382
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,730
Welcome. Is it just you two?

383
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,773
Yes.

384
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,191
Hey.

385
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,360
-Hello.
-Hi.

386
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,403
Please sit down.

387
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,989
-This way.
-Okay.

388
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,748
Where are you going at this hour?

389
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,335
Yoo-jin asked me for help.

390
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,509
I really don't understand that punk.

391
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,137
I'll see you when I get back.

392
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,308
Always be careful of your actions.

393
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,607
Today's event was really incredible.

394
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,526
I've never been to an event like that
in my life.

395
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,951
I can't drink that well yet.

396
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,746
I also want to drink well.

397
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,257
I reread what I had written,

398
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,344
and I realized
that it was just full of bluff.

399
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,973
The trend and some other stuff
that I didn't really mean.

400
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:19,187
But I came to my senses
as soon as I talked to you.

401
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,190
I realized that I'm just someone
who likes perfumes

402
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,734
more than I am a businesswoman.

403
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,863
Here you go.

404
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,372
I always drink my shots in one go.

405
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,041
This is why they say
it's hard to change old habits.

406
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,001
I think it's great.

407
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,087
I've aged and deteriorated in many ways,

408
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,383
but I'm still good at drinking.

409
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,343
I envy you so much.

410
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,053
Why?

411
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,724
Because you're living your dream.

412
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,611
Being envious...

413
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,116
is also a sad thing.

414
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:21,290
Being envious of something
that's ordinary, not extraordinary...

415
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,044
is sad.

416
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,469
Hey, you over there.

417
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,556
-I said your face must show.
-Gosh, seriously.

418
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,016
What is her problem?

419
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,727
Her face is.
No wonder she wants to hide it.

420
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,729
It's too hot. I'm getting annoyed.

421
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,813
Hey, Kang Orc.

422
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,190
I'll kill you
if you tell that you like me.

423
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,817
You'd better not tell anyone.

424
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:02,415
Being envious of something
that's ordinary, not extraordinary...

425
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,877
is sad.

426
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,949
Mi-rae.

427
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:39,994
Yes.

428
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,295
Mom, I said it's okay.

429
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,256
Come on, it's fine. Give it to me.

430
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,135
Gosh, it's so heavy. Let's go, son.

431
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,019
Hey, you. You got here fast.

432
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,191
Ms. Na.

433
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,319
I have something to tell you.

434
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,536
What are you doing? Get to work already.

435
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,248
Huh?

436
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,772
He's my classmate.

437
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,483
-This is--
-What are you...

438
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,777
doing here?

439
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,580
You've grown up so much.

440
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,967
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can help out today.

441
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,677
Hey.

442
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,637
Kyung-seok.

443
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,097
Do Kyung-seok.

444
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,450
I'm his mom.

445
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,661
Pardon me?

446
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,383
Kyung-seok.

447
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,763
See you later.

448
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,735
I'm sorry for leaving like this.

449
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,321
It's okay. Please get home safely.

450
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,658
-I'll see you around.
-Okay.

451
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,334
-Let go.
-No.

452
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,254
Let go! Let go of me, please.

453
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,922
Let go!

454
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:24,969
I'm not a flower.
I said, I'm not a flower! Let go.

455
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,556
-Come to your senses, please!
-Let go of me.

456
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,310
Let go!

457
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:34,854
No.

458
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,232
I told you to let go of me...

459
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,486
Let go. Please let go of me!

460
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,439
This is so nice.

461
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,468
People might seem
like they're living a worry-free life.

462
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,889
But they're all just trying their best
to keep living.

463
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,879
Hi, Mom.

464
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:27,883
Where's Dad?

465
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:34,014
Well, just because I miss you two.

466
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,525
Hello?

467
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,152
-Yes?
-What's wrong?

468
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,696
It's nothing.

469
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,451
Don't starve yourself
trying to lose weight.

470
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,120
Okay. I'll call you again soon.

471
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,164
All right, good night.

472
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,837
ONE NEW MESSAGE

473
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,595
5,000,000 WON DEPOSITED
BY KANG TAE-SIK

474
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,185
What on earth is this about?

475
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,658
Hey, it's me, Eun-shim.

476
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,994
Did you talk to Tae-sik today
by any chance?

477
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,205
No?

478
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,585
Gosh, I don't even know.
He hasn't been coming home.

479
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,936
You're here.
Can you take a look at this for me?

480
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,981
Did you talk about it?

481
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,027
What's wrong? Did she not remember?

482
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,697
I didn't tell her.

483
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,115
Why?

484
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,577
We weren't in the right mood
to bring up the subject.

485
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,957
By the way, I heard some noise
on my way back again.

486
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,708
-Again?
-Yes.

487
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,046
It felt like someone was following me.

488
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,577
ALUMNI ASSOCIATION
OF JARYONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

489
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,996
SEARCH RESULTS FOR NA HYE-SUNG

490
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,292
PRESIDENT OF KELUN KOREA

491
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:39,385
SHE WAS DIVORCED FROM THE FORMER
CONGRESSMAN, DO SANG-WON, TEN YEARS AGO.

492
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,160
Your  postures are the same,
but feel totally different.

493
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,414
Forget it.
You'll only get compared to him.

494
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,618
You've grown up so much.

495
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,802
What's going on between them?

496
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,100
Can we talk for a while?

497
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,316
Did you get home safely last night?

498
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,151
How do you know that woman?

499
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,320
That woman?

500
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:25,449
I met her for the first time
at the perfume event that day.

501
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,455
Our TA was there, too.

502
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,541
He introduced me to her,
saying she was our alumna.

503
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,420
You drink with someone you met
for the first time?

504
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,340
Well...

505
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:46,720
It happened that way
by accident after the event.

506
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,097
Is that all?

507
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,474
Yes.

508
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,060
She left right after that as well.

509
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,190
Are you okay?

510
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,445
I was worried.

511
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,241
Why would you be?
It's none of your business.

512
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,745
Don't tell others.

513
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,082
I won't. Why would I tell such a thing
to others?

514
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:19,086
You asked me not to tell that we went
to the same school, but you revealed it.

515
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:24,967
Well, that's because that was my problem.
It didn't harm you either.

516
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,846
Are you the type
who changes words like that too?

517
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,725
I hate those...

518
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,313
who don't keep their promises.

519
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,448
I also hate those...

520
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,412
who vent their anger on others.

521
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,255
Anyway,

522
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,466
I won't care, so don't worry.

523
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:51,511
What are you... doing here?

524
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,896
You've grown up so much.

525
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,316
Hi.

526
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:54,324
Kyung-seok. You know the "exam notes"
passed down from seniors, right?

527
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:59,037
I have a really helpful one,
different from the others. You want it?

528
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,164
No.

529
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,041
Okay.

530
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,088
Are you leaving?

531
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:10,924
I need to eat.

532
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,222
That chic personality of his
is getting annoying.

533
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,935
Thank you.

534
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:36,324
-Finally, exam period is over.
-It's over?

535
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,661
-Did you do well on your tests?
-Of course not.

536
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,871
Let's go eat first.

537
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,290
-Deal.
-But I'm sleepy.

538
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,751
-Come on.
-Let's eat.

539
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,341
PRODUCT NAME: WAX

540
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,227
-This one smells nice.
-It's really nice.

541
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,605
How much will you sell it for?

542
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:11,068
9,900 won seems a bit cheap,
so I'll make it 10,000 won.

543
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,905
Then how many of them
should you sell a month?

544
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:20,077
If I work part-time for 4 hours,
it's 30,120 won.

545
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,120
I should sell at least 60.

546
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,873
Do you think you'll be able to?

547
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,043
I'll raise the price for the ones
with a bigger size.

548
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,630
If it's not enough,
I should get another part-time job.

549
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,510
It's 71,600 won.

550
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,892
Oh... Well...

551
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,021
Can't you give us a little discount?

552
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,233
Check the other stores.
Our place is the cheapest.

553
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:56,029
Still, we came all the way here
instead of buying items online.

554
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,783
Hey, try acting cute. Hurry.

555
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:00,909
What?

556
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,996
Sir, we plan to sell products,

557
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,290
so we're going to come really often
from now on.

558
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,668
It's the cheapest.

559
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,630
What are you doing?

560
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:26,434
Please give us a 100 won discount
for each item. Please?

561
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,862
Come on.

562
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,160
Okay, I'll do that.

563
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,414
Thank you.

564
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,921
Oh my gosh.

565
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,389
I actually wanted to do it
once in my life.

566
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,059
"Mister, please give me a discount."

567
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,687
Shut up.

568
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,274
But you told me to act cute.
Aren't I cute?

569
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,443
-Goodness.
-Hey.

570
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,944
Don't do it forever.

571
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,614
I'm telling you.

572
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,533
MS. NA HYE-SUNG

573
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,124
Hello?

574
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,252
Yes, I'm doing great.

575
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,214
I finished my mid-terms.

576
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,055
Pardon?

577
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:48,016
I know it's a difficult thing to ask,
and I'm sorry.

578
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,394
But please.

579
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,357
What? My goodness.

580
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,818
She's Kyung-seok's mom?

581
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,278
Yes.

582
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,740
I guess
good looks are genetically inherited.

583
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,078
Did his parents get divorced then?

584
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,250
Why doesn't he want to see his mom though?

585
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,919
I don't know.

586
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,257
So what are you going to do?

587
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,513
I'd do it if I were you.

588
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,100
She saved your life,
so what's there you can't do for her?

589
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,936
Don't say that.

590
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,274
It's hard for me to say no to her as well.

591
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,318
So don't say such a thing.

592
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,197
That's right. You're good.

593
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,324
Nice job.

594
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,661
Look.

595
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:53,790
Fill 20 percent of the glass with foam.
Nice and neat like that.

596
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,208
One more glass?

597
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,676
Glaring like that will only hurt
your eyes.

598
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,563
A glass of water, please.

599
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,148
You already have it.

600
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,233
I mean, warm water.

601
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,402
Do you drink warm water with beer?

602
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,404
That's up to me.

603
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,659
Did you see her
throw a fit at her customer?

604
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,120
Let's just go.

605
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,085
-Do Kyung-seok.
-Huh? Kyung-seok.

606
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,879
-Are you alone?
-Yes.

607
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,672
Sit here then.

608
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:43,923
Hi, Kyung-seok.

609
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,551
Let's sit over there.

610
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,222
Give us two glasses of beer.

611
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,309
Is he trying to avoid me now?

612
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,228
You're making me want to avoid you too.

613
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,109
Thank you.

614
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,710
Why is my business so slow
when the mid-terms are over?

615
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,922
It went all right in the beginning,
but not anymore.

616
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,842
Maybe my father's prayer is working.

617
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,678
Prayer for you to fail?

618
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:31,846
Don't get me started.

619
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:35,350
He keeps talking about
"The Return of the Prodigal Son."

620
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,520
He must be waiting for you
with a feast.

621
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:42,941
I should be the one who prepares the feast
by becoming successful somehow.

622
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,777
But my mother's counting on me.

623
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,824
Oh, Lord, please.

624
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,119
Come on... huh?

625
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,206
It's not my phone.

626
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:04,129
Check your phone already
if you know you got a message.

627
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,964
It could be from Kyung-hee.

628
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,971
KANG MI-RAE

629
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,390
CAN WE MEET TOMORROW?

630
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,941
Hasn't she contacted you yet?

631
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,325
Let's not talk about it.

632
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:52,594
GENES OF HANKOOK

633
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,805
FROM MAY 15TH TO 17TH

634
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,515
I hope Twice comes.

635
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,018
Twice.

636
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:10,403
-Sua.
-Oh, hello.

637
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,114
It is essential
you and Kyung-seok serve at the bar.

638
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,324
What?

639
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,493
-We'll do it too.
-Well, right.

640
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,287
-We might not need your help.
-Right.

641
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,959
Why is it essential for me?

642
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,671
Because you're the face of our campus.

643
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:33,134
Exactly. I want to help her.

644
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,594
Why would they stop me?

645
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,224
Stop hitting on Sua already.

646
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,935
If you want to copy Kyung-seok,
do it right.

647
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,728
Be chic.

648
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:01,579
How were your mid-terms?

649
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:03,998
They were okay.

650
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,300
Would you like to have a drink?

651
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,792
I smiled only once in my middle school
life. It was because of you.

652
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,043
I must be crazy.

653
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,920
There's a beauty among the freshmen?

654
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,422
How about Kang Mi-rae?

655
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,675
Can you help us serve at the bar
during the festival?

656
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,386
What about Mi-rae? She must be in it.

657
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,471
She's the goddess of Hankook University.

658
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,724
Why did she like your picture?

659
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:06,561
I thought you didn't know each other
at first because you acted like that.

660
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:09,772
-What do you do during the festival?
-The festival? I'm not sure.

661
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,649
I'm a bit busy these days.

662
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,693
You're the TA of Mi-rae's department.

663
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,403
How about some beer later today?

664
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,655
It'd be nice if we tell Mi-rae to join us.

665
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,866
We have a good selection of servers.

666
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,994
Sua is feminine while Mi-rae is sexy.

667
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,038
That woman came back to Korea.

668
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,665
She had an affair
and abandoned her children.

669
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,876
I know you won't see her.

670
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:30,793
Mi-rae.

671
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,754
Come over at a housewarming party.

672
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,797
-Didn't you say you were busy?
-Huh?

673
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,382
When will you hold the party?

674
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,594
Are you really coming?
Or is there someone you like among them?
