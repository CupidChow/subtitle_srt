1
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,521
Are you surprised?

2
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:05,690
What?

3
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,070
A little.

4
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,616
Sorry.

5
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,284
Oh, no.

6
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,162
That's not it.

7
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,423
Should we... sleep now?

8
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,677
What?

9
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,221
Huh?

10
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,973
Oh, no.

11
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,268
That's not what I meant.

12
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,063
I mean sleep, literally.

13
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,154
I didn't say anything.

14
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,120
I'll sleep here...

15
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,871
BASED ON THE WEBCOMIC
MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY! BY KI MAENG-GI

16
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,873
...and catch the first bus. So, you go.

17
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,251
No, I'll go with you.

18
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,506
It'll be uncomfortable for you.

19
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,758
It's fine. Don't worry.

20
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,426
Maybe you can change.

21
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,140
My dad's clothes won't fit you.

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,851
I'm fine. Just go to bed.

23
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,270
You won't sleep much.

24
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,440
Okay.

25
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,403
I'll go to sleep,
so you can sleep, too.

26
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,614
Good night.

27
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,659
Okay. Good night.

28
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,726
This doesn't feel real.

29
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,354
It's not a dream, but it feels like one.

30
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,365
Oh, that was my first kiss.

31
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,573
Oh, right!

32
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,384
Sorry.

33
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:22,720
It's okay.

34
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:26,849
Good night.

35
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,477
Okay.

36
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,270
She left her phone here.

38
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,963
Is everything really okay?
I'm worried.

INCOMING CALL: MOM

40
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,934
Hello?

41
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,521
Mi-rae, are you there?

42
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,858
Hello?

43
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,569
Oh, dear. Who are you?

44
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,989
-Don't be scared.
-Who is this?

45
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,617
I am Do Kyung-seok.

46
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,788

48
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,214
Hello.

49
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,842
Why did you answer Mi-rae's phone?

50
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,179
She is... sleeping right now.

51
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,264
What? Where?

52
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,059
In her room. I'm in the living room.

53
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,654
But... why are you there?

54
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,408
We came here together,
and I missed the last bus.

55
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,952
Just the two of you?

56
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,913
Yes.

57
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,665
What's your relationship with Mi-rae?

58
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,169
I'm her boyfriend.

59
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,505
-You?
-Yes.

60
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,633
You're going out with Mi-rae?

61
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,259
Yes.

62
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,055
So, you two are dating?

63
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,014
Yes.

64
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,017
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to surprise you.

65
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,772
What are you doing out here?

66
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,107
Good night, then.

67
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,157
Who was that?

68
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,618
Mi-rae's boyfriend.

69
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,746
-What?
-Do you know who he is?

70
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,750
That super-handsome boy!

VIDEO CALL

72
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,949
It's true.

73
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,618
Hi.

74
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,580
-So, you're dating Mi-rae?
-Yes.

75
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,541
I will tell you one thing.

76
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,793
We have CCTV at home.

77
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,839
It records everything.

78
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,425
Good night, then.

79
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,895
What time is it?

80
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,197
Oh, no. I have to wash up
and put on make-up again.

81
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,247
I slept without washing my face.
My skin must look so bad.

82
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,878
I can't show him my bare skin.

83
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,527
Why is he sleeping like that?
It must be uncomfortable.

84
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,701
Where's the CCTV?

85
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:44,870
You're awake?

86
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,914
Where's the CCTV?

87
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,332
CCTV?

88
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,586
What are you talking about?
What kind of home has that?

89
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,388
What's the matter?

90
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,223
Did you have a dream?

91
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,475
I'm gonna sleep ten more minutes.

92
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,035
Drive slow. They left already.

93
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,874
Why did Dad say that?
Kyung-seok couldn't sleep.

94
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,460
Why? Did he do something?

95
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,380
He didn't do anything.

96
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,800
You can't really speak
because he's right next you?

97
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,386
Yeah.

98
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,472
I'll talk to you later, then. Bye.

99
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,441
So, they don't like me?

100
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,027
Weren't you sleeping?

101
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,280
I shouldn't have said hi that way.

102
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,034
They must've not liked me.
That's why your dad mentioned the CCTV.

103
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,706
-I shouldn't have answered the phone.
-Why? Are you worried?

104
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,208
Of course.

105
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,378
I've never seen you care
about someone so much.

106
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,635
Of course. They're not just anyone.

107
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,345
They're your parents.

108
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,518
They're just curious
because I have a boyfriend.

109
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,187
-That's all?
-Yes.

110
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,815
So, don't worry and sleep.

111
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,282
You didn't sleep much, either.
Aren't you tired?

112
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,828
A little bit.

113
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,415
Lean here.

114
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,961
-What?
-Lean on me and get some sleep.

115
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,934
You can lean over, too.

116
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,789
It's obviously a hidden camera.
Why can't it be deleted?

117
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,750
-Are you the one in the picture?
-Well...

118
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,427
If it's a domestic site,
can't it be shut down?

119
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:51,557
We also consider this a harmful site.
But it's hard to shut it down.

120
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,893
We can block the domain
so no one can access it.

121
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,107
And what if they post the picture
publicly or re-upload it?

122
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,568
We track down and delete the photos.

123
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,989
You can file a complaint as a proxy,
but the victim has to testify anyway.

124
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,208
Hello?

125
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,555
Hi.

126
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,683
It's been a while.

127
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,026
Who said this is me? Jang Won-ho?

128
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,654
-Jo Jung-yeob?
-Does Jung-yeob know about this,?

129
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,699
Won-ho!

130
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,118
Did he spread the rumor?

131
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,162
No. He came to see me
because he was worried about you.

132
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,373
He told me that he would not say
a word to anyone.

133
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,791
How can I trust him?

134
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,669
Sua.

135
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,714
I don't want to make you worry
for no reason.

136
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,133
Wouldn't you be worried
if you just let it be like this?

137
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,553
Don't you want to find who did this
and take them to court?

138
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,516
The police will investigate
if they consider this a crime.

139
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,811
I called, but they said
this is not considered a crime.

140
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,397
So, the victim has to testify.

141
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,025
Victim?

142
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,317
What?

143
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,530
No. I don't want to be
one of those weird girls.

144
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,616
Why is the victim weird?
Whoever filmed you is weird.

145
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,871
They did something wrong. But I'm the one
who has to deal with the rumors.

146
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,167
Don't you know victims get harassed
after talking to the police?

147
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,543
It makes more pictures circulate.

148
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,421
That's why we have to investigate,
so it can stop.

149
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,882
The police can track down
and delete the photos.

150
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,092
They can trace the download
and catch the culprit.

151
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,178
And...

152
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,806
we can ask them not to make big noise
during the investigation.

153
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,977
Once the police finds out who did this,
they'll arrest them. So, no worries.

154
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,605
No.

155
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,154
I don't want to do that.
Just leave me alone, please.

156
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,118
-Bye.
-Sua.

157
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,175
You were asleep when I came back.

158
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,843
I wasn't late.

159
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,932
Let's have dinner after freshening up?

160
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,934
Okay. That sounds good.

161
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,144
-See you later.
-Okay.

162
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,278
-Hello?
-Yes.

163
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,823
You hang up first.

164
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,491
No, you first.

165
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,492
No.

166
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,702
Then, I will hang up first.

167
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,788
See you later.

168
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,289
Okay.

169
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,420
I did not know hanging up the phone
would be this difficult.

170
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,178
HI!

171
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,110
What's up?

172
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,904
My friend said she needs to tell me
something about Sua.

173
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,615
Let's just meet tomorrow.

174
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,119
What's there to talk about Sua?

175
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,830
Sua is not well, you know.

176
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,667
I'll just listen and come home.

177
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,046
Don't go.

178
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,009
Don't worry.
I'll call you when I get back.

179
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:32,147
Maybe she didn't like you
because of those bad memories.

180
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,446
I know Sua
has done a lot of things to you.

181
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,323
She must have.

182
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,079
It was hard
because I liked her in the beginning.

183
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,793
Even though I am a girl,

184
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,381
I felt nervous in front of Sua
because she's so pretty.

185
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,926
When she told me we were friends,

186
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,178
I was very happy.

187
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,932
I'm ashamed now.

188
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,310
But I felt pretty, too,

189
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,147
because a pretty girl was my friend.

190
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,781
Anyway, there is nothing I can do
for her now.

191
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,950
And I don't want to.

192
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,163
Of course. I understand.

193
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,457
Maybe not now,

194
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,168
but if you could still be her friend...

195
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,880
that would change Sua's life.

196
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:47,431
If I can't even change my own life,

197
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,642
how could I change someone else's?

198
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,812
The wounds caused by other people

199
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,606
get cured by people.

200
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,403
I don't understand that very well.
However, it's obvious...

201
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,574
that the person who can make
the greatest impact on Sua

202
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,286
is not Kyung-seok,
or anyone else for that matter.

203
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,581
It is you.

204
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,838
Sua is not well, you know.

205
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,008
I'll just listen and come home.

206
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,636
Stop being so nice.

207
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,201
Is something wrong?

208
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,079
No, nothing.

209
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,628
Kyung-seok!

210
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,173
Is anyone at school following Sua?

211
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,510
Jang Won-ho?

212
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,056
No, never mind.

213
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,485
-Hello?
-Where are you?

214
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,196
I'm in Eun's neighborhood.

215
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,492
You don't have to pick me up.

216
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,082
Okay.

217
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,759
I won't forgive you.

218
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,096
Why did you mess with me?

219
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,516
All you have is your face.

220
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,810
I know where you live.

221
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,146
I will do it and prove it tonight.

222
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,168
Next time,
I'll get you cat food, not this.

223
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,004
You like this.

224
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,482
Do you live around here?

225
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,193
You despised me.

226
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,694
What?

227
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,416
Apologize.

228
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:16,640
Kyung-seok likes you
more than you like him, right?

229
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:21,520
No, it is not like more or less.

230
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,231
The feelings cannot be equal.

231
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,651
Usually, the person
who has stronger feelings calls,

232
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,361
wants to meet, and gets mad.

233
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,695
Gets mad?

234
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,531
You guys haven't fought yet, right?

235
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,327
I think we did before we dated.

236
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,621
I'm not sure it was exactly a fight.

237
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,376
Yes, Woo-young.

238
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,088
Sua?

239
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,884
Yes, I live close by.

240
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,430
Have you seen Sua today?

241
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,391
-Why do you ask?
-Nothing.

242
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,434
I wanted to ask her something,
but I can't reach her.

243
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,895
I know where she lives.
Should I go there?

244
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,440
No, you don't have to.
Don't go.

245
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,568
Okay.

246
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,655
She could get into trouble, too.

247
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,039
I would like to report.

248
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,332
Was it Woo-young?

249
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,211
Yes. He asked if I had seen Sua today.

250
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,922
He wants to ask her something.

251
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,925
Kyung-seok!

252
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,344
Is anyone at school following Sua?

253
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,974
No, never mind.

254
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,228
Do you know where Sua lives?

255
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:46,730
I do.

256
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,488
What did I do?

257
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,576
I thought I was the only one
who liked you.

258
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,330
I need a normal weight to look pretty.
I have the body of a little kid.

259
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,750
You must be kidding.
You never had a boyfriend?

260
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,384
Are you okay?

261
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,387
So, I wanted to give up.

262
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,723
But you liked me, too.

263
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,477
You said hi to me first.

264
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,228
You smiled at me!

265
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,356
I did?

266
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,778
Hi, Dong-won!

267
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,240
You two have the same name!

268
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,368
His name is Dong-won, too.

269
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,915
You even named the cat after me.
Who would ever give that name to a cat?

270
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,503
You did that on purpose
to get my attention.

271
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,465
You liked the drink I gave you.

272
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,385
You wanted to take a picture with me, too.

273
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,929
FOR SUA

274
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,973
Thank you for the drink.

275
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,520
Do you want to take a picture like that?

276
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,771
Why me?

277
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,565
Take a picture of Dong-won, too!

278
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,443
And you said you like Kyung-seok
in front of me?

279
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,240
You looked down on me!

280
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,909
You don't really like Kyung-seok, right?

281
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,244
What are you talking about?

282
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,621
What a loser.

283
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,255
It was a misunderstanding!

284
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,511
You had feelings for me!
You can't just change your mind.

285
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,766
Please. Help me!

286
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,228
You?

287
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:54,691
No.

288
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,825
You know what this is?

289
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,339
What's the matter?

290
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,592
I don't know.
I have a weird feeling about this.

291
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,098
I hear her over there.

292
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,025
Hey, isn't that Dong-won?

293
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,160
Kyung-seok!

294
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,064
What did you do?

295
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,067
She didn't apologize.

296
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,568
What?

297
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,670
Sua!

298
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,591
Are you okay?

299
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,134
Are you okay?

300
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,554
He sprayed something on me.

301
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,513
What?

302
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,307
-What did he spray?
-I don't know.

303
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,685
He just sprayed something.

304
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,651
It's nothing. You're okay.

305
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,236
Don't look!

306
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,947
I said don't look.

307
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,075
Please, don't look.

308
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,828
Take it easy.

309
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,914
It's nothing, okay?

310
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,959
It's just water. Look at me, Sua.

311
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,836
I told you not to look!

312
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,384
I'm going to kill myself.

313
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,344
Sua!

314
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,016
Put that down.

315
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,147
Sua, look at me.

316
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,357
Look!

317
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,611
Here, Sua. Look!

318
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,821
You're fine.

319
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,657
Nothing happened.

320
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,287
You are fine.

321
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,123
Everything's okay.

322
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,170
Put that down.

323
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,303
Give that to me.

324
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,646
Did he hurt you?

325
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,982
Let's get up slowly.

326
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,610
Let go!

327
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,240
Why are you here?

328
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,743
Why you?

329
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,080
Why is someone like you helping me?

330
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,541
Who asked you to help me?

331
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,961
Why are you acting
like you're better than me?

332
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,215
Why are you acting
like you're happier than me?

333
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,471
You're not even pretty.

334
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,022
Please. Stop now, please!

335
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,403
You...

336
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,657
I really don't like you.

337
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,160
Do you know how much you frustrate me?
I feel like I'm talking to a wall.

338
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,748
Fine. I am not pretty,
so I had plastic surgery.

339
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,167
I was unhappy because I was ugly,
like you said.

340
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,879
What about you?
Are you happy because you're pretty?

341
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,132
Are you happy?

342
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,760
Why does it have to be this way?

343
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,098
Why do we have to be like this?

344
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,687
We are on a diet
even though there's no weight to lose.

345
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,982
We throw up and have surgeries...

346
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,319
as if we'd die if we didn't get pretty.

347
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,993
We judge faces...

348
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,582
and fight with each other.

349
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,051
Why do we have to do that?

350
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:21,392
I... really don't want to.

351
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,730
I don't want to do that any more.

352
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:27,982
I...

353
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,193
From now on,

354
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:37,033
I will concentrate
on what makes me really happy.

355
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,415
That's what I'm gonna do.

356
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,726
Yes, Sua is fine.

357
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,271
She was scared, but didn't get hurt.

358
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,859
Yes, she is sleeping now.
So don't worry.

359
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,153
Of course.

360
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,159
Are you okay?

361
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,412
I am.

362
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,586
Well...

363
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,592
can I stay with Sua for a while?

364
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,810
Don't you hate her?

365
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,688
Hate?

366
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,358
You hate her, too,

367
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,277
and you still helped her.

368
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,614
-That's...
-Is it okay if I stay?

369
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,035
It's your decision. Do what you want.

370
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,206
Thank you.

371
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,047
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

372
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,146
What a psycho.

373
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,481
What will happen to him?

374
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,611
After the police investigation,
he will be kicked out of school.

375
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,696
The legal process will remain to be seen.

376
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,411
-Are you waiting for Mi-rae?
-No.

377
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,330
I was waiting for you.

378
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,582
I wanted to go home together.

379
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,669
Why are you so friendly
all of sudden?

380
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,296
It's not all of sudden.

381
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:58,549
When you were drunk last time,
I brushed your teeth.

382
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,344
What?

383
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,138
-Let's go.
-Wait up!

384
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,058
-What are you saying? When?
-When you came home drunk.

385
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,559
You brushed my teeth?

386
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,853
Yes. And I made you breakfast.

387
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,232
Oh, that day!

388
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,944
Now that I think of it,
I did everything...

389
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,030
You didn't brush my teeth!

390
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,073
I did.

391
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,742
You sure are brave.

392
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,118
I thought I was.

393
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,668
Are you still here?

394
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,590
I'll stay here.

395
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,552
Okay, then.

396
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,473
Call me if you need me.

397
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,433
I will.

398
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,122
Silly.

399
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,544
You're even sillier than me.

400
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,131
Let's stop...

401
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,302
living like this.

402
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,585
What picture was posted online?

403
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:40,920
I didn't see it.

404
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:45,257
It was just the back of a woman.
You can't even be sure it was Sua.

405
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,512
The face also was online for a short time.

406
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,516
Her phone is off.
And she's not picking up.

407
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,645
I thought we were close,
but she's not calling me.

408
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,356
You were close
and you spoke behind her back?

409
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,733
I'm not the one who spread the rumors.

410
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,445
Everyone knew she was throwing up
and dating all the boys.

411
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,075
Anyway, people have
a bad impression of her now.

412
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,162
-She's not even from a wealthy family.
-Who said that?

413
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,290
Dong-won.

414
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:22,795
When we were in the lab,
he said everything about Sua is fake.

415
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,256
How would he know?

416
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,550
Isn't he a little strange?

417
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,010
Look! You always say bad things
about people.

418
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,346
-Just eat.
-Why?

419
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,808
He is weird. He never makes eye contact.

420
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:41,480
I hope he stays in prison forever.

421
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,025
I understand you feel nervous,
but don't worry too much.

422
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,736
He will be issued a restraining order
when he gets out.

423
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:52,533
And you will be fine
with counseling and treatment.

424
00:40:55,244 --> 00:41:00,291
I don't know
why I have to go through this.

425
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,668
I don't think...

426
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,213
I can go anywhere alone.

427
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,301
Do you have anyone you can count on?

428
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,721
Someone who can be with you for a while.

429
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,475
I thought I had someone.

430
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,146
But I don't have anyone.

431
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,024
COUNSELING ROOM 2

432
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,320
Okay. I got it.

433
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,405
I see. All right.

434
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,161
Sua!

435
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,251
Why, didn't you think I'd be waiting?

436
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:52,968
I'd like to be with you for a while,
if it's okay with you.

437
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,646
There.

438
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,400
The cakes in that bakery are good.
Let's go and eat some next time.

439
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,448
No one knows what happened.

440
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,117
Really.

441
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,664
Everyone knows how to hold their tongues.

442
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,750
Woo-young, Kyung-seok, Mi-rae.

443
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,922
And you.

444
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,845
I've tried...

445
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,016
but I have to say something.

446
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:47,856
Mi-rae liked you at first.

447
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,902
You told her you two were friends.

448
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,697
She said that made her happy.

449
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,837
Thank you.

450
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,339
Of course. Don't worry.

451
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,972
The cat knows you.

452
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,808
Yes. Sometimes I feed him.

453
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,560
He likes my food.

454
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,772
You like cats.

455
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,443
Yes, I do.

456
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,619
Kyung-seok and Mi-are are dating.

457
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,871
-Since when?
-Since the break.

458
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:47,541
-They began dating at Kelun Korea.
-Wow!

459
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,419
I should have applied for Kelun.

460
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,546
If you had,
would you be able to date Kyung-seok?

461
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,924
Mi-rae is so lucky.

462
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:59,845
She must have saved the country
in her previous life. I am so jealous.

463
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,057
-I should have...
-I know.

464
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,226
Everyone scream!

465
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,981
A campus couple is born.

466
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,275
-What are you two?
-Are you guys really together?

467
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,365
Yes, we are together.

468
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,994
Kyung-seok smiled.

469
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,887
Don't kiss during class.

470
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,310
Okay. Not in class.

471
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,938
After class, then?

472
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,613
You don't have to answer everything.

473
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,699
You said I should be nice to people.

474
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,543
Next year, I'd like to apply
for the exchange student program.

475
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,877
Is your GPA over 3.5?

476
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:19,007
Do you also have the prejudice
that pretty girls get bad grades?

477
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,469
I thought you were different.
I'm disappointed.

478
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,639
I don't think you're that pretty.

479
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,890
I just asked.

480
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,059
What's for lunch today?

481
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,061
You're curious about that
on the first day of the semester?

482
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,523
You're all curious, right?
You're just not saying it.

483
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,151
Now that I think about it, it's true.

484
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,571
I thought about it, but I didn't say
anything because I knew you would.

485
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,989
I knew it!

486
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,243
Am I the only one who has a problem
understanding this conversation?

487
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:02,843
Sorry.

488
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,179
About what?

489
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,766
I hurt your feelings.

490
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,852
It's okay. It's all in the past.

491
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,230
You can't make yourself
feel a certain way.

492
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,483
I know.

493
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,861
I can't control how I feel.

494
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,115
I can't stop thinking about you.

495
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,079
Really?

496
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,709
That is so sad.
I don't really think about you.

497
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,131
There are people who are fine as a friend.

498
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,718
But they're just okay as a boyfriend.

499
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:47,846
You're one of them.

500
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,810
So, I got over it quickly.

501
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,688
Don't feel too bad. I gotta go.

502
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:05,697
Woo-young!

503
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,828
Do you have a minute?

504
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,414
None of the seniors are available.

505
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,794
So, they want me
to be the president for a while.

506
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,673
Silly Tae-young.

507
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,092
If he doesn't want to do it,
there's nothing we can do.

508
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,344
Behave until the election.
Don't get in trouble.

509
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,556
Okay. By the way...

510
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,981
do you know her? She's the prettiest girl
in the Dance Department.

511
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,818
-No
-Really? She is very famous.

512
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,822
I don't know her. Why?

513
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,325
She asked to be introduced to you.

514
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,829
She saw you in a science class.
You will meet her, right?

515
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,332
-No.
-Why?

516
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,211
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-No, that's not it.

517
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,381
I want love at first sight.

518
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,174
Tell her I am sorry.

519
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,056
She's not a model, but she's very pretty.

520
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:19,438
Oh, he's the pine tree of the school.

521
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,648
Never changes.

522
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,484
Who is she?

523
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,777
You scared me.

524
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,738
Who is she?
If Woo-young won't meet her, I will.

525
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,116
-Don't talk to me.
-Hey, hey!

526
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:35,162
Let's get along, huh?

527
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,499
This is not my year.

528
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,462
Hyun-jung!

529
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,049
Hyun-jung!

530
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,929
-Are you going home?
-Hi!

531
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,765
What's wrong?

532
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,434
Will you buy me a drink?

533
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,562
Okay, sure.

534
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,995
He said "friend",
so I expected someone in his 20s.

535
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,790
He was 33! Oh, my God.

536
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,293
If we met and fell in love,
that's a different story.

537
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:27,464
How can a 33-year-old man
want to meet a college freshman?

538
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,174
Is he some kind of weirdo?

539
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,885
It was wrong.

540
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,721
He should have told you his age
in advance.

541
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,890
I don't expect much.

542
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,560
I just want an ordinary boyfriend
and ordinary love.

543
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,354
How can everything go so wrong?

544
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,609
There is no ordinary love.
Every relationship is special.

545
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,657
I'm curious to see who you will meet.

546
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,952
I also don't know.

547
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:10,257
How do you change an exponential function
to a log function?

548
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,592
Where did you have the surgery?

549
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,930
This is study hall. Let's focus.

550
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,516
If you change to a log function,

551
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,019
this is how it should be.

552
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:26,440
Did you do it all at once?
Or one at a time?

553
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:31,069
Can you not concentrate
because of my face?

554
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:35,490
No, of all the tutors I had,
you're the best one.

555
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,703
Really? Then let's do it again.

556
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:44,875
And you switch X and Y here...

557
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:46,918
and this is how it goes.

558
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:51,381
-How much did it cost?
-Look here!

559
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,092
I'm explaining an important concept.

560
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,427
Okay.

561
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,055
-Do you remember symmetric transformation?
-By the way...

562
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,181
Now what?

563
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,392
-...can I go to the bathroom?
-What?

564
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,937
Okay. Go ahead.

565
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,363
Be patient.

566
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,284
You need money
to buy Kyung-seok's birthday present.

567
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:27,125
-Your brother is so handsome.
-Really?

568
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,506
What do you want to eat?
I will pay.

569
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,674
-Order whatever you want.
-Wow!

570
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,176
Is your brother real?

571
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,261
And...

572
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,014
what is that?

573
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,476
My ID.

574
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,187
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND

575
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,403
-I'm here.
-Just a minute.

576
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,907
Take your time. I will wait.

577
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,828
KYUNG-SEOK
CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT

578
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,163
-Isn't it inconsiderate?
-Oh, my! You scared me.

579
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,835
-What?
-Am I just your classmate?

580
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:17,509
I wanted to change it, but I did not know
what I should change it to.

581
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,887
How did you save my name?

582
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,473
I don't know.

583
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,768
What's the matter?

584
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,604
Kang Mi-rae, chemistry department.

585
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,277
Are you upset?

586
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,114
Okay. I will change it.

587
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,159
What should we do Saturday?
Do you have any plans?

588
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,414
If not, do you want to go somewhere?

589
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,336
Okay.

590
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,715
Saturday is your birthday!

591
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,759
-Are you 33 years old?
-No.

592
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,139
You will spend the day with Mi-rae.
Come by for a while.

593
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:05,974
I'll buy you a drink.

594
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,981
When do girls get tired
of their boyfriends?

595
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:13,940
What?

596
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,570
What are you talking about?
Are things getting cold with Mi-rae?

597
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,197
No.

598
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,075
I'll call you later.

599
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:26,620
Okay.

600
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:29,956
Hey!

601
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,632
-You put on the cologne I gave you.
-Yes.

602
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,550
Just a little.
I don't want to use it all up .

603
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,220
I'll buy you more if you run out.

604
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,347
When is your birthday?

605
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,850
Mine? September 25th.

606
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,020
-I was born in September, too.
-Really?

607
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:56,983
I was born on the 15th. So, I am older.

608
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,947
Okay. I'll call you big guy.

609
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,244
Maybe she forgot.

610
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,331
You can't just work
part-time jobs forever.

611
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:15,877
Stop rejecting your dad's business.
You can quit if you don't like it there.

612
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,629
You haven't even given it a try.

613
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,093
Do you want to go
to my dad's business place with me?

614
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,515
Can anyone go there?

615
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,477
Yes, everyone's welcome there.

616
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:39,025
Why did you want to come to a church?

617
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,236
Dad!

618
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,281
Yoo-jin!

619
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,206
-Who is this?
-She is a junior at my school.

620
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,836
Hello. I am Choi Jung-boon
of the chemistry department.

621
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:02,048
Chemistry?
Isn't that Kyung-seok's department, too?

622
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,508
-Yes.
-Yes.

623
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,139
You said business.

624
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,601
You must have a lot to think about.
You like drinking so much.

625
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:17,731
That's just the first problem.

626
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,403
I feel sorry for you and the kids.

627
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,655
There's a lot I regret.

628
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:33,330
If I said for us to eat together tomorrow
to celebrate Kyung-seok's birthday...

629
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,085
that would be too much to ask, right?

630
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,756
-Is that what you wanted to say?
-No.

631
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,510
I want you to know one thing.

632
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,598
I only loved two women in my life.

633
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:57,062
Hye-sung at 26 and Hye-sung at 46.

634
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,196
-I am 47.
-What?

635
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,282
Oh.

636
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,080
Just...

637
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,386
-Hey, brother!
-You...

638
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,763
I was fired,
you're not my boss any more.

639
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,517
Yes, you are right.

640
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,815
I'm sorry for blaming you
for Kyung-hee's problem.

641
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,485
Oh, no. It's all good.
I got a better job now.

642
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,572
I will tell my boss Kim,
head of the party,

643
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,951
to take good care of you, brother.

644
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,625
Take care.

645
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,822
It's not her.

646
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:41,624
Did I sleep through class?

647
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,295
Mi-rae!

648
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,131
Were you asleep?

649
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,843
-I think so.
-You didn't answer the phone.

650
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,847
I think I passed out.

651
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,935
What's this?

652
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,230
What? What is it?

653
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,441
Someone must've put it there
while you were asleep.

654
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,696
-What are you saying? It was you!
-No, it wasn't me.

655
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,781
You're trying to fool me.

656
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,117
It wasn't me.

657
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,125
It really wasn't you?

658
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:30,715
Someone else must know you well enough
to give you perfume.

659
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,763
I gotta go. I have a class.

660
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,725
-Call me when you're done.
-I have to go to work.

661
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,022
What is this?

662
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,358
Who put it here?

663
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,073
Tomorrow is Kyung-seok's birthday!

664
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,507
It's been a while.

665
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,762
How did you find me here?

666
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,933
Your picture is everywhere on SNS.

667
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:23,810
You're famous.

668
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,316
Now, I use the internet
and see stuff like that.

669
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,151
Do you feel okay?

670
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,781
It's weird that you worry about me.

671
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,327
I took some time off of school.

672
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,080
I don't know when I'll be back.

673
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,458
And I don't think
we'll see each other again.

674
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,918
Do you have something to say?

675
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:50,962
Yes.

676
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,174
I need to tell you the truth.

677
00:59:56,467 --> 01:00:00,930
I never liked you,
not even for a second.

678
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:09,772
I will go now.

679
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:16,487
Are you wearing perfume?

680
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:17,947
Yes.

681
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:24,954
I tried something new.
Everything else became easy.

682
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:18,966
What can I do
if someone I don't know left it there?

683
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,136
-Is it my fault?
-Did I say anything?

684
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,681
What can I do? My girlfriend is popular!

685
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,141
I changed your name in my contact list.

686
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:28,685
Look!

687
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,189
♥KYUNG-SEOK♥

688
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:40,988
Is that good? Do you feel better?

689
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,157
Yes. Okay.

690
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,661
Where are we going?

691
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,665
The weather's nice. Let's go far away!

692
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,042
-Far away?
-Yes.

693
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,134
Two people?

694
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,345
Yes, I made a reservation
under the name Do Kyung-seok.

695
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,347
Yes, please follow me.

696
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:15,940
Sit down, please.

697
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,075
You...

698
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,453
You thought I forgot?

699
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,094
No! Don't you dare.

700
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:49,432
Don't.

701
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:53,561
Yes, I will.
Happy birthday to you!

702
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:59,400
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday, Kyung-seok!

703
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:05,072
Happy birthday to you!

704
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:08,993
Blow.

705
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,624
Happy birthday!

706
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:23,758
Here's my present.

707
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,556
-So, you pretended you didn't remember?
-I really wanted to surprise you.

708
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,308
You want to do a lot of things.

709
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,561
Thank you.

710
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,357
Open it.

711
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,453
-Do you like it?
-I don't...

712
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:58,709
I like it.

713
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,964
I have one more thing.

714
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,552
Ta-da!

715
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,607
One, two, three!

716
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:33,911
Actually, a long time ago,

717
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:38,374
I used to judge people's faces
when they walked by.

718
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,796
But at some point, I stopped.

719
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:50,511
I am conscious of other people,
so I figured they would do the same.

720
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:57,476
But not many people pay attention to me.

721
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,571
This would be a nice place to propose.

722
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:10,448
What?

723
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:16,329
Places like cafes go away
as time goes by.

724
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,498
But this place will always be here.

725
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:29,050
Looking at my parents,
I thought I would never marry.

726
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:49,278
The hoodie I gave you,
I bought one for myself, too.

727
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,810
Hey, Do-rae couple!

728
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,229
You guys should buy lunch!

729
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:32,196
Let's leave in matching hoodies

730
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,490
Are you guys on your honeymoon?

731
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,705
Should I not have bought mine?

732
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:44,125
Who cares? Do whatever you want!
