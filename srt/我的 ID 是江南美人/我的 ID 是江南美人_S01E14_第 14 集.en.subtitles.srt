1
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,093
We're dating.

2
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,144
Happy for you.

3
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,188
Good luck.

4
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,671
You asked me to keep it a secret.

5
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,882
She won't tell anyone.

6
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,345
She doesn't want her pride to be hurt,

7
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,764
so she won't tell.

8
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,603
I'm glad you got smarter.

9
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,232
-What?
-I wanted to tell Hyun Sua.

10
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,400
That I'm dating you.

11
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,074
I don't want to make you lie.

12
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,995
You don't have to lie.
I made you keep it secret.

13
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,206
It's okay, I'll do everything with you.

14
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,500
I'll never leave you alone.

15
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:16,636
Did you... did you search
how to talk nicely?

16
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,597
No, it just came out.

17
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,145
Do I... have to search?

18
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:41,411
Layering too many scents into one perfume
can make them push against each other.

19
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,289
It will end up becoming
too strong and disgusting.

20
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,793
-For feminine and chic type of...
-What do you want to do?

21
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,587
...You can add citrus.

22
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,508
If you want some lovely type of perfume
grapefruit will be good.

23
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,636
Well, anything.

24
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,561
I think he hasn't messaged very often.

25
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,646
But he types with even one hand.

26
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,818
Okay, then, dinner first.

27
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,654
Great.

28
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,283
Okay.

29
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,828
I'll tell you where.

30
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,963
-Haven't you decided yet?
-Sorry?

31
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,967
Well, I would go
for an autumn-inspired scent.

32
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,219
Autumn?

33
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,262
What are you going to mix?

34
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,641
Hmm, I think...

35
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:49,187
Woody floral, or citrus type, I guess.

36
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,441
Ah, it will go well with autumn winds.

37
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,401
Thank you.

38
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,201
Meet you outside later.

39
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,161
Outside the office isn't safe.

40
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,958
-Then middle?
-Middle where?

41
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,000
Streets?

42
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,920
Or we can meet up there?

43
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,588
I think it's a better idea.

44
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,383
Are you shooting a spy movie?

45
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,719
Who are you messaging with?

46
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,388
Uh?

47
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,307
-Mom.
-Your mom?

48
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:30,645
-Something happened?
-Something with my family.

49
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,399
-All have their own family things.
-True.

50
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,981
Hello?

51
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,317
I'm Woo-young.

52
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,454
-Oh, please sit. You don't have to.
-Okay.

53
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,043
-What do you want to have?
-Oh, I will order.

54
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,378
It's fine, it's on me. I'm your senior.

55
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,673
-Then I'll have an iced cafe mocha.
-With cream?

56
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,134
-A little.
-A little?

57
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,929
Iced cafe mocha with a little cream in it.

58
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,607
Thank you.

59
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,619
-Why did you come to school?
-Summer session.

60
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,412
Right, you told me that.

61
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,210
What did you want to tell me about?

62
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,836
Uh? Ah...

63
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,131
Well, you know...

64
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,676
-You gave me the...
-The letter I gave you?

65
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,304
Yes.

66
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,934
I've been thinking after reading it.

67
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:36,020
It's okay, please be honest with me.

68
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,482
Okay, honest...

69
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,527
Honestly,

70
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,446
I think you're awesome.

71
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,659
But you're trying to say
I'm not your type?

72
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,827
Uh?

73
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,290
-Yes.
-I see.

74
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,000
Nothing we can do.

75
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,172
-I'll finish this before I go.
-Take your time.

76
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,770
I've been turned down several times.

77
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,356
Time will help you.

78
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,735
Depends. It takes longer for some people.

79
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,988
Right, some people do.

80
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,871
-Do you like the summer session?
-No, I don't.

81
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,331
No, you don't like it...

82
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:47,008
I don't want you to get drunk too much
because you feel low, just saying.

83
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,802
I will try not to.

84
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,930
You can do it.

85
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,982
-I'm leaving.
-Uh, oh.

86
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,905
-Bye.
-See you.

87
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,288
You really don't like Sua?

88
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:21,000
Am I nuts? She told me
that she likes Kyung-seok.

89
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,295
See you!

90
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,595
-Uh, see you.
-Bye!

91
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,392
I think he got upset.
You told him you like Kyung-seok.

92
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,232
-Would you stop talking about him?
-Ah, sorry.

93
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,529
-Let's have lunch, shall we?
-Sure!

94
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,239
What do you like to have?

95
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,965
Anything particular in mind?

96
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,427
-Men's cologne.
-A new cologne came, a few days ago.

97
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,305
It's gender neutral.
Do you want to try this?

98
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,365
-I like it.
-All set?

99
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,201
-Yes.
-Is it for your boyfriend?

100
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,831
Yes, it's for my boyfriend.

101
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:47,169
-If you want to engrave letters, tell me.
-Really?

102
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:53,175
Then, I'll go with D, K, S, and...

103
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,140
-A heart mark.
-I will.

104
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,355
Good evening.

105
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,486
Did you enjoy? It's 187,000 won.

106
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,196
Thank you.

107
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,907
Please sign here.

108
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,457
Thanks.

109
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,702
-I don't want to bump into college people.
-You know what?

110
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,289
You stick out.

111
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,250
-What?
-It's like shooting a spy film.

112
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,757
-Was it?
-We used to go out for movies

113
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,176
and have dinner and drink.

114
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:22,014
We had an excuse back then.
We had assignments for pop culture class.

115
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,308
That was your excuse, too?

116
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,602
-What?
-For me, it was an excuse.

117
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,396
To go watch a movie with you.

118
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,906
-Let's order first.
-Alright.

119
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,289
-Aglio e olio for me.
-I think you like that a lot.

120
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,836
-You ordered it last time too.
-I used to order cheap meals.

121
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,548
Ah, I'm too embarrassed.

122
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,509
Actually I was worried.

123
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,346
-I didn't have enough money.
-Did you?

124
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,599
I could've paid too.
Why didn't you ask me to?

125
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,518
I asked you out.

126
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,733
-Are you ready to order?
-Two aglio e olios, and...

127
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,778
-I'll have Coke, you?
-Same as you.

128
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,865
-The same, please.
-Okay, right away.

129
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,088
Let me go to the restroom first.

130
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,850
Okay, let's have a good dinner
and get over it.

131
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:52,021
-Good food can't actually cheer me up.
-It can!

132
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,774
-Huh?
-Kyung-seok?

133
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,529
-Hi.
-What are you doing here alone?

134
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,990
-Or are you with someone?
-No.

135
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,284
Alone, I came alone.

136
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,870
-Alone?
-For dinner.

137
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,125
-Okay, enjoy.
-See you.

138
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,453
Feels like I drank alcohol.
I feel hot.

139
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,167
Whether I date him or not,
my heart goes crazy.

140
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,254
It drives me nuts.

141
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,891
I decided. I'll have this one.

142
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,774
Then I'll go for this one.

143
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,448
What should I do?

144
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,285
What should I do now?
What should I do? Ah...

145
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,127
You care about what he said?

146
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,965
You're not going to drink
because he doesn't want you to?

147
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:47,052
You're right. I think I should.
He cares about me so much.

148
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,805
Hmm, he's a good man.

149
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,568
Excuse me?

150
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,573
Could you take this
to the women's restroom?

151
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:08,949
Sorry?

152
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,911
Please, quickly.

153
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,287
Ah, okay.

154
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,487
What should I do?

155
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,867
Excuse me?

156
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,581
Uh, my bag.

157
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,625
Your friend asked me to bring this to you.

158
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,711
Ah, thank you.

159
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,672
Thank you so much.

160
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,802
Ah, damn it.

161
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,024
Hello?

162
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,402
-Tae-hee is on her way.
-What?

163
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,292
Don't answer, just listen.
I'll hold their attention.

164
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,627
You leave then, okay?

165
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,184
Now it's really a spy movie.

166
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,146
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

167
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,322
We're dating.

168
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,117
Whatever.

169
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,580
KOO TAE-YOUNG

170
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,130
Hello?

171
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,512
-Right now?
-I need to ask something.

172
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,641
-About what?
-Let's talk in person.

173
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,227
It won't take long.

174
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,907
He is having two dishes.

175
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,410
You can do that, too.

176
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,705
But I don't eat two dishes by myself.

177
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,499
Rather, I order three for two.

178
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,422
Mind if I sit?

179
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,925
No, have a seat.

180
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,554
What did you order?

181
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,974
-We?
-Yes.

182
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,561
-Uh, I'm having rose pasta.
-I ordered aglio e olio.

183
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,687
I ordered it too.

184
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,734
-Two of them?
-Yes.

185
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,487
Wow, you eat more than I thought.

186
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,116
-I sometimes eat too much.
-How much is too much?

187
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,789
But honestly, one serving
at BBQ restaurants isn't for one person.

188
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,374
What?

189
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,751
Enjoy.

190
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,048
That's it? To ask what we ordered?

191
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,052
-Uh, he's weird.
-He was living in his own small world.

192
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,930
And now finally he may want
to communicate with people.

193
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,268
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

194
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,065
Kyung-seok!

195
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,574
-Are you alright?
-I'm so sorry. You must be hungry.

196
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,703
-You couldn't eat, either.
-I don't feel hungry at all.

197
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,624
-Can we go now?
-Where else can we go?

198
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,465
Are you a meerkat?

199
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,427
Sorry for distracting you.

200
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,770
-Let's get home now.
-Hmm?

201
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,106
I don't want you to be nervous like that.

202
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,153
-I'm sorry.
-We have plenty of time ahead.

203
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,411
What did you say to them?
Did you say you came alone?

204
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,288
Yes.

205
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,043
-So I made you lie.
-It wasn't a bad lie.

206
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,087
They might have thought you are weird.

207
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,173
Saying you go to dinner alone.

208
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,634
I'm okay, never mind.

209
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,054
You know, I don't want to bother about...

210
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,974
how people think of me.

211
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,439
I'm fine with that.

212
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,361
I got used to the unwanted attention
from others.

213
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,908
It used to be that way for my whole life.

214
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,413
-Shall we?
-Alright.

215
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,140
-Hello!
-Thanks for welcoming me.

216
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,148
-You are awesome.
-Ah, thanks.

217
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,945
-Please work hard to prop up the economy.
-Okay, I will.

218
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,698
I will, you know my motto is...

219
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,206
What is it?

220
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,255
Ah, I'm screwed.

221
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,966
I'll do my best. Thanks for your support.

222
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,760
-Yes!
-Thanks.

223
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,101
Mr. Mayor, please take a look.

224
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,066
-What is this?
-Kyung-hee seems to run an online channel.

225
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,944
Under the nickname of Dovely,
she talks about

226
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,572
what her rich life is like
and praises extravagance.

227
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,262
-So what did you want to ask?
-First of all...

228
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,474
I wanted to say thank you.

229
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,189
You know I'm kind of indecisive.

230
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,108
But after you talked to me that night,

231
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,527
I've become a bit more confident.

232
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,947
Thanks.

233
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,950
-About what?
-You told me...

234
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,286
to follow my heart.

235
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:53,997
So...

236
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:05,550
Here. I bought it for you.
It's a necklace.

237
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,137
Tae-young.

238
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,641
-Yes.
-Why did you ever think of me,

239
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,559
and why are you giving me this?

240
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,811
Uh?

241
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:20,107
I feel it's a bit too much.
Why are you doing this to me?

242
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,068
Ah, back then...

243
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,987
I think we felt some chemistry...

244
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,615
between us.

245
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,120
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I mean...

246
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:40,210
You asked me what I'd do
if I found out someone likes me.

247
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,548
Did you ever think that I like you?

248
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,263
What I meant was if you have
a second thought about it,

249
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:56,143
it shows you don't have
much affection for your girlfriend.

250
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,938
And I wished the best
for both of you.

251
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,407
Why?

252
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,034
I have to go now.

253
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,641
What's going on?
What the heck is going on between them?

254
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:56,828
The other day, you told me you can
be my company if I feel low.

255
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,955
Of course I meant it.

256
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,916
I'm a huge fan of yours.

257
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,628
I see.

258
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,090
Uh, well, to be honest,

259
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,552
I have not had much dating experience.

260
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,641
-I had a lot on my mind while dating her.
-Tell me about it.

261
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,646
I don't know, maybe I started dating her
without thinking deeply about my feelings.

262
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,691
-Ah...
-Of course, she is gorgeous.

263
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,779
And she's cute.

264
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,950
I have feelings for her.

265
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,284
But...

266
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,498
-I don't know.
-Hmm...

267
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,751
-What if...
-Yes?

268
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,381
...you found out someone likes you,

269
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,466
how would you feel?

270
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,304
Hah, what?

271
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,391
Will you have second thoughts?

272
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,727
Well, no...

273
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,189
I'm not sure.

274
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:14,072
I don't know that much, but I think
you should follow your heart.

275
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,538
Did I get it wrong?

276
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,916
Did I?

277
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,723
Oh, my gosh.

278
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,601
What's so "oh, my gosh"?

279
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:47,522
You and Kyung-seok will be, like,
holding hands together, and...

280
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:51,318
What are you guys going to do next?

281
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,319
Stop it.

282
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,447
-I'm not ready to accept this.
-What are you talking about?

283
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,533
-I won't be able to see you two.
-Screw you.

284
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,412
You seem more confident than ever.
You told me you can't date him.

285
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,957
It's not about confidence. We'll still
keep it a secret from college people.

286
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,917
College? Secret?

287
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,128
Of course, it should be that way.

288
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,590
He already gets too much attention.
Now it will get worse.

289
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,176
They want to know who he's dating
after ditching Sua.

290
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,969
If they find out it was me...

291
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:20,764
Ugh...

292
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,516
What if they find out?
What are you going to do?

293
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:29,481
I wasn't that careful
before I started all this.

294
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,776
Okay, you just focus on you two

295
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:38,531
and what you want to do with him,
like cuddling, cuddling, and cuddling.

296
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,950
Stop talking about cuddling.

297
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:45,372
-Cuddle, cuddle, cuddle!
-I said stop!

298
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,333
-Wait, wait.
-What?

299
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,002
Woo-young knows this?

300
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,169
Seem like you're tied up.

301
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,256
I'm reading some papers.

302
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,722
-You want to talk?
-Well, no.

303
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,101
I mean yes.

304
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,938
-What is it?
-We can talk later if you're busy.

305
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,983
I am, but go on.

306
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,987
About Mi-rae.

307
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,906
Not going well with her?

308
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,161
Well, actually it turned out well.

309
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,665
Turned out well.

310
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,587
Hah, I was expecting something else.

311
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,676
-Do you feel sorry for me?
-Not like that.

312
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,055
-I don't need to.
-Then why are you acting awkwardly?

313
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,767
Congrats.

314
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,980
But could you keep it secret
at school?

315
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,900
-Why?
-I'm just asking.

316
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,612
-I'll go to sleep.
-Okay.

317
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,155
Have a dream about Mi-rae.

318
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:22,278
Wait, did you drink all of it?

319
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,365
-We had 10 bottles.
-Yes.

320
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,077
I want to keep in shape, too.

321
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:35,124
I gained only a few pounds,
but my waist got this much bigger.

322
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,046
Don't be so selfish.
Help me get in shape, okay?

323
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,632
I'll get more for you.

324
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,718
Will you go into the office
with Kyung-seok?

325
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:51,558
Of course you will.
Like cuddly-cuddly.

326
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,893
Cuddly-cuddly.

327
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,354
-Not funny at all.
-For me it is!

328
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,690
-Not funny.
-So what?

329
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,242
So he won't come here today?

330
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,420
How long have you been here?

331
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,172
-For 10 minutes?
-You could've called me.

332
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,716
Anyway, you came out.

333
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,303
Before we go, let's stop by somewhere.

334
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,597
-Where?
-Just follow me.

335
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,818
You want to buy masks?
Did you catch a cold?

336
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,070
No, to cover my face.

337
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,532
-Why?
-Because I don't want you to be a meerkat.

338
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,409
I'm going to wear it.

339
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,661
But the weather is too hot.

340
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,458
Then, I'm wearing it.

341
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,668
No, I'll do it.

342
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,962
You're doing it for me, so I should.

343
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,966
Then let's wear it together.

344
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,061
-Feeling okay?
-Yes.

345
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,231
I feel like we're drawing
even more attention.

346
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,026
I said I would wear it alone.

347
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,195
-You can take it off.
-No, it's okay.

348
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,030
-You take it off.
-No, you take it off.

349
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,992
It feels so weird to keep saying
"take it off."

350
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,830
Okay, we both take them off.
Your chin must be itchy.

351
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,584
We can tell people we're living
in the same neighborhood.

352
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,546
Just let go of my hands.

353
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,692
Where do you want to go?

354
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:10,321
-Somewhere distant?
-Like where?

355
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,615
I'll think about it.

356
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:23,418
-Hi.
-There must be something with Sua.

357
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,881
It seemed like he was trying to confess.

358
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,467
Sua had a gift in front of her.

359
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,845
And something serious
was going on between them.

360
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,306
But then she dumped him.

361
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,850
Hah.

362
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:44,147
He'd never been alone with a girl.
He was always around people.

363
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,109
Okay, if, just if...

364
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,445
Let's say he likes Sua at the moment.

365
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:54,449
But he just broke up with you.
How can this happen so suddenly?

366
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,869
I think there must have been something
while he was dating you.

367
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:04,625
Now I see. He didn't seem to listen
to me, looked distant around me.

368
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,004
He used to text to someone
even when I was around.

369
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,338
I knew it!

370
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,926
There's always a reason
for such a sudden breakup.

371
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,287
You came early.

372
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,173
Sua.

373
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,719
How about lunch after this?

374
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,222
-On me.
-Why?

375
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,434
I thought you might feel awkward
around Kyung-seok.

376
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,398
Thanks.
I'm lucky to have you.

377
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,660
Come in.

378
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,125
Hi.

379
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,043
Hi, Hyun-jung.

380
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,880
-Not a good time?
-It's okay, almost done.

381
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,217
-Why did you come to school?
-To return some books.

382
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,260
Hmm.

383
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,264
-How about taking a coffee break?
-Sure.

384
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,807
Wait a second.

385
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,647
What did you say to the girl
you told me about?

386
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,440
She seems perfectly okay.

387
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,694
But I have no idea
how she's been since then.

388
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,405
How do you feel now?

389
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,740
Well, I am...

390
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,577
worried about her.
I hope she's going to be fine.

391
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,914
Not her.
I'm asking about you.

392
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,000
Me?

393
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,336
You used to like Mi-rae.

394
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,963
How did you...

395
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,843
-Did you know that I liked her?
-Of course, I major in psychology.

396
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:20,887
Hah.

397
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,056
I didn't even tell you,
and you never saw what happened.

398
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,854
Then you must...

399
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:34,400
know I was turned down
after telling her I like her.

400
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,862
Ah.

401
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,741
That I didn't know.

402
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,499
I didn't know there's something
best friends don't share.

403
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,503
Oh, you told her.

404
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,174
Of course I did.

405
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,386
Wishing for even a 1% chance
it would work...

406
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,890
If I didn't, I would have regretted it.
Don't you think?

407
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,019
Maybe guys and girls
think differently about this.

408
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,856
I won't do that
unless there's a 99% chance.

409
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,317
Why would I, if he might reject me?

410
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,995
I think I have lots to learn from you.

411
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,921
I'm actually an N.B.S.B.

412
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,970
Sorry.

413
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,976
I think they're all out for lunch.

414
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,936
Only Dong-hoon is here.

415
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,983
Won-ho went out with Sung-woon.
He seems disappointed with Sua.

416
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:00,152
Tae-hee and Yoon-a seem to have
some secrets to talk about.

417
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,364
Sua suddenly went out with Eun.

418
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,120
I thought he wanted to be in our group.
But he is eating alone now.

419
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,548
What? Sit.

420
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,232
Why are you sitting next to me
and not Mi-rae?

421
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,573
He doesn't sit next to me all the time.

422
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:50,786
You know he's far from a sociable person.
He only gets along with his old friend.

423
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,206
Am I not sociable?

424
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,625
Yes, you didn't know?

425
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,796
Wow, you are indeed not sociable.

426
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,136
He has a sense of humor
and like to talk with people.

427
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,849
Do you know who he likes?

428
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,520
Well, I don't know.

429
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,023
Are you in a relationship with her?

430
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,987
-Yes.
-Wow.

431
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,823
-Who?
-You don't need to know.

432
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,451
Why do you keep it secret?

433
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,163
Oh, wait.

434
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,087
-A celebrity?
-No.

435
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,632
Hey, I just saw your nervous face.

436
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,133
Am I right?

437
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,219
No?

438
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,639
Ah, then who?

439
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,391
I'm dying to know who.

440
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,519
Why do you want to know
who I'm seeing?

441
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,687
Of course I'd like to know.

442
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,233
I want to know the girl who beat Sua.

443
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,905
Do you have any idea who?

444
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,574
Uh? No.

445
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,249
Should I move to another college?

446
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,879
You are hilarious, indeed.
You want to move to another college?

447
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,689
Sua shouldn't have talked to you
in person.

448
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,693
I was dumb.

449
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,487
I should've just ignored her and left.

450
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,909
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

451
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,036
That's what she wants.

452
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,757
I didn't get mad about you.

453
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,302
Kyung-seok?

454
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,056
What are you guys doing here?

455
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,690
You two...

456
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,276
were dating?

457
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,244
You two!

458
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,456
You're dating?
Isn't it so lovely?

459
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,504
Why don't you say something?
Did I surprise you?

460
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,464
What's wrong with me finding out?

461
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,635
-Didn't we surprise you?
-Of course you did.

462
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,846
See how much I'm surprised.
It's so surprising!

463
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:01,268
I've always wanted for you to date
a person like Mi-rae.

464
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,897
So it's a good surprise for me.
My wish has been realized.

465
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:11,320
I wanted to have a break here,
but I don't think it's a good idea now.

466
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,657
I'll leave you guys alone.
Enjoy your time together.

467
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,245
See you.

468
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,124
-She is so cool.
-She really is.

469
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,294
Is it because she lived overseas for long?

470
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,260
-Are you alright?
-Uh? Why?

471
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,803
Getting busted.

472
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:38,639
Uh...

473
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,310
I think I'm fine.

474
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,127
Do you want to talk about something?

475
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,256
Finished?

476
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,300
Yes.

477
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,556
Tell me.

478
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,142
Actually...

479
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,477
I saw you the other night.

480
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,274
Back when Tae-young was walking you home.

481
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,319
Ah. You saw us?

482
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,447
We bumped into each other.

483
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,741
He walked me home, since it was late.

484
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,201
I said I was okay, but...

485
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,456
Is there something wrong with it?

486
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:51,503
Yena saw you were with him last night.

487
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,592
She thinks you broke up
their relationship.

488
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,551
Well...

489
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:04,058
I saw him last night,
but I asked him to get back together...

490
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,770
with Tae-hee.

491
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,314
That's all I said to him.

492
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:16,445
If you want to talk about something,
I'm all ears.

493
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,121
Actually, I think...

494
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,833
I'm often misunderstood like this.

495
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:37,257
I might not be able to blend in
with girl friends.

496
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,767
It seems like it's my college.

497
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,477
Could it be...?

498
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,864
Why are you surprised to see me?

499
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,783
Nothing.

500
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,785
You bastard.

501
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,122
Show me.

502
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,333
-Hey, give it back to me.
-Hold on.

503
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,001
Hmm?

504
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,717
-Hey, give it to me.
-Wait.

505
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,227
-Ah, I don't like it.
-Thanks for good photos.

506
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,854
She's too petite.

507
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:35,482
-Hey, don't you think it's Sua?
-Just give me that.

508
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,278
Well.

509
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,115
I think she's going crazy.

510
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,159
I heard Kyung-seok rejected her.

511
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,455
-What?
-She told she likes him, in public.

512
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,331
-For real?
-Hah.

513
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:56,420
I think we misunderstood her
by the way she looks.

514
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,337
Hah.

515
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,426
Should I call her up to cheer her up?

516
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,598
Hey, call her and don't say I'm here.

517
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:11,769
I used to have some chemistry
with her, so...

518
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,313
Okay, I should go now.

519
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:20,277
Hey. We've got nothing to lose.
Make a call to her, huh?

520
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,576
-Bye.
-See you around.

521
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,875
Kyung-hee.

522
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,340
-Hi.
-Your dad needs to talk to you.

523
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,304
You want to talk? Go ahead.

524
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,810
The videos you uploaded...

525
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:53,977
Delete them all.

526
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,897
The Dovely mukbang thing.

527
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,484
It's already viral.

528
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:04,988
-You can't delete them?
-I can't, they're already shared.

529
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,199
You...

530
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,538
You know my slogan is
to make better lives for ordinary people.

531
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,456
Why'd you show off your expensive bags?

532
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,209
Did I ever ask for those?

533
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,254
I never asked. Is it my fault
for letting people know about it?

534
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,634
Okay.

535
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,763
-Any other way to solve this?
-No.

536
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,139
Bye.

537
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,281
This hand is only for bus rides.

538
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,035
By the way, where are we headed?

539
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:57,124
Let's go somewhere far.
I don't want you to get nervous.

540
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,759
-Hey...
-You can't pick it up with one hand?

541
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:17,978
Hello.

542
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,773
Yes, I'm on my way back.

543
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,236
Is it? Okay, see you later.

544
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,866
-Hyun-jung?
-Yes.

545
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,744
She's going to see her parents.

546
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,789
-When is she coming back?
-Tomorrow, she said.

547
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,848
Only if...

548
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,601
you feel pressured outside.

549
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,939
You keep acting like a meerkat.

550
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,660
Do you want to come over?

551
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,998
Well, not a bad idea.

552
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,045
Okay, let's go then.

553
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,312
If you want to talk about something,
I'm all ears.

554
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:51,863
Hello?

555
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,577
Ah, is it you? Hi.

556
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,123
You must have been surprised
by my call.

557
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:09,089
I know it's quite out of the blue.
But I need to tell you something I saw.

558
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,550
I think you should know this.

559
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:14,511
What is it?

560
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,097
Do you have time now?

561
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:18,473
Now?

562
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,018
If you're up to something, it's fine.

563
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,645
But I want you to know this soon.

564
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,701
Wait. I will be back soon.

565
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,370
-Where are you going?
-Wait inside.

566
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,123
-Alright.
-I'll be back soon.

567
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,041
Yes.

568
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,466
-Hi.
-What the...

569
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,427
-Why are you so surprised?
-No...

570
00:50:56,678 --> 00:51:00,640
-Why did you suddenly come here?
-Your mom wanted to see you.

571
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,685
No, you said you missed her.

572
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,986
Are you... okay?

573
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,741
-Of course, I am.
-I mean, friends...

574
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:21,328
-Do you get along with them?
-What are you talking about?

575
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:25,874
I wonder if you're doing well
with friends.

576
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,376
If you have a boyfriend
you can tell me about it.

577
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,176
How many candles do you need?

578
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,428
One large candle, please.

579
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:55,612
-Is this non-alcohol?
-Yes.

580
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,123
-Do you sell these too?
-No, they are for decor.

581
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:07,958
Can't you sell these to me?

582
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,881
-I don't think there will be glasses.
-You're going to your girlfriend's house.

583
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:16,883
Yes.

584
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,971
Then I will sell them to you.
I'll charge the original price only.

585
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,848
Thank you.

586
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,157
Mom and Dad are here.
I'll text you later. Sorry.

587
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,667
Why didn't you come with Hyun-jung?

588
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,587
You don't have to stay alone.

589
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,255
I have lots to do...

590
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,716
What? During summer break?

591
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,260
Well, some stuff.

592
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:04,681
The research center
gives me a lot of work.

593
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,434
-Do they give you assignments?
-Yes.

594
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,645
So you can leave now.

595
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,607
You said you didn't have dinner yet.

596
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,362
I forgot. I already ate with my friends.

597
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,740
Now I know why I was full.

598
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:25,619
-Which friends of yours?
-You know, friends doing my major.

599
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,580
Specifically who?
Tell me about your close friends.

600
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,957
How would you know
who they are?

601
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,545
Of course I don't know them.
I know Kyung-seok only.

602
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,507
I'm just curious.

603
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,509
I just want to know
who's on your side.

604
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,805
-Side?
-Enough, get to the point.

605
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:50,227
-When are you coming home?
-Uh, I will soon.

606
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,437
After the center job is done.

607
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,275
So please just go now.

608
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,319
Why are you kicking us out?

609
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,488
I came here to see you.

610
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,658
When did I try to kick you out?

611
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,578
I was just worried.
Driving at night is hard.

612
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,164
What is hard?
I can even drive with my eyes closed.

613
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,833
You can't! What nonsense.

614
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,087
I'm just saying.

615
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,090
Who can drive with eyes shut?

616
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,175
I'm just scared.

617
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,595
You drive every day,
but you always have to be careful.

618
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,723
I know, you don't have to worry about it.

619
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,101
Okay, it's done.

620
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,771
-Anything I can fix for you?
-No, thanks.

621
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,239
-Hi.
-Oh.

622
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,533
Hi, have a seat.

623
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,831
You want to have a beer?

624
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,084
Okay.

625
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,461
Two 500cc glasses, please.

626
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,424
Why did you want to see me?

627
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:03,925
Well.

628
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:08,221
I may be overreacting, but...

629
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,600
-Well, as a matter of fact...
-Jung-yeob.

630
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,108
Hi, Sua. Wow.

631
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,444
Hah, what a...

632
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,905
Hey, I need to talk with Sua.

633
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,449
Excuse me?

634
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,075
500cc, please.

635
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,660
-Alright.
-Chan-woo.

636
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,455
You must feel low.

637
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,290
As a man,

638
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:39,002
I think Kyung-seok is just good-looking,
but kind of annoying.

639
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,129
For me, you deserve better.

640
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,590
Let's talk outside.

641
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,259
-What are you doing?
-Come outside.

642
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,012
What? Sua, wait.

643
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,350
Knock it off.

644
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:57,354
-Hands off of me.
-Let's talk.

645
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,356
Go, now.

646
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,733
-What?
-You didn't see her face?

647
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,360
She feels uncomfortable with you.

648
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,570
Hey, what?

649
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,239
Do you think you can hit on her?

650
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,201
I have more potential
than you do.

651
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:15,622
Honestly, you hit on
every single girl at university.

652
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:19,626
-What did you say?
-Don't mess with me, leave!

653
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,003
Ah, what the heck. Hey!

654
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:16,683
Sua, sorry. You must have been
uncomfortable. I should've let him go.

655
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:18,935
What's this?

656
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,856
Uh...

657
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,778
In fact, that was
what I wanted to talk about.

658
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,739
I happened to find it online.

659
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:34,200
Is it...

660
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,120
Is it you?

661
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,584
-No.
-No?

662
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,710
It's not me.

663
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,297
It's not hard to take photos like these
with similar outfits.

664
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,716
Well, you're right.

665
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,553
But, I just care about you.

666
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,807
-Hey, come outside.
-Wait.

667
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,269
-Knock it off.
-I can't stand the way you talk to me.

668
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,980
I can't just go.

669
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,773
Why are you doing this to me?

670
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,734
Sua, wait, Sua.

671
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,445
She's leaving because of you!

672
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,281
Don't ever think about seeing him.

673
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,867
-What did you just say?
-Stop.

674
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,661
Hey, stop, stop.

675
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:23,333
-Argh!
-Hands off of me first.

676
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,131
Who was it? Who took the photos?

677
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,133
Why try to mess with me?

678
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,427
I need to find out.

679
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:57,075
They left. Sorry.

680
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:20,807
I'm coming.

681
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,078
I'm so sorry.

682
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,749
What is this?

683
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,043
I bought this for you.

684
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,844
It's good that we don't have a TV.

685
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,559
This is how I live.

686
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,519
I know.

687
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:08,605
I came here before.

688
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,526
I laid you down there.

689
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,577
Have a seat.

690
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:29,500
Not there.

691
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,918
There.

692
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:48,061
-Did you make this?
-Yes.

693
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,480
-At home?
-Yes.

694
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,154
Aren't you hungry?

695
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,490
-A little.
-What about delivery?

696
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,992
Chinese food will come quickly.

697
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,912
-Anything will be good.
-Home food?

698
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,123
-Or we can place an order.
-Well...

699
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,044
My mom left some banchan.

700
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,423
Well, my gut feeling is...

701
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,718
I think she's hiding something.

702
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:25,014
She used to do that.
She never told us what happened in school.

703
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,558
Teachers let me know later.

704
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:32,605
There must have been more
she was hiding.

705
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,149
Don't see everything so negatively.

706
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,862
Kids were young then.
College kids won't bully her.

707
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,240
She kept saying we should go.

708
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,577
I think she doesn't want to talk about
what she's going through.

709
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,455
I shouldn't have left.

710
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,042
-Or I should've taken her with us.
-Do you want to go back?

711
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:59,340
It's okay. She might want to be alone.

712
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:02,468
Let's just go.

713
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:07,682
Is it good?

714
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:08,975
Yes.

715
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,145
Enjoy. There's more.

716
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:17,150
I can't have it all.
She wanted you to eat this.

717
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,736
I'm okay. You eat. All of it.

718
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:29,454
It is our first time
having dinner together.

719
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,789
Right.

720
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:38,671
-Sorry.
-Stop saying you're sorry.

721
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,137
What do you want to do next?

722
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,806
A movie?

723
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,811
Watching a movie takes too much time.

724
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:57,523
Then, you choose.
I'm fine with anything.

725
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,109
Well, not specifically...

726
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,947
Do you want to make a candle?

727
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,240
I'll teach you how.

728
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:08,409
Okay.

729
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,923
Keep stirring. I will mix this.

730
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,633
Okay.

731
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,851
-Like this?
-Right.

732
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,153
I have a question.

733
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,156
When did you start liking me?

734
01:03:55,289 --> 01:04:00,503
When I first found out
that you didn't laugh at me.

735
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,466
It's been a while, then.

736
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:11,597
What about you?

737
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,060
-Maybe at the OT.
-OT?

738
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,565
When I danced?

739
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:22,817
No.

740
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,321
When you did stupid things
because of Chan-woo,

741
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,907
I was pissed off.

742
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,711
Keep stirring it.
Or it'll stick together.

743
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,173
-Ah!
-Oh!

744
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,846
-I'm okay.
-No, you're not.

745
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,222
Come.

746
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:05,902
Stupid. You should've been more careful.

747
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:08,112
You can't touch the pot like that.

748
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,200
-It wasn't that hot.
-You should run cold water over it.

749
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,786
Burns really hurt.

750
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,504
I should look for ice.

751
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,077
You're wearing it.

752
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,124
I used to hate it.

753
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:07,380
But now it's growing on me.
