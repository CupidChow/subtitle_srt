1
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,390
Just follow your heart, Mi-rae.

2
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,226
So don't cry, okay?

3
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,620
You don't have to take me home.

4
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,540
Okay, go in now.
Don't come back out again.

5
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,625
Okay.

6
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,255
Goodbye.

7
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,583
You're home.

8
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,750
Yes.

9
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,003
I am going to throw away the trash.

10
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,462
Okay.

11
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,192
Why are you back?

12
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,068
Do you have soju?

13
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,995
Did something happen?

14
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,000
Is it because of her?

15
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,425
Gosh, your first love is giving you
a hard time.

16
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,763
Everyone becomes a fool
for their first love.

17
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,806
You just end up liking a great person...

18
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,559
instead of liking the person
that might like you as well.

19
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,311
How can anyone differentiate that?

20
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,939
It's hard at first, but...

21
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,026
once you get heartbroken a couple of times
you'll start to have better judgment.

22
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,986
You'll be able to stop yourself...

23
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,156
from liking the person that
you don't have a chance with.

24
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,327
You'll continue to stop yourself
from thinking of that person.

25
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,307
Are you sleeping already?

26
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,812
Are you sick?

27
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,937
Good luck with Kyung-seok.

28
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,279
I thought no one would ever root for me.

29
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,959
Hey, I need to go home now.

30
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,296
Let me stay here tonight.

31
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,255
Hey.

32
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,674
Do you think I'm still
the owner of this place?

33
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,014
Fine, do whatever you want.

34
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,516
I'll come early tomorrow morning.

35
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:56,814
Bye.

36
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,135
Did he leave already?

37
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,478
Did he not come home?

38
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,906
-Hello, Sua.
-Hello.

39
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,283
Let me take a photo of you
wearing a lab coat.

40
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,202
Why only me?

41
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,163
You should take a photo of Dong-won too.

42
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,082
Let me take you first.

43
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,835
Here we go.

44
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,672
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

45
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,175
You have good tolerance.
How much did you drink?

46
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,430
I guess everyone reeks of alcohol
if they drink too much.

47
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,056
He's pretty human.

48
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,060
Is there something wrong?

49
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,942
If you're too tired,
you can rest at the nurse's office.

50
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,735
I'll explain to the assistant manager.

51
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,697
Thank you.

52
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,840
You can take a rest here.

53
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:47,967
Okay.

54
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,781
YEON WOO-YOUNG

55
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,919
Why didn't Tae-hee come today?

56
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,879
I don't know. She won't pick up calls.

57
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,472
Someone should check up on Kyung-seok.

58
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,724
He should at least have some soup.

59
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,894
Just let him rest. He'll sober up soon.

60
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,146
But I'm sure he'll feel sick
until he sobers up.

61
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,857
He should've just stayed home.

62
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,568
If you're that worried,
why don't you go and check up on him?

63
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,113
Do you know where the nurse's office is?

64
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,449
Are you really going to go?

65
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,160
Do you like Kyung-seok?

66
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:57,828
What?

67
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,293
Gosh, I was just joking.

68
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,795
Are you mad?

69
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,133
No.

70
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,261
It seems like you really like him.

71
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,476
You're right.

72
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,687
I like Kyung-seok.

73
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,777
You said you didn't like him
when I asked at the festival.

74
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,029
I know.

75
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,323
Are you guys dating?

76
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,451
See? I knew this would happen.

77
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,161
They're dating for sure.

78
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,080
No, we're not dating yet.

79
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,602
Are you okay?

80
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,855
Hyun Sua is so weird.

81
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,525
She told us that she doesn't have
high standards. But did you see...

82
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,402
how she confessed
that she likes Do Kyung-seok?

83
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,362
Is she kidding us?

84
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,782
Frankly, it's not like Kyung-seok has
a good personality.

85
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,161
Sua's just the same.
She likes good-looking guys.

86
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,416
Hey.

87
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,502
You already got rejected
at the welcoming party.

88
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,087
Stop making a fuss.

89
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,756
I know that.

90
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,594
But she didn't have to tell me that
she likes someone else.

91
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,642
Yes, I guess.

92
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,519
It's like...

93
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,023
she totally made a fool of me.

94
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,322
About the girl that I like...

95
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,116
Apparently, she likes someone else.

96
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,078
This makes no sense.

97
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,413
She made it seems like
she liked me as well.

98
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,625
Was she just having fun with me?

99
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,087
I'm so mad.

100
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,426
Ms. Na.

101
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,683
What's wrong?

102
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,102
Ms. Yoon just came by

103
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,980
and told me that Kyung-seok
is at the nurse's office right now.

104
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:31,899
What?

105
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,944
-Is he sick?
-Not exactly.

106
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,904
He's hungover.

107
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,240
I think he drank too much.

108
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,383
Are you okay?

109
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,144
What happened?
Is there something wrong?

110
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,355
No.

111
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,442
Why did you drink so much that

112
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,026
you even have had to come here?

113
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,321
I'm sorry.

114
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,118
Is there really nothing I should be
worried about?

115
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,204
Everything's fine.

116
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,833
How much did you drink?

117
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,212
I'm not too sure.
I think I drank five to six bottles.

118
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,591
No, seven bottles.

119
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,550
What?

120
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,427
Do you want to die?

121
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,015
No,

122
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,809
that was too harsh.

123
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,027
You shouldn't drink that much.

124
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,904
Don't ever do it again.

125
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,791
You really can't smell, can you?

126
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,212
Everyone avoided me today
because I reeked of alcohol.

127
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,174
Don't think your mom is an excuse
for everything.

128
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,510
No one will go easy on you,
even if you're the CEO's son.

129
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,096
If this happens again, I'll kick you out
from the team.

130
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,182
Okay.

131
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,269
Did you treat your hangover?

132
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,023
No.

133
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,193
Gosh, who did you learn
to drink so much like this?

134
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,700
Why are you smiling?
You did nothing good.

135
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,661
It didn't feel real...

136
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,831
but now, I feel like I really have a mom.

137
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,799
Stay here.

138
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,051
I'll go get you some honey water.

139
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,775
Go visit him at the nurse's office.

140
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,569
I might wake him up.

141
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,653
Who cares?

142
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,280
It could be irritating.

143
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,407
No one will be irritated
if you visit him.

144
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,577
Just go in there, and ask him
if he's okay.

145
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,453
Then he'll say "Sua, you're here."

146
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,081
That's how you'll start dating him.

147
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,708
Go now.

148
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,084
What's going on?

149
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,336
She only said she has a crush on him

150
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,381
but if feels like they're already
become an official couple.

151
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,508
I'd go if I were you.

152
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,594
You really should.

153
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,470
It's hard to understand.

154
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,306
What?

155
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,224
Nothing.

156
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,648
WOO-YOUNG

157
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,903
Hello?

158
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,404
We should go too.

159
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,447
Shall we?

160
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,620
Hey, Tae-hee.

161
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,831
What's wrong? What happened?

162
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,544
What's wrong?

163
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,672
I broke up with my boyfriend.

164
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,008
What?

165
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,011
Stop crying for now.

166
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,389
Stop crying.

167
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,812
Don't cry.

168
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,440
Yes.

169
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,484
Kyung-seok is here.
Why do you ask?

170
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,320
He wasn't home in the morning,
so I was wondering if he never came home.

171
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,364
He didn't go home yesterday?

172
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,825
No, I'm relieved to hear that he's there.

173
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,745
You're okay, right?

174
00:15:59,124 --> 00:15:59,959
Yes.

175
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,046
I'll hang up then.

176
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,506
Bye.

177
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,266
I'm not okay.

178
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,067
All of a sudden over the phone?

179
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,902
Why?

180
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,196
We had an argument because of Chan-woo.

181
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,365
But that can't be the reason to break up.

182
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,034
Maybe he has other reasons.

183
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,871
Did he feel ashamed to date
a fat girlfriend too?

184
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,999
Hey, what are you saying?

185
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,460
I can't believe that's the only reason.

186
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,047
Did her boyfriend dump her?

187
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,591
That's why she cried.

188
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,721
People say it's fine as long as
you love each other

189
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,681
but I guess you can't ignore
what others say.

190
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,268
Yes, a lot of them said
Tae-young was too good...

191
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,894
for the chubby girl like her.

192
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,773
I don't know why people gossip
about other people's love affairs.

193
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,733
Goodness.

194
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,987
Right?

195
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,265
-Go in.
-Okay.

196
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,893
Cheer up, Tae-young.

197
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,145
Remember I'm always on your side.

198
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,086
You always brush your teeth
right after eating.

199
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,130
It became a habit.
I feel uncomfortable if I don't do it.

200
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,965
I'll be back.

201
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,686
Did you hear?

202
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,691
Tae-young and Tae-hee broke up.

203
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,776
What?

204
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,861
Everyone talked about how
she didn't deserve him.

205
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,030
It must've been stressful.

206
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,534
I'm worried too.

207
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,954
People might say I don't deserve
Kyung-seok if we go out.

208
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,961
Kyung-seok doesn't like you.

209
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,589
Some men think this way.

210
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,843
They date girls because they like them

211
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,178
but they also want to show them off.

212
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,684
-Excuse me.
-Thanks for that day.

213
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:07,563
Things were awkward between
me and Kyung-seok

214
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,773
but you walked away as if
you didn't see us.

215
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,663
Hyun Sua.

216
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,790
You know about everything.

217
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,835
Why are you doing this to me?

218
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,133
Since when were you there?

219
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,843
Did you...

220
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,262
throw up?

221
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,722
What?

222
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,141
It sounded like you did throw up.

223
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,145
I felt sick.

224
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,106
I gagged a little, but didn't throw up.

225
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,410
What is it?

226
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,788
I saw you earlier during lunch

227
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,791
but you didn't look like
you were feeling sick.

228
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,335
What?

229
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,881
By any chance...

230
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,844
do you habitually throw up
after eating?

231
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,558
That's ridiculous.

232
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,394
Why would I do that?

233
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,272
Do you see me as a person
who'd do such a thing?

234
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,906
She's flustered.

235
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,951
It's obvious she's flustered.

236
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,414
You woke up?

237
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,584
I was told to come
and check your condition.

238
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,132
How many bottles does a heavy drinker
like you need to drink

239
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,883
to become that drunk?

240
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,308
Do I still reek of alcohol?

241
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,561
You do.

242
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,939
Still, it's better than a while ago.

243
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,361
What's that?

244
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,490
Is that honey water?
Who made you that?

245
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,952
Did Sua come see you?

246
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,704
Why would she come here?

247
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,084
We had a crazy incident
during lunch earlier.

248
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,587
We were having lunch together and...

249
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,757
Sua confessed that she likes you.

250
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,259
What?

251
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,345
Kyung-seok, you're unbelievable

252
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,722
for getting a girl like her
to have a crush on you.

253
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,807
I'm so jealous.

254
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,854
You had no clue at all?

255
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,899
Is she out of her mind?

256
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,152
Gosh, hey.

257
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,447
Hey Kyung-seok. Do Kyung-seok!

258
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,002
I've done it too, even though it was
only for a short while.

259
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,176
I've always been too skinny
and I didn't like it.

260
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:11,223
Why? Why did she lie
that she never gains weight?

261
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,017
That pretty friend of yours

262
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,229
may not be much different from you.

263
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,525
Even with that pretty face

264
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,236
you're unhappy?

265
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,365
Hey, Kyung-seok.

266
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,745
Kyung-seok, Do Kyung-seok.

267
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,956
Are you feeling better now?

268
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,128
We need to talk later.

269
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,588
Oh, okay. I'll see you in a bit.

270
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,960
Tae-young, where are you?

271
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,882
-Do you want to grab a drink later?
-A drink, not food?

272
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,717
Yes.

273
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,887
What's wrong with you?
You rarely drink.

274
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,474
I know, right?

275
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,185
I'm surprised that I'm craving alcohol.

276
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,438
Alright, bring other guys too.
I'll treat you all.

277
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,358
Okay, I'll see you there.

278
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,329
Those who aren't here today and
those who are late,

279
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,750
if you're late again or miss another class
 you won't get your certificate.

280
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,548
Where shall we go to talk?

281
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,051
We don't need to go anywhere.
Let's talk here.

282
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,553
Here?

283
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,354
Guys, shall we leave? Let's go.

284
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,439
Come on, let's go.

285
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,790
Kyung-seok is so manly.

286
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,918
Still, he should take her somewhere
romantic.

287
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,421
Manly? I don't think so.
He seemed mad.

288
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,882
No way. What's there to be mad about?

289
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,467
I mean, Sua likes him.

290
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,595
I'm telling you.
They'll start dating today.

291
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,810
I told you to stop.

292
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,186
Stop what?

293
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,272
I heard you told everyone that
you like me.

294
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,233
You're really something.

295
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,486
I've never hated anyone this much.

296
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,322
Why are you so cold to me?

297
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,491
Just because you don't like me

298
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,244
doesn't mean you should doubt me
when I say I like you.

299
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,291
I pity you.

300
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:27,919
Alright.

301
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,006
I never knew having a crush on someone
was this hard.

302
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,924
This is really exhausting.

303
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,052
That's not the point.

304
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,848
I pity you as a person.

305
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,934
What?

306
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,020
If I date someone else

307
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,607
does that ruin your reputation
of being the most popular girl?

308
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,410
Kyung-seok will reject her.

309
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,163
But it'll distance me
further away from him.

310
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:08,084
Everyone will think that he'll date
someone who's prettier than Sua.

311
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,003
They'll have high expectation.

312
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,757
Sua can't date Kyung-seok.

313
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,885
and he doesn't like her.

314
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,804
I'm sure she knows too.

315
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,516
Then why did she tell everyone
that she has a crush on him?

316
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,645
Some men think this way.

317
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,439
They date girls because they like them

318
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,775
but they also want to show them off.

319
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,702
Sua doesn't like Kyung-seok.

320
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,917
Then just like how you told everyone
about having a crush on me,

321
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,878
shall I go ahead and tell everyone
who I really like?

322
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,216
Shall I tell everyone that
I like Kang Mi-rae?

323
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,510
Well, if you do that,

324
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,846
Mi-rae will become very famous.

325
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,644
People will wonder why a guy like you has
fallen for Mi-rae.

326
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,356
Do you think all that gossiping and rumors
will help her?

327
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,327
Mi-rae.

328
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,292
Kyung-seok, let's go.

329
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:42,387
Well, we're talking about something
important right now.

330
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,140
I have to talk to him about something
important too.

331
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,809
What do you think you're doing?

332
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,102
Hyun Sua.

333
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,398
-What do you think you're doing now?
-I'll talk to her.

334
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,361
Let me talk to Sua for a minute.

335
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,468
I know that you don't like me.

336
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,720
I also know you can't stand the fact

337
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,805
that Kyung-seok likes me.

338
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,224
But...

339
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,518
you'd better not use him.

340
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,440
Do not meddle in his life.

341
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,443
I'm meddling in his life?

342
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,237
What do you mean?

343
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,073
Everyone knows that he's the most
handsome and competent guy.

344
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,619
If he dates someone else,
you won't be in the spotlight anymore.

345
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,622
That's why you're trying to make sure

346
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,708
he can't date anyone if he's not going
to go out with you.

347
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,214
Are you thinking straight?

348
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,632
Yes.

349
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,468
I've come to my senses.

350
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,680
I can see exactly what
you're trying to do.

351
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,016
Even with Chan-woo

352
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,269
I bet you told him you can't date him
because I like him.

353
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,315
I also know that you approached
Park Young-chul first.

354
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,568
You must've wanted to make me admit
that I was born ugly.

355
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,112
That I'm no match for you.

356
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,454
That's right.

357
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,541
From the moment I was born,

358
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,378
and for the rest of my life,
I'll be different from you.

359
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,799
I'm different from girls who want
to fix their faces for a better life.

360
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,012
I'm not sure about that.

361
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,893
I think we're a bit similar in some ways.

362
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:55,854
What?

363
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,650
Are you saying that
because of what you saw?

364
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,029
Let me make myself clear again.
I wasn't forcing myself to throw up.

365
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,657
I was just nauseous, that's all.

366
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,537
The fact that you're bringing this up now

367
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,543
tells me that you were in fact
forcing yourself to throw up.

368
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,170
Hey!

369
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,764
I've never seen you like this before.

370
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,227
Do you know

371
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,440
that this is your first time being
honest with me?

372
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:46,529
I think this is my first time
seeing the real you.

373
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,044
That brat.

374
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,881
She should know her place.

375
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,611
What is it?

376
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,033
-What do you mean?
-You said you wanted to talk to me.

377
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,328
What was it?

378
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,666
Well, the thing is...

379
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:44,921
Are you sober now?

380
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,259
I'm so disappointed.

381
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,805
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

382
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,598
Yes.

383
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,480
I was worried about you.

384
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,243
Do you want to eat?

385
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,370
What?

386
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,220
GANGNAM BEAUTY

387
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,858
You're home early.

388
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,819
I'm going to rest for a while.

389
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,780
I don't feel like dealing with customers.

390
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,824
-Did you eat?
-No.

391
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,785
I bought you some dumplings.
You should have some.

392
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,538
I don't feel like eating anything.

393
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,792
Gosh, stop acting as if someone died.
What's wrong?

394
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,881
It's all my fault.

395
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,592
I told her to get a full makeover.

396
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,345
She should've just gotten
a few surgeries done.

397
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,097
What's the point of saying that now?

398
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,891
Here, let's eat.

399
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,812
By any chance

400
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,274
did people say that in front of her?

401
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,236
They're probably just saying that
behind her back, right?

402
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,328
I feel so sorry for her.

403
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,705
Gosh, I told you to stop acting
as if someone died.

404
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,082
Why are you crying?

405
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,460
I feel sorry toward you too.

406
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,630
There are a lot of people
who like Mi-rae as well.

407
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,674
She seemed really popular
at the orientation.

408
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,428
Right? There have to be more people
that like her, right?

409
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:01,015
Of course, people who call her names
are the ones who don't know her well.

410
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,893
The ones who know her well
wouldn't call her that.

411
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,188
-Eat.
-Yes.

412
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,107
You're right.

413
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,741
Were you really going to ask
if I was sober or not?

414
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,452
What?

415
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,413
Well, that and...

416
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,000
Why didn't you go home last night?

417
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,295
How did you know?

418
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,422
Woo-young called me earlier.

419
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,384
He said you didn't come home
and asked if you came to the lab.

420
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,719
I didn't go home
because I didn't want to see his face.

421
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,138
Why?

422
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,518
Did you fight with him?

423
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,896
I would've fought with him
if it was worth fighting for.

424
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,108
If it wasn't worth fighting, then why
don't you want to see his face?

425
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,658
That's weird. He's a nice guy.

426
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,123
Okay, fine.

427
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,417
-I don't want it.
-Okay, fine.

428
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,045
Woo-young, is something wrong?

429
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,757
No, there's nothing wrong.

430
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,553
You've bought us food a lot of times,
but this is the first buying us drinks.

431
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,267
This is so fun. Let's drink.

432
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,268
Come on, cheers.

433
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,115
Are you guys dating anyone?

434
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,661
He's dating Tae-hee
and we're not dating anyone, as usual.

435
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,208
Did I ask you to come out
when you have to meet Tae-hee?

436
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,127
No, we don't meet that often.

437
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,962
How come? You just started dating.

438
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,590
Don't couples usually meet each other
everyday at first?

439
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,926
Then why do you always get dumped so fast?

440
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,761
Hey, I've dumped someone as well.

441
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,554
When? I don't ever recall it.

442
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,766
-Gosh, you don't know me.
-Then tell me, when did you dump someone?

443
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,184
Tell me, who did you dump?

444
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,020
-Min-jung.
-Oh, come on.

445
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,106
Who's Min-jung?

446
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,901
The pretty girl in the biology department.

447
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,946
That's absurd. Why did you dump her?

448
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,072
Well...

449
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,492
she's pretty but she's not very curvy.

450
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,202
-Gosh.
-He's lying.

451
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,620
I'm not lying.

452
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,373
-Do you want me to call Min-jung?
-Yes.

453
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,167
-I'll call her.
-Where's my phone?

454
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,086
Why did you...

455
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,547
suddenly show up when
I was talking to Hyun Sua?

456
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:39,882
What?

457
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,427
You could've asked if I was sober
after I was done talking to her.

458
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,305
You're right.

459
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,016
I guess I'm impatient.

460
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,269
Was it because...

461
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,107
you were worried that something might
happen between me and Sua?

462
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,651
No.

463
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,989
I already know that you don't like Sua.

464
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,496
Are you done eating?

465
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,956
Yes.

466
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,258
Frankly, I went there because
I didn't want anyone bothering you.

467
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,678
I didn't want her to anger
the guy I like.

468
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,637
Aren't you coming?

469
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,598
Okay, I'm going.

470
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,129
I've never seen you like this before.

471
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,424
I think this is my first time...

472
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,261
seeing the real you.

473
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,970
I've tried so hard.

474
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,919
-Hello?
-Hey, Sua.

475
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,130
It's me, Tae-young.

476
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,384
Hello?

477
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,638
Yes.

478
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,227
I had a couple of drinks.

479
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,563
I'm busy right now.

480
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,191
Sua.

481
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,547
My gosh.

482
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,674
-Let's put him over there.
-Okay.

483
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:09,925
My goodness.

484
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:18,350
You're the guy he lives with?

485
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,769
-Let's go, I'm about to pass out.
-Okay.

486
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,230
Please take care of him.

487
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,693
He's acting strange today.
I'm sure something's up.

488
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,328
Woo-young.

489
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:40,956
Wake up.

490
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,002
-It's you, Kyung-seok.
-Sleep in your bed.

491
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,046
Okay, I will.

492
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,964
I won't sleep outside.

493
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,967
-You're home.
-Okay, I'll go.

494
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,848
Sit up first.

495
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,644
Gosh, why.

496
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,731
It's you, Kyung-seok.

497
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,236
I need to brush my teeth
before going to bed.

498
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,580
Gosh, easy, easy.

499
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,636
Here you go.

500
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:37,680
Thanks.

501
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:50,943
Thank you.

502
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,831
Gosh, I almost threw up.

503
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,250
It's driving me nuts.

504
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,795
-This tastes weird.
-Give me that.

505
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,013
Open your mouth.

506
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,516
It's all over his face.

507
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,480
This is it.

508
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,899
Please brush the other side too.

509
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,861
There, right there.

510
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:34,945
Open your mouth wider.

511
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,201
I can't believe I'm doing this.

512
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,417
Thank you.

513
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,597
It's tougher than I thought.

514
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,599
Why did you drink more than
you can handle?

515
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,188
I got rejected by Mi-rae.

516
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,071
What did you just say?

517
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:20,908
Woo-young.

518
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,994
Woo-young, Woo-young.

519
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,080
Woo-young, Woo-young.

520
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,010
Mi-rae.

521
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:41,553
Yes?

522
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,098
Aren't we going to go on blind dates?

523
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,684
Why suddenly?

524
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,437
I thought I'd have a handsome boyfriend
when I enter college.

525
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,689
But nothing is happening.

526
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,567
DO KYUNG-SEOK

527
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,371
Hello?

528
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,831
Come out for a second.

529
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,499
Right now?

530
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,501
Yes.

531
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,129
It's not something I could
talk about tomorrow.

532
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,631
Anyway, come out now.

533
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,508
Okay.

534
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:10,809
Well...

535
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,104
go ahead and ask me.

536
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,734
What did you do with Woo-young yesterday?

537
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,531
Why do I have to tell you that?

538
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,287
I heard you rejected him.

539
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:32,831
Is that true?

540
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,875
Who told you that?
Did Woo-young say that?

541
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,169
Yes.

542
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,629
Wow.

543
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,757
I didn't think he'd be
that kind of a person.

544
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,050
He has such a big mouth.

545
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:51,767
Anyway...

546
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,686
did you call me out to ask me that?

547
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,445
Yes.

548
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,040
Shall we go?

549
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,052
Aren't you going?

550
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,722
I'll tell you why I turned him down.

551
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,521
I have someone I like.

552
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,026
Because I...

553
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,699
like you.

554
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,626
I like you.

555
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,748
I know I'm shameless

556
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:43,086
to say this after rejecting you twice.

557
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,172
That's okay.

558
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,053
I told you I'd wait.

559
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,908
So now, we're...

560
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,159
We're going out, right?

561
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,495
-What?
-No?

562
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,374
Yes, we are.

563
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,809
Shall we go now?

564
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,636
It's pretty much the same, right?

565
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,725
Should we hold hands?

566
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,106
Well...

567
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,817
we could.

568
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:01,808
We're here already.

569
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:05,812
I know.

570
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,652
I should let go of your hand now.

571
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,629
Thanks, get home safely.

572
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,298
Alright, go in.

573
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,092
Okay.

574
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,681
Bye. Go home safely.

575
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,544
-You're back.
-Yes.

576
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,171
Why did he want to see you?
Was it something urgent?

577
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,257
No, nothing urgent.

578
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:18,593
Hey, do you...

579
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,389
still like Do Kyung-seok?

580
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:23,890
What?

581
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,894
I mean, feelings can change.

582
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,731
You may like someone else, you know?

583
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,819
Someone else? What are you talking about?

584
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,362
No.

585
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,415
Both you and I need to like guys
who will like us back.

586
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,739
Did something happen yesterday?

587
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,409
You drank a lot yesterday.
Have some of this.

588
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,959
Make sure to take this before you drink.

589
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,878
Hey, what's wrong with you?

590
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:17,963
Why?

591
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,349
I must've made a mistake.

592
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,353
Are you being all nice to me
because you're going to move out?

593
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,188
Why would I move out?

594
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,448
-Did you cook this?
-Yes.

595
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,827
-You're a pretty good cook.
-You can find all sorts of recipes online.

596
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,537
That's right.

597
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,582
I did make a mistake, right?

598
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,126
You did.

599
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,880
By any chance, did I cry? No, right?

600
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,759
I think you did tear up a bit.

601
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,221
Did I actually cry?

602
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,807
If you jab the back of your throat
with a toothbrush like this,

603
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,642
you could tear up.

604
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,605
I'm glad I brushed my teeth
before going to bed.

605
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,288
I told Mi-rae that I like her,
but she rejected me.

606
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:37,792
I thought she'd at least think about it,
but she rejected me right away.

607
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,840
I know you like Mi-rae too.

608
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,467
Good luck.

609
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,555
I'm trying.

610
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,641
You'll have to make a lot of effort.

611
00:55:54,809 --> 00:56:00,315
Mi-rae is quite reserved and cautious,
so it won't be as easy.

612
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:05,153
Don't tell her about me getting all drunk.

613
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,613
She'll feel bad.

614
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,242
Did you like her a lot?

615
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,749
I think I did. More than I realized.

616
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,726
Am I dreaming?

617
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,317
DO KYUNG-SEOK

618
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,652
Are you awake?

619
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,613
No, this isn't a dream.

620
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,954
YES

621
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,417
Let's go to the lab together.

622
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,005
-What are you doing?
-What?

623
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:08,341
Did you hear some bad news?

624
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:09,843
No.

625
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,181
I have to get ready.

626
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,029
What's wrong with her?

627
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,494
I should have done a facial mask
last night.

628
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,499
Why is my face so puffy today?

629
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,175
-Hi.
-Hi.

630
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,887
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes, what about you?

631
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,764
I did too.

632
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,269
This sounds like a conversation
in an English textbook.

633
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,270
What do you mean?

634
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,399
Good morning, how are you?
I'm fine. And you?

635
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,447
Oh, the bus is here.

636
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:04,958
Go ahead.

637
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,211
Okay.

638
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,974
Did you have breakfast?

639
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,561
No, I just had a glass of water.

640
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,272
Do you usually skip breakfast?

641
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,901
I eat breakfast sometimes.

642
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:33,778
What about you?

643
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,407
I had breakfast with Woo-young.

644
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,579
Did you tell him?

645
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,830
Tell him about what?

646
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,542
Did you tell Woo-young that we're dating?

647
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,587
No, not yet.

648
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:52,714
I see.

649
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:55,633
Should I tell him?

650
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:57,719
No.

651
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,888
If he finds out I started dating you
right away...

652
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,016
Do you feel bad?

653
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,643
Yes, a little bit.

654
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:09,731
I guess...

655
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,943
-you're worried about Woo-young.
-No, I'm not.

656
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,573
It's just that he was the first person
who rooted for us.

657
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,492
Who? Woo-young?

658
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,077
Yes.

659
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,371
He wished me good luck with you.

660
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,294
I guess I made it pretty obvious
that I like you.

661
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,424
-He deserved to get his teeth brushed.
-What?

662
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,217
Nothing.

663
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,389
By the way...

664
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,187
I'd prefer not to tell people.

665
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:50,772
Why?

666
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:55,318
-Are you worried they might say something?
-Yes.

667
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,570
I must sound so dumb.

668
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,242
If anyone says anything,
I won't let it go.

669
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:09,207
Do whatever you want.
It doesn't matter to me.

670
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:22,345
But no one on this bus knows.

671
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:23,971
What?

672
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,904
-Forget it if you don't want to.
-No, I want to.

673
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,102
Let's stay like this until we get off.

674
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:13,855
Okay.

675
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,746
Are they coming together?

676
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:33,249
-You mean Kyung-seok and Sua?
-Yes.

677
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,835
But Kyung-seok seemed
pretty upset yesterday.

678
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,044
He seemed a bit mad.

679
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,963
Haven't you watched
any romantic comedies?

680
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,590
Bickering can make
the heart grow fonder.

681
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:43,760
That's true. I wonder why we're still
not fond of each other.

682
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,052
What happened yesterday?

683
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,346
-With what?
-With Kyung-seok.

684
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:54,061
I think he likes someone else.

685
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,021
What?

686
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:02,195
Hey, where are you?

687
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,865
-I'm almost there.
-I have big news for you.

688
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:06,949
What is it?

689
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,994
He rejected Sua.

690
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:13,414
She deserves it.

691
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,666
Apparently, Kyung-seok likes
someone else.

692
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,752
Gosh, who could it be?

693
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,506
She must be prettier than Sua,
so it can't be someone from our school.

694
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,382
-Hey.
-What?

695
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,301
Sua isn't that pretty.

696
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,972
My goodness.

697
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,059
You should've given up like that
a long time ago.

698
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,270
Who could it be?

699
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,983
Are you not going to tell Hyung-jung too?

700
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,821
No, I should tell her.

701
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:52,662
You should go in first.
I'll go in a bit later.

702
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,581
No, I'll go in later.
You go ahead.

703
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,707
No, you go in first.

704
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,544
No, you go ahead. I'm really okay.

705
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,212
What are you guys doing?

706
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:04,382
Hey, Unnie.

707
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,343
Why are you guys not going in?

708
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:11,472
-We just ran into each other here.
-What?

709
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,895
That didn't even make sense.

710
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,692
I'll head in first.

711
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:32,076
Did Kyung-seok tell you what happened
with Sua yesterday?

712
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,369
Pardon?

713
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:37,832
I don't think it went well.

714
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,959
I knew it.

715
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:41,711
How?

716
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:44,463
I think he has feelings for you.

717
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:45,756
What?

718
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:50,261
What on earth are you talking about?

719
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:55,141
You said Jung-boon is taking
a summer class, right?

720
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:58,060
Yes, let's visit her school soon.

721
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,647
I miss Jung-Boon.

722
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,026
I feel bad for Sua.

723
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,320
She should've just kept it to herself.

724
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:11,449
Hey, why didn't you feel bad for me?

725
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,328
Everyone knew I had a crush on Kyung-seok.
I was so embarrassed.

726
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,414
That's because you were hitting on him.

727
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,207
What?

728
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:24,879
Hey, Tae-hee.

729
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,348
Do Kyung-seok.

730
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,532
Shouldn't we finish our conversation
from yesterday?

731
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,827
I told you everything I had to say.

732
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:02,667
I've told everyone that you rejected me.

733
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,546
-Unnie.
-Yes?

734
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,009
I have to use the restroom real quick.

735
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,302
Okay.

736
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,811
I won't be like that again.

737
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:24,438
I'm sorry if I bothered you.

738
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,527
We'll have to see each other
at school.

739
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:33,155
We'll both be uncomfortable
if we're on bad terms.

740
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,325
-Let's at least say hi to each other.
-Depends on how you behave.

741
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,205
You're so cold to me.

742
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,376
So are you dating Mi-rae?

743
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:50,965
Are you guys dating?

744
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,218
Yes.

745
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:01,934
We are dating.

746
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,628
-You've gotten so brave, Mi-rae.
-How dare you.

747
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,047
I feel like I'm in a spy movie.

748
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,841
We won't run into people
from our department, right?

749
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:36,260
It looked like Tae-young was confessing.

750
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,929
Is there something you wanted to tell me?

751
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,389
Hey, isn't this Sua?

752
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,307
What is this?

753
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,601
I happened to see it while I was
surfing the web.

754
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,687
-Who took the photos?
-Hide it from people in your department?

755
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:50,232
-Who is he seeing after rejecting Sua?
-If people find out that it's me...

756
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,567
Don't feel bad for me.

757
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,110
That's what Sua wants.
