1
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,218
Are you done?

2
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,764
No, I'm not done.
I haven't even taken off...

3
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,687
Tell me when you're done.

4
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,153
What is this situation?

5
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,159
This is like...

6
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,787
going to an island together

7
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,997
and missing the last ferry back.

8
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,132
But there's only one room.

9
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,468
Isn't this what it's like?

10
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,685
I must be going crazy.
What am I thinking?

11
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,025
Turn around in 20 minutes.

12
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,070
-What?
-Stay still for 20 minutes.

13
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,989
-Hey!
-Is this a punishment or what?

14
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,783
-Why should I?
-10 minutes, then.

15
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,535
BASED ON THE WEBCOMIC
MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY BY KI MAENG-GI

16
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,371
I don't want you to know exactly
when I changed.

17
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,708
Turn around.

18
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,669
-I'll give you 20 seconds.
-What?

19
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,964
-Hey.
-Start.

20
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,723
By the way, how will you know
when 20 seconds are up?

21
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,267
12.

22
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,227
13.

23
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,855
14.

24
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,107
15.

25
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,152
16.

26
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,779
17.

27
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,365
18.

28
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,493
19.

29
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:46,749
20.

30
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,605
I'm done.

31
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,837
You're wearing it backwards.

32
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,922
What?

33
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,013
I'll give 30 seconds.

34
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,309
Hey, don't do that.

35
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,104
Just don't turn around
until I tell you that I'm done.

36
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,575
Will you leave without watching it?

37
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,577
You can stay and watch it.

38
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,248
Why are you suddenly in a bad mood?

39
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,709
I'm not. I'm just tired.

40
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,462
Sua.

41
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,008
Why did you only call Sua?
Ji-hyo is here too.

42
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,677
Hi, Ji-hyo.

43
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,928
No need to call my name.

44
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,764
Are you not going to watch
the performance?

45
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,557
I want to leave because I'm tired.

46
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,269
Already?
You should stay for a little longer.

47
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,732
Hey, he's been looking for you
all day long.

48
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,943
At least take a photo with him.

49
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,570
-Hey.
-Just be quiet, okay?

50
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,155
Let's take a photo.

51
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,619
Oh, my goodness. It's your lucky day, man.

52
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,622
Then... go stand over there, will you?

53
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,874
A little further back.

54
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,715
Oh, my. What nice scenery.

55
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,300
-Ji-hyo.
-Yes?

56
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,801
-Get out.
-Me?

57
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,011
Yes, get out.

58
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,308
Sua, you look so pretty. This is great.

59
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,059
Won-ho, smile.

60
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,689
All right, I'm going to take it now.
1, 2...

61
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,357
-Hey!
-Hold on! Just a second.

62
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,151
Let's take it together.

63
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,863
-What is this about? Gosh!
-Can't we be in this photo?

64
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,365
All right. You can eat this. Here.

65
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,576
-Let's take it.
-She wants us in the photo.

66
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,119
Send the photo to us too.

67
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,579
Sure, no problem.

68
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,039
Here we go.

69
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,125
One, two, three.

70
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,337
-Another one?
-Yes.

71
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,671
Okay, sure.

72
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,798
All right. Here we go!

73
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,968
-Perfect.
-Is it perfect?

74
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,386
-It's perfect.
-You're always so serious.

75
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,721
KYUNG-SEOK, PLEASE JOIN
THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN

76
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,473
-Have fun, guys.
-Okay.

77
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,642
-Did you finish it?
-Was it not good?

78
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,527
You were...

79
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,654
cool yesterday.

80
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,866
What you did to Trash.

81
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,537
What's cool about it?

82
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,332
Everyone found out my nickname.

83
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,337
It wasn't a surprise to you
since you already knew.

84
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,254
I didn't know.

85
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,632
What?

86
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,593
That nickname of yours.

87
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,053
I didn't know.

88
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,933
You didn't know what everyone else knew?

89
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,103
Was I an outcast?

90
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,610
Nobody made you an outcast.
You probably wanted to be alone.

91
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,695
Everyone wanted to be friends with you.

92
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,864
With me? Why?

93
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,241
Because I'm handsome?

94
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,120
If you...

95
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,164
hadn't gotten the wrong idea,

96
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,792
could we have been friends?

97
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,304
You'd never have wanted...

98
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,849
to be friends with me.

99
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,562
There were many pretty girls.

100
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,359
Looks aren't everything.

101
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,821
I don't like...

102
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,491
pretty girls.

103
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,333
So are you saying...

104
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,422
I'm ugly?

105
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,343
Well, you're funny.

106
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,805
Do you think I'm funny because I'm ugly?

107
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,224
No.

108
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,687
I just thought
your dance on the bench was funny.

109
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,358
I liked that you were funny.

110
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,120
Let's head inside.

111
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,511
Hey!

112
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,304
Were you here together?

113
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,306
Yes.

114
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,601
What are you guys doing here?

115
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,895
I came here to get changed.

116
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:41,854
What?

117
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,566
Thank you.

118
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,778
Thanks.

119
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,908
She came to get changed?

120
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,080
I guess I'm no longer a loner.

121
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,791
I have a friend now.

122
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,084
What?

123
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,169
I have you.

124
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,926
I never had a guy friend before.

125
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,930
I can't believe I'm friends with him.

126
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,604
That's so pretty.

127
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,323
In one, two, three.

128
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,065
You should go now.
You don't need to walk me home.

129
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,233
It's not like I shouldn't.

130
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,489
My bus is here.

131
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,492
I'll go now. See you.

132
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,391
I have a friend now.

133
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,684
What?

134
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,019
I have you.

135
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,656
BUS 7010 ROUTE

136
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,328
Sir.

137
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,631
Sua.

138
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,592
Look at this.

139
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,928
He's Kyung-seok's dad.

140
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,398
CANDIDATE DO SANG-WON GOES
CAMPAIGNING FOR VOTES

141
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,279
HIS EX-WIFE IS NA HYE-SUNG,
THE CEO OF KELUN KOREA,

142
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,239
AND THE TWO GOT DIVORCED TEN YEARS AGO.

143
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,340
What are you doing?

144
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:42,470
Kyung-hee came in 23rd out of 26 students.

145
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,475
The other three didn't take the test,
and don't come to school.

146
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,375
I know I did something wrong,

147
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,212
but this is just too much.

148
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,214
What did you do wrong?

149
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,760
Getting bad grades isn't a bad thing.

150
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,513
Right?

151
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,322
Kyung-seok, stop crying right now.

152
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,407
A man shouldn't cry over
something petty.

153
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,202
What's wrong with you?

154
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,704
The least you could do is
try to console him.

155
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,792
Guys need to have a strong mindset.
Why do you cry so easily?

156
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,337
Gender has nothing to do with crying.
He can cry if he feels upset.

157
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,216
I gave him everything he wanted,
and now he's just weak.

158
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,806
Don't even think about coming inside.

159
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,850
He's so mean.

160
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,270
-Dad's so mean.
-Why did you cry?

161
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,397
Did something upset you?

162
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,023
Yes.

163
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,400
It's okay.

164
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,199
Guys can cry if they want to.

165
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,451
That doesn't mean you're weak.

166
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,329
That's not what Dad says.

167
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,331
A true strong person is...

168
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:39,253
someone who tries not to hurt the people
who are weaker than them.

169
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,215
Kyung-seok, you're healthy

170
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,552
and very handsome.

171
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,596
So you'll have to be extra careful.

172
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,367
-According to the freshmen...
-Yes?

173
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,037
...Kyung-seok's
dad used to be a congressman.

174
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,164
-Really?
-Yes.

175
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,916
Who?

176
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,501
His name was Do something.

177
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,463
Well, of course, his last name is Do.

178
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,257
-Gosh.
-Do...

179
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,467
What was his name?

180
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,844
His mom's the CEO of Kelun.

181
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,012
-Really?
-Yes.

182
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:34,266
Gosh, if my mom was the CEO of Kelun,
I would've beaten Chan-woo up as well.

183
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,768
Chan-woo must've known.

184
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,312
Otherwise,
he wouldn't have let him get away.

185
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,982
But I haven't seen him around
for a really long time.

186
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,901
You're the one who should know.

187
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,111
-What do you mean?
-He's your best friend.

188
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,614
-What are you saying?
-You didn't have to hit me.

189
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,804
FROM: DAD
DON'T SKIP YOUR MEALS.

190
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,812
I'll visit you on Saturday.

191
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,733
-His dad used to be a congressman.
-Really?

192
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,193
The perfume company.

193
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,196
-I use their perfume.
-I love their products.

194
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,163
They're probably talking about me.

195
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,342
His mom's the CEO of Kelun.

196
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,885
He's really rich.

197
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,304
-My gosh.
-He comes from a great family.

198
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,433
I heard his parents got divorced.

199
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,018
No wonder he's so cold.

200
00:16:59,101 --> 00:16:59,935
Hey, Sua.

201
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,687
-Hi.
-Hey.

202
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,522
He's so good-looking.

203
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,608
-He really is.
-He's so handsome.

204
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:09,737
Hey, Mi-rae.

205
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,822
Hey.

206
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:16,660
Kyung-seok's dad is a congressman
and his mom's the CEO of Kelun.

207
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,995
-Really? Who?
-Yes.

208
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,205
He's from a rich family.

209
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,790
No wonder he's so rude.

210
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,250
-I get it now.
-Yes.

211
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,585
He lacks nothing.

212
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,088
Did you tell everyone?

213
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,757
Well...

214
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:36,889
Hey.

215
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,651
Give me his phone.

216
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,540
You dropped this yesterday.

217
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,881
You're coming to the after-party?

218
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,676
You really are the worst.

219
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,428
What?

220
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,940
Hello.

221
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,275
-Hello.
-Hello.

222
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:36,406
Let's talk about the assignment
you must submit before the final exam.

223
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,621
Watch one of the movies
that are currently playing at theaters

224
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,332
and submit your report on that movie.

225
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,460
There isn't any format or guideline, okay?

226
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,254
-Yes, professor.
-Yes, ma'am.

227
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,759
Hey, let's go watch a movie together.

228
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,597
Did you get shot in the head?

229
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,309
Bang, bang.

230
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,521
Kyung-seok.

231
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,024
Are you going to the after-party?

232
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,025
What about you?

233
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,652
I think I'm going.

234
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,530
I'll think about it.

235
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,740
Okay.

236
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,288
-You took the wrong bus, didn't you?
-No.

237
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,958
I had to go somewhere yesterday.

238
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,843
Hello, Woo-young.

239
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,460
You're here.

240
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,503
Hello.

241
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,464
-Come sit here.
-Okay.

242
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,765
Why did you want to see me?

243
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,976
I have to visit the office of Kelun Korea
regarding our partnership.

244
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,811
The director wants you to come.

245
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,313
Me?

246
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,858
She wants to know
how you made the candles.

247
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,318
Seems like you did a great job.

248
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,654
Well...

249
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,989
How about today?
Any plan after school?

250
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,784
We're having the festival after-party.

251
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,790
I think I can go there late
after visiting the office with you.

252
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,416
-Really?
-Yes.

253
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,710
-Then I'll see you later.
-Okay.

254
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,254
Mi-rae.

255
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,966
How do you do this?

256
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,094
Wait, that's...

257
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:07,099
I can follow the choreography
except for this part.

258
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,684
Can you teach me how to do it?

259
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,187
-Well...
-Well, later.

260
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,772
-See you later.
-Okay, bye.

261
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,360
You came early.

262
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,488
I have no part-time work today,
so I came to help you.

263
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,282
Thank you.

264
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,547
By the way, aren't you hiring
any part-timers?

265
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,385
What is it?

266
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,096
-None of them are pretty?
-That's not it.

267
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,556
I have no money.

268
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,141
What?

269
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,435
I think my business is going badly.

270
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,813
I might have to take out my house deposit
to pay for the rent here.

271
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,190
Let me take a look at the ledger.

272
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,317
Ledger?

273
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,405
Even elementary school students would do
a better job than this.

274
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,615
You have to organize this with Excel.

275
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,034
Excel?

276
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,747
-You're pretty smart.
-You don't even know such a thing?

277
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,792
If you lack experience,
you should hire an experienced part-timer.

278
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,336
Business isn't a joke.

279
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,050
Pass.

280
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,510
You're hired.

281
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,477
Did you think I'd be excited?

282
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,021
This isn't time to play around.

283
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,568
1, 2.

284
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,489
Who taught you that dance?

285
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,783
I just watched video clips...

286
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,993
You learned this
only by watching videos?

287
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,995
-Stop it.
-Why? It's cool.

288
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,164
I respect those who are good at dancing.

289
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,041
How did you...

290
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,088
Amber Five?

291
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,509
-But it smells a bit different.
-It is Amber Five.

292
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,514
I knew you were interested
in perfume, too.

293
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,600
Well, I'm the teaching assistant
of the chemistry department.

294
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,523
But it smelled a bit different
from the familiar scent of Amber Five.

295
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,193
People all have their own body scent.
It affects the scent.

296
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,823
Like how you dance this move is
different from how I do it.

297
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,326
That's not how you do it.

298
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,744
This.

299
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,165
All right, look.
Stand still like this.

300
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,710
Put your arms like this.

301
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,005
-Like this.
-Like this?

302
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,341
I respect that, seriously.

303
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,936
I plan to hold a housewarming party
this Saturday.

304
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,690
I'm going to see my parents this Saturday.

305
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,485
Then how about Sunday?

306
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,281
Good for me,
but I'm not sure about Hyun-jung.

307
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,490
Really?

308
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,368
How about we create a group chat
to talk about it?

309
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,745
Sure, I'll make it.

310
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,249
Let's not make it grand
like a real party.

311
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,960
Let's just gather up
and eat delicious food.

312
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,378
Kyung-seok said he'd come.

313
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,255
-What?
-Why?

314
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,301
It's nothing.

315
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,307
We're friends. Friends.

316
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,689
GROUP CHAT ROOM

317
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,065
ARE YOU FREE THIS SUNDAY?

318
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,942
I'M GOOD
WHAT ABOUT YOU, KYUNG-SEOK?

319
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:46,860
Kyung-seok.

320
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,946
Well...

321
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,117
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

322
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:58,246
I didn't mean to look at your phone
on purpose.

323
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,208
It's just that a message popped up
on the screen.

324
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,127
I told only a few of my friends,

325
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,297
but word got out in the entire department.

326
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,176
Sorry.

327
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,559
I heard it from Ji-hyo.

328
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,813
-Sorry about misunderstanding.
-It's nothing new.

329
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,607
I'm fine.

330
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,236
I was shocked more by...

331
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,031
how you sounded like
you expected this from me.

332
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,160
I realized how you thought of me.

333
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:42,207
You must've kept misunderstanding
if it hadn't been for Ji-hyo.

334
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,882
You think
all my behaviors are intentional.

335
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,848
How you think about me is up to you.

336
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,310
But it was a bit upsetting for me
this time.

337
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,068
You know...

338
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,991
I don't have a mom either.

339
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:24,165
That's why I know how it feels
to have my hurtful experience...

340
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,668
revealed to others.

341
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,339
No one knows about it.

342
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,133
You're the first.

343
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,805
You know what it means, right?

344
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,737
WHAT ABOUT YOU, KYUNG-SEOK?

345
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,405
Okay.

346
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:57,907
Okay.

347
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,747
The CEO was taken to the emergency room
just a while ago.

348
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,665
The director went with her.

349
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,668
-What?
-Why was she taken to the hospital?

350
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,170
I'm not sure.

351
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,797
-Let's go.
-Okay.

352
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,132
Thank you. Goodbye.

353
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,761
All right, guys.

354
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:22,724
These two have something to tell you.

355
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,060
Come on.

356
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,733
I think I offended you
during the preparation period.

357
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,070
I didn't know you were that sensitive.
I'm sorry.

358
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,031
-Me, too.
-What are you sorry about?

359
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,910
Well, for criticizing you
about your looks.

360
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,370
I can't hear you.

361
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,834
I'm sorry that I criticized you
about your looks...

362
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,838
and forced only the female students
to wait tables.

363
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,674
What about the uniforms?

364
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,093
I'm sorry.

365
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,261
I'm really sorry, too.

366
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,306
We'll never do that again. We're sorry.

367
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,728
Stop being mad at us.
I scolded these two harshly.

368
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,899
We have to see each other around.
Will you keep being awkward?

369
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,528
They can sound mean and rude,
but you know that they're not bad guys.

370
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,612
-Aren't I right?
-Yes.

371
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,655
Yes.

372
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:24,828
We will accept your apology, but how
you behave from now on matters more.

373
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,663
Thanks, Yoon-byeol.

374
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,832
Then let's raise our glasses, everyone.

375
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,835
Good work with the festival,
and we're sorry again.

376
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,753
My, what a beautiful sight!

377
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,214
-Cheers, everyone.
-Cheers!

378
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,882
Good work, everyone.

379
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,350
Have the two of you been hanging out
often lately?

380
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,937
Seeing the two of you together is
a bit weird.

381
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,732
What's weird about it? We're close.

382
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,108
Right, Kyung-seok?

383
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,737
Yes.

384
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:03,158
-Does it mean we have a new couple?
-Does it mean we have a new couple?

385
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,079
What did she eat?

386
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,331
She must've eaten spoiled food.

387
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,208
Thankfully, she's okay this time.

388
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,043
She can be discharged tomorrow.

389
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,212
Has something like this happened before?

390
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,591
She has been in the ER
after eating spoiled food.

391
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,969
It must've smelled very bad.

392
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,139
She probably hasn't told either of you,

393
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,226
but she can barely smell anything
at the moment.

394
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,895
-Sorry?
-Pardon?

395
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,858
She was in a big accident and
her olfactory nerve was severely damaged.

396
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,318
My goodness.

397
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,529
That's why she ends up eating spoiled food
at times.

398
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,616
Then Kelun Korea... What about perfumes?

399
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,367
She's very impressive.

400
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:50,997
It's like a singer losing her voice
and a painter losing her sight.

401
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,462
Excuse me for a moment.

402
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,548
Yes, sir.

403
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,803
Something urgent came up.
Yes, I apologize.

404
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,721
I'll call you in a bit.

405
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,181
Okay.

406
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,268
You can go if you need to.
I'll stay here.

407
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,312
Would you really do that for me?

408
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,731
I can be back in two to three hours.

409
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,484
Yes, I'll stay right by her side.

410
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,569
You can get going too.

411
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,071
Gosh, how could I...

412
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,156
It's okay. You can go.

413
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,574
Please look after her.

414
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,423
Oh, does Ms. Na have no family?

415
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,343
Didn't Professor Park tell you?

416
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:46,803
About what?

417
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,763
It was in the newspapers too.

418
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,724
She got divorced years ago.
She lives alone.

419
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:53,977
I see.

420
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,648
I actually wanted to get in touch
with her son earlier,

421
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,985
but I didn't because she'd probably
get mad at me if she found out.

422
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,654
He's in the chemistry department.

423
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,365
He's in our department? What's his name?

424
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,867
His name is Do Kyung-seok.

425
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:13,329
Please pretend you know nothing.
Ms. Na hasn't seen him in years.

426
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,540
Oh, okay.

427
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,377
-This has to stay between us.
-Yes.

428
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:57,999
Thanks.

429
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,047
I didn't want to tell anyone about it.

430
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,967
But I do feel much better
now that I've told someone.

431
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,183
Do Kyung-seok and Hyun Sua.

432
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,518
Both are good-looking
and from rich families.

433
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,728
Parallel theory?

434
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,565
Parallel lines never meet.

435
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,567
Look at you. You sound so confident.

436
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,570
-Just go and grab the microphone.
-The microphone?

437
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,371
KANG MI-RAE

438
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,642
Ladies and gentlemen.

439
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,978
Next up is the star of Hankook University.

440
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,854
The most beautiful angel,

441
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,191
Hyun Sua, will sing for us!

442
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,694
Please give her a big hand!

443
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,864
-Hyun Sua!
-Hyun Sua!

444
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:14,867
Where are you?

445
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,414
You're at a hospital?

446
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:23,334
Ms. Na is hospitalized
because of food poisoning.

447
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,462
She ate food that had gone bad.

448
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,721
I heard she can't smell things anymore
due to an accident.

449
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,181
Did you know about it?

450
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,353
I'm staying with her now
because she has no one else.

451
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,691
Will you come?

452
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,779
No.

453
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,412
Well, there's something
I have to tell you.

454
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:04,417
I actually saw her back in middle school.

455
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,756
I'm saying I saw your mom
in our neighborhood.

456
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,259
She must've come to see you.

457
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,596
I have to go.

458
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,869
Room 1013 at Hankook University Hospital.

459
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,164
I'm sorry.
I won't meddle in your business anymore.

460
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,011
-Are you okay?
-How do you feel?

461
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,139
Yes. I'm so sorry
that you had to stay here.

462
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,017
Soo-hyun, please drive Mi-rae home.

463
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,937
No, I can take the bus home.

464
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,146
I'll call a cab.

465
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,650
Director Lee.
I want you to go home as well.

466
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,027
I can't leave you alone.

467
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,863
Don't worry. I'm not a kid.

468
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,824
You're more stubborn than a kid.

469
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,660
I'll be off now.

470
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,830
-Bye.
-Hold on, Mi-rae.

471
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,416
Thank you.

472
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,878
No problem.

473
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,549
Goodbye. Take good care of yourself.

474
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,569
Hey, Woo-young.

475
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,739
Ms. Na woke up. Don't worry.

476
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,325
Bye.

477
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,495
-Woo-young came as well?
-Yes.

478
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,873
What am I going to do?

479
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,208
I caused everyone trouble.

480
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,294
That's why you should hire an assistant.

481
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,672
What kind of a CEO doesn't have
an assistant and drives herself?

482
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,800
I really hate it when someone keeps...

483
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,595
following me around.

484
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:24,098
Gosh, what if you get into an accident?

485
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,184
I've never been in a car accident.

486
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,709
Then at least date someone.

487
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,796
Isn't it sad that I'm the only one
who's here to take care of you?

488
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,050
You're not really caring for me.
Gosh, stop nagging and leave.

489
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,803
Are you going to get old all by yourself,
just missing your kids?

490
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,139
You should start settling down.

491
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,600
If I meet a few more of your girlfriends,
it'll add up to 100.

492
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,769
What are you talking about?

493
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,020
You should leave now.

494
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,481
I'll get discharged on my own,
so don't come.

495
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,574
Kyung-seok.

496
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,457
Do Sang-won!

497
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,334
-I'm a fan.
-Do Sang-won!

498
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,544
-Have some.
-Do Sang-won!

499
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,004
-Here.
-Do Sang-won!

500
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,006
-Do Sang-won!
-Do Sang-won!

501
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,342
Goodness, have a drink.

502
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,178
-It will cheer you up.
-Okay, thank you.

503
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,221
Drink up.

504
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,597
Do Sang-won!

505
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,140
Gosh, that's nice.

506
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,976
-Sir.
-Yes?

507
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,687
Kyung-seok and Ms. Na are together
right now.

508
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,355
-Do Sang-won!
-Do Sang-won!

509
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,399
I'm sorry. I'll report to you later.

510
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,985
-Do Sang-won!
-Do Sang-won!

511
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,283
I never even imagined that you would come.

512
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,830
I'm so grateful toward Mi-rae.

513
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,207
You too.

514
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,046
I missed you so much.

515
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,176
But now that you're here,
I don't know what to say.

516
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,181
I can't even bring myself to apologize.

517
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,183
If you're sorry,

518
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,186
you should apologize.

519
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,317
What are you sorry about?

520
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,572
For leaving you and your sister.

521
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,870
I regretted it a lot.

522
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,334
I figured I should've tried
to think about things differently.

523
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:04,383
You should quit work.
You don't need to earn money.

524
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,927
Money isn't the problem.

525
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,598
It's my life-long dream
to become a perfumer.

526
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,689
I told you that
I'm working overtime today.

527
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,233
Why do you always have trouble putting
the kids to bed?

528
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:26,906
I looked after the kids every time
you had a plan or went to play golf.

529
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,534
But I still managed to become
the youngest head researcher.

530
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,411
I can't quit now.

531
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,207
What are you trying to become
by working so hard?

532
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,918
Everyone else dreams of becoming
a stay-at-home mom.

533
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,172
You know the typical question
that everyone asks actresses?

534
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,967
"What's more important?
Your work or your family?"

535
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,223
I never thought there'd come a day
when I had to answer that question.

536
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,060
Is that all?

537
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,070
I got into an accident
and lost my ability to smell.

538
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,906
I also went through a lot with it.

539
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,411
Because I could no longer work
as a perfumer.

540
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,675
FATHER

541
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,806
Kyung-seok isn't picking up?

542
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,312
But is there a reason
why he shouldn't meet his mom?

543
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,275
Is there something
he shouldn't know about

544
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:48,112
that might make him leave you
and run off to live with his mother?

545
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,534
Never mind. I'm sorry.

546
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,912
Cut the nonsense,
and just focus on giving me reports.

547
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:57,913
Yes, sir.

548
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,971
It's late. You should go home.

549
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,058
You should sleep.

550
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,436
I'll go a little later.

551
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,489
Stay healthy.

552
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,146
Kyung-seok.

553
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,857
Did you spend the night somewhere?

554
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,317
Yes.

555
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,320
Kyung-seok, come inside.

556
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:44,872
Sit down.

557
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,335
Where were you?

558
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:51,795
I met Ms. Na.

559
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,637
Okay. I'm sure you missed her.
I understand.

560
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,930
But it's hard to understand her.

561
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,809
She never reached out to you for 10 years,
and now shows up.

562
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,895
She once came
when I was in middle school.

563
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,231
I didn't get to meet her.

564
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,319
Did she tell you
that I didn't let her meet you?

565
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,577
Okay, fine. I didn't let her meet you.

566
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,705
How dare she show up
when she left after having an affair?

567
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,250
That's not true.

568
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:31,669
What?

569
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,712
She didn't have an affair.

570
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,967
Why did you lie?

571
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:41,970
Why did you do that?

572
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,394
I can't believe she made up an excuse
to meet you.

573
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,690
Did you even...

574
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,692
have me followed?

575
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,194
Or did you do that to her?

576
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,740
That wasn't an excuse.

577
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,285
You must know it was food poisoning.

578
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,579
And that she hurt her olfactory nerves.

579
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:08,997
What?

580
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,798
That was a mistake.

581
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,008
Just once.

582
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,220
I hit her one time by mistake.

583
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,856
For a woman,

584
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,944
it was natural to be responsible
for her family, not her job.

585
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,864
Who would like his wife
to keep staying outside?

586
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:45,451
Every time, work came first
before family for her.

587
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,917
I told you to stay home comfortably.

588
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,253
What's comfortable for me?

589
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,715
I have no intention of living
the way you want.

590
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,009
I'm doing my best here.

591
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:06,513
You keep talking back to your husband.
You think you're that great?

592
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,098
How pathetic.

593
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,641
What?

594
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,978
How you're trying to have control over me.

595
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,649
Did you really say that?

596
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:21,695
Why you...

597
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,456
Hye-sung.

598
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:36,794
When I knew that her olfactory sense was
paralyzed, I begged as hard as I could.

599
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,547
I promised her thousands of times
that I'd make her happy

600
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,800
after she resigned from being a perfumer.

601
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,303
But she cared only for her job.

602
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,431
That was why she went crazy.

603
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,600
You ruined someone else's life,

604
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,437
and you said you'd make her happy?

605
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,148
What?

606
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,235
You even ruined our lives
with your lies until now.

607
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,489
And you cared about your family?

608
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,534
Watch what you say.

609
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,577
I raised you until now.

610
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,871
I wouldn't have let you
had I known sooner.

611
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,331
Kyung-seok.

612
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,291
I would've chosen to grow up alone.

613
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,086
Then get out.

614
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,053
You must've kicked my mom out...

615
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,305
this way, right?

616
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,182
What?

617
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,109
Kyung-seok. Stop right there.
Kyung-seok!

618
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,668
Does anyone not like pork?

619
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:00,669
Not me.

620
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,713
I can't eat it because there isn't any.

621
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,089
Is pork belly okay then?

622
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,048
Good.

623
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,384
Me too.

624
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,471
GROUP CHAT ROOM

625
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,144
INCOMING CALL: DAD

626
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,438
Hey, Dad.

627
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,817
I'm almost there.
I'm getting off at the next stop.

628
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,031
Okay.

629
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,373
Wait. Dad.

630
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:45,547
You didn't have to come all the way here.
I could've walked.

631
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,342
Get in.

632
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,652
It's amazing.

633
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,364
You're pretty

634
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,575
however I take pictures of you.

635
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,412
Let her have her meal.

636
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,456
You're still awkward with her looks.

637
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,707
What do you mean?

638
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,502
You worried about her every day,
but you can't see her.

639
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,212
What do you mean, I can't?

640
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,184
It's still awkward, isn't it?

641
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,143
No, no.

642
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,732
It's pretty and nice.

643
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,568
Are you not angry anymore?

644
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,905
He blew off his anger a long time ago.
He's just awkward.

645
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,616
Stop it already. I'm not awkward.

646
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,660
How about karaoke?

647
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,370
-Karaoke?
-Yes.

648
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,288
How about we go for a round?

649
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:02,749
Sounds great.

650
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,043
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

651
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,254
Mom, you should hurry up too.

652
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,090
Dad.

653
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,011
I think he ran away.

654
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,057
I'll call you. Take care.

655
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:32,821
Who are you?

656
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,406
Is Seo Yoo-jin there?

657
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,407
Mom.

658
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,160
Who is it?

659
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,329
Isn't this Seo Yoo-jin's house?

660
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,499
No, it's not. We just moved in here.

661
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,436
Why did you fight with your father?

662
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,396
A bed in this room?

663
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,315
It costs money to throw it away.

664
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,318
And I can't sleep on the floor.
My back will hurt.

665
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,573
You're just as pathetic.
You have no plans.

666
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,785
Do you have money?

667
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,041
The summer season is coming up soon.

668
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:29,127
I'm not sure if I'll be able
to turn on the air conditioner.

669
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,006
I'm not that sensitive to heat.

670
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,008
Don't act up and move back in.

671
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,760
Living alone isn't easy.

672
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,262
You'll be just like me
if you miss the timing.

673
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,278
Sua.

674
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,449
Hey, you.

675
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,785
What brings you here?

676
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,080
-Do you live in this neighborhood?
-Yes.

677
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,792
Didn't you say you live in Dogok-dong?

678
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,169
I moved out recently.

679
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,337
Oh, really?

680
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,839
It hasn't been a few days.

681
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,801
I'll leave you then. See you at school.

682
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,219
Okay, bye.

683
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,566
Yes!

684
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,026
-Goodness.
-Gosh, I'm tired.

685
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,612
Mi-rae. Let's...

686
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,950
add some more time now.

687
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,869
Give us...

688
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,997
-One more hour!
-One more hour!

689
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,040
Let's go!

690
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,295
Mom, wait up.

691
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,547
I need to go home and lie down.

692
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,174
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

693
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,303
We did all the singing.
Why is she exhausted?

694
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,055
Dad, you sang twice as much as I did.

695
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,185
I hadn't been to karaoke in so long.
There were many new songs.

696
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,120
Dad, you still got it.

697
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,752
I'm sorry about everything.

698
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,547
No, don't be.

699
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,508
Just because I adore you,

700
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,886
it doesn't mean you can be happy.

701
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,306
I was too self-centered.

702
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,363
You're still pretty,

703
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,032
my dear daughter.

704
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,162
It must've been very hard for you, Dad.

705
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,957
I'm sorry.

706
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,469
It's okay.

707
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,974
You'll look ugly if you cry.

708
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:34,813
Let's go.

709
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,610
Oh, right. I forgot about BTS.

710
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,410
Where is he?

711
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,707
Honey.

712
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,170
Where did he go?

713
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,976
Where did he go?

714
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,574
What are you doing out here?

715
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:23,731
I wish I had a chance to say goodbye
to Mi-rae's old face.

716
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,113
I'm sorry.

717
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,057
Let's go back inside.

718
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,812
I'm really sorry.

719
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,650
Let's go back in.

720
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,045
-Excuse me.
-Oh, my.

721
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,381
Your place is so nice.

722
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,299
It looks really nice.

723
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,011
My gosh, you have such a nice place.

724
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,683
Woo-young, take this.
It's my housewarming gift for you.

725
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,309
Mi-rae made it.

726
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,107
Oh, a Chypre scent.

727
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:31,651
Thank you.

728
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:35,697
I thought the scent would suit you.
That's why I chose it.

729
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,118
Ms. Na was right.
You really have the talent.

730
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,461
The view from here is incredible.

731
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,298
Isn't it pretty good for the rent
I'm paying?

732
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,966
Your place is amazing.

733
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,636
It's like a penthouse.

734
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,306
Can we come over often?

735
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,557
Yes, of course.

736
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,978
The first time
I'm having girls over.

737
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,813
-Seriously?
-Yes.

738
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,189
Are you conservative?

739
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,108
No, not really.

740
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,862
I couldn't when I was living in a dorm
or a basement apartment.

741
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,655
I thought they'd be uncomfortable.

742
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,950
You're very honest.

743
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,536
By the way, isn't Kyung-seok coming?

744
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:28,583
I'm not sure. I haven't heard from him.

745
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,378
GROUP CHAT

746
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,299
IS EVERYONE OKAY WITH PORK BELLY?

747
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:56,152
It's not brand new,
but it was bought recently.

748
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,682
Could Do Kyung-seok have a crush on you?

749
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,433
Mi-rae, we should watch a movie.

750
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,311
She'll watch a movie with a guy
for the first time.

751
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,646
With a handsome guy.

752
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,773
No, it's just an assignment.

753
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,358
Why do I miss him?

754
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,361
-How about a movie with me?
-I'm going with someone else.

755
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,697
-You want to be my roommate?
-Yes.

756
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,240
What on earth is this about?

757
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,033
Are you trying to get back at me?

758
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,952
Is it possible?

759
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,872
To think of a guy like that
just as a friend.
