1
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,318
BASED ON THE WEBCOMINC
MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY BY KI MAENG-GI

2
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,265
Why didn't you call me?
Have you been waiting long?

3
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,767
-No.
-Let's go in.

4
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:36,406
In a month, rent and half of utilities
are due. If you can't pay, you move out.

5
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,659
I only accept money, not stuff.
We'll buy our own food, okay?

6
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,579
-Okay.
-All right, then.

7
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,916
I'll sleep here. You can sleep there.

8
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,918
I'll sleep there.

9
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,340
Sure, that's fine.
Now, here's some important stuff.

10
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:58,344
Make sure all windows are open
before you use the vacuum cleaner.

11
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,848
And separate the recyclables carefully.
It's important.

12
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,228
The top shelves are mine.
The bottom is yours.

13
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,064
If you must use my shelf,
label your container.

14
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,858
And...

15
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,653
What? What is it?

16
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,364
Nothing. You're a bit different
from what people say.

17
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,700
In what sense?

18
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,494
You're a real nag.

19
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,916
You'll also have to watch your mouth.

20
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,339
Give me that.
Because my place isn't that spacious,

21
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,507
you should lay it out like this.

22
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,135
Then fold it like this.

23
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,554
After that, all you have to do is this.

24
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,097
You saw what I did, right?

25
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,183
What else?

26
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,359
Don't you think that guy likes Mi-rae?

27
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,276
What?

28
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,529
Now that she's pretty,
guys swarm around her.

29
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,783
What? Who? That jerk?

30
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,827
Why are you calling him a jerk?

31
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,622
He's in Mi-rae's department.
I heard he's a TA.

32
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,208
It doesn't matter. All men are animals.

33
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,545
A TA should focus on guiding students.
How dare he have a crush on her?

34
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,632
He's someone's beloved son.
Why are you talking ill of him?

35
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,426
I'd love to have a son-in-law like him.

36
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,054
A son-in-law? Did you say "son-in-law"?

37
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,098
Mi-rae is too young to get married.

38
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,224
She's still a kid!

39
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,019
Okay, I heard you. Just drive carefully.

40
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,437
Goodness.

41
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,275
Where does he live?

42
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,443
Close to Mi-rae's?

43
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,613
Oh, dear.

44
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,331
Who is it?

45
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,250
Hey, Mi-rae.

46
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,089
My mom wanted me to give you this.

47
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,467
-Your mom?
-Yes.

48
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,679
Take the containers. Come in.

49
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,895
Make sure you tell your mom
that I thanked her.

50
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,272
Okay.

51
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:19,193
-You should put everything in the fridge.
-Oh, right.

52
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,237
Let's see.

53
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,579
Hey, what are you doing here?

54
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,122
I live here now.

55
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,418
What?

56
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,135
I posted about looking for a roommate,
and he showed up.

57
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,553
He practically begged me.

58
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,223
You're at the age,
dying to live on your own.

59
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,852
You must've wanted to move out
to be like a cool guy like me, right?

60
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,981
My, these side dishes look amazing.

61
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,447
Kyung-seok moved out of his parents'?

62
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:09,035
Yes, I was so surprised, too. I was
definitely not expecting to see him there.

63
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,620
There must've been a reason.

64
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,416
I wonder
if the talk Ms. Na had with him went well.

65
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,836
It bothers me
that he moved out right after that.

66
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,421
Are you worried?

67
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,091
A little, I guess.

68
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,885
About yourself or him?

69
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,678
About me? Why?

70
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,349
Now that he lives so close by,
you might fall for him. Are you worried?

71
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,184
What are you talking about?

72
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,439
I think that something big will happen
between you two in the near future.

73
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,651
-Are you writing a novel or what?
-What? It's possible.

74
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,236
Kyung-seok's nice to you.

75
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,987
Stop writing stories.

76
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,032
-You should've majored in literature.
-What?

77
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,118
Eat up. This is really delicious.

78
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,788
I cooked a special meal today
to celebrate your moving in.

79
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,208
-You should cook your meals from tomorrow.
-Okay.

80
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,209
Let's eat.

81
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,591
Mi-rae's mother is a great cook.
This is really delicious.

82
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,762
-How do you know her parents?
-I ran into them a couple of times.

83
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,056
How many times exactly?

84
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,599
What?

85
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,148
-What about your breakfast tomorrow?
-I rarely eat breakfast.

86
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,485
Have you ever worked?

87
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,612
No.

88
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,450
You'll have to turn into
an adult starting from tomorrow.

89
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,994
Reality strikes you once you move out.

90
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,135
Turn right.

91
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,763
You've gone off-course.
You'll be redirected.

92
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,599
DO KYUNG-SEOK

93
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,982
I'm sorry. Today's my first day,
so I'm kind of lost.

94
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,110
No, it's okay. I'm not bothered by you.

95
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,112
Just focus on driving safely.

96
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,156
Okay. Thank you.

97
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,884
I wonder if Ms. Na called
because she knew.

98
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,682
You startled me.

99
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,560
Sorry.

100
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,812
Is recycling your responsibility?

101
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,731
Yes.

102
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,296
Can you wait a little?
I'm not done.

103
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,673
Okay.

104
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:27,149
Who throws away cans like that?
You know nothing about it.

105
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,288
Are you okay?

106
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:43,749
Yes.

107
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,002
I'm fine.

108
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,675
Are you hurt? Come over here.

109
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,135
No, it's okay.

110
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,846
Let me see.

111
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,975
I'm really okay.

112
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,655
I'll see you.

113
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,745
See you again.

114
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,204
"See you again"?

115
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,458
Do I need to see him every day now?

116
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,591
-Goodnight.
-You're sleeping already?

117
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,551
I need to leave early in the morning.

118
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,180
You should sleep, too.
You'll have to face reality tomorrow.

Are you okay?

124
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,544
Let me see.

125
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,879
I'm really okay.

126
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,580
Hey.

127
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,374
The hot water won't turn on.

128
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,584
Hot water?

129
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,130
I haven't used it yet,
but I'm sure there's a button.

130
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,717
But you're a man.
I'm surprised you shower with hot water.

131
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,473
Gosh, I'm about to faint.

132
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,682
He can't be human.

133
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,395
-No, you should go to him and say hello.
-No.

134
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,189
My gosh.

135
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,692

What are you doing here?

143
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,028
I was waiting for you.

144
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,158
He waited...

145
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,452
for me?

146
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,583
-How did you know we'd come?
-I never saw you pass by.

147
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,145
-The weather's so nice.
-The fine dust level is bad.

148
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,484
It's really bad today.

149
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,406
Why did you move into Woo-young's place?

150
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,533
Didn't you move out to live alone?

151
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,328
It's cheap there.
I don't have money right now.

152
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,164
Didn't your dad offer to pay for you?

153
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,336
Did you run away?

154
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,922
Why would I? I'm not a kid.

155
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,385
Does your mother know about this?

156
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470
I didn't tell her yet.

157
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,224
Our bus is here.

158
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,481

160
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,196
I'm sorry.

161
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,699
You go first.

162
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,828
-Hey.
-Hey.

163
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,719
Is he mad at us?

164
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,722
So why did you have to ask details
about his private life?

165
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,391
We're friends.
You can ask a friend that much.

166
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,351
You asked him
if Ms. Na knew about it.

167
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,647
It doesn't look like he did it
for a good reason, right?

168
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,065
Right.

169
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,206
You face reality once you move out.

170
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,135
Why does he want the study guide from me?

171
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,596
-Who?
-Jang Won-ho.

172
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,100
Gosh, why is he talking so nicely
all of a sudden?

173
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,896
Ji-hyo, do you have a study guide
for the finals?

174
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,023
Would you share it with me?

175
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,652
I guess he's trying to hit on me now
because it doesn't work on you.

176
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,036
I've got you a new cup of coffee.

177
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,413
-You're here.
-Here you go.

178
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,040
Sung-woon.

179
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,084
Check this out.

180
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,252
Here.

181
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,379
HYUN SUA

182
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,839
Here.

183
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,678
It's the picture that I took, right?
She changed her profile.

184
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,057
How do you notice
even her newly updated profile picture?

185
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,895
That's impressive.

186
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,565
Didn't you say you'd get flicked
ten times in the forehead

187
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,276
if she changed her profile
to this picture?

188
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,574
I mean, she shouldn't be giving you
empty hope like this.

189
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,659
This isn't right.

190
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,327
Okay, get ready.

191
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,122
Come on. You're in a good mood today.

192
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,249
-So let it slide this one time.
-Okay.

193
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,712
-One.
-Bring it on.

194
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,882
-Two.
-You're good at it.

195
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,425
Right?

196
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:56,885
Three.

197
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,221
Awesome.

198
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,640
Sung-woon?

199
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,226
Sung-woon.

200
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,231
Hi, Sua.

201
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,399
Hello.

202
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,484
Can I come over to your house?

203
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,072
Well, it's pretty late
when I go home after my part-time work.

204
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,491
Is that right? How about weekends then?

205
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,619
I have to go to my parents' house
on weekends.

206
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,581
-You mean, Dogok-dong?
-Right.

207
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,416
Do you live with your grandparents?

208
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,043
When you live with
a lot of family members,

209
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,713
it makes you dream of living alone.

210
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,345
My grandparents passed away.

211
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,060
I'll take care of it myself.

212
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,952
You've become very curious about me.

213
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,582
Well, yes. You can tell me
if you're struggling with anything.

214
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,125
I could help you with it.

215
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,669
Okay.

216
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,547
My class is starting soon.
I have to go. See you later.

217
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,506
Bye.

218
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,517
Should I eat spicy stir-fried pork
or omelet rice?

219
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,810
I'll have pork cutlet.

220
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,689
-Spicy stir-fried pork or omelet rice?
-I said I'll have pork cutlet.

221
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,566
-I had it yesterday.
-Pork cutlet.

222
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,026
-Let's go.
-Pork cutlet.

223
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,948
-Hello?
-Have you had lunch?

224
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,284
No.

225
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,577
Come to the faculty cafeteria.

226
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,831
Never mind if you don't want a free meal.

227
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,517
We were having naengmyeon,

228
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,936
and he gave me his egg.

229
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:57,566
The toppings matter because it's too bland
to eat just the noodles, you know.

230
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,820
Among all the toppings, the half-cut egg
is so precious that you wouldn't share it.

231
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,072
You know what's surprising?

232
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,616
He gave me the pear too.

233
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,204
He knows very well
how to get to your heart.

234
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:15,876
He meant that I didn't need to lose weight
and that I was cute just the way I was.

235
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,087
Did you kiss each other?

236
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,091
Did you hold hands?

237
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,428
He's conservative,
so he isn't good at it.

238
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,721
Hey.

239
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,059
Those men become open-minded
to their girlfriends.

240
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,643
What are you talking about?

241
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,395
Be quiet. Others might hear you.

242
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,272
Jung-yeob.

243
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,608
Oh, hey.

244
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,319
Let's eat together here.

245
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,405
Ye-na is here, so people won't suspect us.

246
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,286
I'm good at keeping secrets,
so you don't need to worry.

247
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,080
I'm not worried.

248
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,166
-Enjoy your food, then.
-Won't you eat with us?

249
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,044
I'll eat with those guys.

250
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,670
I'll call you later.

251
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,761
Ye-na.

252
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:20,273
By the way, why do you keep
your relationship from others?

253
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,609
It's no good to make it public.

254
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,236
We'll only be gossiped about.

255
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,737
Did he say that?

256
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,158
Well, I think the same.

257
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,918
Why aren't there any campus couples
in our department?

258
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,629
Maybe it's just that we don't know.

259
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,674
Hi.

260
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,300
-Hello.
-Hello.

261
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,678
-Are you going to have lunch?
-Yes.

262
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,639
I see. Enjoy your lunch.

263
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,849
-Okay.
-Thanks.

264
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,358
You can call me
when you want to grab a drink.

265
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,529
I'm a huge fan of yours.

266
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,389
You can be hungrier and crave more
when you have no money.

267
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,642
-Did you get a part-time job?
-Not yet.

268
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,145
Post an ad on a job-hunting website.
It won't take long.

269
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:47,402
Or look for private tutoring or teaching
at institutions. They pay you more.

270
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,029
It's easy for us to get one.

271
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:54,451
If not, look for a modeling job.
It's more than 10,000 won per hour.

272
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,329
The workplaces need to be close
to your house and school.

273
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,080
You can save time and transportation fees.

274
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,335
And... If they often hire a new person,
the work must be tough there.

275
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,922
It means their part-timers often run away.
And what else?

276
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,593
Ask me if something's strange.
I know a lot because I've done all kinds.

277
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,473
I have to go prepare for my next class.

278
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,726
Take your time and eat slowly.

279
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,781
Do you live with Woo-young?

280
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,909
I've heard you two talk.

281
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,578
I eat here to avoid the kids.

282
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,042
I've done a shameful thing.
I deserve a beating from my junior.

283
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,212
I've abused my power
just because I'm a senior.

284
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:48,713
Sorry about that.

285
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,634
You should be apologizing to Mi-rae,
not me.

286
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,677
What?

287
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,429
Right, I should apologize to her, too.

288
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,975
I've been looking for her
so I could apologize.

289
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,352
But it's not easy to find her.

290
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,563
Do you know where she is?

291
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,858
Do it properly.

292
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,905
Right, I should.
I've done a terrible thing to her.

293
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,246
Can I introduce you
to a good part-time job?

294
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,584
-I'll go first.
-Oh, okay.

295
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,675
What's up with that punk?
Does he like Mi-rae?

296
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,554
He's hot enough to go out with Sua.
What a lunatic.

297
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,807
Gosh, it's hard to maintain relationships.

298
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,815
What's wrong?

299
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,985
Kim Chan-woo?

300
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,153
That Kim Chan-woo?

301
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,739
-What does he want?
-Did something else happen?

302
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,157
No.

303
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,326
Then why, out of the blue?

304
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,037
-Shall I answer it for you?
-No, it's okay.

305
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,334
Are you still scared of that jerk?

306
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,419
Hey.

307
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,715
We avoid poop because it's gross,
not because it's scary.

308
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,224
What's wrong?

309
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,020
Is that the poop?

310
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,106
What does he want?

311
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,488
Hey, Mi-rae. How have you been?

312
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,410
Can we go somewhere quiet
and talk for a moment?

313
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,828
What is this about?

314
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,458
I need to apologize to her
about something.

315
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,467
My friend can come too, right?

316
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,551
What?

317
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,096
I hate even the thought
of being alone with you.

318
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,891
Right, you must feel that way.
I understand.

319
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,312
Can I get you a cold drink?

320
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:10,980
No, thanks.

321
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,565
Oh, okay.

322
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,824
Hit me and swear at me.

323
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,992
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

324
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,495
Violence is the best way
to punish violence.

325
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,872
Why are you being like this suddenly?

326
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:32,752
You may not believe me,
but I've been very distressed.

327
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,214
I'm a senior,
but I made fun of a freshman's looks.

328
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,884
Sua rejected me but I took it out on you.

329
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,054
I'm really sorry.

330
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:47,225
Punch me all you want and forgive me.

331
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,151
Forget it, if you regret what you did.

332
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,153
-Hey.
-Does that mean you forgive me?

333
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,446
Get up, please.

334
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,408
Thanks.

335
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,035
-Let's get on good terms.
-All right.

336
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,623
-Just don't do things like that again.
-Of course, I won't. Never.

337
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,251
Mi-rae was really hurt by what happened.

338
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,920
Be grateful
that she's accepting your apology.

339
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,256
Yes, of course. I am grateful.

340
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,467
Then...

341
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,302
I'm off.

342
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:23,928
All right, bye.

343
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,312
What's with him now?

344
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,065
I guess he wanted to apologize to me.

345
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,866
Who's that midget?
Who does she think she is?

346
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,826
Is your dad a congressman too?

347
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,747
Gosh, my knees.

348
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,051
You must be busy.
What brings you all the way here?

349
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:07,055
I have too much on my mind. I came here
for your words of encouragement.

350
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,184
I'm not sure how helpful I can be
but I'll do my best.

351
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,610
Then I shall...

352
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,155
I'll always think of you
as well in my prayers.

353
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,657
Thank you.

354
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,965
What's the matter? Any problem?

355
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,800
Kyung-seok moved out.

356
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,927
What is the matter with him?

357
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,305
He met Hye-sung.

358
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,892
He's mad at me for fooling him
when his mom never cheated on me.

359
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,856
So what? Is he staying with her now?

360
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:01,526
No, he's with Yoo-jin now.

361
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,070
Then he'll come back home soon.

362
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:09,367
The bar went out of business. He's trying
to see when he can move back home.

363
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,371
You won't find anything like this.
It's in a great location too.

364
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,333
-Oh, I'll show you over there too.
-Okay.

365
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:20,920
Hey!

366
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,970
For this, you need someone
who's older and experienced. Why me?

367
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,890
My mom just knows how to spend,
not something like this.

368
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,894
She opened it for me when I knew nothing
about business. Can't you tell?

369
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,192
For the premium,
we're thinking 80 million won.

370
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,654
80 million? I paid 100 million
when I got this space.

371
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,073
The business has been very slow.

372
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,910
Not easy to find someone
who's willing to pay this much.

373
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,581
It's because he doesn't know
how to run it.

374
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,416
Other businesses
in the area are doing well.

375
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:02,253
It was renovated only a few months ago.
How could you ask for 20 less?

376
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,756
Please be considerate
of how much we'd be losing.

377
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,763
Then let's settle at 90. I can't pay more.

378
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,764
Let's do that.

379
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,851
Are you out of your mind?

380
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,940
If it's less than that, I'll get
kicked out. My dad will beat me up.

381
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:32,241
It all comes down to money. They can't do
anything if we cut off financial support.

382
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,620
Right? He'll come back home
and beg me, right?

383
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,246
Don't even give tuition fees.

384
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:43,127
He can figure out a way to support
himself, but not for a long time.

385
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,255
You must be firm and strict
at times like this.

386
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,549
If you go easy on him, it never ends.

387
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,927
I certainly won't go easy on him.

388
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,513
No parent can win against their children,

389
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,975
but children can't win against
their parents either. You know that?

390
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,071
Make sure you button up your lab coats.

391
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,823
And tie your hair back, too.

392
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,867
Tie your hair back. You, too.

393
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,494
It's for your safety.

394
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,997
Why did you submit your report
a week late?

395
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,456
Because of him!

396
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,128
Can we move along already?
He's such a nag.

397
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:29,132
I wonder if he also nags people around.
If he does, he probably has no friends.

398
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,842
Thanks for not being meaner.

399
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,428
I have no friends. How did you know?

400
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,221
No, don't mind us.

401
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,514
We were just kidding.

402
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,224
We must follow the protocol.

403
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,812
I don't think you're a nag.

404
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,773
I think you must be popular
among your friends.

405
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,614
Oh, really? Thanks.

406
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,670
So what is it?

407
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,425
I have a crush on Woo-young.

408
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,551
-What?
-What?

409
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,886
I want to date him.

410
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,638
I have no idea
how to make that happen.

411
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,849
Give me some advice, girls.

412
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,062
Oh, my goodness.

413
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,064
Yoon-byul, this is crazy.

414
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,733
You're so cute.

415
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,526
Do you really have a crush on him?

416
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,528
Have you ever seen her cracking jokes?

417
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,781
How did that happen?

418
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:41,204
I've been watching him. I have a lot
to learn from him, and he's sensible.

419
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,083
He's a great role model.
Plus, he's handsome, too.

420
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,376
What should we do?

421
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,629
But how can you say that to his face?

422
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,591
Why can't I? As far as I know,
he's not seeing anyone.

423
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,886
Right, he is single,

424
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,140
but all of his ex-girlfriends were
drop-dead gorgeous.

425
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,558
-Seriously?
-So what?

426
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,185
Yoon-byul is pretty too.

427
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,687
I just wish she was a bit more feminine.

428
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,233
I know, right? Grow your hair out
and put on some makeup.

429
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:15,029
I like your tomboy style,
but I don't think that's Woo-young's type.

430
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,781
What's wrong with my style?

431
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,158
You are pretty.

432
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,704
-Hello.
-Hello.

433
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,624
It's been a while, girls.

434
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,419
Do you know any good part-time positions?

435
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,421
Why are you asking that suddenly?

436
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,174
I'm helping Kyung-seok
find a part-time job.

437
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,177
Why would you do that for Kyung-seok?

438
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,763
Kyung-seok and I are close.

439
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,348
You guys are close?

440
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,058
"After a storm comes a calm."

441
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,562
I apologized and reconciled with him,
and now we're very close.

442
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,193
-Gosh, we're friends.
-You're quite strong.

443
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,571
Hey. Do you have part-time jobs?

444
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,114
-No.
-No.

445
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,575
You guys have so much to learn.

446
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,036
You should learn from Kyung-seok.

447
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,538
Let's learn from him.

448
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,748
How am I going to get him a part-time job?

449
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,502
Gosh, he just shows up out of nowhere
and talks nonsense.

450
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,381
Yoo-jin put his bar up for sale.

451
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,676
Really? Then what's going to happen
to his bar?

452
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,512
It'll have a different owner.

453
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,472
He'll be selling it to someone else.

454
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,391
Then what about Yoo-jin?

455
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,978
He's completely bankrupt,
so he's going to go back home.

456
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,772
I see.

457
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,402
I'll help you out.

458
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,906
Goodness, thank you.

459
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,241
It's really hot.
You should drink some water.

460
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,869
-You're always nice.
-Not at all.

461
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,579
Woo-young is so sweet.

462
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,167
Yoo-jin's two years older than Woo-young.

463
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,669
But Woo-young seems way older.

464
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,630
-Should I take it over there?
-Yes.

465
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,515
TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY: 50,000 WON

466
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,434
CURRENT BALANCE: 800 WON

467
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,894
800 won.

468
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,531
Can I sit next to you?

469
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,327
Do whatever you want.

470
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,884
That's our homework for General Physics.

471
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,262
It's due today.

472
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,597
Some questions were pretty hard to solve.

473
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,182
Are you stuck on any?

474
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,183
Not really.

475
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,604
Everyone's saying
the questions are hard.

476
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,026
You solved this one.

477
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,028
Can you teach me how?

478
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,260
Do you get it now?

479
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,096
I had a hard time solving this question.

480
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,306
Thanks.

481
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,147
Mi-rae.

482
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,607
You're here.

483
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,027
Hey.

484
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,488
-Hey, Mi-rae.
-Hi.

485
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,158
Sit here.

486
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,328
What?

487
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,537
What's wrong?

488
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,332
No, it's nothing.

489
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,430
-Are you doing homework for Physics?
-Yes.

490
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,681
It's nothing.

491
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,186
Hey, Kyung-seok.
Did you move away from home?

492
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,605
-Yes.
-Really?

493
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,525
Gosh, I thought Chan-woo was
talking nonsense.

494
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,694
Did you ask him to find a job for you?

495
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,029
No.

496
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,740
Come on, why would he ask him
to look for a job?

497
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,116
Plus, why would he work?

498
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,827
-I do need a part-time job.
-Why?

499
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,329
I need money.

500
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,831
Don't you get money from your dad?

501
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:37,792
No.

502
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:40,961
Really?

503
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,175
Please don't tell anyone
that you live near my place.

504
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,719
Sua, you moved out as well.

505
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,180
Really?

506
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,975
I recently started living by myself.

507
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,435
Since when?

508
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,647
It's been a while. It's really fun.

509
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,023
Don't you agree?

510
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,027
Are you guys living together?

511
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,738
-What?
-I'm wondering the same thing.

512
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:11,534
You are both from rich families
and moved out at a similar time.

513
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,247
-I smell something fishy.
-Hey.

514
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,249
You're really talking nonsense.

515
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,000
It's not entirely impossible.

516
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:24,255
Kyung-seok and Sua are living
in a parallel universe.

517
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,383
You look good together.
Why don't you just date?

518
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,135
Date each other.

519
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,261
Hey.

520
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,638
You better watch what you say.

521
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,809
I'll watch what I say.

522
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,743
-Get me a designer handbag for women.
-For women?

523
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,788
It's for Kyung-hee,
so get the trendiest one.

524
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,000
Price doesn't matter,
so get me the best one.

525
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,671
He's going to give Kyung-hee
a designer handbag?

526
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,014
These two are the most expensive products
in our store.

527
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:19,518
This product has been purchased
by the top Korean celebrities.

528
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,519
There's only one left.

529
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:24,148
This one's a limited edition
and only five were imported.

530
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,941
It's a popular item in Hollywood.

531
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:30,237
Many female idols wanted this,
but they all gave up because of the price.

532
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,280
I see.

533
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,409
I guess this will be better
for a 17-year-old.

534
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,786
A 17-year-old?

535
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,165
She's so pretty.

536
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,625
Is she a celebrity?

537
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,793
She looks so elegant.

538
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,590
-I look forward to working with you.
-Me too.

539
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,510
She's the CEO of Kelun.

540
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,471
They'll be doing a collaboration
with our brand.

541
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,932
Please send my regards to your CEO.

542
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,559
Okay, I will. We should get going now.

543
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,327
What's up with with this weather?

544
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,287
Let's go.

545
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,998
-Actually...
-Yes?

546
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,834
I'd like one
that will suit a middle-aged woman.

547
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,379
I'll introduce some other products.

548
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,012
You don't have anything else scheduled
for the day. Do you want to go home?

549
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,474
Just a moment.

550
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,110
Hey, Ms. Na.

551
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,737
I was wondering
if we could meet up for a while.

552
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,823
I have something to ask you.

553
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,326
I'll go to your neighborhood.
Just tell me your address.

554
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,413
Okay, I'll see you later.

555
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,164
Bye.

556
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,798
You already hired someone?

557
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,760
Okay.

558
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,598
Have you still not found a job?

559
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,100
No.

560
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,853
Why don't you apply where I work?

561
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,648
It's located near our school
and the owner's really kind.

562
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,484
How much is the pay?

563
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,157
If the owner likes you, he pays you more
than the minimum wage.

564
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,247
Isn't he Kyung-seok
from the Chemistry department?

565
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,708
Will he be working here?

566
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,754
To be honest,
we don't need to hire anymore.

567
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,632
-Do you know how to make a latte?
-No.

568
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,094
Then have you ever worked
as a waiter before?

569
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,598
No. I've only waited tables
at the school festival.

570
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,692
There won't be much to learn. You'll just
have to stay as handsome as you are now.

571
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,945
Sua asked me for a special favor.

572
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,450
You can come to work with Sua
starting tomorrow.

573
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,410
Okay.

574
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,371
Thank you, sir.

575
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:26,914
This is great news.

576
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,625
Yes.

577
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:36,131
Hey, I think one of us will end up
getting fired.

578
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,051
It'll probably be me.

579
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,388
Our manager always hires people
based on their looks.

580
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,265
It sucks to be ugly.

581
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,850
I agree.

582
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,311
See? He's calling me already.

583
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,606
This is so annoying.

584
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,152
Where are you?

585
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,863
I have something to say,
so please come upstairs.

586
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,200
-Sir.
-Yes?

587
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,703
I'm sorry. I don't think I can work here.

588
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,746
-What?
-Bye.

589
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,373
Wait.

590
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:17,089
Good-looking punks are always so rude.

591
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,387
You wanted to see me?

592
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,807
I just wanted to tell you
that you're doing a great job.

593
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,560
-Keep up the good work.
-Pardon?

594
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,353
Get back to work.

595
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,064
Kyung-seok.

596
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,525
What's wrong?

597
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,738
Didn't you know
that someone would lose their job

598
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,281
if I got hired?

599
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,368
What do you mean?

600
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,664
I only did it to help you.

601
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,500
Thank you.

602
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,961
You don't have to care about me.

603
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:57,588
Kyung-seok.

604
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,717
You're so mean, you know that?

605
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,510
Is this my fault, too?

606
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,390
I just don't want to harm others.

607
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,392
Bye.

608
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,582
Do Kyung-seok.

609
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:35,709
Me?

610
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,631
Were you waiting for me?

611
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,007
What?

612
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,343
No.

613
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,011
Never.

614
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:56,939
I'm meeting someone here.

615
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,149
Who?

616
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,152
Woo-young?

617
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,113
-What?
-Are you meeting him alone?

618
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,365
No.

619
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,701
Do you like him?

620
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,288
Do you?

621
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,419
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

622
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,591
Why can't you answer?

623
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,968
Do you like Woo-young?

624
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:29,721
Hey, be quiet.
It's just that I'm flustered.

625
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,139
You aren't saying no.

626
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,560
No, I don't like him, satisfied?

627
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,813
Okay.

628
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,067
What if someone hears it?

629
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,279
Why do you care about that?
You said you don't like him.

630
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,407
Hey, you might not understand,

631
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,285
but people usually care about rumors.

632
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,206
Ms. Na.

633
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,125
You're here.

634
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,257
Were you waiting for her?

635
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,842
That's right.

636
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,219
What about you?

637
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,930
I live nearby here.

638
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,599
What?

639
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,019
Well, right.

640
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,980
He moved to this neighborhood recently.

641
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,025
I see.

642
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,738
How is it?

643
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,990
It must not be comfortable.

644
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,118
It's manageable.

645
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,620
I see.

646
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,790
Let's grab a meal together soon.

647
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:42,669
Let's go, Mi-rae.

648
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,379
Okay.

649
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,134
Buy me a meal today.

650
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,347
What?

651
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,974
If you don't mind.

652
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,685
Of course, you can join us.

653
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,354
You want to?

654
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,661
You wouldn't even try this
when you were young.

655
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,086
You might get an upset stomach.
Eat slowly.

656
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,392
Why did you want to see Mi-rae?

657
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:42,771
Well...

658
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,816
You know, Mi-rae likes perfume.

659
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,402
We're like a mentor and mentee.

660
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,320
That's right.

661
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,907
How are you feeling?

662
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,243
I'm all better now.

663
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:10,048
-Can I order something else?
-Of course. What do you want?

664
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,093
Soju.

665
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,804
Soju?

666
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,389
Yes, or soju bomb.

667
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:21,727
Shall we?

668
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:23,854
Excuse me.

669
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,065
Can we have a bottle of soju
and two bottles of beer?

670
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,053
Cheers.

671
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,524
He must get his drinking skill from her.

672
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,415
This is for me?

673
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:30,128
The most expensive bag in the store.
Don't brag about it too much though.

674
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,259
Put your computer back in your room.

675
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,803
Really?

676
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,935
I'm telling you this just in case.

677
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,771
Tell me if you get a call from that woman.

678
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,898
Don't ever meet her.

679
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,047
I'm glad you and Mi-rae are neighbors.

680
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,842
Do you live alone?

681
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,219
No, I have a roommate.

682
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,428
Is that right?

683
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,851
Aren't you going to ask me...

684
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,769
why I moved out?

685
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,397
Actually,

686
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:35,068
I knew about it
because your father came to see me.

687
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:41,283
I was worried and curious.

688
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,035
But...

689
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,538
I couldn't call you.

690
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,167
Why?

691
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,629
I thought you might not like it.

692
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,769
You can really hold your alcohol.

693
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:18,111
Kyung-seok is famous at school
for being able to hold his liquor.

694
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,739
-Really?
-Yes.

695
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:22,949
I guess...

696
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,203
I get that from you.

697
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,302
Why don't we call it a day after this one?

698
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,722
You shouldn't drink too much
on a school night.

699
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,312
We already drank too much.

700
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,449
I'll treat you to delicious food again.

701
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,077
Thank you.

702
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,081
Ms. Na.

703
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,962
Woo-young.
Do you live in this neighborhood too?

704
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,383
He's my roommate.

705
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,594
Really?

706
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,638
That's good.

707
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:36,106
Actually, Kyung-seok is my son.

708
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,776
Oh, I see.

709
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:42,988
How do you know him?

710
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,826
Professor Park in your department is
fond of him.

711
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,953
I know him very well.

712
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,497
Why don't you come to see our place?

713
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:54,833
May I?

714
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,294
Of course.
I bought a bottle of soju for him.

715
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,256
My gosh, we already drank a little bit.

716
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,550
Then go for a second round at our place.

717
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,639
I don't want to impose.

718
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,474
Not at all. Let's go.

719
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,894
Then shall I come in
for just a few minutes?

720
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,438
Mi-rae, you should join us.

721
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,273
This way, please.

722
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,697
I'll just go home.

723
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,699
Why? Come with us.

724
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,001
Your place is very neat and cozy.

725
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,837
Kyung-seok doesn't have a bed, though.

726
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,796
Not a big deal.

727
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,923
Please take good care of him.

728
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,301
Feel free to come by.

729
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,554
Next time, I'll bring good food with me.

730
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,722
Thanks for today.

731
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,682
No problem.
I didn't even do anything.

732
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,934
Then... Cheers, everyone.

733
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,941
Isn't that your third one?

734
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:06,988
You can drink more?

735
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:08,948
Yes.

736
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,284
Mi-rae, are you really all right?

737
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,994
Yes, I'm totally fine.

738
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,456
Please feel free
to speak casually to me, Ms. Na.

739
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,957
I'm his friend.

740
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,420
-Can I?
-Of course.

741
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,090
I'm happy that you seem close.

742
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,634
Do we?

743
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,390
Are you seeing anyone?

744
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,893
-No.
-Do you have a crush on anyone?

745
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,066
He probably does.

746
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:45,568
Really?

747
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,280
-Who is it?
-What are you talking about?

748
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:50,740
Who is this girl?

749
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,283
Is she first year or older?

750
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,701
I never said anything.

751
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,620
You're not denying it.

752
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,001
-I don't have a crush.
-I guess you can't lie.

753
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,254
You couldn't lie
when you were a kid.

754
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,340
Think whatever you want.

755
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,807
Why did you down it like that?

756
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:20,520
Ms. Na must be the happiest person
at this moment.

757
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,649
Actually, Kyung-seok could be as well.

758
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,155
What are you...

759
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,157
doing here?

760
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,867
You're all grown up now.

761
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,079
Even until just a little while ago,

762
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:43,209
they probably couldn't even imagine
chatting with each other like this.

763
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,088
We all change,

764
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,507
and so do our relationships.

765
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,393
And I had no idea...

766
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,773
that I'd meet the person
who saved my life when I was younger

767
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,276
again like this.

768
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,404
It has nothing to do with you.

769
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,283
I also didn't know that I'd be able to...

770
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:18,369
call the handsome guy, Kyung-seok,
my friend.

771
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,997
I'm no longer an outcast.
I have a friend now.

772
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,290
What?

773
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,375
I have you.

774
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,379
No matter how insignificant the change is,

775
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,424
and although we can't even imagine
its consequences...

776
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,928
-You two look so much alike.
-You think so?

777
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,306
...if it's a heartwarming change
like this, it'll be so nice.

778
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,603
Others' happiness can give me
this much joy.

779
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,356
I felt it for the very first time.

780
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,363
Mi-rae.

781
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,031
-Mi-rae.
-Mi-rae.

782
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,241
What should we do?

783
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,450
-Mi-rae.
-Mi-rae.

784
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,701
Gosh.

785
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,122
I'm all right. I'm really okay.

786
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,750
I should take her home. Let me carry her.

787
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,252
No, I'll carry her.

788
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,128
I'm really okay.

789
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,090
-I'll do it. Put her on my back.
-No, I'll carry her.

790
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,050
-Gosh.
-I'm really all right.

791
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,261
Kyung-seok, you should carry her.

792
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,470
Woo-young, help me.

793
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,681
-Oh, okay.
-Mi-rae, I'll help you up.

794
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,308
-I'm okay, though.
-There.

795
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,271
Don't worry.
We'll get her home safely.

796
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,147
Okay.

797
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,109
Are you all right?

798
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,777
Oh, boy.

799
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,280
Yes, I'm fine.

800
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,447
She's not fine.

801
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,449
-I'll get going.
-Get home safely.

802
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,493
-Make sure she gets home safely.
-Bye.

803
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,453
Be careful.

804
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,998
Get home safely. Hey, be careful.

805
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,628
What's wrong? What happened to her?

806
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,798
-She passed out after three shots of soju.
-What?

807
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,510
Hello.

808
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,054
Aren't you her friend who came with her
to the event?

809
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,265
-Yes, I am.
-Where's her bed?

810
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,808
Here, this one.

811
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,395
What happened?

812
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,105
Be careful.

813
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,400
She'll be okay, right?

814
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:16,863
Of course, she'll be fine.
Thank you so much.

815
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,118
-I'll see you around.
-Oh, thank you.

816
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,539
Bye.

817
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,885
-Get home safely.
-I will.

818
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,970
I'm so happy for them.

819
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,057
What a relief.

820
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,523
You could've moved into my place.

821
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,402
You must be uncomfortable

822
01:00:57,403 --> 01:01:00,073
since we've been living separately
for too long.

823
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:04,827
It's not that.

824
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,790
I wanted to live independently.

825
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:12,752
You need some money?

826
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,131
No, it's okay.

827
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,347
Buy a hangover recovery drink
for Mi-rae tomorrow morning.

828
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,351
I don't have any change. Here.

829
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,579
Can I give you a hug?

830
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,544
Yes.

831
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,918
You should come over sometime.

832
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,004
Okay.

833
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,305
Hello.

834
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,391
-I'd like a transit pass, please.
-Sure.

835
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,193
HANGOVER CHASER

836
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,486
I'd like this, too.

837
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,071
Sure.

838
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:09,762
Are you up?

839
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,682
Do you remember anything?

840
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:14,892
About what?

841
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,811
Kyung-seok carried you on his back.

842
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:18,938
What?

843
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,148
Ms. Na came, too.

844
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,654
They met up to reconcile.

845
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:28,906
Why did you have to tag along
and ruin it all?

846
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:30,533
What happened?

847
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,201
I don't know.

848
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,163
I have class, so I have to leave now.

849
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,500
I made hangover soup for you.
Have some.

850
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:49,510
Gosh, I should've stopped
after my second shot.

851
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,613
Hi.

852
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,702
HANGOVER CHASER

853
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,537
I'm fine.

854
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,916
You can't be. Isn't three shots of soju
your drinking limit?

855
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:28,591
Take it.

856
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,578
Is your stomach okay?

857
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,792
Yes, I think I feel better now.

858
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,589
Don't worry.
You didn't make any drunken mistakes.

859
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,593
What are you talking about?
I heard you carried me home.

860
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:13,678
What about it?

861
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,305
I'm sorry for the trouble.

862
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:21,268
Don't ever drink more than three shots
when I'm not around.

863
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,229
What?

864
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:28,192
Don't let any other guy carry you home.

865
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:58,931
Are you her boyfriend?

866
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,016
-Yes.
-No.

867
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,268
Why is he being like this?
He's leading me on.

868
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,895
Oh, I see Mi-rae and Woo-young over there.

869
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,480
You're the prettiest girl.

870
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,024
Don't you want a boyfriend?

871
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,609
-I can make it to the interview.
-They need more workers?

872
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,237
Are you doing a facial mask
for your part-time job?

873
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,822
You and Mi-rae work together?

874
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,907
-Have you cried tears of joy?
-What?

875
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:20,119
I'm not sure if it's enough to cry.
I'm happy we met again.

876
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,788
Do they need another part-timer
by any chance?

877
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,582
I like Kyung-seok.
