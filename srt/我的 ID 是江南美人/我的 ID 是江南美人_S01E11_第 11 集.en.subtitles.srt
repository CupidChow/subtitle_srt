1
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,422
Do you...

2
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,383
have a crush on him too?

3
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,555
No way. Do you?

4
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,518
What's the problem?
Am I not allowed to like him or what?

5
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,607
You won't need my help.

6
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,068
You're bright,

7
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,028
active, and pretty.

8
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,112
You're pretty too.

9
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,281
What?

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,116
You guys going out?

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,035
Why do you think so?

12
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,331
You're popular among guys as well
because you're pretty.

13
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,586
I think...

14
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,256
it's a blessing to be pretty,
don't you think?

15
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,675
People naturally like you.

16
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,012
That must be
why those who aren't blessed

17
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,682
get plastic surgery
to enjoy that kind of benefit.

18
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,104
It eventually harms the ones
who were born pretty.

19
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,648
Harm?

20
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,987
I mean, pretty faces become less rare
because of plastic surgery.

21
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,249
I thought that I was mistaken...

22
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,838
and that I was at fault for judging you
in a bad way.

23
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,215
But I wasn't mistaken.

24
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,929
You've hated me...

25
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,390
from the beginning.

26
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,195
Don't get me wrong.

27
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:39,367
There are just so many pretty girls
these days.That was my point.

28
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,453
I'm sorry if I offended you.

29
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,418
I'm well aware that you had to get
plastic surgery out of despair.

30
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,173
I really wasn't talking about you.

31
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,051
That's a lie.

32
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,388
In any case, what you mean is

33
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,474
that you don't like girls
who got plastic surgery.

34
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,731
That's ridiculous.

35
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,608
She wasn't talking about you?

36
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,987
She can hate me. What bothers me is
how she thinks that I'm dumb.

37
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,616
I told you that girl is weird.

38
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,117
Park Yong-cheol too.

39
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,536
She definitely has it out for you.

40
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,872
Hey, you won't be helping her

41
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,458
so that she can date Kyung-seok, right?

42
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,961
No, I'm not. I told her I won't help her.

43
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,632
What should I do?

44
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,384
Chan-woo found out
that we're going out.

45
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,385
What?

46
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,055
-How did that happen?
-What?

47
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,306
Seeing someone?

48
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,350
Actually...

49
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,314
-Hello.
-Hi, Mi-rae.

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,070
So who's the guy you're seeing?

51
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,780
Hey, why are you so slow-witted?

52
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,948
What's wrong?

53
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,744
Why Kim Chan-woo of all people?

54
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,330
This smell.

55
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,291
I can smell Tae-young's girlfriend
somewhere in this room.

56
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,709
It's not funny.

57
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,003
Tae-hee, is it true?

58
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,465
Were you really doing this with Tae-young?

59
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,261
Come on.
Are you in an improper relationship?

60
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,972
Why hide it?
Everyone will congratulate you guys.

61
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,098
Look at us now.

62
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,683
Is this how you congratulate?

63
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,688
I guess that's Tae-young's type.

64
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,691
Because he's skinny,
he want a girlfriend who's like...

65
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,692
Stop it.

66
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,571
-What did you just say?
-What did I say?

67
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,740
Didn't you hear about the festival?

68
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,660
We won't let it slide
if you mock someone's looks ever again.

69
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,662
I didn't say anything.
What did I say?

70
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,039
-Well, I'm not sure.
-We heard it.

71
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,749
I could hear it from here.

72
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,128
Your hearing is too good.

73
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,048
I'll keep my voice down.
Let's talk quietly.

74
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,259
That scumbag deserves no respect.

75
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,261
What?

76
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,430
-Hey.
-What?

77
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,140
How dare you, to a senior?

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,980
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I am.

79
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,151
Apologize to her.

80
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,157
Hey, come on.

81
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,326
What did you say?

82
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:31,205
You should apologize for offending juniors
instead of being obscure about it.

83
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,849
If I tell people that I like someone,

84
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,811
and if that someone was Kyung-seok...

85
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,022
No.

86
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,566
They'll definitely make fun of me.

87
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,032
You must've been hungry.

88
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,326
I'll give you more next time.

89
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,670
JANG WON-HO

90
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,431
Sua.

91
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,308
I'm sorry...

92
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,895
about the report and your photo.

93
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,355
No, it's okay.

94
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,317
I felt bad about having reacted
so sensitively toward you.

95
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,113
-I'm sorry too.
-You're so nice.

96
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,324
You're nicer for apologizing to me
about something like that.

97
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,867
The weather's nice today.

98
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,369
I brought my camera.

99
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,330
-Do you want me to take a photo of you?
-Sure.

100
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,293
Please call me right away
If you see her.

101
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,586
Okay, sir.

102
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,171
Have a good day.

103
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,930
JUNG YOUNG-MO

104
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,268
You look just like Kyung-seok.

105
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,522
Hey, don't you feel sad
about wearing the exact same outfit?

106
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,942
This is too expensive for me
to feel that way.

107
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,781
And, why is that important?
What matters is that Sua's no longer mad.

108
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,125
Hey, Won-ho.

109
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,086
Yes?

110
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,466
-Where did you get that shirt?
-Where do you think? I bought it.

111
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,810
Is that a fake?

112
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,111
It's the real deal.

113
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,988
It's from the 2018 S/S collection.

114
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,659
I'll send it to you
as soon as you wire me the money.

115
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,328
Okay.

116
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,014
INCOMING CALL
KYUNG-SEOK

117
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,269
Hello?

118
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,729
Did you sell my clothes?

119
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,814
Yes, I needed some money.

120
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,316
But how did you find out?

121
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,860
Money? Is there something going on?

122
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,119
That was quite impressive.

123
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,540
Why didn't you behave that way before?

124
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,711
Thank you earlier.

125
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,047
I know I'm always mean to you.

126
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,466
No, it's because
Chan-woo crossed the line.

127
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,053
I mistreated you a lot, right?

128
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,097
-No.
-Don't lie.

129
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,348
You never did.

130
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,935
-I always criticize and ignore you.
-I can already think of so many things.

131
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,188
Just eat your food.

132
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,453
Ye-na.

133
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,663
Yes?

134
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,375
You know I like you, right?

135
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,469
It would've been nice
if I told you a bit earlier.

136
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,182
I'm joining the army.

137
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,976
What?

138
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,607
-When?
-As soon as we're done with the finals.

139
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,485
Hey.

140
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,572
I wanted to tell you

141
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,201
how I felt before I actually left.

142
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,371
I...

143
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,541
liked you...

144
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,793
a lot.

145
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,925
Hey.

146
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:35,843
What?

147
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,555
Why are you telling me that now?

148
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,225
Why are you reacting this way?

149
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,852
My gosh.

150
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,150
-This is so annoying.
-Hey.

151
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,278
Ye-na, what... What's wrong?

152
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,739
That's what I should ask.
What's wrong with you?

153
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,783
Why is she crying
over a guy like him?

154
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,660
He must be really rich.

155
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,579
Okay, don't cry.

156
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,499
What's wrong?

157
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,584
When people refer to a beautiful couple,

158
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,754
which means "like attracts like"...

159
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,590
Kyung-seok is handsome.

160
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,426
But I'm not pretty.

161
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,222
We don't look good together.

162
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,482
Did you eat?

163
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,317
Yes.

164
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,908
Sua looks much better with Kyung-seok
than me.

165
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,585
Kyung-seok takes this class.
Why isn't he coming?

166
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,749
Kyung-seok, is that you?

167
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,209
Yes.

168
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,254
How could you?

169
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,505
What?

170
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,514
-Pack your things.
-Why? You moved out as well.

171
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,849
I said, pack your things.

172
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:56,525
It'll take some time to do a joint program
with your school and provide internships.

173
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,195
Meanwhile, we suggested to Professor Park

174
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,072
that we could pick a few students
who are interested

175
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,909
and let them take a tour
around our laboratory.

176
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,368
That'd be great.

177
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,662
It's good for students
to experience things.

178
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,500
They won't be able to learn much
in a short period of time,

179
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,960
but it's always better to see things
in person.

180
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,302
-I'm not going to go home.
-Go.

181
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,345
-No.
-I said, go.

182
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,806
No, I'm never going to go home.

183
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,725
-Are you going to live there forever?
-Of course not. Am I dumb?

184
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,227
Then why did you move out?

185
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,523
You're so mean and selfish.

186
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,317
You left home as soon as you found out,
so why can't I?

187
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,070
Do I need to stay home
because I'm younger?

188
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,697
Why didn't you tell me anything?

189
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,157
I hate all of you.

190
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,285
I hate Dad, I hate you,

191
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,746
I hate that woman,

192
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,123
and I also hate myself.

193
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,708
I hate everyone.

194
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,711
What am I supposed to do now?

195
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,971
I'm the only one who didn't know anything.

196
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,974
I said so many mean things to her.

197
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,894
Let's go.

198
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,774
I said, I'm not going to go.
I don't want to see Dad.

199
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,568
I'm not taking you there.

200
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,987
Then where?

201
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,742
She'll probably cry out of happiness
if I tell her that you're coming.

202
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,292
I'm sorry that we can't accept
that many students.

203
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,334
No, it's okay.

204
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,336
Some applied for other activities,

205
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,089
and some are going abroad,
so there won't be a lot.

206
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,966
Ms. Na, wait. Ms. Na.

207
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,263
I guess it's nothing bad.

208
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,473
How do you know that?

209
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,601
No one runs like that if it's bad news.

210
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,519
It's normally the excitement.

211
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,689
-Let's go.
-Okay.

212
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,443
A dinner meeting with Ms. Yoon
of Korea Cosmetics...

213
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,527
Cancel it.

214
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,196
-What about Director Shin...
-Cancel it.

215
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,616
-Then...
-Just cancel everything.

216
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,119
No, I mean, where should I drive you?

217
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,329
To my house.

218
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,331
To your house?

219
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,563
I'll just go.

220
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,732
Why are you so stubborn?

221
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,651
This isn't right. It's too late--

222
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,653
It's not late at all.

223
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,573
We can make things work from now on.

224
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,744
-She might hate me.
-Why would she?

225
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,998
I don't know. She might hate me.

226
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,833
Do you know what I said to her?

227
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,336
-I--
-Why would I hate you?

228
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,825
Thank you for coming.

229
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,979
Excuse me.

230
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,315
Do you know a freshman named Do Kyung-hee?

231
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,654
What's wrong?

232
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,574
Help, there's a pervert here.

233
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,950
-Help.
-What, me?

234
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,247
Stop right there.

235
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,759
Where did he go?

236
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,814
Hello?

237
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,609
Oh, yes.

238
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,446
Thank you so much.

239
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,747
Here.

240
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,299
You can stay here.

241
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,551
Tell me if you need anything.

242
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,805
You must be tired.

243
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,932
Do you want to wash up?

244
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,892
Yes.

245
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,709
Actually, I like Kyung-seok.

246
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,587
Can you help me out?

247
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:05,769
You look dazed.

248
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,064
I'm not.

249
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,157
What are you doing?

250
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,241
WOO-YOUNG

251
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,242
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

252
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,201
Nothing much.

253
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,995
OH HYUN-JUNG

254
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,163
How about we gather up today?

255
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,581
HOW ABOUT WE GATHER UP?

256
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,540
I'm in.

257
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,750
OH HYUN-JUNG

258
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,085
How about Mi-rae and Kyung-seok?

259
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,462
HOW ABOUT MI-RAE AND KYUNG-SEOK?

260
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,475
From its interior design
to every single prop...

261
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,060
GROUP CHAT

262
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,687
...I feel so heartbroken.

263
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,901
Kyung-seok, are you listening?

264
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,695
-No.
-Cold-hearted punk.

265
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,990
Right, you wouldn't know how I feel.

266
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,367
I decorated each and every thing
at the bar,

267
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,996
and I have to say goodbye to it,
but you wouldn't know how that feels.

268
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,749
So why did you call me
instead of someone who'd understand?

269
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,796
Try to feel pity on me for having
no one else but you to have a drink with.

270
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,098
What are you going to do?

271
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,185
I don't know.

272
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,773
Choose one: fried chicken and beer,
movie, a karaoke, or indoor baseball?

273
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,815
Indoor baseball?

274
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,401
Sounds good.
I'll be able to blow off steam.

275
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,738
-How about we do it then?
-Deal.

276
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,032
We'll go near your house right now.

277
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,201
WE'LL GO NEAR YOUR HOUSE RIGHT NOW!

278
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,078
Let's go, Mi-rae.

279
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,586
What are you doing? Get ready.

280
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,848
Even my mom can't go against
my dad's will.

281
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,602
He says he'll get divorced
if she gives me money.

282
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,271
Then work part-time.

283
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,856
Should I work here?

284
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,319
You should move in sooner or later.

285
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,530
Or get some financial help.

286
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,908
You can't earn your tuition
only by working part-time.

287
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,453
If I can't, I should take a break.

288
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,164
It's good to be realistic,

289
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,501
but you should give her a chance
to be your mother.

290
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,010
And be good to Mi-rae.

291
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,804
Why are you bringing her up here?

292
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,266
If it hadn't been for her, you would not
have been able to meet her.

293
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,482
Hold on.

294
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,654
What was that smile just now?

295
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,239
What do you mean?

296
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,658
I'm sure there's something.

297
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,162
You know, I'm quick-witted.

298
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,914
In that sense, let me go to the toilet.

299
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,377
Gosh.

300
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,921
Hello.

301
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,259
Hello.

302
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,889
Indoor baseball?

303
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,817
Let's see. It's Hyun Jung's.

304
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,028
It's Mi-rae's.

305
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,697
Isn't this for elementary school students?

306
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,412
Just hold wherever feels comfortable.

307
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:57,709
Instead of trying to swing it hard, just
try to hit the ball when it approaches.

308
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,503
Stand in position.

309
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,256
Hold the bat.

310
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,300
Then swing.

311
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,137
DO KYUNG-SEOK

312
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,180
You're good.

313
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,773
Finish it up. Let's go out.

314
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,108
Why?

315
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,276
I have somewhere to be.

316
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,073
You want to go home
when your friend is lost in grief?

317
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,074
Yes.

318
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,661
You'll abandon me here and leave?

319
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,954
Finish your drink.

320
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,583
It's Jung-boon.

321
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,298
What are you doing here?

322
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,134
I feel bad.

323
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,345
There are a lot of people who care for me.

324
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,306
Are you consoling him?

325
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,893
I'll leave him to you.
I only have this. Bye.

326
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,771
No, you don't have to leave us alone.
Kyung-seok.

327
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,523
Kyung-seok.

328
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,485
Were you smooching off
of your younger friend?

329
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,948
-Jung-boon.
-Wait a second.

330
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,033
Who's that?

331
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,827
-It's my boyfriend.
-What?

332
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,788
I mean, my male friend.

333
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,248
Oh, okay.

334
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,710
Why? Who are you to get surprised by that?

335
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,628
When did I do that?

336
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,352
Woo-young is very good at this.

337
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,104
I'm no match for him.

338
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,189
Totally.

339
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,941
Hey, isn't it nice to be out?

340
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,569
Isn't it? Aren't you happy?

341
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,530
Alright, it's your turn now.
Go and do a good job.

342
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,656
Okay.

343
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,117
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

344
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,417
What do you think? Aren't I pretty good?

345
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,003
I didn't know you could show off.

346
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,089
Gosh, is this fair?
Shall I only use one arm?

347
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,883
You never know though.

348
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,323
Hello.

349
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,179
Excuse me.
Are you a celebrity by any chance?

350
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,430
No, I'm not.

351
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,766
And you're this handsome?

352
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,518
Oh, my goodness.

353
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,604
Wait. Just a second, please.

354
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,525
I'm the owner of Charbain Beaute, Jeno.

355
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,985
Visit my salon.

356
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,905
If you model for us, I'll give you
a free haircut with 200,000 won.

357
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,490
Here.

358
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,785
Here's the address and my number.

359
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,538
Could I get your number by any chance?

360
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,415
No.

361
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,459
Oh, wait!
I'll pay you 250,000 won, then.

362
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,588
How about 300,000 won?

363
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,048
Hey!

364
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,690
My gosh, Mi-rae has great posture.

365
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,945
This is too fast.

366
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,407
You can do it, Mi-rae.
Go for it! You got this.

367
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,325
Go for it.

368
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,340
What just happened? Did you see that?

369
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,636
What's going on here?
I might win at this rate.

370
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,811
INDOOR BATTING CAGE

371
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,483
-Great. Nicely done.
-What is happening?

372
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,235
I've caught up with you. It's a tie!

373
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,779
She's never done this before?

374
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,198
I told you that she's very athletic.

375
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,253
-My gosh, how can she be so good?
-Oh, my.

376
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,838
Amazing.

377
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,132
My goodness.

378
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,302
-I'm so impressed.
-I won!

379
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,731
Hey, we couldn't get a hold of you.

380
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,235
-How did you know?
-You said you were coming here.

381
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,820
Oh, I'm glad you came.

382
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,448
How about we split up into two teams?
The team that loses has to pay for this.

383
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,533
Sure.

384
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,284
You're good at baseball?

385
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,370
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't good.

386
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,592
Why didn't you answer my call?

387
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,681
I didn't know you called.

388
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,728
Good luck!

389
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,541
He's good.

390
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,556
Gosh, how can he hit two home runs
right off the bat?

391
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,183
He's really good.

392
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,019
Let's play one more time.
Shall we do it together?

393
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:19,943
How much is it?

394
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,361
-It's 56,000 won.
-Okay.

395
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,737
-We'll pay.
-No, it's OK.

396
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,114
I was going to pay.
I asked you to meet up.

397
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,283
But still... Then let's split it.

398
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,160
No, it's really okay.

399
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,913
I'll pay with this.

400
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,166
You're frugal, but you can be generous.

401
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,544
Thank you. We had a great time.

402
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,711
You're welcome.

403
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,633
-Discard the receipt.
-Yes.

404
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,634
-Let's go.
-Thanks.

405
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,094
Goodbye.

406
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,720
-Bye.
-Bye.

407
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,061
Kyung-seok, is there anything
you can't do?

408
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,273
Being so perfect could be impersonal.

409
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,232
Aren't I right?

410
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,234
Yes, that's right.

411
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,156
I'm sure he has at least one shortcoming.

412
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,534
Hey, are you good at soccer too?

413
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,662
He obviously is.
See? he's not answering.

414
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,622
No, not really.

415
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,881
Mi-rae, why are you quiet?
Did all the batting tire you out?

416
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,926
Oh, she's actually quite competitive.

417
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,012
She's probably upset
because she lost.

418
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,348
Is she right?

419
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,189
You played it too seriously.
She was so stoked earlier.

420
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:43,943
Mi-rae.

421
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,987
Are you really upset

422
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,281
because I beat you?

423
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,870
Yes, I was having so much fun.
What is this now?

424
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,415
Mi-rae, Mi-rae...

425
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,046
Gosh, she's just fooling you guys.

426
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,131
You couldn't tell
because it was so real.

427
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,925
Woo-young, I'll be off, then.

428
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,092
I'll see you later.

429
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,594
Mi-rae, wait up.

430
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,600
She must be really upset.

431
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,728
Did you do something to upset her?

432
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,653
You experienced being broke
and getting dumped by a girl.

433
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,614
Everyone goes through that.
That's how you really grow up.

434
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:33,618
You're all grown up now.
You can live on your own now.

435
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,928
You said Kyung-seok isn't your type.

436
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,097
Yes, what about it?

437
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,934
I should wash these.

438
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,103
Why are you doing that
to Kyung-seok?

439
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,230
What did I do?

440
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,942
Like you said, I was just annoyed
because he beat me.

441
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,487
I'm not an idiot.

442
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,325
You have feelings for Kyung-seok,
don't you?

443
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,456
Hey.

444
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,086
Be honest, will you?

445
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,056
You see,

446
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,892
I hate being talked about.

447
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,436
I hate it so much.

448
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,690
Because it's never been about
anything good.

449
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,821
"A plastic surgery monster
has a crush on that handsome guy."

450
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,199
I can't put up with all the gossiping.

451
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,536
I just want to live a quiet life.

452
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,345
Kyung-hee moved into my mom's.

453
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,222
I see.

454
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:20,558
Hey.

455
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:24,979
Why are you angry?

456
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,732
What? I'm not angry.

457
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,984
-Then what's wrong?
-Then what?

458
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:34,781
Was I supposed to get all excited
and say how happy she must be?

459
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,828
Hey, guys.

460
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,421
I did an interview yesterday,
and I passed.

461
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,090
I heard you introduced her.

462
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,886
Look at these two beautiful ladies.

463
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,013
We won't need to decorate the interior.

464
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,016
They're not materials.

465
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,229
What are you saying?

466
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,855
Sua, let's go.

467
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,732
I'll see you later.

468
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:21,202
YOUNGLIM INDUSTRIALS

469
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,916
Did something happen with her?

470
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,042
No.

471
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,088
Did she say something about us?

472
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,215
No.

473
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,635
I guess she did say something.

474
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,890
Why is he so quick-witted?

475
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,980
Can you let me eat with Kyung-seok
in private later?

476
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,675
BALLOT BOX

477
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,343
POLLING BOOTH

478
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,934
Hello. Thank you.

479
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,938
Hello. Hi.

480
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,357
Hello.

481
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,942
Hi.

482
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,030
I didn't tell you this yesterday

483
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,741
because you might get angry
and not be able to sleep.

484
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,868
But Kyung-hee moved into Ms. Na's place.

485
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,704
Why are you telling me that now?

486
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,916
-I would've slept better if you told me.
-Pardon?

487
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,419
It's safer for her to be there.

488
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,176
Yes, you're right. It is safer there.

489
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,389
Did you sleep well?

490
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,558
Come sit down.

491
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,352
Okay.

492
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,485
I haven't cooked in a while.

493
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,862
Did I cook too much stuff?

494
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,406
No.

495
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,161
Thank you for the meal.

496
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,634
It doesn't taste good, does it?

497
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,679
It tastes okay.

498
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,849
You don't have to lie.
It's obvious that I can't cook.

499
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,894
I can't really taste food,

500
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,855
so I rarely cook for myself.

501
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,276
But I tried my best
by searching for recipes online.

502
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,658
It's okay.
You don't need to force feed yourself.

503
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,370
It doesn't taste so bad.

504
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,209
And this tastes better.

505
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,222
What should we eat?

506
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,310
There's a nice pork cutlet place nearby,
and a cold noodles and dumplings place.

507
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,270
Sua, what do you prefer?

508
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,855
I want...

509
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,606
Hey, Hae-sung.

510
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,486
Can you work during lunchtime?
We have more customers than usual.

511
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:43,946
Sure.

512
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,824
I'd like one more volunteer.

513
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,170
I can eat lunch later.

514
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,797
Okay. Thank you. Let's go.

515
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,020
I'm going to order pork cutlet.
You?

516
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,147
Me too.

517
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,941
-Two pork cutlets, please.
-Okay.

518
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,199
I really like the working environment.
The people are nice as well.

519
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,867
Why did you come here?

520
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:34,663
I heard you guys are working together,
so I figured it'd be nice to join.

521
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,125
Why are you so interested in us?

522
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,297
-What do you mean?
-I know you're not that slow-witted.

523
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,508
What?

524
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,676
As for this product,

525
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:51,222
the sink is facing the living room,
not the wall.

526
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,891
So it enables you to talk to your kids

527
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:57,520
or watch TV as you do the dishes.

528
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,979
And on both sides...

529
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,816
I know you didn't really like me at first.

530
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,944
But we resolved our misunderstanding,

531
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,738
so I thought we were slowly becoming
close friends.

532
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,198
You didn't?

533
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:10,825
That's enough.

534
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,912
I want to be good friends with you.

535
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,455
You don't like me.

536
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,002
What do you want?

537
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,297
I don't understand.

538
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,968
Are you pretending again?

539
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,469
Kyung-seok.

540
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,098
Why do you always think of me
so negatively?

541
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,100
Because that's how I perceive you.

542
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,602
That's sad.

543
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,774
I only did that
because I really wanted to be your friend.

544
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,945
But I guess you think I'm pretentious
and a liar.

545
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:54,410
If you're annoyed because it feels
as if I'm clinging onto you,

546
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,579
I get it.

547
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,416
I'll quit the job after today.

548
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,716
Enjoy your meal.

549
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:24,899
Mi-rae.

550
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,152
-What's your relationship with Kyung-seok?
-Pardon?

551
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,613
I mean, you look really close.

552
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,491
We're just friends.

553
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,576
Then is Sua his girlfriend?

554
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,286
No.

555
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,538
Are you dating anyone?

556
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:41,665
No.

557
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,377
Eat up.

558
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:53,385
The seventh local election will soon
come to an end at 6:00 p.m.

559
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,804
-Did you vote?
-Yes.

560
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:59,225
Many young people participate actively
in voting these days.

561
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,518
It's a good thing.

562
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,852
...the current status.

563
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,812
I wonder who'll win for Gangnam-gu.

564
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,065
Let's look into the overall voting rate.

565
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,192
Everyone's so crazy about Gangnam.

566
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,362
Gangnam should always set a good example
for everything.

567
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,906
People call my daughter "Gangnam Beauty."

568
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,909
And that makes me more interested
in Gangnam.

569
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,703
Now, let's move
onto the local voting rates.

570
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,413
She's my daughter.

571
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,165
Let's check out the district
with the highest voting rate.

572
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,835
Daejeon City has a voting rate
of 64 percent. It exceeded 60 percent.

573
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,965
That's the estimated amount of votes.

574
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,760
Now, let's move onto the traffic.

575
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,512
In the morning, it will...

576
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,770
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

577
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,276
Excuse me.

578
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,444
Yes.

579
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,739
I want a Gangnam-style haircut.

580
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,867
What are you talking about?

581
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,744
What kind of style is that?

582
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,372
You're the hairdresser,
so you should know.

583
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,458
But why, all of a sudden?

584
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,502
Has something gotten into you?

585
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,880
Well, to be honest, yes.

586
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:16,844
People call Mi-rae "Gangnam Beauty".

587
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,431
And I kind of want people
to think she takes after me.

588
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,975
She's tall and slim just like you.

589
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,603
Bring her sometime.
Let me see how much she's changed.

590
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,607
Okay, I'll bring her over next time.

591
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,991
It must be tiring to be so good-looking.

592
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,870
It seems like Sua has a thing for you.

593
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,789
But do you prefer girls like Mi-rae
than Sua?

594
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,294
I'd definitely choose Sua over Mi-rae.

595
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,217
But then again,
some people care more about the physique.

596
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:01,263
If a girl had Sua's face
and Mi-rae's body, she'd be perfect.

597
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,236
I didn't eat with Kyung-seok.

598
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,113
What?

599
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,116
He must've felt uncomfortable
to eat with me without you.

600
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,547
By the way,

601
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,467
I'm curious about something.

602
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,555
She seems to have done
all the plastic surgeries.

603
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:44,848
Her boobs are fake too?

604
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,060
You can't really tell
just by looking them.

605
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,358
Hey.

606
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:55,984
Are you crazy?

607
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,114
Have you gone insane?

608
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:07,955
Scumbag.

609
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,915
What's wrong with what I asked?

610
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,835
What's wrong with talking about the truth?

611
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,503
Let me go.

612
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:23,762
Be quiet.

613
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,685
Kyung-seok, don't.

614
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:33,439
And I'm not interested in someone
who looks so cheap.

615
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,193
-Kyung-seok.
-Gosh.

616
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,236
Goodness.

617
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,238
Kyung-seok.

618
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,325
-Kyung-seok.
-K... Kyung-seok.

619
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,035
-You punk.
-Kyung-seok.

620
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,413
-Kyung-seok.
-What's wrong with you?

621
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,665
This punk hit me first.

622
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,667
I got beaten up by him.

623
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,504
If you have hit back at least once,
you're both to blame.

624
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:02,217
You all seem like students,
so talk it out and make up--

625
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,094
I said I wouldn't...

626
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,599
unless he bows his head and apologizes.

627
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,478
Unless he bows and apologizes sincerely,

628
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,229
I'll sue him.

629
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,649
It seems like you've hit him a lot more.

630
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,610
Why don't you apologize
and settle it out?

631
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,242
I'm sorry.

632
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,581
I should've killed him
so that he couldn't even talk.

633
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,377
Has he gone crazy or what?

634
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,921
-Sit down.
-Hey.

635
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,465
Do you want to be an ex-convict?

636
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,054
You jerk.

637
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,432
Shouldn't you be apologizing to me?

638
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:55,020
If you have at least
the slightest sense of guilt, let him go.

639
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,943
-I don't want to.
-What?

640
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,696
I was going to tell you,

641
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,533
but he tried to hit on me too.

642
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,745
Don't worry.
The company will take care of this matter.

643
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,288
Go back to work.

644
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,581
Okay.

645
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,168
I should've fired him sooner.

646
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,134
Yes, I thought the room could use
a bit more decoration.

647
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,012
Tell me if there's a specific design
in mind.

648
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,558
Okay, bye.

649
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:49,408
NA HYE-SUNG APPOINTED
AS THE CEO OF KELLUN

650
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:54,580
-Are you looking for something?
-I'm just looking around.

651
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,833
Take a look around
and tell me if you need me.

652
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,091
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

653
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,219
Doesn't a guy named Do Kyung-seok
work here?

654
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,971
Kyung-seok?

655
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,767
Yes, but he's not here right now.
What's the matter?

656
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,605
I'm his mom. Did he go somewhere?

657
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,607
Oh, hello.

658
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,985
I'm Hyun Sua, his friend in college.

659
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,571
Is that right?

660
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,241
But he's...

661
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,370
Why? Did something happen?

662
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,497
Yes.

663
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,793
He was taken to a police station
because he got into a fight.

664
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:42,836
What?

665
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,088
Why would he?

666
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,132
Whom did he fight with?

667
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,927
With another part-timer here,

668
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:54,598
he got into a fight
because of a girl named Kang Mi-rae.

669
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,766
Mi-rae?

670
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,809
Do you know her?

671
00:48:58,685 --> 00:48:59,686
Yes.

672
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,564
She lives in Kyung-seok's neighborhood.

673
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,318
I see.

674
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,404
How impressive, Mi-rae.

675
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,449
Do you know which police station it is?

676
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,868
Please give me a minute.

677
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,541
Good.

678
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,544
I've hurt you with words,
so I'll apologize the same way.

679
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,756
Mi-rae, I'm sorry, satisfied?

680
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,175
That's not the attitude
of someone apologizing.

681
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,511
This punk hit me, so he should kneel down.

682
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,430
Or let me punch him 10 times.

683
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,475
All right. Do as you want
because I'll go by the law too.

684
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,476
What?

685
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,065
Hello, sir. This is Mi-rae.

686
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,987
I'm still at the police station,
but I have a favor to ask you.

687
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,739
What?

688
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,369
I see.

689
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,247
Okay, thank you.

690
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,252
He said you're fired.

691
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:11,925
The manager says he'll testify
how you sexually harassed me if he has to.

692
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,886
Should I file a lawsuit?

693
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,054
No.

694
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,723
Hold on.

695
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,183
What are you going to do?

696
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,479
Kyung-seok.

697
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,945
Do you hit people?

698
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,741
Ms. Na.

699
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,744
I came from the store.

700
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,457
How could you not even call me
in this kind of situation?

701
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,382
Next is the exit poll in Daejin.

702
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:56,219
66.7 percent for candidate number one,
Do Sang-won.

703
00:50:56,803 --> 00:51:00,057
-Yes!
-23.2 percent for...

704
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,018
Mayor of Daejin, Do Sang-won.

705
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:06,313
Mayor of Daejin, Do Sang-won.

706
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,898
-Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
-Thank you.

707
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,150
Now, take some rest in your house.

708
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,193
All right.

709
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,571
I was worried
your children might cause trouble,

710
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:18,200
-but I'm glad they didn't.
-I didn't raise them like that.

711
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,868
They wouldn't cause trouble.

712
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,244
Sure thing.

713
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,913
-See you.
-Do Sang-won.

714
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:28,919
Mayor of Daejin, Do Sang-won.

715
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,420
Mayor of Daejin...

716
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,299
He did deserve a beating.

717
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:40,597
Still, you shouldn't punish him
in a way which could harm you as well.

718
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,266
Mi-rae must've gotten hurt a lot.

719
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,352
Are you okay?

720
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,062
Yes?

721
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,022
Yes.

722
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,649
You must've been startled.

723
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:02,536
I thought I'd be okay if I thought I was.

724
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,250
I guess I wasn't okay.

725
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,759
Mi-rae.

726
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,762
You haven't done anything wrong today.

727
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,348
People like him have wrong thoughts.

728
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,062
Right.

729
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:36,069
Please excuse me now.

730
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,115
I'm okay.

731
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,413
Don't go alone.

732
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,583
Let's eat and go together.

733
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,294
Right, Mi-rae.

734
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:53,795
Go home together.

735
00:52:58,633 --> 00:52:59,467
Let's go.

736
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,812
Hey, Kyung-hee.

737
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,649
It looks like you'll have to have dinner
alone. I'm sorry.

738
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,444
There's some fried rice in the fridge.

739
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,030
I'm sorry.

740
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,782
WHERE DID DOVELY GO?

741
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,201
WILL SHE FINALLY SHOW HER FACE?

742
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,327
Ta-da.

743
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,828
SHE IS SO CUTE!

744
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,413
SHE HAS IT ALL

745
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,831
DO NOT WEAR THE MASK FROM NOW ON.

746
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,957
Yes, that's right.

747
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,710
Because I don't have my mask today.

748
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,047
And I won't be eating in my room today.

749
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:41,468
I'm outside now and I'll host my show
while enjoying this night view here.

750
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,511
What's for dinner today?

751
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,013
HAVE YOU MOVED?

752
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,181
I'll have fried rice.

753
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,891
IT LOOKS LIKE A DIFFERENT SHOW.

754
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,643
IS THAT A SPECIAL ONE?

755
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,144
This fried rice is special.

756
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,979
My mom made it.

757
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,067
Then I'll dig in now.

758
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,653
I'll take a big spoonful...

759
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,529
IS THERE LOBSTER IN IT?

760
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,490
YOUR MOM NEVER COOKED IT FOR YOU?

761
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,283
WHY WOULD SHE COOK IN A RICH FAMILY?

762
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,077
My first time tasting my mom's fried rice.

763
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,662
MOM'S FRIED RICE IS THE BEST.

764
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,829
I'd rate this...

765
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,206
I WANT TO SEE HER MOM.

766
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,666
FROZEN FRIED RICE IS THE BEST.

767
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,667
100 out of 100.

768
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,335
SHE IS SO LOVELY WHEN SHE EATS.

769
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,881
There's a lot of meat in it.

770
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,467
There are raisins too.

771
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,977
Thank you for the dinner.

772
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,606
Mi-rae, could you wait for us in the car?

773
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,317
I have to talk to him about something.

774
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:03,985
Sure.

775
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,661
You got yourself in trouble,

776
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,956
but I could act as your guardian
for the first time.

777
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,042
It doesn't feel that bad.

778
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,463
From now on, call me if anything happens.

779
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,049
-Okay.
-And...

780
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,843
About your tuition...

781
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,679
Could I take care of it for you?

782
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,016
It's not like I'm a stranger to you.

783
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,142
I'm...

784
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:38,937
your mom after all.

785
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,606
I hope you let me pay it.

786
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,279
Okay.

787
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,573
Really?

788
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,536
I was so anxious,
thinking you'd say no.

789
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,710
-Thanks.
-For what?

790
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,712
I'll...

791
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,090
pay you back.

792
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,310
Thanks for today.

793
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:23,815
But from now on,
don't punch people because of me.

794
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,943
Don't worry.

795
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,073
I'm not mad at you.

796
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,956
I'm just frustrated
that all I can do is punch people.

797
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,333
Those jerks should not gossip about you.

798
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,256
You must still be all shaken up.

799
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,675
You should go in.

800
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,263
Okay, thanks.

801
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,850
You should get going. I'll head in, then.

802
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,440
Mi-rae.

803
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,539
If...

804
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,878
something like that happens to you again,

805
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,175
I'll get involved without punching.

806
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,971
That will be okay, right?

807
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,687
If you keep saying things like that,

808
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,650
I'll get the wrong idea.

809
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,070
About what?

810
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,740
Just like how I'm feeling, you might...

811
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,207
Never mind.

812
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,043
Get going. I'm going to head in.

813
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,098
Do you have...

814
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,771
any feelings for me?

815
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:28,856
What?

816
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,596
Are you free on Wednesday?

817
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,306
Just the two of us.
I have something to tell you.

818
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:04,017
If you think that we can go back
to how we were before,

819
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,686
-I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
-Anything bothering you?

820
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,354
I think I'm just scared.

821
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:12,233
He's way too good for me.
He's too perfect.

822
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,569
Hey, I told you that enough is enough.

823
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,988
Why must you mess everything up?

824
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:18,823
You still don't feel anything?

825
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,200
If you're having a hard time
because of me,

826
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,994
I shouldn't do it.

827
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,288
But I'll wait for you.
