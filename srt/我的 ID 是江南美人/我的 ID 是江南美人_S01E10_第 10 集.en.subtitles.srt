1
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,181
Is your stomach okay?

2
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,394
Yes, I think I feel better now.

3
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,233
Don't worry.
You didn't make any drunken mistakes.

4
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,986
What are you talking about?

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,322
-I heard you carried me home.
-What about it?

6
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,949
I'm sorry for the trouble.

7
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,913
Don't ever drink more than three shots
when I'm not around.

8
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,790
What?

9
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,419
Don't let any other guy carry you home.

10
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:36,721
What does he mean? I shouldn't let
any other guy carry me home?

11
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,648
Aren't you coming?

12
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,026
Oh, yes. I'm coming.

13
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,548
Hello.

14
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,342
-How have you been?
-Good.

15
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,802
Who is he?

16
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,263
BASED ON THE WEBCOMINC
MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY BY KI MAENG-GI

17
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,181
I thought Mi-rae was famous
and followed her.

18
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,641
You even remember my name?

19
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,143
Because you're so pretty.

20
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,478
You probably don't remember my name.

21
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,231
-Your name?
-I'm Kim Se-hoon.

22
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,941
Right, Se-hoon.

23
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,237
Are you on Instagram?
Let's follow each other.

24
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,156
I don't do those things.

25
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,409
Remember my name, too.

26
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:41,786
I'm Do Kyung-seok.

27
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,539
Are you her boyfriend?

28
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,707
-Yes.
-No.

29
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,627
You're her boyfriend?

30
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,545
-No.
-Yes.

31
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,762
This is my stop. Have a good day.

32
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,641
Bye.

33
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,646
Why did you lie to him?

34
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,231
When did I lie?

35
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,067
I am a boy friend, not a girl friend.

36
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,865
It's a good tactic to ward off those
who bug you.

37
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,746
Why is he being like this?
He's leading me on.

38
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,025
Her.

39
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,860
Do you like him?

40
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:58,988
Do you?

41
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,618
Don't let any other guy carry you home.

42
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,339
Hey.

43
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,926
Do you have feelings for me?

44
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,320
Stay focused.

45
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,031
Okay.

46
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,242
This is the last experiment
of the semester.

47
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:48,204
Stay focused until the end
and submit your report today.

48
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,789
-Got it.
-Okay.

49
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,007
What's wrong?

50
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,759
-I don't have last week's report.
-What?

51
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,346
I'm sure you have it with you.
Try looking again.

52
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,723
It's not here.

53
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,558
What should I do?

54
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,019
What's wrong with you today?

55
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,521
All our grades depend on that report.

56
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,690
And you're saying you lost it?

57
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,608
What are we going to do?

58
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,612
Should we make it up?

59
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,198
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,951
My gosh.

61
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,122
Let's look for it again.

62
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,742
A) THE RECRYSTALLIZATION OF ACETANILIDE
1) THE HEATING TIME

63
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,870
Yes, it was 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

64
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,002
Yes, it was two grams. I remember now.

65
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,879
My goodness.

66
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:24,133
He's not only good looking,
but he's a genius as well.

67
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,850
This is all we need?

68
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,310
Yes, sir.

69
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,145
Thanks.

70
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,233
Sua, you should treat him to a meal.

71
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,359
Of course.

72
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,955
-I'll go now.
-I'll go with you.

73
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,252
Bye, Kyung-seok.

74
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,633
I was really startled
because of the report.

75
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,677
I'll treat you to a meal later.

76
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,679
No, it's okay.

77
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,100
I'll just get you something
at the school cafeteria.

78
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,769
At least let me buy you that.

79
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,148
We really picked a great team leader.

80
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,066
Well, that's not really true.

81
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,152
He volunteered
because no one wanted to.

82
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,195
Imagine if you were the leader.

83
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,365
What's wrong with me?
Am I jealous right now?

84
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,658
So relieved.

85
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,290
I was really upset
after you left yesterday.

86
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:42,587
I wanted to help you out because I figured
we have something in common.

87
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,756
Plus, we both are living by ourselves now.

88
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,469
I thought both your parents passed away.

89
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,762
Why bother moving out?

90
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,184
My grandma nags a lot.

91
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,394
Do you feel better?

92
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,147
I know a restaurant
that sells great hangover noodles.

93
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,482
Just a second.

94
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,734
We came to hand in our report.

95
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,236
-Leave it on my desk.
-Okay.

96
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,364
Sorry. They also sell
a lot of other delicious menus as well.

97
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,200
It's on me. Let's go eat there.

98
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,460
Next.

99
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,463
It's really delicious.

100
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,132
I'm glad you like it. Eat up.

101
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,218
Thank you.

102
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,973
How's it going with your candles?

103
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,684
I was planning
on selling fragrant candles,

104
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:43,022
but it's not as easy as I thought,
so I'm going to get another part-time job.

105
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,362
Cheer up.

106
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,366
Thank you.

107
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,370
You should've added your photo.

108
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,706
They consider applicants' looks a lot.

109
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,792
You saw it at the interview.

110
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,835
Looks don't get the work done.

111
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,840
You guys look great together.

112
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,302
The sight of you two together is
too much...

113
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,513
-Be careful.
-Block your own eyes.

114
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,889
Stop joking around.

115
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,517
-Are you guys finally going out?
-No.

116
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,605
Eat up.

117
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,858
Gosh, I'm so jealous. Enjoy your meal.

118
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,991
-You must be bothered by those comments.
-I don't care.

119
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,659
Really?

120
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,079
I'd love to be so strong-minded like you.

121
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,791
Then I wouldn't care about
what others say.

122
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,260
By the way, are you not interested
in dating anyone?

123
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,229
Do you not want a boyfriend?

124
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,526
I'm not really interested.

125
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,236
Why not? You're probably popular.

126
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,489
I'm not popular. There are so many
pretty girls out there.

127
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,535
You're the prettiest in our department.

128
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,540
Stop joking around.

129
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,834
I'm being serious.

130
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,634
Did I just make you feel uncomfortable?

131
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,012
No, that's not it.

132
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,724
But I'm sure you already know.

133
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,398
I did a lot of plastic surgery.

134
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,444
What's wrong with that?

135
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,866
You did it to become pretty
and now you're pretty.

136
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,120
What's weird about that?

137
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,669
Let's eat.

138
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,297
How weird.

139
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,215
What's weird?

140
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,679
You don't seem weak-minded, seeing
that you moved out to live on your own.

141
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,350
Although I don't know why you had to.

142
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,814
There's no special reason.

143
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,660
That's Mi-rae and Woo-young.

144
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,749
Thank you.

145
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,085
You shouldn't have.

146
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,629
Stop thanking me.
I only bought some noodles.

147
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,588
But still...

148
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,091
I want to treat you again.

149
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,008
Pardon?

150
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,927
I need to get to class.

151
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,928
Okay.

152
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:01,929
-See you.
-Yes.

153
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:12,857
Hello?

154
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,900
You applied for a part-time job, right?

155
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,360
Yes.

156
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,238
Yes, I can make it to the interview.

157
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,118
Okay, thank you.

158
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,620
Mi-rae.

159
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,378
Did you eat?

160
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:35,880
Yes.

161
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,298
With whom?

162
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,758
Woo-young.

163
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,052
You guys must be really close.

164
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,139
Yes, we live in the same neighborhood.

165
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,058
Let's go home together.

166
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,690
Kyung-seok and Woo-young live together.

167
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,779
I need to go somewhere.

168
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,905
Where?

169
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,657
-An interview for a part-time job.
-A part-time job?

170
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,952
-Do they need more workers?
-I'm not sure.

171
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,079
Can you ask them for me?

172
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,916
You can ask yourself.
I'll give you the number.

173
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:16,337
I've never done anything like that before.
Do me a favor. After all, we're friends.

174
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,093
I'll be off now.

175
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,762
See you guys later.

176
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,932
Kyung-seok, I wish you
good luck this time.

177
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,734
-You think neighbors should be close?
-What?

178
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,612
You said you're close with Woo-young
because you're neighbors.

179
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:46,492
I just said that because Sua asked me
a question.

180
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,036
Does that mean we're close too?

181
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,454
It's not the same with you.

182
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,206
What?

183
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,123
I mean...

184
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,670
We were already friends
before you moved into my neighborhood.

185
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,215
Then can I go with you?

186
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,133
-Seriously?
-Yes.

187
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,274
Why?

188
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,527
It's so weird.

189
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,321
Why?

190
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,254
Sua.

191
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,257
It's just a snap, but it looks amazing.

192
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,925
Look.

193
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,764
You seemed really startled earlier
because of the report.

194
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,393
I would've been in big trouble
if it weren't for Kyung-seok.

195
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,479
You must've been worried about your grade.

196
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,690
Don't say that.

197
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,861
But I wish you wouldn't take pictures
without asking me like this.

198
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,406
Isn't it a crime to take pictures
without permission?

199
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,622
Sua.

200
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,542
Is this a joke to you?

201
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,586
You can't just bring your friend.

202
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,254
I'm sorry.

203
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,465
Okay

204
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,800
I see. Bye.

205
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,765
What did he say?
Did he tell us not to come?

206
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,600
No, he told us to come for now.

207
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,775
-You haven't done any part-time work?
-No.

208
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,527
You can work only
on holidays and weekends.

209
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,487
That's right.

210
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,284
We'll work hard.

211
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,667
-Fill out the papers.
-Pardon?

212
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,210
Contracts.

213
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,880
You'll get paid by the day.
Write down your bank account carefully.

214
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,093
Thank you.

215
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,013
Get used to the product explanations.

216
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,182
-Okay.
-Look at that guy.

217
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,517
He's too handsome.

218
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,397
The girl's face isn't so realistic either.

219
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,823
-Doesn't it look delicious?
-Yes.

220
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,200
Here.

221
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,128
No one would come at this hour.
They all went home.

222
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,172
I'll just feed myself.

223
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,191
It's delicious!

224
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,911
Look at this lovey-dovey couple!

225
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,003
Since when did you start going out?
Has it been a long time?

226
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:27,880
That's not it.

227
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,174
Is that right?

228
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,259
Then do you want to feed me too?

229
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,765
Hurry up.
You said you aren't dating.

230
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,524
It's delicious. Keep it up.

231
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,075
-What are you reading?
-I got a part-time job.

232
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,035
I have to learn this.

233
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,621
Can you memorize the details
by reading that fast?

234
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,291
I'm good at memorizing.

235
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,296
I'll go to bed first.

236
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,131
Brush your teeth or they'll rot.

237
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,269
Today's menu is delicious tuna sashimi.

238
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,522
Do you see this?

239
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,565
DOVELY TV

240
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,400
DOVELY HAS TURNED ON HER BROADCAST.

241
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,236
IT LOOKS LIKE TUNA SASHIMI.

242
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,240
I'll take a piece...

243
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,909
and dip it into this soy sauce.

244
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,581
I CAN'T WAIT

245
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,333
I FEEL SATISFIED BY WATCHING YOU EAT

246
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,793
IS THAT EXPENSIVE?

247
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,753
IS THAT A LIMITED EDITION BAG?

248
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,839
AWESOME. HOW DID YOU GET THE BAG?

249
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,509
I got it as a gift.

250
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,636
THE TUNA HAS LOST OUR ATTENTION

251
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,888
WHY DO YOU LOOK UPSET
WITH THE EXPENSIVE BAG?

252
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,307
ARE YOU REALLY A HIGH SCHOOLER?

253
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,107
KYUNG-SEOK

254
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,192
Hold on.

255
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,659
-Hello?
-Have you had dinner?

256
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,205
Who are you? Do you know me?

257
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,543
You sound all right. I'm relieved.

258
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,420
Who says you can feel relieved?

259
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,547
Why did you move out?

260
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,972
Let's meet up and talk tomorrow.

261
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,141
Not tomorrow. I have to go
to my part-time job.

262
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,058
Part-time job?

263
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,811
You're working part-time? Where?

264
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,317
At an interior design store? Where is it?

265
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,652
I'll call you again. Don't skip meals.

266
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,489
Brush your teeth or they'll rot.

267
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,749
What is he saying?

268
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,173
Aren't we going anywhere
during the break, my friend?

269
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,091
It's already late to book a place.

270
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,345
I don't think I can go.

271
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,223
I still have my surgery installments
to pay.

272
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,516
I should at least earn some pocket money.

273
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,727
Let's make it cheap and short.

274
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,896
It's a shame to waste our time like this.

275
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,236
ACTIVITIES

276
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,239
Check everything
you want to do from this list.

277
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,951
VIEWS IN HONG KONG

278
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,119
BEST NATURE IN HONG KONG

279
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,664
Oh, I want to do everything.

280
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,042
I'll earn money and go on a trip
during my winter break.

281
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:57,589
By the way, why are you putting on
a facial mask for a part-time job?

282
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,261
Is it a blind date?

283
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,389
What?

284
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,152
-Do you have a blind date?
-No, I'm going to work.

285
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,447
Did you sign a contract?
You have to be careful with that.

286
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,033
I did already.
Mi-rae was good at it.

287
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,162
Are you working with her?

288
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,623
Yes, why?

289
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,920
Well...

290
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,882
I think you have to come home early today.

291
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:45,345
You have to clean the house,
the toilet, and the rooftop.

292
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,222
And laundry, too.

293
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,558
You said the laundry was
once every two days.

294
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,767
Well...

295
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,062
I mean, the blankets.
You have to wash the blankets.

296
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,607
Blanket laundry was in the contract, too?

297
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,652
Of course,
blanket laundry is included in laundry.

298
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,491
-This feels somewhat evil.
-What?

299
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,535
Evil?

300
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,831
You're becoming more rude as days go by.

301
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,464
Oh, hello.

302
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,138
Hi.

303
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,434
You didn't have to bring all these.

304
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:37,230
I felt sorry for having fun without giving
you any housewarming gifts last time.

305
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,859
I can't eat all of that by myself.

306
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,112
Why would you have to eat it all yourself?

307
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,989
You have to share it with Woo-young.

308
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,619
We're paying for our food separately.
That's written in the contract.

309
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,122
You shouldn't do that with food.

310
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,375
Two guys can finish this much easily.

311
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,292
Right.

312
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,002
That's what the contract says.

313
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,222
We'll take care of this matter.

314
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,894
So do I still have to wash the blankets?

315
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,690
I think you can do it later.

316
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,337
This is grapefruit-scented,
and the other is mandarin-scented.

317
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,048
Which one should I wear?

318
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,343
They're both fruit-scented.

319
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,887
Wear that perfume.

320
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,242
Ms. Na.

321
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,000
Hello.

322
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,669
I heard you have a shift today. Get in.

323
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,337
You don't have to give her a ride.

324
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:32,929
Get in.

325
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,813
I'm sorry about the other day.

326
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,191
I drank more than I can handle.

327
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,276
Don't worry about it at all.

328
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,738
Even I have passed out and thrown up
when I got very drunk.

329
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,622
Oh, right.

330
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,125
Everyone gave positive feedback
about the candle you sent.

331
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,044
I forgot to tell you.

332
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,712
Oh, really?

333
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,048
Our lab said
that the scent ratio is amazing.

334
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,218
It'd be good for you
to consult them in person.

335
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,928
I'd be so grateful.

336
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,306
When does your lunch break start?
Shall we have lunch together?

337
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,352
Well, I'm not sure
when our lunch break is yet.

338
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,103
Anything you want to eat?

339
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,730
We're on our way to work.

340
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,024
Yes, I know.

341
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,986
I wouldn't bother you guys at work.
I'll just drop you off and leave.

342
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,488
Okay.

343
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,658
When will you be done?

344
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,622
I just wanted to tell you
to get home safely.

345
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,591
Hello.

346
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,928
Our showroom provides you
with a one-stop shopping experience.

347
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,723
From doors to kitchen units,
you'll find all furniture pieces here.

348
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,227
Please browse around and let me know
if you have any questions.

349
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,728
Good. That was great.

350
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,856
Even when a customer asks you
about things you don't know,

351
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,150
be friendly and keep a smile on your face.

352
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,861
You can just ask me or the team for help.

353
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,989
-Are we all good?
-Yes, sir.

354
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,742
And you two will get the same title
as everyone else here.

355
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,452
You're our interior curators.

356
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,871
Everyone, let's get to work.

357
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,255
Thank you.

358
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,488
What are you doing here?

359
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,616
So you actually got a part-time job.

360
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,422
They want to know more
about Kelun's marketing strategy.

361
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,883
I prepared our answer
with regards to that.

362
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,593
Would you like to take a look?

363
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,265
Reading off this will make me look
less credible.

364
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,226
You guys have been updating me on it,

365
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,020
so I'll just say what I think.

366
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:27,937
Okay.

367
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,398
Here's our menu.

368
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,483
Thank you.

369
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,276
Whenever you're ready.

370
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,115
Then you'll come up with the answer
yourself...

371
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,742
Would he be around 20?

372
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:41,993
Pardon me?

373
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,080
He looks young.
He must be a part-timer, right?

374
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,500
He could be a full-time server.

375
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,169
He doesn't look that young.
Why do you ask?

376
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,047
I was just curious.

377
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,185
Can we finish our meeting
by 4:00 p.m. today?

378
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,978
Yes, that's more than enough time.

379
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,480
Another meeting after?

380
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,565
I have to go somewhere.

381
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,363
So she's your little sister.

382
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,407
I've been wondering who she was.

383
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,327
-Do you two live together?
-No.

384
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,747
-Where are you staying?
-I told you. I live with a senior.

385
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,503
I'm not a senior. I'm a freshman as well.

386
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,964
It's nice to meet you.

387
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,426
Likewise, but I probably won't see you
after this.

388
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,593
Sorry?

389
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,179
I'm going abroad to study
after our dad's election,

390
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,223
to escape from my bad grades.

391
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,435
Don't go if you don't want to.

392
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,603
I'll talk to Dad again.

393
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,152
What do you want to eat?

394
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,075
They don't have lunch combo.

395
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,786
I want pork cutlet
as well as hamburger steak.

396
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,457
Then let's get one each and share.

397
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,210
What about you?

398
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,463
I'll get pork cutlet, too.

399
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,470
YOUNGLIM INDUSTRIES

400
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:23,947
I'll be off, then.

401
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,659
Go in first.
I'm going to see her off.

402
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,162
It's okay. The bus stop is so close.

403
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,372
I'm off.

404
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,373
Kyung-hee.

405
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,958
Bye.

406
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,465
She's very independent.

407
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,259
Shall we?

408
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,879
Kyung-hee.

409
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,191
Pass me the white plates.

410
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:49,991
Why are you smiling?

411
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,786
You're quite sweet as a big brother.

412
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,459
Then you can call me a sweetheart.

413
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,795
-What?
-Kyung-seok.

414
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,964
Spare me a moment.

415
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:05,882
Sure.

416
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,053
What was that about?

417
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,889
I had no idea he could be that cheesy.

418
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,477
Have you been well?

419
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,862
You must be surprised.
I know that this is very sudden.

420
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,368
I'm sorry.

421
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,912
The moment I saw you,

422
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,498
all I could think was
that I had to talk to you.

423
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,416
Why are you back?

424
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,671
What did you come here to say?

425
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,219
I want to say that I'm sorry.

426
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,559
I'm sorry about everything.

427
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,106
I should've taken you guys with me
at all costs back then.

428
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,860
Everything I say will sound like
an excuse, but--

429
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:08,778
"But"?

430
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,071
Ma'am.

431
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,157
Whatever you say now

432
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,451
won't change the fact
that you abandoned us.

433
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,870
Just because of a man.

434
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,667
You had an affair and left your kids
and husband for another man.

435
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,377
That fact won't change.

436
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:27,839
I had an affair?

437
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,051
-What are you...
-That face can't charm men anymore?

438
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,600
What's with that look on your face?

439
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,645
Why are you acting like a victim?

440
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,314
It is worse for me.

441
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,608
Me...

442
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,819
and Kyung-seok.

443
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,239
I pity our lives.

444
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,546
Crying won't solve anything.

445
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,391
Kyung-seok.

446
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,164
Bye.

447
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,042
Mi-rae, are you getting off work?

448
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,126
Yes.

449
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,921
-How's the work?
-It's okay.

450
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:50,963
Do you have time?

451
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,966
No, I'm sorry. My friend's waiting for me.

452
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,554
Let's go.

453
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,473
What did he say?

454
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,518
Mr. Park?

455
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,938
He asked if the job's okay
and said that he'd treat me to a meal.

456
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:07,897
Let's go.

457
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,616
Five days' pay will be enough
to last me a month.

458
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,951
YOUNGLIM DEPOSITED 100,000 WON

459
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,705
-You need to pay rent, right?
-Yes.

460
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,582
-How much is it?
-70,000 won.

461
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,292
-A month?
-Yes.

462
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,921
That's so cheap.

463
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,465
It's not like he's doing charity work.

464
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,593
I do all the housework.

465
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:41,472
I think he's doing it so that
you won't have to pay that much.

466
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,474
What a nice offer.

467
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,977
He's such a nice senior.

468
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,944
Hello?

469
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,280
-Are you done?
-Yes.

470
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,365
Hurry up.
You have a lot of work to do.

471
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,079
Are you hungry?

472
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,666
Then I'll buy some pork belly on the way.

473
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,503
Do you pay for food?

474
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,630
We share whatever we buy.

475
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,302
By the way,

476
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,888
where can I buy pork belly?

477
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,764
What?

478
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,274
Why is he going to buy pork belly
when we already have beef?

479
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,277
-Pork belly, please.
-Okay.

480
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,782
No, not that one.
We'll take the one behind that.

481
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:44,785
Thank you.

482
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,414
Thank you.

483
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,877
Why did you choose this one?

484
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,923
It's not good
when the fat color is yellow.

485
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,508
It needs to be light pink like this one.

486
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,011
Where did you learn that?

487
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,138
This is all basic knowledge.

488
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,849
I have gone grocery shopping with my mom
since I was young.

489
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,812
Some vegetables for wraps?

490
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,730
Yes.

491
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,330
Mi-rae gets drunk
on three glasses of soju.

492
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,124
And he gets drunk on two.

493
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,508
Hey.

494
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,852
Did... Did you take Mi-rae home safely?

495
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,772
Yes, I tucked her into bed.

496
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,651
What?

497
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,376
MORNING DEW, PURE WAVE

498
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,552
-You should come, too.
-Go with you?

499
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,555
I got a job thanks to you,
so I should treat you to a meal.

500
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,349
We need more pork.

501
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,978
Hyun-jung will be waiting for me at home.

502
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,314
Then tell her to come as well.

503
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,402
Why is he being so kind?

504
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,158
Do Sang-won will brighten your lives!

505
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,661
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work.

506
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,496
Thank you for your work.

507
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,790
-Good luck, sir.
-Thanks.

508
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,012
Can we talk?

509
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,599
You're not as well-mannered as before.

510
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,436
You're the one who's ill-mannered
for lying to our children

511
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:21,108
that their mother left home
because she had an affair with a guy.

512
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,860
I have people working for me here.

513
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,863
Will you please excuse us?

514
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,657
This won't help with his election.

515
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,203
Please excuse us.

516
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:33,913
Okay, sir.

517
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,388
You're pretty good now.
Did you practice?

518
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,681
No.

519
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,850
What's so hard about this?

520
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,353
He picked it up quickly
because I taught him.

521
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,188
He just doesn't know a lot.

522
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,815
I'll do it now.

523
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,819
I'm not dumb. I know...

524
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:10,408
you made up stories about me
to give yourself an advantage.

525
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,244
I held things in...

526
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,288
because I felt sorry for the kids,
not for you.

527
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,749
But this is way out of line.

528
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,128
I don't care what others think about me.

529
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,797
I can't stand my kids getting
the wrong idea.

530
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,342
The wrong idea?

531
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,262
What exactly is wrong?

532
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,181
Seriously?

533
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,810
What's the point of correcting the story?
Do you think anything will change?

534
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,981
This is a fact to them.

535
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,400
For whatever reason,
their mom abandoned them.

536
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:48,362
And their dad protected them until now.

537
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,322
That will never change.

538
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,038
You're way too brazen.

539
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:05,212
Do you want me to leave it to the public
to judge what you did to me

540
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,298
by stating the facts?

541
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,179
Are you threatening me?

542
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,764
You feel that way
because you have something to hide.

543
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,100
What do you say?

544
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,479
I'd wreck your entire career
if I could have things my way.

545
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,981
I'm giving you a chance.

546
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,692
Tell our kids...

547
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,694
the truth.

548
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,541
-It's so delicious.
-I know.

549
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,752
How can pork belly taste so good?

550
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,462
It's good, right? Eat up.

551
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,838
Why are you being proud?

552
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,340
I'm grilling it, as you see.

553
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,220
I'm sure it's good-quality meat,

554
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,014
but it tastes even better
because you're grilling it for us.

555
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,766
Yes, you grill meat so well.

556
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,233
Here.

557
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,984
Have a glass of soju.

558
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,403
Mi-rae probably won't drink.

559
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,657
Me neither. I prefer cola when I eat meat.

560
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,077
-You're going to drink, right?
-I don't feel like it.

561
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,662
Why?

562
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,623
Is it because you collapsed
after two shots?

563
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,419
What... What are you talking about?

564
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,671
Me? You?

565
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,425
I... I only fell asleep
because it was time to sleep.

566
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,845
You must have low stamina.

567
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,223
Did you just question my stamina?

568
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,434
My nickname is Yeon Stamina.

569
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,478
-You mean Weak Stamina?
-Is that a joke?

570
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,147
That was really lame.

571
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,148
It wasn't a joke.

572
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,234
I saw you collapse after two shots.

573
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,365
Kyung-seok.

574
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,535
One's ability to drink has nothing to do
with stamina.

575
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:04,123
There are guys who can drink even though
they're really skinny and weak like you.

576
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,374
What did you just say?

577
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,631
What's going on?

578
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,803
Judging by the conversation,

579
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,972
we should hold a stamina competition.

580
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,642
-What?
-You guys should arm wrestle like a man.

581
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,230
Gosh, come on. His arm will break.

582
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,274
You must be scared.

583
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,822
Gosh, stop running your mouth.

584
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,532
Arm wrestling, it is.

585
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,828
Both are right-handed?

586
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,121
-Yes.
-Yes.

587
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,040
Okay, then that's a fair fight.

588
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,417
I think Woo-young will win.
What about you?

589
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,044
Well...

590
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,843
I'm not sure.

591
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,767
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

592
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,770
No important schedule tomorrow?

593
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,356
You'll be in pain for a while.

594
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,150
Kyung-hee, your father is home.

595
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,206
One of them might break his arm.

596
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,041
This is fun.
Should we do it, too?

597
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,461
He is winning.

598
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,923
Gosh, it's so nerve-racking!

599
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,758
-A little more.
-Go for it.

600
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:20,676
Almost there.

601
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,189
I told you Woo-young would win.

602
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,027
You're stronger than I thought, though.

603
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,658
Don't be so down.
You can beat others later.

604
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,705
Right, Kyung-seok. You did well.

605
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,876
Why would you depress him even more?

606
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,512
Anyway, she was the one
who left you behind.

607
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,475
Still, I wouldn't have had to resent her
that much.

608
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,020
I thought...

609
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,523
she was such a horrible person.

610
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,402
Why did you make me keep that prejudice?

611
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,574
Who are you to turn my mom
into that kind of a person?

612
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,202
Get out.

613
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,746
Get out!

614
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,960
Let's talk later, once you calm down.

615
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,649
We're leaving. Bye.

616
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,359
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

617
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,320
Thank you for the meal. Bye.

618
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,372
Go home safely.

619
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,249
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

620
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,333
Come again.

621
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,424
I can do it today if you want.

622
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,801
It's okay.

623
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,683
Is your arm okay?
If it hurts, go see a doctor.

624
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,280
Here.

625
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,703
Kyung-seok was in a bad mood.

626
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:56,081
I guess arm-wrestling is a big deal
in the world of men.

627
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,917
If it's in front of someone he likes.

628
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,881
As I see it, he looked like
he had feelings for you.

629
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,886
It's just that he's finally got a friend
after a long time.

630
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:14,099
Still, what will you do
if he does like you?

631
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,354
No one would dare reject
someone so handsome like him.

632
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,446
Someone so handsome like him isn't
my type of man.

633
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,283
My ideal type of man...

634
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:37,247
is someone with an average appearance
who is okay with my plastic surgeries.

635
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:41,793
Someone who isn't so tall, so rich,

636
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,921
or so popular.

637
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,675
That's pretty picky.

638
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,303
Right?

639
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,680
What about you?

640
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,561
Someone who looks neat?

641
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,356
For example?

642
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,233
Well...

643
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,111
Someone like Woo-young.

644
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:12,908
You're right.

645
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,204
Woo-young fits that criterion.

646
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:23,126
Don't you think your standard is
a bit too high?

647
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,753
I know.

648
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,215
This must be why neither of us can
date anyone. Don't you think so?

649
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,509
Tell me about it.

650
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,192
Hello?

651
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,319
Hey, this is Sua.

652
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,779
What's up?

653
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,199
I'm calling just because I'm bored.

654
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,623
Have you decided to work part-time
with Kyung-seok?

655
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,459
Yes.

656
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,714
I have something to tell you.

657
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,924
Spare me some time to talk on Monday.

658
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,010
See you at school.

659
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:24,813
Who was it?

660
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,733
-Hyun Sua.
-That weird girl?

661
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,776
I think she's really weird.

662
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,488
I just can't believe she invited
Yong-cheol over without knowing.

663
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,622
Sir, this is bad!

664
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,504
I think Kyung-hee has run away from home.

665
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,141
Did you have a good night?

666
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,686
Your schedule today is busier
than any other days.

667
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,397
Kyung-hee ran away from home.

668
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,398
What?

669
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,069
Look for her without letting others know.

670
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,487
Yes, sir.

671
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,675
He's so handsome again.

672
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,472
This isn't an ordinary sight of someone
going to work.

673
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,945
Why are you standing there?

674
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,577
Oh, I'm coming.

675
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:15,048
You seemed to be in a bad mood yesterday.

676
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,508
Are you feeling better now?

677
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,387
The arm wrestling.

678
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,806
I went easy on him.

679
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:27,102
He gave me a good deal on rent,
so I should do at least do that much.

680
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,440
I see. Okay.

681
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,404
Just a second.

682
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,408
Hi, Mom.

683
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,993
Do you have another shift today?

684
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,413
We're coming to drop off some food.

685
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,165
Working again today?

686
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,126
She probably doesn't make much in a day.

687
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,460
100,000 won a day.

688
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,755
All right, then. Take it easy.

689
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,844
-Shall we visit her at work?
-Gosh.

690
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,263
Do you know where it is?

691
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,056
I sure do.

692
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,816
Feel free to browse around.

693
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,527
Mi-rae.

694
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,531
Mom, what are you doing here?

695
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:22,908
What do you think?

696
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,327
We wanted to visit you at work.

697
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,747
Act like a customer.
You're making her uncomfortable.

698
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,249
Hello.

699
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,345
Oh, Mom. He's my friend from school.

700
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,723
I'm Do Kyung-seok.

701
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:49,517
Hello.

702
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,022
What's your relationship with Mi-rae?

703
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,485
She just said they're friends.

704
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,488
Yes, she's my closest friend
in our department.

705
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,577
Excuse me.

706
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:10,997
Yes, ma'am.

707
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,340
Does this chair come in different colors?

708
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,932
Shouldn't a guy like him become an actor?

709
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,394
How can someone be that handsome?

710
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,312
That is just not fair.

711
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:35,981
All right.

712
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,111
-I'll call you later.
-All right, go back inside.

713
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,158
See? Don't you think
the surgery was a good idea?

714
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,413
She can be friends with a guy like that
now that she's pretty.

715
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,541
Isn't that girl who just walked by
a Gangnam beauty?

716
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,127
Totally. She's a typical Gangnam beauty.

717
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,646
Not even just a beauty.
They called her a Gangnam beauty.

718
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:20,775
Everyone's obsessed with Gangnam.
They associate everything nice with it.

719
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,819
-Let's go to a department store.
-What?

720
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,113
Actually, should I go to a hair salon?

721
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,742
I must look good enough
to call myself Mi-rae's mom.

722
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,452
Like those ladies in Gangnam.

723
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,166
I'm due for a haircut, too.

724
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,461
Mi-rae.

725
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,590
Good work today.

726
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,467
-I guess you work out a lot.
-Sorry?

727
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,010
You look very fit.

728
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,731
Did he ask you out for a meal again?

729
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,942
No, he asked me
if I find anything stressful.

730
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,361
Let's go.

731
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,038
Hello?

732
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,002
Did something happen?

733
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,972
You must've resented me to the point
that you can't even talk about it.

734
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,934
Kyung-hee is right.

735
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,187
Regardless of what I say now,

736
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:40,897
nothing will change.

737
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,067
No matter how much I apologize,

738
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,904
I can't go back and hold you two
in my arms.

739
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:53,368
I can't turn back the hands of time
and change what happened.

740
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:55,703
But...

741
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,542
I want you to know that I didn't leave you
for another man.

742
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,753
That is really not true.

743
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,592
I'm sorry.

744
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,179
It must've been much harder for you two.

745
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,516
In all those years...

746
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,477
It must've been so tough.

747
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,610
Yes, it was hard.

748
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,575
And I did resent you a little.

749
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,166
But you see,

750
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,004
I don't want any of us
to be in pain anymore.

751
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,222
Mom.

752
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,339
Thanks.

753
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:32,967
Thanks so much.

754
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,017
And I'm sorry.

755
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,646
I must look shameless now.

756
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,692
I'm sorry
that I can't hide how happy I am.

757
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,887
Did something happen to Ms. Na?

758
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,473
No, she's fine.

759
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,561
I see. I'm glad she's fine.

760
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,692
By the way,

761
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,570
-do people cry out of joy?
-What?

762
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,030
Have you ever cried tears of joy?

763
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,453
Yes, when I found out
that I got into Hankook University.

764
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,667
Why do you ask?
It's never happened to you?

765
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,085
I'm not sure.

766
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,256
I guess you've never been that happy.

767
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:54,757
Maybe not.

768
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,552
Shall we go?

769
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,232
I'm not sure if it's enough
to make me cry, but...

770
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,150
What?

771
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,486
I'm happy that we met again like this.

772
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,700
Do you really have feelings for me?

773
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,412
If you keep doing this,
I'll totally fall for you.

774
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,207
Hyun-jung must be waiting for me.

775
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,001
Let's hurry.

776
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:46,809
I'm at school now. Where are you?

777
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,039
How's your part-time job?

778
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,542
It's been pretty good.

779
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,838
Will Kyung-seok keep working there?

780
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,007
I think so.

781
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,638
Do they need another part-timer
by any chance?

782
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:24,555
What?

783
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:27,684
I think it'll be fun
to work with you and Kyung-seok.

784
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:35,775
What's wrong?
Will that make you uncomfortable?

785
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,862
No, it's not that.

786
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:42,990
I'll look into it for you.

787
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,329
To tell you the truth,

788
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,833
I like Kyung-seok.

789
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,590
Can you help me?

790
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,219
Well...

791
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,931
I don't think I can help you with that.

792
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,266
Why not?

793
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,936
I'm asking you
because you're his closest friend.

794
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,398
Do you...

795
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,234
have a crush on him, too?

796
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,156
No way. Do you?

797
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,783
What's the problem?

798
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,453
Am I not allowed to like him or what?

799
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,499
You won't need my help.

800
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,962
You're bright, active, and pretty--

801
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,088
You're pretty, too.

802
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,007
What?

803
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,050
Are you guys going out?

804
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,969
Why do you think so?

805
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:47,597
You're popular among guys as well

806
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,766
because you're pretty.

807
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,771
I think...

808
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,608
it's a blessing to be pretty,
don't you think?

809
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,321
People naturally like you.

810
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,283
That must be why those who aren't blessed

811
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:10,745
get plastic surgeries
to enjoy that kind of benefit,

812
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,541
harming the ones who were born pretty.

813
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,960
Harm?

814
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,630
I mean,

815
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:24,675
pretty faces become less rare
because of plastic surgeries.

816
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,020
I thought I was mistaken...

817
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:41,359
and that I was at fault
for judging you in a bad way.

818
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,986
But I wasn't mistaken.

819
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,784
You've hated me...

820
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,036
from the beginning.
