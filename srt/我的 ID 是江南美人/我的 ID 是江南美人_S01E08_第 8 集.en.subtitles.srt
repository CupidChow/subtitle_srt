1
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,799
This doesn't work.

2
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,968
Looks like your dad blocked it.

3
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,057
To be honest,

4
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,976
I can pay you for all the help
I've gotten from you.

5
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,811
But I can't hire you.

6
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:06,316
I really can't afford it.

7
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,526
Why did you have to pack up
and leave the house?

8
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,029
BASED ON THE WEBCOMIC
MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY BY KI MAENG-GI

9
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,572
I don't even know anymore.

10
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,241
Can I go to a housewarming party
empty-handed?

11
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,663
Give me one of those
instead of payment.

12
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,002
Whose housewarming party?

13
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,213
A senior in my department.

14
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,639
It's not brand new,
but it was bought recently.

15
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,192
-What? Are you lending it to me?
-No.

16
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,653
It's a gift.

17
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,874
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

18
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,877
We'll do it. You should have some too.

19
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,171
I'll do it.
Don't worry about me and eat up.

20
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,048
How manly.

21
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,800
Thank you for the food.

22
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,641
-I'll do it.
-Don't worry. It's okay.

23
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,642
Give me that.

24
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,021
Look at this.

25
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,232
He even cut the meat
into bite-sized pieces.

26
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:30,900
Yes.

27
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,210
Are you making noodles?

28
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:55,967
I'll just do it.

29
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,095
You should eat. Eat up.

30
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,606
I'll hold on to the TV for now.
Take it back whenever you need it.

31
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,773
It's too much.

32
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,192
Do you not watch TV?

33
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,736
I can watch shows on my phone
to save the fee.

34
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,238
Me neither.
But she wants to have one.

35
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,656
What?

36
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,409
Mi-rae is so thrifty, it's annoying.

37
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,994
When we buy daily necessities,

38
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,705
she has to buy them online
at the cheapest prices.

39
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,832
Me too. I only buy things on hot deals.

40
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,792
Me too. A flash sale every morning.

41
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,628
The weekly special sale is cheaper.

42
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,214
Well, bulk deals are way cheaper.

43
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,508
-A bundle of bottled waters is 1,500 won.
-Are you serious?

44
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,388
Then let's place orders together
when we don't have much to buy.

45
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,349
Great! Then shipping will be free.

46
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,394
You two are so excited.

47
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,148
You'll get 50 percent off for a movie
on the last Wednesday of each month.

48
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,109
You're so impressive.

49
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,322
No. I'm broke, so I have to be frugal.

50
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,701
I went for buy-1-get-1-free deals
at a convenience store.

51
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,456
When you buy one,
you get another one for free.

52
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,007
What a downer.

53
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,847
Isn't that a guitar?

54
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,270
Can you play the guitar?

55
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,729
A little. It's my hobby.

56
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,773
-Show us.
-Yes, please.

57
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,733
I'm not good enough.

58
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,278
-Show us.
-Show us.

59
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,906
-Show us.
-Show us.

60
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,866
I'll show you later.

61
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,662
Please.

62
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,678
Leave it. I'll do it later.

63
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,513
I can finish this quickly.

64
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,189
I'll do it.

65
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,786
-Shall we take the garbage out?
-Yes.

66
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,965
Kyung-seok is very different from
what I thought he'd be like.

67
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,344
-He gets along with people well.
-Did he used to be prickly?

68
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,764
I wouldn't say he was "prickly" per se.
How should I put it?

69
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,933
Shall I say he was unapproachable?

70
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,520
I can't believe a guy like that
remembered Mi-rae.

71
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,604
I was so surprised.

72
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,616
I get that he hates his mom,
but she's hospitalized.

73
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,536
He could visit her at least once.

74
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,788
Why did he come here instead?

75
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,756
You still haven't opened that?

76
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,318
I'll do it.

77
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,325
Let's meet up often
since we're neighbors now.

78
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,120
How about a movie
on the last Wednesday of every month?

79
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,456
-I'd love that.
-Me too.

80
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,087
Mi-rae. We need to watch a movie as well.

81
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,803
It's our assignment
for Studies on Pop Culture.

82
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,224
Oh, right.

83
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,392
Let's do it together.

84
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,522
It's just an assignment,
so it'd be weird to turn him down.

85
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,733
Sure.

86
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,822
You need to write a report on it,
don't you?

87
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,032
Make it long.

88
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,659
The professor would give long reports
good grades.

89
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,912
Thank you.

90
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,246
I knew that.

91
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,249
I already heard.

92
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,848
Does he want to watch the movie
with just me or with other friends?

93
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,319
See you.

94
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,241
-Let's meet up after school tomorrow.
-Okay, sure.

95
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,118
-My class finishes at 4:00 p.m.
-My last class is at--

96
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,453
Aren't you done by 5:00 p.m.?

97
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,580
Yes, my class finishes at 5:00 p.m.

98
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,208
Then I'll wait.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,876
Okay.

100
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,379
What?
Is it going to be just the two of us?

101
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,633
-Where do you guys live?
-We live up there.

102
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,638
See you.

103
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,722
Bye.

104
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,475
Bye.

105
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,162
They live really nearby.

106
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,382
I'm so happy for you, Mi-rae.

107
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,634
Your first time watching a movie
with a guy.

108
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,886
On top of that, with a handsome guy.

109
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,097
We're just doing our assignment.

110
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,724
Do you think...

111
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,852
Kyung-seok likes you?

112
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,479
Not a chance!

113
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,316
What do you think about him?
Are you not interested?

114
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,276
Fine, I'm interested in him. Okay?

115
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,445
Today is our first day of dating.
So what?

116
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,365
My gosh, you touched your feet
with those hands. Stop it.

117
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,161
-My gosh.
-Move.

118
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,038
Hey, hurry up and wash up.

119
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,373
Stop touching me with your feet. Stop it.

120
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,291
Go and wash up.

121
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,169
I'll wash first.

122
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,227
Let's meet at Sinchon Cinetown
at 6:00 p.m.

123
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:48,981
What?

124
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,817
This really feels like a date.

125
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,835
I think my business is failing.

126
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,673
Do you want to skip classes tomorrow
and go to the beach?

127
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,592
I have plans to watch a movie.

128
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,678
A movie? With who?

129
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,888
I need to do my assignment for my class.

130
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,349
You must have money for tickets.

131
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,396
-No, I don't.
-What?

132
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,815
I don't have money. Lend me some.

133
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,068
My gosh, how did you end up penniless?

134
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,279
Here.

135
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,867
Lend me 50,000 won.

136
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,536
What are you talking about?

137
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,579
I need money for popcorn and dinner.

138
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,081
Popcorn, my foot.

139
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,708
It's a date, isn't it?

140
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,086
-It's just an assignment.
-Sure, it is.

141
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,508
Hey, stop it.

142
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,479
FIRST MOVIE WATCHING
WITH A GUY

143
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:24,285
IT'S A DATE

144
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,289
It's not a date.

145
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,915
It's just an assignment.

146
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,758
IT'S A DATE

147
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,426
Just an assignment.

148
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,678
Let's see how this looks.

149
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,650
Hey, I...

150
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,069
I need to go to the bookstore.

151
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,071
I forgot to buy some books.

152
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,323
Should I go with you?

153
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,366
No, it's okay.

154
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,411
You... You need to get to class.

155
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,370
Go first.

156
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,706
Okay, I'll see you later.

157
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,749
Okay.

158
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,334
Oh, I almost forgot.

159
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,129
Will you be late?
Watching a movie with Kyung-seok.

160
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,051
I'm going to go home
as soon as the movie ends.

161
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,554
What? Were you also planning to do
some other stuff?

162
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,474
Gosh, just go.

163
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,189
Mi-rae, you can come home late.

164
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,400
Just go.
We're only going to watch a movie.

165
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,332
Anything you need?

166
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,168
I'm looking for pink lipstick.

167
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,128
The lipsticks are placed over here.

168
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,506
You know, there are many different kinds.

169
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,550
There's salmon pink, coral pink,

170
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,677
rose pink, magenta pink
and cherry pink.

171
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,179
Coral pink comes with both pearls
and no pearls.

172
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,098
I see.

173
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,100
Gosh, you look like a peach.

174
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,644
-Pardon?
-Don't you know your fruit?

175
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:17,189
Joy from Red Velvet looks like an apple,
and Sulli looks like a peach.

176
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,400
-You look like a peach.
-Really?

177
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,486
You must not have a lot of experience
with makeup.

178
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,823
You have a warm undertone
but your makeup is for cool undertones.

179
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,200
I see.

180
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,162
Just wait here.
I'll fix your makeup for you.

181
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,999
Okay, thank you.

182
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,261
Girls start doing makeup
when they enter middle school,

183
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,681
and that's when
they start rolling their bangs.

184
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,434
But I had never done any of that.

185
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,437
What's the brand?

186
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,148
Look at the case. It's so pretty.

187
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,756
I was scared
that others would make fun of my looks

188
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,258
even after I wore makeup
and rolled my hair.

189
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,931
Gosh, you look so pretty!

190
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,226
Let's finish up
by putting some lip gloss on you.

191
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,939
Gosh, you look so pretty and cute.
Have a look in the mirror.

192
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,276
Look in the mirror and smile.

193
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,531
How pretty. You really look like a peach.

194
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,700
You're so pretty.

195
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,163
The cotton pads are 10,000 won.

196
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,040
The cotton pads are 10,000 won?

197
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,416
They're quite pricey.

198
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,336
But if you buy over a certain amount,

199
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,713
you'll be getting a travel kit for free.

200
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,050
This actually costs over 30,000 won

201
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,261
so you'll be saving 15,000 won
if you buy all these.

202
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,568
Why did I buy this?

203
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,824
How many candles do I need to sell?

204
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,745
-Hey.
-Yes?

205
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,331
Can you not tell anyone
about what you saw?

206
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,916
What did I see?

207
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,127
I mean, the day of the after-party.

208
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,923
Tae-young and I are
getting to know each other.

209
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,551
So please keep it a secret for now.

210
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,593
What?

211
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,514
-The fact that I'm dating Tae-young.
-You're dating Tae-young?

212
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,975
Be quiet.

213
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,436
Really? Are you serious?

214
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,273
You... Do you not remember?

215
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,608
I cannot believe this.

216
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,237
Hey, it's a secret. Don't tell anyone.

217
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,489
How did that happen?

218
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,086
I'm not drunk at all.

219
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,173
Okay. So what is this about?

220
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,552
I've never done this in my entire life.
Hear me out and don't laugh at me.

221
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,972
Don't laugh.

222
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,103
I like you.

223
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,318
-I told you not to laugh at me.
-I didn't.

224
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,445
Yes, you did. You laughed.

225
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,448
-I didn't mean it like that.
-My gosh.

226
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,909
That's not it.

227
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,329
You fool.

228
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,127
What are you doing?

229
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,841
Hey, I can't see.

230
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:14,843
Ye-na.

231
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,345
Well...

232
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,144
-You can't tell anyone, okay?
-I got it.

233
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,489
-Hello.
-Hi.

234
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,120
You got home safely that night, right?

235
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,414
Sorry? Yes.

236
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,874
You got home safely too?

237
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,962
I was busy taking care of the drunk ones.
I didn't get to see you off.

238
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,381
Being the student president is hard,
isn't it?

239
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,925
It's not that hard.

240
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,513
If there's anything I can help you with,
please tell me anytime.

241
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,224
Okay.

242
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,853
Call me when you want
to grab a drink, too.

243
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,398
What?

244
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,443
I'm a huge fan of yours.

245
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,571
Okay.

246
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,073
I see.

247
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,710
Is she sick or something?

248
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,004
No, she's just hungover.

249
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,174
She drank with her old friends
over the weekend.

250
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,720
I'm about to die.
They'd better not come visit me again.

251
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,263
Did many friends come?

252
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,974
Hey, she said six guy friends
came to visit her.

253
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,354
You have a lot of guy friends.

254
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,066
I only have guy friends,
but I don't have a boyfriend.

255
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,860
Is there anyone you like?

256
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,030
I like all of them
but I don't want to date them.

257
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,824
If I want to date them,
I can't stay friends with them.

258
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,706
Help me up, please?

259
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,547
By the way, you look nice today.

260
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,424
What do you mean?

261
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,801
Why didn't you come to the after-party?

262
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,011
You said you'd come.

263
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,597
Something came up that night.

264
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,682
I understand then.

265
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,560
Let's go.

266
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,108
MAKING 500 MILLION WON WITH 50,000 WON

267
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,371
Are you already preparing for the finals?

268
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,251
No, I just needed to read up on something.

269
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,547
You left the after-party early
without saying bye.

270
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,091
Must I say goodbye?

271
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,926
I had to do something.

272
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,848
KANG MI-RAE

273
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,062
Like what?

274
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,273
Something I had to do.

275
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,238
I thought you and I had become friends.

276
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,704
Kyung-seok, do you want to go watch
a movie with me?

277
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,000
Let's do the assignment together.

278
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,752
I'm doing it with someone else.

279
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,839
-Who is it?
-Kang Mi-rae.

280
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,052
I see.

281
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,230
Right now, I'm on my way
to meet a guy friend.

282
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:01,838
Mi-rae.

283
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,675
What are you doing there?

284
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,013
I didn't see you there.

285
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,810
Which movie?

286
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,146
-I bought the tickets.
-You did?

287
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,273
Good job, buddy.

288
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,944
How much do I owe you?

289
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,113
It's fine.

290
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,249
How can I help you?

291
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,794
-One original combo, please.
-That'll be 8,500 won.

292
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,927
-Why are you paying for everything?
-It's fine.

293
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,720
It's not fine.

294
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:09,156
Here's 13,250 won.
I'll give you 250 won later.

295
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,491
I said, it's fine.

296
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,410
Quit saying that.

297
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,538
Take it. Friends usually go Dutch.

298
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,221
Too early to go in yet?

299
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,015
We have some time left.

300
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,524
Oh, right. Don't we have to attach
the movie ticket to our report?

301
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,609
Do we have to?

302
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,527
Probably?

303
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,284
-Should I split it in half?
-You'll split it?

304
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,252
Then how about one of us submits
a photo of it?

305
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,422
I'll take a photo, then.

306
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,017
Mi-rae.

307
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,795
Let's get a good mark.

308
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,588
We can do it.

309
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,566
Oh, Sua.

310
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,444
-What are you doing here?
-I came to drop off the pickles I made.

311
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,113
I can take care of myself.

312
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,249
Gosh, don't walk so fast.

313
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,728
The apartment in Dogok-dong...

314
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,230
Was it all a lie?

315
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,280
You can talk like a womanizer.

316
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,574
You were the one who cast a spell on me.

317
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,081
However, you...

318
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,628
What is the message the director wants
to impart through the movie?

319
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,673
Which elements excite the viewers
and can make this movie a hit?

320
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,135
I should pick the most memorable scene.

321
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,555
Which scene would I want to watch again...

322
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,393
No, it's not like you think.

323
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,604
Then why were you hugging each other?

324
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,983
Is it one of those casual relationships?

325
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,319
I'm saying it's not what you think.

326
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,661
Why do I...

327
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,955
keep wanting to look at him?

328
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,138
It must be an instinct.

329
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,265
A basic instinct.

330
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,444
Our eyes are always
drawn to pretty things.

331
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,364
It's not that we have an affection.

332
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,242
We just can't help but stare at them.

333
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,414
Instinctually, that is.

334
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,198
Have some popcorn.

335
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,495
Oh, right.

336
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,209
In most romantic movies, this is when...

337
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,955
This is usually how the plot unfolds.

338
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,250
Please have some.

339
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:56,878
I will.

340
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,842
What a fuss.

341
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:07,263
He was always such a snob, and now...

342
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,519
This trick allows you
to prevent such an incident.

343
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,491
What are you doing?

344
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,745
What? You told me to eat popcorn.

345
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,623
I'm eating it now.

346
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,600
It was such a fun movie.

347
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,769
A lot to write about.

348
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,398
I know.

349
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,820
Is it now to part ways?

350
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,948
Aren't you hungry?

351
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,157
What?

352
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,742
Do you like pasta?

353
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,994
Pasta?

354
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,915
Isn't that what people usually eat
on a date?

355
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,917
We can eat something else.

356
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,169
It's okay.

357
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,881
I like everything. I'm an omnivore.

358
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,884
All right, then. Let's go.

359
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,064
This restaurant is so nice.

360
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:44,110
-Have you been here before?
-No, I found it online.

361
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,945
He looked up restaurants online?

362
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,072
To take me?

363
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,753
I HAVE 37,000 WON LEFT

364
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:05,381
TWO OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PASTA
DISHES WILL COME TO 28,000 WON IN TOTAL

365
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,764
TWO OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE BEVERAGES
WILL COME TO 12,000 WON IN TOTAL

366
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:16,100
THE GRAND TOTAL WILL BE 40,000 WON

367
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,269
I'll get aglio e olio.

368
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,566
AGLIO E OLIO: 11,000 WON

369
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,277
TWO SERVINGS OF AGLIO E OLIO EQUAL
22,000 WON

370
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,279
THE GRAND TOTAL WILL BE 34,000 WON

371
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,114
Excuse me.

372
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,993
What would you like to order?

373
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,162
We'll each get aglio e olio pasta and...

374
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,124
-What do you want to drink?
-I'll just stick with water.

375
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,293
Get something else.
I'll get Sprite.

376
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,837
Then I'll get the same.

377
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,506
We'll get two of it, then.

378
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,049
Sure, no problem.

379
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,428
TWO GLASSES OF SODA WILL BE
8,000 WON IN TOTAL

380
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,263
THE GRAND TOTAL WILL BE 30,000 WON

381
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,599
-Did you take a lot of notes earlier?
-What?

382
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,144
You took notes while watching the movie.
Show me what you wrote.

383
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,401
You have to write about
what you thought about the movie.

384
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,236
You shouldn't be influenced.

385
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,947
I never said I'd copy yours.
I'm just curious.

386
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,992
What's there to be curious about?
They're obvious things.

387
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,536
Your handwriting.

388
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,871
I want to see what it looks like.

389
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:20,999
But why?

390
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,585
I'm just curious.

391
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:26,963
Do I need a reason?

392
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,512
Excuse me. I have to use the restroom.

393
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,867
Is it possible?

394
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,163
To think of a guy like that
just as a friend.

395
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,417
Can someone like me really do that?

396
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,677
Isn't that guy so handsome?

397
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,179
Totally. Oh, my.

398
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,766
His girlfriend must be super pretty.

399
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,188
-He's really good-looking.
-Unbelievably handsome.

400
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,647
I know, right?

401
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,784
-Why didn't you eat?
-Because you weren't here.

402
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,839
Hey,

403
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,633
When's your birthday?

404
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,218
What?

405
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,470
We're friends, but I don't know it.

406
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,141
You want to know so many things.
Just eat up.

407
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:07,480
I won't ever let myself get high hopes
by telling him my birthday.

408
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,863
Then don't tell Woo-young either.

409
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,866
-Don't tell him what?
-Your birthday.

410
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:06,998
I'M SEARCHING FOR A ROOMMATE WHO WANTS
TO LIVE AT A ROOFTOP NEAR OUR SCHOOL

411
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,547
-Let's split the bill.
-It's 30,000 won.

412
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,341
-Here you go.
-Hey.

413
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,053
You didn't pay for your share
of the pork belly with Woo-young.

414
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,265
-What?
-So why are you trying to pay for this?

415
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,352
That's because he's the one
who invited us.

416
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,981
I'm the one who suggested watching a movie
and eating dinner together.

417
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,819
Goodbye.

418
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,948
Bye.

419
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,796
The forecast didn't say
it would rain today.

420
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:02,678
I have seven dollars left.
Will that be enough to pay for the cab?

421
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,646
Just a moment.

422
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,577
Hello.

423
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,333
-Can I have one more of this?
-That's the only one we have left.

424
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,816
-You can take this.
-What about you?

425
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,859
I can run to the bus stop.

426
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,656
Let's go together. I'll walk you there.

427
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,163
Let's go.

428
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,708
No, it's okay.
It's too small for two people.

429
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,084
You can take it.

430
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,298
Then you take it.

431
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,177
Hey.

432
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,732
You're getting all wet. Get under here.

433
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,151
Then you'll get wet.

434
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,902
Come closer.

435
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,593
The umbrella is so small, isn't it?

436
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:08,804
Yes.

437
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,188
Are you wearing perfume?

438
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,233
No, I don't wear perfume
that often these days.

439
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,154
Because I don't like it?

440
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,825
Well, not exactly.

441
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,417
I...

442
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,754
went to the hospital that day.

443
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,047
What?

444
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,346
I met her.

445
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,394
-I see.
-Aren't you going to ask how it went?

446
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,188
I thought you wouldn't want me to ask.

447
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,778
How did it go?

448
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:10,908
It went quite well.

449
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,495
Really?

450
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,623
Wear that perfume.

451
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,675
I'll do what I want.
I'm not going to do as you say.

452
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,764
Forget it, then.

453
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,104
I'm relieved.

454
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:43,899
About what?

455
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,777
That you don't hate your mom.

456
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,827
Thanks.

457
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,329
No problem.

458
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,884
Seo Yoo-jin moved out of his apartment
and is living at his bar.

459
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,637
Seeing that, I'm guessing
his business isn't doing that well.

460
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,891
I'm worried that Kyung-seok might not
be able to get enough food.

461
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,478
The elections are coming up,
but kids are only causing trouble.

462
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,647
You must be going through
a lot these days.

463
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,066
Do you know where Hye-sung lives?

464
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,112
Let's go there.

465
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,405
Okay.

466
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,456
It's...

467
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,042
not raining anymore.

468
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,504
You're right.

469
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,384
You should go now.

470
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,053
It stopped raining.

471
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:54,970
Here.

472
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,056
You bought this.

473
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,475
Okay.

474
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,564
-See you.
-Bye.

475
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,487
Wait.

476
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:20,996
Take it.

477
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,165
It might rain again.

478
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,677
Okay.

479
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,637
Thanks.

480
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,431
No problem.

481
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,935
Thank you for walking me all the way here.

482
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,190
Then, bye.

483
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,406
I'll get heart disease at this rate.

484
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,967
I definitely realized it.

485
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,638
I can't...

486
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,351
think of Kyung-seok as just a guy friend.

487
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,914
Stay healthy.

488
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,966
Who is it?

489
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,801
Hello, Ms. Na Hye-sung.

490
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,012
Who is this?

491
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:04,350
I'm sorry to visit you at this hour.
My name is Jung Young-mo.

492
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,853
It's me.

493
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:30,167
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get back at me?

494
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,045
How did you find me here?

495
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,964
Did you have someone look into me?

496
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:40,344
Do you still have no respect for me?
That you would barge into my home?

497
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,768
Send Kyung-seok home.

498
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,230
-What?
-Are you pretending to be clueless?

499
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,441
After he met with you yesterday,
he left home.

500
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,197
You told him that I hit you...

501
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,741
when you saw him after 10 years?

502
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,412
I didn't tell him that.

503
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,580
You didn't?

504
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:13,293
Only two of us know
what happened between us.

505
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,130
Then you told him.

506
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,762
Where is Kyung-seok now?

507
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,349
If you know where he is,
will you take him?

508
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,435
That's up to Kyung-seok.

509
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,398
Get out if that's all you came to say.

510
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,457
It's been 10 years, right?

511
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,500
-Mind your own business.
-Yes, sir.

512
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,605
What's up with this weather?

513
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,482
Let's go.

514
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,027
Gosh.

515
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,198
You're back.

516
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,159
What are you doing?

517
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,997
How did you sleep here?
I almost fell when I turned.

518
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,415
I don't move when I sleep.

519
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,043
You take the room tonight.

520
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,004
That's fine.
Don't call 911 after you fall off.

521
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,719
I might move back home.

522
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,599
If I move back in after using up
the deposit, my dad really might kill me.

523
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,104
-When will you go back?
-I don't know. I should ask my mom.

524
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,818
You should move back home, too.

525
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,986
-Stop being a rebel.
-I won't.

526
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,488
How will you get by?

527
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,074
I'll get a part-time job
and a place, too.

528
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,576
Put up with me until then.

529
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,413
Hey, you think
you're better than me, right?

530
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,751
Making a living in this world isn't
that easy. Got that?

531
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,422
Get the lights. I'm going to sleep.

532
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,346
-Is there a specific job you'd like?
-No.

533
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:34,226
No questions regarding your personal life.
No copy of your family registry.

534
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,313
No jobs that require you to talk a lot.
You can't work every day or overtime,

535
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,942
-but you want a job that pays well?
-Yes.

536
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:47,865
I think it'd be better
if you look for a job yourself.

537
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,575
Pardon?

538
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:53,745
There must be a lot on the recruiting
website or the school website.

539
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,751
-I'll go a little later.
-Okay.

540
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:03,547
JOB PLACEMENT OFFICE

541
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,345
Why is he coming out of this office?

542
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,307
Why are you coming out of here?

543
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,310
Why did he come out of this office?

544
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,605
-Thank you.
-Sure.

545
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:25,986
Ta-da.

546
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,530
Isn't this cool?

547
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,407
Here.

548
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,036
-Jung-ho.
-Yes?

549
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,998
You know the expression,
"Little strokes fell great oaks"?

550
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:42,628
-That applies to trees, not to people.
-Then you should give up on Kyung-seok.

551
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,380
-Why?
-He's a person, too.

552
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,176
You little runt!

553
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,934
I saw him coming out
from the job placement office.

554
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,769
Why would he go there?

555
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,021
A rich guy wouldn't need a job.

556
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:05,025
He's just showing that even a son
of a congressman has a part-time job.

557
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,944
He's not a congressman anymore.

558
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,445
He will be a mayor soon.

559
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:21,708
That jerk, Kyung-seok.
That explains his behavior.

560
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,135
What's up with this jerk?
Why does he order me around?

561
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,153
Let's keep some distance.

562
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,865
It won't be awkward after some time.

563
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,541
STUDIO IN PRIME LOCATION
COOL STUDIO FOR 600,000 WON A MONTH

564
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:06,461
ROOFTOP HOUSE NEAR SCHOOL, THE RENT IS
100,000 WON. WE'LL DISCUSS DETAILS.

565
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,130
What are you doing?

566
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,805
Was the movie fun yesterday?

567
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:17,723
Yes.

568
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,106
I'm busy right now.

569
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:38,410
Drink this, buddy. Goodness.

570
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,874
Look at that.
I've never seen him walk that fast.

571
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,918
He always seemed to be annoyed
by everything around him.

572
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,171
What? He's even running now?

573
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,964
Hey, Kyung-seok is running.

574
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,966
What's going on? What is this?

575
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:57,262
Just like any other day,
I'm talking to myself.

576
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:59,931
What are you doing?

577
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,019
Didn't Kyung-seok wear that
the other day?

578
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,856
That's not 55,000 won.
It's 550,000 won?

579
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,524
Come on.

580
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,360
Buddy.

581
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:17,574
No matter how great it is,
don't copy someone else.

582
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:18,909
I wasn't going to buy it.

583
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,952
I won't buy it.

584
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,747
"I won't buy it."
Actually, you can't afford it.

585
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:30,670
Hey, you drink it. What do you know
about my family's finances?

586
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,673
Oh, my. How are the finances?

587
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,176
How are they? Tell me.

588
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,263
We're better off than yours.

589
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,688
What do you know about it?

590
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,191
If you keep skipping classes,
you can't graduate.

591
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,945
-Do you want to stay one more semester?
-It's just that it's embarrassing.

592
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,365
Could you come to classes
after being humiliated by a freshman?

593
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,828
Then apologize to him like a senior
and clear the air. Don't avoid him.

594
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,581
I should've done that then.
It's too late now.

595
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,464
-Is it true? Is Do Kyung-seok...
-What?

596
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,508
Nothing.

597
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,346
What is this?

598
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,806
Unbelievable.

599
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,532
OFFICE OF CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT
TA: YEON WOO-YOUNG

600
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,788
Long time no see.

601
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,248
Yes.

602
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,879
-You've been well, right?
-Yes.

603
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,383
I've been wanting to see you.

604
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:01,261
-Can we talk for a second?
-I'm busy right now.

605
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,055
You're busy.

606
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,933
Then I'll see you later.

607
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:07,934
Okay.

608
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,737
Had I known, I wouldn't have done that.

609
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,702
You want to move into my place?

610
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,205
-Why?
-I moved out.

611
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,415
You moved out, but you don't have a place?

612
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,959
-No.
-If you moved out, why don't...

613
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,212
You ran away from home?

614
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,091
I don't want a short-term roommate.

615
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,344
It's not short-term. It's long-term.

616
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:45,889
Take a seat.

617
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,358
Did you read the terms?

618
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:01,488
But as for the first month, could you
accept the TV I gave you as my rent?

619
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,574
-Come again?
-A microwave or a coffee maker?

620
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,036
I saw that you don't have either.

621
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,288
No money?

622
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,791
I'll pay soon.

623
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,001
-You did run away.
-I moved out on my own.

624
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,385
Have you already found one?
I mean, a roommate.

625
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,095
No, not yet.

626
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,058
Then let's do this.

627
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,146
AGREEMENT

628
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,484
Just pay 70,000 won a month, but you must
take care of all the housework. Okay?

629
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,446
AGREEMENT

630
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,156
YEON WOO-YOUNG
DO KYUNG-SEOK

631
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,122
Pay 30,000 won more
if you don't want to do housework.

632
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,335
I'll do it.
I'll take care of all the housework.

633
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,135
Oh, it must be that way.

634
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,846
Put them in the fridge
and come back out quickly.

635
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:11,599
I should cut up the watermelon.
They won't eat it if I leave it like that.

636
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,227
I can't park on the street for that long.

637
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,480
All right. I'll be quick.

638
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,153
My gosh, it's that guy.

639
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,905
-Pull over for a moment.
-Why? Who is he?

640
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,163
It's so nice to run into you like this.

641
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,372
Do you remember me?

642
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,333
Oh, yes. Hello.

643
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:40,086
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

644
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,965
Thank you so much for everything
the other day.

645
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,884
Where are you headed? Get in.

646
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,635
It's okay. I live right there.

647
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:50,930
Mom.

648
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,767
-Are you getting home now?
-What's up?

649
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,145
-Hello.
-Hi.

650
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,275
-He's a senior in my department.
-Really?

651
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,654
You and my daughter are
in the same department.

652
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,114
Yes, hello.

653
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,159
-It's nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

654
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,336
Does he live alone, too?

655
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:22,712
Yes.

656
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,508
How old is he?

657
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,385
I guess he's around 26?

658
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,428
So he's six years older.

659
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,225
Take some of these side dishes to him.
Some watermelon, too.

660
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,768
To Woo-young?

661
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,479
He probably never buys one
because he lives alone.

662
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,606
-I'll cut it up. Take some to him.
-Okay.

663
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,274
Hurry up already!

664
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,153
Can't he just drive around the block
if he can't park?

665
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,781
Make sure you take it to him.

666
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,898
Yes, Ms. Na.

667
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,818
-How have you been?
-Good.

668
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,612
How are you feeling? Are you better now?

669
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,575
I'm fine now.
Thank you so much for your help that day.

670
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,285
No problem.

671
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,915
How's Kyung-seok?
Is everything well with him?

672
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,127
Yes, he's doing great.

673
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:50,717
I heard that you two finally met.

674
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,095
Thank you for that too.

675
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,185
Well, could you give me his number?

676
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,686
I forgot to ask him.

677
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,063
Sure, I'll send it to you right away.

678
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:08,526
Okay. Take care. Bye.

679
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,533
DO KYUNG-SEOK

680
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,661
KANG MI-RAE

681
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,808
Who is it?

682
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:42,602
Hey, Mi-rae.

683
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:48,274
My mom wanted me to give you this.

684
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,861
-Your mom?
-Yes.

685
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,574
Take the containers. Come in.

686
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:04,541
Make sure you tell your mom
that I thanked her.

687
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,583
Okay.

688
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:10,421
-You should put everything in the fridge.
-Oh, right.

689
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,715
Let's see.

690
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,767
Hey, what are you doing here?

691
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,769
I live here now.

692
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,611
What?

693
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:58,177
In a month, rent and half of utilities are
due. Also, we'll buy our own food, okay?

694
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,347
Look at that. Woo-young is so sweet.

695
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,891
Don't you think that guy likes Mi-rae?

696
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:04,809
-Hello.
-Hello.

697
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,019
Hi.

698
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:09,647
-You live with your grandparents?
-You've become very curious about me.

699
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:13,109
Do Kyung-seok and Hyun Sua.
They look so lovely together.

700
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:16,487
You haven't found a job?
