1
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,548
Kang Mi-rae.

2
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,478
If...

3
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,483
something like that
happens to you again,

4
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,113
I'll get involved without
punching someone.

5
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,993
That will be okay, right?

6
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,626
If you keep saying things like that,

7
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,630
I'll get the wrong idea.

8
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,008
About what?

9
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,678
Just like how I'm feeling, you might...

10
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,770
Never mind.

11
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:45,980
You should get going.

12
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,357
I'm going to go.

13
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,578
Do you by any chance...

14
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,626
have any feelings for me?

15
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:08,837
What?

16
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,644
No, it's not like that.

17
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,398
If...

18
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,735
I'm sorry If you got offended by
how I jumped to conclusions like that.

19
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,614
But I've never thought of you
more than a friend, so don't worry.

20
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,907
What, worry?

21
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,160
That's not what I meant.

22
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,870
We're friends, right?

23
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,290
I really think of you just as a friend.

24
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,293
100 percent.

25
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:52,922
Hey.

26
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,967
By any chance, do you...

27
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,679
Do you have a crush on someone else?

28
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,602
No, I don't have a crush on anyone.

29
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,984
See you tomorrow.
I'm going to go.

30
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,625
Do you by any chance...

31
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,753
have any feelings for me?

32
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,383
No.

33
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,386
No, don't think about it.

34
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,472
I've already given up.

35
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,058
I can never date Kyung-seok.

36
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,232
I don't want my life to get ruined again.

37
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,009
Did something happen?

38
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,927
You seem upset.

39
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,180
There's no alcohol.

40
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,436
Oh, I noticed you didn't clean today.

41
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,688
I did it for you, so you better
clean well from tomorrow.

42
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,899
I'll just pay the full rent
going forward,

43
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,402
so let's divide the housework.

44
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,992
I guess your part-time job
pays you well.

45
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,291
What's with him?

46
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,930
We're friends, right?

47
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,768
I really think of you just as a friend.

48
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,395
100 percent.

49
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,960
What's wrong?

50
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,380
What? Oh no, it's nothing.

51
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,093
What am I going to do
if I run into him?

52
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,637
What am I supposed to say?

53
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,432
-Hey, it's a special lecture.
-It must be held by Kelun.

54
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,976
-Where's the lecture held at?
-It doesn't say it there.

55
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,063
Does that mean we can meet
Ms. Na Hye-sung in person?

56
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,398
I'm so excited.

57
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,649
It sounds fun.

58
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,776
I'm glad I didn't enroll
in summer classes.

59
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,028
Do you think Woo-young
will be attending as well?

60
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,657
If you like him so much,
you should dress up like me.

61
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,867
That's not my true self.

62
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,787
I don't want to seduce him
by faking myself.

63
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,704
Seduce?

64
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,164
Did you just say seduce?

65
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,126
That word doesn't suit you at all.

66
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,710
Hey!

67
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,756
-Did you put up a banner for me?
-Of course.

68
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,341
It's a special lecture by you.

69
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,010
I didn't think I'd be nervous.

70
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,054
But I am now that I'm here.

71
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,643
Are you going to sing?

72
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,687
Will they make me sing?

73
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,189
Sure, kids these days are difficult
to deal with.

74
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,152
That actually made me
pull myself together.

75
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,195
I wish you good luck.

76
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,741
What should I do?

77
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,414
Are you sure Woo-young is coming?

78
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,667
Gosh, stop talking about him.
I'm sure he'll be here.

79
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,433
A SCENT THAT WILL MAKE
PEOPLE REMEMBER YOU.

80
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,271
I guess the power of genetics is
really incredible.

81
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,649
My mother-in-law's so pretty.

82
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,569
Since when did she become
your mother-in-law?

83
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,907
Since today?

84
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,369
I can see where Kyung-seok got
his looks from.

85
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:20,041
His mom's beautiful but Kyung-seok isn't
that good looking.

86
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,461
Frankly, he and I are pretty much
on the same level. We're both tall.

87
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,380
Do you have any conscience at all?

88
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,305
I'm sure you all know who she is
but I'll still introduce her to you.

89
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,225
She's a proud graduate of Hankook
University's chemistry department

90
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,185
and CEO of Kelun Korea.
She's Ms. Na Hye-sung.

91
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,691
I'm glad to meet you all.
My name is Na Hye-sung.

92
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,450
Where's Kyung-seok?

93
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,663
His mom came to school to give a lecture
but he's not even here.

94
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,588
Our manager desperately waited
for you to come

95
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,383
but he went to a seminar abroad.

96
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,011
I might not be as good as him,
but can I still give it a try?

97
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,556
I don't care as long as you pay me.

98
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,975
Thank you for trusting me.

99
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,685
Do I get paid right away?

100
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,605
Of course, you'll get paid
as soon as you're done. Let's begin.

101
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,528
You have a girlfriend, right?

102
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,905
I hope she'll like it.

103
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,367
But then, I don't think it matters
since you're so handsome.

104
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,704
Even an afro would look like
a fashion trend if you do it.

105
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:48,838
What I meant was a person's look
is what completes the hairstyle.

106
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,383
I won't do an afro on you.
I'm not out of my mind.

107
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,885
Perfume always comes last.

108
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,804
Let me explain.

109
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,515
When you get ready to go out,
you put on your clothes, do your hair,

110
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,725
and put makeup on.

111
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,020
And no one puts on perfume
before doing any of those things.

112
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,023
However, there are times when this
invisible last step

113
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,859
ends up lingering in people's memories
for a long time.

114
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:14,405
It's hard to remember a certain person's
hairstyle or outfit from long time ago.

115
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,991
But you remember their smell.

116
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,827
That smell stays in your head
along with that person's image.

117
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,375
This is yours, right?

118
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,629
You can wear that perfume.

119
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,842
When you smell the steam
from a rice cooker,

120
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,303
you're reminded of your mother.

121
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,389
And when you smell the perfume
you used to wear a long time ago,

122
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,225
you're reminded
of how you used to feel back then.

123
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,397
I'm not sure how you'll remember me...

124
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,285
Isn't that Kyung-seok?

125
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,664
I have to say, he likes to put himself
in the spotlight.

126
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:26,227
I don't know how you'll remember me
after this lecture.

127
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,021
-Don't ever dye your hair like him.
-But I hope...

128
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,315
-It doesn't look good on him.
-...you'll at least remember

129
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,734
what I told you all about scent today.

130
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:38,364
If you wish to take part in our company
program, please submit applications.

131
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,700
I'll end my lecture here.

132
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,254
-Thank you for the lecture.
-Thank you.

133
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,720
-Your finals are coming up, right?
-Yes.

134
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,139
Is everything okay?

135
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,807
What do you mean?

136
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,934
Well...

137
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,105
What's your plan for the summer?
Are you going to apply for the program?

138
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,899
I'll think about it.

139
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,027
Okay, but I hope you do apply.

140
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,490
See you.

141
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,248
Is he going through late adolescence?

142
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,459
What's up with him?

143
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,713
Girls get their hair done after
they go through a break up.

144
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,715
I wonder if it's something similar.

145
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,723
I'm sorry.

146
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,191
You dyed your hair.

147
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,611
Yes.

148
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,740
-It looks pretty.
-I didn't do it to look pretty.

149
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,701
Oh, sorry. It looks good.

150
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,161
I didn't do it to look good.

151
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,662
Oh really?

152
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,957
-I guess you just did it for no reason.
-Not exactly.

153
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,753
Well, okay.

154
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,964
I'll go now. Good luck on your finals.

155
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,220
Why did I say good luck?
The exams haven't even started yet.

156
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,263
This is driving me crazy.

157
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,561
Is  he getting ready to become
a celebrity?

158
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,313
With his personality?

159
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,941
What's wrong with Kyung-seok's
personality?

160
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,485
It's not normal.

161
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,111
He'll never do as he's told.

162
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,823
With Kyung-seok's good looks

163
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,283
his manager will listen
to Kyung-seok's orders.

164
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,538
Do you still like Kyung-seok?

165
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,917
To be honest,

166
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,419
I gave up on him.

167
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,213
I gave up.

168
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,094
But he's too good-looking
to erase from my heart.

169
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,765
I know you guys all have a small crush
on him as well.

170
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,475
Am I wrong?

171
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,910
Be honest with me.
My cooking was terrible, right?

172
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,499
You can be honest with me.

173
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,711
No, it wasn't that bad.

174
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,799
By the way, Kyung-hee.
Will you take a look at this?

175
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,931
-Is that Kyung-seok?
-Yes.

176
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,642
I didn't want to sound too nagging

177
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,811
so I couldn't ask why he dyed his hair.

178
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,939
He's not the type who cares about
his looks.

179
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,941
What's wrong with him?

180
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,069
-Maybe he's dating someone.
-Do you think so?

181
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,865
Or maybe, he got his heart broken
by someone.

182
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,994
By whom?

183
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,336
Thanks.

184
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,130
Write me a receipt.

185
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,384
You said a verbal agreement
wouldn't be effective.

186
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,304
I see that you've got used to
life in society now.

187
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,766
-Didn't I say I learn things quickly?
-It's partly thanks to my useful tips.

188
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,851
It's not cool to take credit like that.

189
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,814
-How cool of you.
-Aren't you writing me a receipt?

190
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,324
Did you do modeling for a hair salon?

191
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,618
How did you know?

192
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,162
I told you. I've done
almost every part-time job.

193
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,330
DO KYUNG-SEOK HAS PAID

194
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,791
I thought you wouldn't do such a thing
with your personality.

195
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,751
Did you not like doing chores?

196
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,046
Or is there a change in your mind?

197
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,511
Don't act like you know about me.

198
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,912
He changed his hair color again.

199
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,856
I got this question wrong.

200
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,110
Finals are finally over!

201
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,491
Hey, finals are over.
How about we go play games?

202
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,409
Sure, let's get it.

203
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,828
Let's go.

204
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,163
It's over.

205
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,125
Why don't we go eat something good?

206
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,919
Let's not eat near the school.
I want to go somewhere far.

207
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,004
Let's go.

208
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,972
Hello, Ms. Na.

209
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,892
Yes, I'm done with my finals.

210
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,480
Okay.

211
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,483
Did I gain weight?

212
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,486
I ate too much because
I was stressed with finals.

213
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,238
No, you didn't.

214
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,574
You say that all the time.

215
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,616
How was the exam?

216
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,994
-Hello.
-Hi.

217
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,831
About going on a field trip
to Kyung-seok mom's company,

218
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,666
are there senior applicants?

219
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,377
-Not that I know of.
-Is that so?

220
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,881
-It might be quite awkward then.
-Are you going to apply?

221
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,550
Never mind.

222
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,302
It wouldn't look good for me to be there.

223
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,139
Are you still mad?

224
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,433
My goodness.

225
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,894
-See you later.
-Bye.

226
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,023
-What did you just do?
-What?

227
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,400
Don't you know that he said
I was a fatty?

228
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,402
How could you talk to him
like nothing happened?

229
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,946
It's not like I'm never going
to see him again.

230
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,783
Kyung-seok turned him into a mop.

231
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,995
Even classmates care for each other.
What's wrong with you?

232
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,080
Tae-hee.

233
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,375
Tae-hee, let's go eat something good.

234
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,377
Tae...

235
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,504
Gosh, this is tiring.

236
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,098
Dong-won, you must've been really hungry.

237
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,311
Sorry I couldn't take care of you
because I was busy with finals.

238
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:31,855
Is it good?

239
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,987
Hello, Dong-won.

240
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,825
Guys, I think

241
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,328
the beauty in my department
really has a crush on me.

242
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,247
That's only your delusion.

243
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:53,543
No, I'm telling you.
The name of her cat is same as my name.

244
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,838
Maybe your name is Nabi or Kitty.

245
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,383
It's rarely used to name a cat.

246
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,592
It's for people.

247
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,886
Can this be a coincidence?

248
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,806
Can you still say that
she doesn't like me?

249
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,024
It must've been hard
studying for your finals.

250
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:16,942
Eat up.

251
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,069
Thank you.

252
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,323
Let me do it.

253
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,701
Moms usually do this for you.

254
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,119
You should start eating.

255
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,705
Thank you.

256
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,128
By the way, didn't you want to say
something to me?

257
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,508
Actually, I have a question.

258
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,221
Nothing special has happened
to Kyung-seok, right?

259
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,436
No, I don't think so.

260
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,814
Then why did he dye his hair?

261
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,900
Kyung-hee told me he doesn't care
about his looks.

262
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,528
I'm not too sure about that,

263
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,489
but he dyed his hair back to black.

264
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,449
Really?

265
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:10,329
I was worried I might look nosy
if I asked him about it directly.

266
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,873
I see.

267
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,505
I guess you're the one in trouble.

268
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,632
Pardon?

269
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,010
Are you worried about something?

270
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,227
I guess you don't want to share.

271
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,604
I'm sorry.

272
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,356
That's not it.

273
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,860
The thing is...

274
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,865
TA, I want to apply for the field trip.

275
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,116
Okay.

276
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,747
LIST OF FIELD TRIP APPLICANTS

277
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,500
-You're Hyun Sua, right?
-Yes.

278
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,839
KO YE-NA, KIM TAE-HEE, YOO EUN,
JANG WON-HO, KIM SUNG-WUN...

279
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,925
It's done.

280
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,761
Thank you. Goodbye.

281
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,678
Bye.

282
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,141
Kyung-seok, are you here to apply for...

283
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,730
What's wrong?

284
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,483
Don't tell me you're here
to call off the rent issue.

285
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,735
I'm here to apply for the field trip.

286
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,821
-To Kelun?
-Yes.

287
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,496
-Do better for your mom.
-That's my business.

288
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,419
Are you mad at me?

289
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,549
I'm done, right? Bye.

290
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,558
I can't read his mind.

291
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,815
You like him,

292
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:05,193
and he seems to like you too.
Why do you have to give up?

293
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,824
I think I'm scared.

294
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,413
He's beyond my league.

295
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,707
He's too perfect for me.

296
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,625
Still, you two like each other.
So why?

297
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,213
The thing is,

298
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,633
a girl who's really pretty
has a crush on him.

299
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,012
Everyone thinks
that they'd make a good couple.

300
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:37,350
As you know, I got plastic surgery
all over my face.

301
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,146
If he dates me, what will people say?
I'm just too scared.

302
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:42,939
I see.

303
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,526
I'm so stupid, right?

304
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,031
But still,

305
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,201
what matters is the fact that you two
like each other.

306
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,244
So don't think about other people.

307
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,583
That's what everyone else will say though.

308
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,252
I understand.

309
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,672
I'm sure many girls would feel
that way in your situation.

310
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:13,762
I'm so mad at the people that made you
think that way.

311
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:19,559
I don't know the details,
so I can't really give you advice.

312
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,146
But perhaps, that pretty girl...

313
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,567
isn't much different from you.

314
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,906
I just don't want you
to have regrets later on.

315
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,956
-Did you apply for the lab experience?
-Pardon?

316
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,462
Let's eat.

317
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,007
Have this too. Help yourself.

318
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,218
Thank you.

319
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,898
Sua may not be that different from me?

320
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,491
Hello, Woo-young.

321
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,828
I'm on my way home now.

322
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:20,787
Mi-rae.

323
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,209
Good timing.

324
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,795
Hello.

325
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,715
Can we talk for a minute?

326
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,717
Sure.

327
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,928
I noticed that you didn't apply.
Did you forget about it?

328
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,015
No.

329
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,144
I'm thinking of visiting my family
during summer break.

330
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,733
But it's not for the whole summer.
You can visit them after you're done.

331
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,989
I thought you'd apply for sure
since you're interested in perfume.

332
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,076
More importantly, I think it'd be a good
chance for you to find out whether

333
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,121
you are a good fit to pursue
a career in  the perfume industry.

334
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,834
Also, there may not be another opportunity
to get hands-on experience

335
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,378
at the perfume lab until you graduate.

336
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,761
Can I still apply for the program?

337
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,639
Of course, I'll add your name to the list.

338
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,018
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

339
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,438
Woo-young.

340
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,275
Thank you.

341
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,696
Then are you free on Wednesday?

342
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,739
Pardon?

343
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,991
Let's watch a movie.
We can get a discount that day.

344
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,495
Then I'll let Hyun-jung know as well.

345
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,247
Just the two of us.

346
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,085
I have something to tell you.

347
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,713
Okay.

348
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,091
Let's go.

349
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,017
I've gained a little bit of weight.

350
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,466
Hey, wait.

351
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,763
Hello, Dong-won.

352
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,725
I heard that...

353
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,480
canned tuna is high in sodium.
You shouldn't give it to cats.

354
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,691
If you still want to,
you should rinse it in water first

355
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,943
to remove the oil and sodium
before giving it to them.

356
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,654
Hey, Sua.

357
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,365
Oh, hi.

358
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,118
-Did you eat?
-Yes, what about you?

359
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,244
I ate as well.

360
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,424
Hi, Mi-rae.

361
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,301
-Hello.
-Hi.

362
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,928
Let's sit over there.

363
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,180
Hello.

364
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:26,723
Hi.

365
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,020
Do you guys still work there part-time?

366
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,230
No, we quit.

367
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,815
Even Kyung-seok?

368
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,525
Yes.

369
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,572
Hello, Kyung-seok.

370
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,704
I heard you quit the part-time job.

371
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,338
He shouldn't have been involved
in that thing. I feel bad for him.

372
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,601
Nice to meet you all.
I'm chief director, Lee Soo-hyun.

373
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,979
This is Ms. Yun Soo-kyung, who will be
your guide through out the program.

374
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,357
Hello, nice to meet you all.

375
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,529
While getting hands-on experience
at the lab,

376
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,365
you'll learn about theories and history
of perfume.

377
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,659
If you have any questions or suggestions,

378
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,744
feel free to speak to Ms. Yun.

379
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,287
-Okay.
-Okay.

380
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,083
Yes, come in.

381
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,129
Why did you come to school today?

382
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,715
-I'm taking a summer class.
-Oh, I see.

383
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:47,095
-What brings you here?
-There's something I want to tell you.

384
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:48,888
To me?

385
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,641
I'm not that eloquent,

386
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,519
so I wrote down what I want to tell you.

387
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,198
Okay. Bye.

388
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,712
Dear Woo-young,

389
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,172
I'm Kwon Yoon-byeol in sophomore year.

390
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,717
I have a crush on you.

391
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,011
You're very responsible
and have a strong sense of ethics.

392
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,055
You respect women.
I like everything about you.

393
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,393
I wrote this letter because I was too shy
to tell you in person.

394
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,354
Best regards, Kwon Yoon-byeol.

395
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,523
Shy? She's so brave.

396
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,860
Gosh, what should I do about this?

397
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,492
First, go ahead and smell
the undiluted scents.

398
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,496
Then, please write down which scents
are in the perfume I gave you.

399
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,927
Because I've been smelling
all these different scents

400
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,470
I can't even smell anything.

401
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,389
You'll have to refresh your sense of smell
here and there.

402
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,224
You can either take a break

403
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,353
or try smelling coffee beans here.
It'll help as well.

404
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,461
I think these scents are combined.

405
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,967
Correct, you guessed every scent
in the perfume correctly.

406
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,679
That's impressive.

407
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,305
Are you Kang Mi-rae?

408
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,349
You're the one who sent us
that perfume.

409
00:32:56,432 --> 00:33:00,353
Everyone in our lab loved that perfume.
We've been waiting to meet you in person.

410
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,188
Thank you.

411
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,650
You are a perfume expert.

412
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,758
It didn't say it was going to rain.

413
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,516
Woo-young.

414
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,561
Woo-young.

415
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,063
Wait, Woo-young.

416
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,650
What were you thinking about?

417
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,611
Well, just some things.

418
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,033
Did you eat dinner?

419
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,161
Oh right, I didn't even have lunch today.

420
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,913
You didn't eat all day?

421
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,457
That's bad.

422
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,375
Thanks for your concern.

423
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,629
Well...

424
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,341
Do you want to eat dinner with me?

425
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,302
Sure, what should we eat?

426
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:19,432
Since today is hot,
let's go somewhere close.

427
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,100
-Sure.
-Okay.

428
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,732
-Welcome.
-Hello.

429
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,484
-Hello.
-You can sit over there.

430
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,410
He's still here.

431
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,954
He's a part-timer, not the owner.

432
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,122
Oh really?

433
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,087
-He must've gone bankrupt.
-Exactly.

434
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,755
You're here.

435
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,715
What do you want? Beer?

436
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:58,304
I don't think I'm good with perfume.
I can't even smell anything now.

437
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,474
I liked it. I wasn't interested
in perfume, but it's really fun.

438
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,392
-Right?
-Yes.

439
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,730
Mi-rae, you look really interested.
You must really like perfume.

440
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,988
-I'm hungry.
-But you already ate.

441
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,491
Why are you sitting here alone
like a loner?

442
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,119
I was a loner all my life.

443
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,995
What would you have done without me?

444
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,413
I know.

445
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,499
Do you guys all want beer?

446
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,667
-Beer sounds good.
-Great.

447
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,212
Kyung-seok, what are you doing there?

448
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,131
You should go.

449
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,217
I can't be bothered.
I'm going to leave after this.

450
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,593
Hey, Kyung-seok.

451
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,428
Get over here.

452
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,680
Kyung-seok.

453
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,974
-Come on.
-Come sit here.

454
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,433
Please just go.

455
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,811
You're practically volunteering
to become a loner.

456
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,481
I thought things were getting better.
But you're doing this again.

457
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,861
-Kyung-seok.
-Come quick.

458
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,530
Gosh, he's so cold-hearted.

459
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,499
Something wrong?

460
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,753
No, there's something on my mind.

461
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:14,755
What is it?

462
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,475
The thing is, someone confessed
that she likes me.

463
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,393
What?

464
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,854
Why are you so startled?

465
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,689
Is it that shocking?

466
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,774
No, it's not shocking.

467
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,485
You're really popular.

468
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,029
No, I'm not popular.

469
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,491
What are you going to do?

470
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,247
I'm just thinking about how
I'm going to turn her down.

471
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,585
Have you already made up your mind?

472
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,502
Yes.

473
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,340
I can't suddenly like someone
just because that person likes me.

474
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,011
You're very clear with what you want.

475
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,764
I just know what kind of woman I like.

476
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,643
Don't be too harsh though.

477
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:14,523
Some people say you should be cold
when you reject someone.

478
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,360
But if she's a decent person,

479
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,781
she'd appreciate it
if you reject her politely.

480
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,534
You're right.

481
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:31,874
I feel like it'll be a scar for life
if the guy she likes says harsh things.

482
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,920
I didn't experience it, but still.

483
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,840
You understand even without experience
because you're a psych major.

484
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,471
Isn't he good-looking?

485
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,014
I'm not sure.

486
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,433
I think On Seung-woo is handsome.

487
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,144
I like guys who look cold-hearted.

488
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,148
What about you, Sua?
Who's your favorite celebrity?

489
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,066
Me?

490
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,694
I don't know much about celebrities.

491
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,113
I like guys who like me.

492
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,744
What about you, Mi-rae?

493
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,079
What?

494
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,499
I've never heard you talk about guys.

495
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,294
What kind of guys do you like?

496
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,842
I haven't really thought about it.

497
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:27,054
Do you like guys who treat you harshly?

498
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,598
You're the first girl
to treat me this way.

499
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,599
Or...

500
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,227
Let me become your firefighter.

501
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,729
Do you like guys who are warm?

502
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,147
Which do you prefer?

503
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,941
I just like the normal type of guys.

504
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,445
What's the standard of normal?

505
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,113
This is so frustrating.

506
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,866
Let's just say you don't have
an ideal type.

507
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,995
I like warm-hearted guys.

508
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,789
-I'm going to leave.
-Kyung-seok.

509
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,125
See you, Kyung-seok.

510
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,669
Bye.

511
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,422
It seems like he's becoming
more harsh.

512
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,467
It's bothering me.

513
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,331
Take this.

514
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,375
It might start raining again.

515
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,880
Okay.

516
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,841
-Thank you.
-No problem.

517
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,761
I'm the one who should thank you.

518
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,860
Is that for Mi-rae?

519
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,697
It's not for me, right?

520
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,698
I told you...

521
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,284
to cut it out.

522
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,078
About what?

523
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,080
Stop pulling tricks I don't understand.

524
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,166
Why do you talk to me that way?

525
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,211
I'm trying my best to become
friends with you.

526
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,173
I sincerely like you.

527
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,259
Even if I don't like you,

528
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,346
I wouldn't have treated you like this
if you were sincere.

529
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,820
Do you still not feel anything?

530
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:07,923
Wait.

531
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,097
You really don't feel anything?

532
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,978
You must be mentally ill.

533
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,777
Why didn't you answer my calls?

534
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,448
Why did you run away?

535
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,454
Because I saw her hug you.

536
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:04,582
Are you okay?

537
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,711
Did it upset you?

538
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,258
I already told you that I'm not
interested in her.

539
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,810
You'll get wet.

540
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,902
Don't change the subject.

541
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,988
Do you really not know?

542
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,158
About what?

543
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:41,744
That I like you.

544
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:46,957
Let's go out.

545
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,628
Don't try to avoid me and answer me
this time.

546
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:55,966
Why?

547
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,763
Why would a guy like you have
feelings for someone like me?

548
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,599
What do you mean by a guy like me...

549
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,561
and a girl like you?

550
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,358
You already know.

551
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,033
Can't you imagine what people will say
if we start dating?

552
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,954
They'll wonder why such a guy
goes out with such a girl.

553
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,373
So what?

554
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,167
What do you think about me?

555
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,131
You're someone...

556
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,970
who can't be anything more than a friend.

557
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,723
Forget about what can or can't be done.

558
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,684
What do you think about me?

559
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,690
I think...

560
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,361
You and I can't be together.

561
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,201
I told you before...

562
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,956
People still think you're cool even if you
live your way. It's not the same for me.

563
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,710
I was bullied throughout my school life
because I was ugly.

564
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,838
And now, people gossip
about my plastic face.

565
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:16,797
Hey.

566
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,843
All I want to know is
what you think about me,

567
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,219
not what other people say.

568
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,596
What other people think is
important to me.

569
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,185
You just think I'm obsessed
with appearances, don't you?

570
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,523
You don't know how hard
it has been for me.

571
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,984
If I'm with you,

572
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,863
my life becomes torture.

573
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,910
Even from the start,

574
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,875
I didn't have a chance?

575
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,002
No.

576
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:55,062
At last, it has ended this way.

577
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,510
-Hello.
-Hello.

578
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:09,928
What?

579
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,305
TO SUA

580
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,349
Thank you for the drink.

581
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,685
What?

582
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,611
Here's what happened with her today.

583
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,447
She enjoyed the drink I gave her.

584
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,532
We're flirting with each other, right?

585
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,286
I think it's true that you get
a girlfriend when they enter college.

586
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,663
I had no idea it'd be
a pretty girl like her.

587
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,250
It must be true that pretty girls
don't go after handsome guys.

588
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,376
What is he saying?

589
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,054
Sua, I thought you might not be able
to finish all the food you got,

590
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,805
but you've actually finished it all.

591
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,141
Sua usually doesn't leave
any of her food.

592
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,144
But you're so skinny.

593
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,190
I don't easily gain weight,
no matter how much I eat.

594
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,151
She says that's her complex.

595
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,696
There's no such thing.

596
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,657
She's so annoying.

597
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,783
Seriously.

598
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:13,992
Hey, lower your voice.

599
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,610
Let's talk for a minute.

600
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,201
Did you eat lunch?

601
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:58,829
No.

602
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,586
If you're going through a hard time
because of me,

603
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,798
I should stop doing that.

604
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,807
But by any chance...

605
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,854
if you think we can go back
to being friends...

606
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,066
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

607
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:32,863
But still...

608
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,076
I'll wait.

609
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,558
You're pretty, so stop
looking into the mirror.

610
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,937
It's been a long time
since I heard you say I'm pretty.

611
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,732
Back when you wanted to date me,

612
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:12,819
you said it every time
you opened your mouth.

613
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,905
I said that because you're pretty.

614
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,032
You were the most beautiful woman
in our neighborhood.

615
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:17,949
I know.

616
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,703
When I was getting married to you,
everyone was shocked

617
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,082
I chose a man for his personality,
not his background.

618
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,459
They said even my heart was pretty.

619
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,337
I was a successful businessman
back then.

620
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,672
They got shocked again

621
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,008
because this pretty woman
was living a bright life,

622
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,386
even if her husband's business
went completely backrupt.

623
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,432
Alright, you're going through a lot
thanks to your pretty face.

624
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,937
Let's stop by that senior's house first
and go to Mi-rae's.

625
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,940
It must be hard for you to carry
two watermelons alone.

626
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,901
I'm okay.

627
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:56,154
I can't make my pretty wife
carry them, even if it's hard.

628
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:05,330
Do you think I look like Mi-rae?

629
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:08,041
Do I look like Gangnam beauty's mom?

630
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,378
Yes, you girls look very much alike.

631
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,130
My goodness.

632
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,260
What do you think
about your brother's place?

633
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,303
I'd like to take a look inside, too.

634
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,266
I'm glad that you two grew up
as affectionate siblings.

635
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,226
Let's go.

636
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,901
Who are you?

637
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,029
-Are you Woo-young's mom?
-No.

638
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,324
No, I'm the mom of Woo-young's junior.

639
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,285
She lives near here.

640
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,620
Near here?

641
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,456
Are you Mi-rae's mom, by any chance?

642
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,880
Nice to meet you.
I'm Do Kyung-seok's mom.

643
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,174
He lives with Woo-young.

644
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,758
He and Mi-rae are collegues.

645
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,928
Do Kyung-seok?

646
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,055
Oh, that pretty-looking man?

647
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,474
Do you know him?

648
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:10,061
-Yes.
-We know him. It's good to meet you.

649
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,230
It's nice to meet you.

650
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,986
I didn't think I'd meet with other parents
once my daughter entered college.

651
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,989
I'm glad we met like this.

652
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,162
Unfortunately, I couldn't be there
for my kids when they were younger.

653
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,082
Watching Mi-rae grow must've
made you very happy.

654
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,876
She's kind and smart.

655
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,670
She also knows how to party.
She's a great dancer as well.

656
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,088
Oh, really?

657
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:43,011
I wondered who gave Kyung-seok
his good looks.

658
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,846
He surely got it from you.

659
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,017
You look so young for your age.

660
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,811
You really are a Gangnam beauty.

661
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,607
My mom didn't get any plastic surgery.

662
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,734
What?

663
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,110
That remark about Gangnam beauty.

664
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,780
People say that to those who got
a lot of plastic surgery done.

665
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,064
Great work, everyone.

666
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,149
What you did today will take up
most of your time

667
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,651
if you join a perfume lab later.

668
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,028
Don't forget what you learned.
Write down everything, okay?

669
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,613
-Okay.
-Okay.

670
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,705
KOO TAE-YOUNG

671
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,125
Can we meet later today?
Just the two of us.

672
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,226
Hello, Woo-young.

673
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,979
-Are you done?
-Yes.

674
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,606
Where are you?

675
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,151
I'm near the Kelun lab.

676
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,028
Where shall we meet today?

677
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,447
Why don't we eat something good
after the movie?

678
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,365
Today?

679
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,453
Right, okay.

680
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,733
-Did you make a reservation?
-Yes, under Woo-young.

681
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,859
Please wait.

682
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,199
The movie was so good.

683
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,369
That man's dance was hilarious.

684
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,620
Yes, it was so funny.

685
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,082
-Shall we grab a drink too?
-Drink?

686
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,709
You know that I'm a lightweight.

687
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,211
Right.

688
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,591
I'm actually worse than you.
I can't drink more than two shots of soju.

689
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,053
Really? I had no clue.

690
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,472
There are many other things
you don't know about me.

691
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,891
I don't like pork belly

692
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,476
and I get cold very easily.

693
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,396
I don't like studying

694
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,940
and I like you.

695
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:37,245
I was worried that things might get
awkward for you at school

696
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:38,997
so I've been hesitant, but...

697
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,336
I've had a crush on you
since we first met.

698
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,594
I guess you had no clue.

699
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,225
Why?

700
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,310
What?

701
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,479
Why do you like me?

702
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,942
Because you're pretty.

703
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,574
You always look grumpy,
as if you're bothered by something.

704
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,701
But I notice the subtle differences.

705
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,623
Today, it must be something very serious.

706
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:27,295
If it's that serious, it must be about
something that's never happened before.

707
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,340
It's about a girl, right?

708
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,513
It must be. Hey, are you seeing someone?
Who is it?

709
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,890
It's none of your business.

710
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,017
I wonder who.

711
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,603
Who's the girl that melted
this guy with the cold heart?

712
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,398
-What's the problem though?
-She said she can't date me.

713
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,275
What? She even rejected you?

714
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,612
She said she can't,
not that she doesn't like me.

715
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,031
I don't understand.

716
00:58:59,118 --> 00:58:59,994
Is she ugly?

717
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,455
-No.
-Is she pretty?

718
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,915
You don't like pretty girls.

719
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,043
She's neither pretty nor ugly.

720
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,087
She's just herself.

721
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,007
You like me just because I'm pretty?

722
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,928
All guys like pretty girls.

723
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,388
You're my type.

724
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,600
Are you surprised?

725
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:24,727
Yes.

726
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,109
I didn't know you were
that kind of person.

727
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,112
What?

728
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,865
Did you start liking me
just because of my looks?

729
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,996
What's wrong with being attracted
to good looks?

730
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,373
Are you not attracted to handsome guys?

731
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,459
It doesn't have to be about good looks.

732
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,045
Some like girls with double eyelids.

733
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:54,632
Some are attracted to skinny girls
or girls with fair skin.

734
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,718
Everyone has a type, you know?

735
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,681
I told you I got plastic surgery
all over my face.

736
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:07,520
I used to be very ugly.
To the point that you can't imagine.

737
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:10,398
So?

738
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,151
So why?

739
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,697
I don't understand why you're
attracted to someone like me.

740
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,948
Someone like you?

741
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,535
You're attractive.

742
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,418
It is partially because you're pretty.

743
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,962
But my feelings for you continue to grow.

744
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,797
I like the way you are.

745
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:59,989
To me, you're just yourself.

746
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,873
Coming home after confessing makes me
feel so awkward.

747
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,047
Go in.

748
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,841
Okay.

749
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,177
Goodbye.

750
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:00,925
Woo-young.

751
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,222
-Woo-young.
-Mi-rae.

752
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,227
-Woo-young.
-Catch your breath first.

753
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,021
Well.

754
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,402
You told me to think about it

755
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,239
but I...

756
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,119
I'm sorry.

757
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,585
Okay.

758
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,337
I got your point.

759
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,631
I'm sorry.

760
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,468
To be honest, I was prepared for this.

761
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:46,512
I'm very sorry.

762
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,805
Don't be.

763
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:49,766
You don't have to feel bad.

764
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,101
To tell you the truth

765
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,646
I'm not too sure if I can do this to you.

766
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,025
Who am I to reject you?

767
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,193
Don't say that.

768
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,323
It's not like some people don't
deserve to be loved

769
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,493
or aren't allowed to be attracted
to someone.

770
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:10,953
There's no such thing.

771
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,247
No one has the right to laugh at you.

772
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:15,833
Moreover,

773
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:20,505
when you're attracted to someone,
you can't control your feelings.

774
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:30,181
Good luck with Kyung-seok.

775
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:36,145
I knew a long time ago that you two
liked each other.

776
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:38,564
But...

777
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,361
I still wanted to tell you
how I feel about you.

778
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,323
Kyung-seok is a good guy.

779
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,116
Plus, he's handsome.

780
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,411
No, it's not that.

781
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:56,374
You're handsome too.

782
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,626
That's really not the reason.

783
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,797
You're a great person.

784
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:08,469
I'm okay.

785
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:09,846
Don't cry.

786
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,694
Just follow your heart, Mi-rae.

787
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:27,697
So, don't cry.

788
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,232
MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY
