1
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,221
Kang Mi-rae.

2
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,030
By any chance,

3
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,825
did you go to Jaryong Middle School?

4
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:17,952
What?

5
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,792
What should I do?

6
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,588
Forget it.

7
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,758
You have the same name
as a girl I used to know.

8
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,229
I knew it.

9
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,232
He is that Do Kyung-seok.

10
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,117
There are those blessed ones
who turn any streets into their runway.

11
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,912
The most handsome guy at
Jaryong Middle School, Do Kyung-seok.

12
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,707
Even when he was just walking

13
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,336
or participating in an earthquake drill,

14
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,593
and even when he broke his arm.

15
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,722
The world practically revolved around him.

16
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,189
And the most legendary one of all was

17
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,154
Do Kyung-seok walking in the rain.

18
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,165
Then one day, he transferred
to a different school,

19
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,293
but everyone at my school knew him.

20
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,738
But I don't know you.

21
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,074
I'll pretend I don't know you.

22
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,468
Oh, my goodness. He's grown up
into a fine, good-looking guy.

23
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,597
Do you still see my old face
from how I look now?

24
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,974
I can tell at a glance
that this girl is Sua.

25
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,977
She must be much prettier in person.

26
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,814
He won't ask me again, right?

27
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,816
Will I tell a lie?

28
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,278
I'll end up making a fool of myself
if someone else went to our school.

29
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,407
I must say, you're on par with her.
You're pretty too.

30
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:08,122
Hey, are you listening?
I'm asking you what I should do.

31
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,709
Hey, he won't recognize you.
Even your dad couldn't.

32
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,836
How will Do Kyung-seok
recognize you?

33
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,131
He probably just wanted
to strike up a conversation.

34
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:18,841
Hey, wait.

35
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,844
What if he's interested in you?

36
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,555
-Hey, what are you talking about?
-By the way,

37
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,183
did something happen with him back then?

38
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,227
How does he remember you?

39
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,854
Oh!

40
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,848
He was the same as everyone else.

41
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,351
Attention, please.

42
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,063
Patient Lee Hyun-joo,
please come to the ICU.

43
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,191
-Can you tell me where Seo Yoo-jin is?
-Okay, let me check.

44
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,361
My goodness.

45
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,322
What did he throw at you?

46
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,449
Why did he do this?

47
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,868
Does it hurt a lot?
Kiss it better for you?

48
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,077
Yes.

49
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,747
-Here?
-No, it's here.

50
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,918
Yoo-jin, does it feel better now?

51
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,503
Of course.

52
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,547
Gosh, I'm so upset.

53
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,716
Hey, Kyung-seok, you're here.

54
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,636
Hey, can you take her home? It's too late.

55
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,056
Did you get kicked out?

56
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,308
He got kicked out?

57
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,768
Why?

58
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,603
What's he saying?

59
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,522
I told my dad that
I'm going to start my own business.

60
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,274
What about the money?

61
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,069
What? What business?

62
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:03,905
A pub.

63
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,865
You're going to start a pub?

64
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:11,037
My goodness.
Then what about your dad's inheritance?

65
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,538
I won't be getting anything.

66
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:17,460
I'll let you drink free beer every day.

67
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,713
Yoo-jin, I wasn't just
fooling around with you.

68
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,548
I was even thinking to marry you.

69
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,469
I can't believe
you're proposing to me right now.

70
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,305
Stop right there.
The guy should be the one to propose.

71
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,017
But this was not what I was expecting.
We can't see each other anymore.

72
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,560
Ah-reum.

73
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,064
Ah-reum.

74
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,859
Ah-reum, wait. Please hear me out.

75
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,903
-Taxi.
-Ah-reum.

76
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,822
Let me go.

77
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,282
Were you dating me
because of my family's money?

78
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,952
You lost my trust.

79
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,413
I didn't know you were this reckless.

80
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:57,208
It's not because I'm materialistic.
It's because you're irresponsible.

81
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,424
Hey, Ah-reum.

82
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,306
You're completely fine.
Why were you lying in bed?

83
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,393
You lost my trust.

84
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,649
How can you make a joke
when I just had my heart broken?

85
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,151
Then...

86
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,489
Will I kiss it better for you?

87
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,241
Gosh.

88
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,284
Let's go.

89
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,874
Hey, Kyung-seok. Kyung-seok!
Wait for me.

90
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,838
She'd always tell me
that she doesn't want to go home.

91
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,967
And every morning, she'd say,
"Yoo-jin, I dreamt of you last night."

92
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,805
I can't believe
I'm still so bad with women.

93
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,475
How many more women do I need to date?

94
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,227
I guess I should date a bit more.

95
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,148
Isn't it too early
to be thinking about dating other women?

96
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,192
Where are we going?

97
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,943
To your school.

98
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,362
Let's go.

99
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,494
When did you buy this place?

100
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,788
The remodeling will begin
starting tomorrow.

101
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,624
Hey.

102
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,709
Drink up.

103
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,004
Congratulations on entering university.

104
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,549
Oh, that's bitter.

105
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,473
It's okay with your dad? Isn't he
upset that you chose chemistry?

106
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,099
Of course he's upset.

107
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,851
Then why did you choose it?

108
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:40,853
I don't know.

109
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,941
I chose this major
because he kept telling me not to.

110
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,571
Are you curious about your mom?

111
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,617
Let's not talk about the dead.

112
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,747
She's dead to me.

113
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:17,807
My goodness gracious.

114
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,308
Are you Mi-rae?

115
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,228
Gosh, stop it.

116
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,939
Hello. Have you been doing well?

117
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,234
Yes, we've been doing well.

118
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,486
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

119
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,614
I think Hyun-jung should get something
done as well.

120
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,824
Stop talking nonsense.

121
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,328
I'll be off now. I'll see you guys later.

122
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,246
Okay.

123
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,748
-See you later.
-Bye. See you.

124
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,500
-Bye.
-Bye.

125
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,045
My gosh, she looks pretty
from the back as well.

126
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,923
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

127
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,178
She has some guts.

128
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,640
How could she get plastic surgery done
without telling her dad?

129
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,352
You better not do anything behind my back.

130
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,278
It's too loud.

131
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,409
Who attends entrance ceremonies
these days?

132
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,665
If I take photos with Kyung-seok, people
will comment on how different we look.

133
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,419
My gosh, what was that? My goodness.

134
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,719
I'd like to report an accident.

135
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,513
No, I'm fine.

136
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,433
But I'm not sure about the people
inside the car.

137
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,311
Please make it quick.

138
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,105
I can't afford to be late
to my deliveries.

139
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,317
There's no need for that.
You must've been surprised.

140
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,736
-Pardon?
-You can just go.

141
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,822
-But still...
-It's okay.

142
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,533
"Tell people how nice I am."

143
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,702
"Take a good look at my face."

144
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,788
"I'm Congressman Do Sang-won."

145
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:05,998
Thank you.

146
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,750
Keep working hard.

147
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,585
-Thank you.
-No problem.

148
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,841
Nice shot.

149
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,552
Let's go.

150
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,364
I'm near your school.
I'm almost there.

151
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,284
Mom, when did Dad receive
his medical checkup?

152
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,204
How's his blood pressure? Is it normal?

153
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,457
Don't worry.
Where are you?

154
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,091
What are you talking about?
What do you mean you can't find Dad?

155
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,057
Excuse me, are you a student here?

156
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,101
Pardon?

157
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,646
I'm here for
my daughter's entrance ceremony.

158
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,816
Is there a nice restaurant nearby?

159
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,443
A place where girls like to go.

160
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,825
Huh? Wait a minute.

161
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,080
You're the girl I talked to last time.
Right?

162
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,626
I'm Mi-rae's dad. She majors in chemistry.

163
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,629
We talked on the phone
because you answered Mi-rae's phone.

164
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,090
Yes.

165
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,719
That was me.

166
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,388
See? I knew it.
Yes, I remember your voice now.

167
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:49,018
I was so surprised
because you sound just like my daughter.

168
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,563
What a coincidence.

169
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,827
Dad.

170
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,541
Dad, I'm Mi-rae.

171
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,376
What?

172
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,256
Dad, I'm... I'm Mi-rae.

173
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,092
It's me, Mi-rae.

174
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,598
I'm your daughter, Mi-rae.

175
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,314
What...

176
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,316
Dad.

177
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,658
Mi... Mi-rae...

178
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,077
I'm sorry Dad.

179
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,747
I had to keep it a secret
because you were so against it.

180
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,632
Honey. Tae-sik.

181
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,768
Dad.

182
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,604
Honey.

183
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,064
Honey.

184
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,156
Dad.

185
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,496
Dad.

186
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,083
Dad.

187
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,297
Dad.

188
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,757
I'm sorry.

189
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,769
I don't know you, miss.

190
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:21,170
Nice. That looks great, Mr. Congressman.
I'll take a picture now, then. 1, 2, 3.

191
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,672
Great. Kyung-hee, stand a little closer.

192
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,468
All right, one more shot. 1, 2, 3!

193
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,429
Oh, you look dashing, sir.
I really mean it.

194
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,891
Yes. Kyung-hee, stand in the middle.
Here we go. 1, 2...

195
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,479
Hello?

196
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,360
Yes, hold on.

197
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,698
She's been appointed
as the CEO of Kelun Korea.

198
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,869
Talk about it another time.

199
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,497
Can you at least gain some weight?

200
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,210
My dear son,
we have to take a photo together.

201
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,545
-Look at the camera.
-I love you.

202
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,799
All right, I'll take another photo.

203
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,218
My, I can't get over
how dashing you look, sir.

204
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,887
All right. Oh, it was my face. There.

205
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,273
Don't worry.

206
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:27,361
I'll have a talk with your dad
when I get home. Okay?

207
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,670
Hurry up!

208
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,464
-Hurry. Come on!
-My goodness.

209
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,009
Why? What is going on?

210
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,429
Mi-rae, you're here too.

211
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,806
Ta-da.

212
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,808
Whose camera is it?
Did you buy it?

213
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,518
No, I borrowed it.

214
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,771
We should take some photos together
now that I own this taxi.

215
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,441
I no longer have to share it
with other drivers,

216
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,110
so I want to hang a photo of Mi-rae
inside my taxi.

217
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,781
Mi-rae, come stand here.
I'll take a pretty photo of you.

218
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,619
Dad. Can you not take a photo of me?

219
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,958
I want to hang your photo inside my taxi.

220
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,295
Seeing your face will keep me
energized throughout the day.

221
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,007
It's my wish.

222
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,428
All right, then.

223
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,723
-Come on.
-Come stand here.

224
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,851
Not there. You should stand right here.

225
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,020
-We're ready!
-Here we go.

226
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,776
Honey, get out of the frame. Come on.
I'll take a photo of Mi-rae first.

227
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,488
All right. Mi-rae, smile.

228
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,156
-Give me a pretty smile.
-Smile.

229
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,700
1, 2, 3.

230
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,703
All right. One more time.

231
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:03,999
Okay, here we go. 1, 2, 3.

232
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,778
Isn't that Mi-rae?

233
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,781
-Hello.
-Hi.

234
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,117
Are you two in this class too?

235
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,493
-You too?
-Yes.

236
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,328
That's great. Let's sit together.

237
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,958
We studied so hard to get into university,
and we now have to study more.

238
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,669
Are we writing up reports now?

239
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,338
I didn't know
when I was registering for my courses,

240
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,924
but it really hit me
on the day of my first class.

241
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,972
Mi-rae! Hi.

242
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:04,059
-Mi-rae is here.
-Mi-rae.

243
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,480
-Hi, Mi-rae.
-Hi.

244
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,607
-Sua!
-Sua!

245
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,276
-Hyun Sua is here.
-Hi.

246
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,277
Hi.

247
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,863
Hello.
Hi. Hi, Mi-rae.

248
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,448
-Hi, Sua.
-How have you been?

249
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,951
-Good.
-I'll see you later.

250
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,621
-Jung-hyun.
-Hey, you.

251
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,791
-She's like a celebrity in our department.
-I know, right?

252
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,626
Sua is making my life difficult.

253
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,296
Why do guys keep asking me
to set them up with her?

254
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,463
Mi-rae.

255
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,759
Hello.

256
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,805
-Sit here. I saved this seat for you.
-Pardon me?

257
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,744
Are you taking General Chemistry too?

258
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,955
No, I got an A in this class
in my first year.

259
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,041
Oh, I see.

260
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,044
Then what are you doing here?

261
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,546
What do you think? I came to see you.

262
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,383
What on earth is he doing here?

263
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,177
Does he have to retake this class?

264
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,804
It looks like
he's trying to hit on Mi-rae.

265
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,476
Right, when Mi-rae walked in earlier,
I could see how much she stands out.

266
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,644
Really?

267
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,314
But as soon as Sua walked in...

268
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,942
What? Did you call me?

269
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,361
No, no. I didn't call you.

270
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,614
I'm such an idiot.

271
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,368
I wanted to call you but I realized
that I never asked your number.

272
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,663
I see.

273
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,332
What's up?
Did the entrance ceremony go well?

274
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,376
Yes.

275
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,587
If there's anything you don't understand,
feel free to ask me.

276
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,589
I got an A in General Chemistry.

277
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,219
Also, I have all the exam notes
for this class.

278
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,554
This professor's exams are the same
every year.

279
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,640
Do you know what I mean by "exam notes"?

280
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:10,269
It seems like you can only see Mi-rae.
We'll need them, too.

281
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,981
Figure it our yourself.
Mi-rae and I have a special relationship.

282
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,691
Me?

283
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,651
We did couple drinking.
Didn't we?

284
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,116
Oh, shall we have lunch together
at the cafeteria?

285
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,284
Sorry?

286
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,412
Today's menu looks amazing.
Girls, you'd better not come.

287
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,047
Mi-rae, let's sit over there.

288
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,646
This is on me, so eat everything you want.

289
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,440
Thank you.

290
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,739
How is it?
The food at our cafeteria is quite good.

291
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,241
-Yes, it's good.
-Good.

292
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,419
You know...

293
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,131
I asked you if I can like you.

294
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,509
I think you've had enough time to ponder.

295
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,930
Should we not talk about it at school?

296
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,850
Shall we go to a nice bar in the evening?

297
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,980
-Do you want some water?
-No, it's okay.

298
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,191
-I'll use the restroom quickly.
-All right.

299
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,780
Gosh, why is she acting all naive?

300
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,078
Hello, Chan-woo.

301
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,662
Sua.

302
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,585
You're in the same General Chemistry class
with us, right?

303
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:03,173
Oh, I'm not actually in the class.
I just stopped by to see you guys.

304
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:07,636
I was wondering
why you were retaking a first-year course.

305
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,805
Oh, were you curious?

306
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,517
-Have a seat. We can chat.
-Sure.

307
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,274
Isn't somebody else sitting here?

308
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,361
-It's Mi-rae. She went to the restroom.
-I see.

309
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,366
Chan-woo, you like Mi-rae, don't you?

310
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:34,454
Well, I think all of you are adorable.
That includes you.

311
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,874
Just talk casually to me.
You don't need to be so polite.

312
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,213
I think you and Mi-rae
will make a cute couple.

313
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,008
Well, we're not there yet.

314
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,137
I'll be cheering for you.

315
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,931
Although I'm a little sad.

316
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,308
What do you mean?

317
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,105
Nothing. Never mind.
I should get going now.

318
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,481
Hey, wait.

319
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,360
What did you mean by that?
Why are you sad?

320
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,611
Well...

321
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,029
Oh, sorry.

322
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,577
I can sit here, right?

323
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,373
Hey, how could you ignore
all of my messages for three days?

324
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,000
I guess you've been busy.

325
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,543
I don't check my phone often.

326
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,337
Goodness,
that's why you don't have a girlfriend.

327
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,506
Come on, tell me.

328
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,217
To tell you the truth,

329
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:34,306
I was quite smitten by you
at the freshmen orientation.

330
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,433
What? Me?

331
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,186
Don't take it too seriously though.

332
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,939
I'm over you now,
so you don't need to care too much. Okay?

333
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,483
No, wait.

334
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,200
Gosh.

335
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,202
I can't believe...

336
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,041
I'm sorry.

337
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,836
I just want to think of you as my senior.

338
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,885
I just want to think of you as my senior.

339
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,223
I just want to think of you
as my senior...

340
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,271
-Chan-woo.
-Hey, Mi-rae.

341
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,565
Let's just be friends. Okay?

342
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,400
Pardon?

343
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,946
What I said to you was a mistake.

344
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,325
I think I was confused.
I actually like someone else.

345
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,369
I'm sorry for making things complicated.

346
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,455
I'm sorry.
You understand what I'm saying, right?

347
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm sorry if you took it seriously.
Is everything okay?

348
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,627
You can finish your meal.

349
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,853
Sorry, my mistake.

350
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,856
Is it you again, you jerk?

351
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,152
What did you just say?

352
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,779
"Mistake"?

353
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,574
Do you want to die?

354
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,451
Huh? My gosh.

355
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,288
This is a mistake as well.

356
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,294
You must want to die.

357
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,213
I'm done eating.

358
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,258
You must be crazy for a beating. Hey!

359
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,181
-What's wrong with him?
-My gosh.

360
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,561
You little jerk.
I'm going to kill you.

361
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,774
-Chan-woo.
-What are you doing?

362
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,860
Are you taking his side? Move!

363
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,432
Chan-woo, what are you doing?

364
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,851
-Let go of me!
-Everyone's staring.

365
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,104
-What's his problem?
-My gosh.

366
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:31,483
-Why is he always causing trouble?
-Let me go.

367
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,943
You better consider yourself lucky.

368
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,404
I'm going to kill you
the next time I see you. Okay?

369
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,407
Why is he always causing trouble?

370
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,410
What a joke. Isn't he the jerk
from chemistry?

371
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,621
-What was that?
-Oh, gosh.

372
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,206
Are you okay?

373
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,343
My gosh. I'm sorry.

374
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,239
They were fighting like crazy.

375
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,784
Do you know what Chan-woo's nickname is?

376
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,497
It's SOJ. It stands for son of a jerk.

377
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,585
You need to be careful of guys like him.

378
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,797
Sua, you better watch out as well.

379
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,757
Okay.

380
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,970
What? Oh, okay.

381
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,681
Oh, well...

382
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,809
What do you think about having chicken
and beer after class?

383
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,436
Are you up for it?

384
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:56,317
Well, I'm up for it if Sua is.

385
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,654
My gosh.

386
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,246
Sorry, my mistake.

387
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,624
How cute.

388
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:16,963
What?

389
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,300
She thinks you're cute.

390
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,263
Sua, there you are.

391
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,057
-Hello.
-Hi.

392
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,811
Can we talk outside in private?

393
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:33,938
Sure.

394
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,982
I'll wait for you outside.

395
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,121
What I'm about to tell you comes from
the bottom of my heart.

396
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,498
So please hear me out.

397
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,542
-Okay.
-Right.

398
00:29:54,918 --> 00:30:00,173
Guys always have their own ideal type
of girl in mind.

399
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,883
The same goes for me.

400
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,970
When I first saw you,
my heart almost dropped to the ground.

401
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,557
I'll be straightforward with you.
You're my ideal type of girl.

402
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:14,687
You're the only one I was interested in
ever since the freshmen welcoming party.

403
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,856
You might not believe me,

404
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,778
but I tend to get really shy
around the person I like.

405
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:26,282
But now that
I know you feel the same way about me,

406
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,577
I was wondering
if you'd like to start going out with me.

407
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,455
Then what about Mi-rae?

408
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,959
I was nice to her
because she was in my team,

409
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,169
and she did good in the talent show.

410
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,046
You were the only girl I liked.

411
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,466
Sua.

412
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,348
I'm really grateful
that you think of me that way.

413
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,391
Okay.

414
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,310
But can you give me some time
to think about it?

415
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,605
Yes, of course. You should think about it.

416
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,817
Although it won't be a problem
since we both like each other.

417
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,403
Anyway, well...

418
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,323
I'll wait for your call.

419
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,368
Bye.

420
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,416
Sua.

421
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,254
Did anything happen?

422
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,756
What? What do you mean?

423
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,218
Is Chan-woo hitting on you?

424
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,762
No.

425
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,182
He just said
what all the other seniors said to me.

426
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,977
He told me to let him know
if I need any help.

427
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,773
Who else said that to you?
Jung-hwan? Jin-wook?

428
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,448
I can't believe he made a fool out of me.

429
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,826
Do I still seem like a joke to everyone?

430
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,040
Remember when I asked you
if it'd be okay for me to like you?

431
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,459
-Chan-woo.
-Hey, Mi-rae.

432
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,462
What I said to you was a mistake.

433
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,425
I think I was confused.
I actually like someone else.

434
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,037
Are you okay?

435
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,129
Are you okay?

436
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,551
I was looking for you
because I was worried.

437
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,764
I heard Chan-woo and Kyung-seok
had a fight at the cafeteria.

438
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,643
I heard Chan-woo even pushed you.

439
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,396
Did you get hurt?

440
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,982
No.

441
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,776
What happened?

442
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,738
I thought things were going well
between you and Chan-woo.

443
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,619
What's going on?

444
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:18,871
I don't know.

445
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,208
He asked me to go out,
but then said it was a mistake.

446
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:26,879
Is that why Kyung-seok got mad
and fought with him?

447
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,050
No, they fought
because Kyung-seok made Chan-woo trip.

448
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,261
I see.

449
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,848
Do you...

450
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,685
have a crush on Chan-woo?

451
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,145
No.

452
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,273
Not at all.

453
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,484
I'm so relieved that
he doesn't actually have feelings for me.

454
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,654
Yes, don't let it bother you.

455
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:56,993
Have you heard?
Chan-woo's nickname is SOJ. Son of Jerk.

456
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,788
He should behave himself as a senior.
Why does he have to bother freshmen?

457
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,623
He's so annoying.

458
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,047
Just forget about it.
Don't take it to heart.

459
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,465
You have me, you know.

460
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,926
I have you?

461
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,429
We'll be late for our class. Let's go.

462
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,223
Okay.

463
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:24,103
If he bothers my friend again,
I'll teach him a serious lesson.

464
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,813
"My friend"?

465
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,274
Friends must help each other.
Aren't I right?

466
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,152
Yes, thanks.

467
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,990
You just smiled. Do you feel better now?

468
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,912
She's an angel.

469
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,458
Yes, I'm totally fine now.

470
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,797
Hello, I'm Yeon Woo-young.
I'll be helping you with your experiments.

471
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,763
First, I'll explain
how the experiments will work.

472
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,890
After that, you'll split up into teams.

473
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,811
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

474
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:11,651
You'll do all experiments in teams.
Each team will consist of 5 to 6 students.

475
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,654
You'll be graded as teams,
so please help each other out.

476
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,282
Let's split you into teams.
We'll do a random draw.

477
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,911
I can't believe we have to do
team experiments in this class.

478
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:25,414
Gosh, I really hope I can team up
with someone I know.

479
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,500
-I heard this is hard.
-Somebody I know.

480
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,129
Someone I know, please.

481
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,298
Team 3

482
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,511
Mi-rae, are you in Team One?

483
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,346
No, Team Three.

484
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,473
Won-ho, are you in Team Three?

485
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,643
I was worried. Thank goodness
one teammate is someone I know.

486
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,895
Gosh, you idiot.

487
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,649
I hope there's a pretty girl in our team.

488
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,903
Hey, Won-ho. Are both of you in this team?

489
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,656
-What are you doing here?
-What?

490
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,576
I was hoping a pretty girl would join us.
Why you?

491
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,578
-Are you dumb?
-Whatever, Ji-hyo.

492
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,373
You're the type to go off the grid
when we have a group assignment.

493
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,875
Shall I teach you a lesson?

494
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,084
I want to live.

495
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,548
I bet Won-ho will enlist in the army
after getting dumped by a girl.

496
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,719
You'll be a total outcast
when you join the military, you idiot.

497
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,721
-Totally.
-Okay.

498
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,849
Are you in Team Three too?

499
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,767
-Yes.
-Me too.

500
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,020
We're in the same team, then.

501
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,271
-Really?
-Yes.

502
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,568
Is Sua the last one to join our team?

503
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,694
Is this Team Three?

504
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:44,952
This is amazing. All the celebrities
of the first year are in our team.

505
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,704
-"Celebrities"?
-Yes.

506
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,081
You and Kyung-seok are very famous.

507
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,627
So is Mi-rae.

508
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,091
Each team leader
needs to guide the team members

509
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,927
and make sure to submit the reports.

510
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,180
What should we do?
Are there any volunteers?

511
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,851
How about Mi-rae?

512
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,228
Me?

513
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:14,398
She seems very mature,
so I think she'll be a great team leader.

514
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,735
I'm not sure.

515
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,403
I'll just do it.

516
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,618
Then I'll be our note taker.

517
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,082
Do we need a manager?

518
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,340
It's that girl,
the celebrity of Hankook University.

519
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,384
She's really pretty.

520
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,969
She's already so famous.

521
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,638
Guys at other schools
are asking me about Hyun Sua.

522
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,765
-Hyun Sua?
-Yes.

523
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,185
I see.

524
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,785
I like soda too.

525
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:13,541
What are you good-looking people
doing here? Are you two dating already?

526
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,335
Please stop.
He hates hearing things like that.

527
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,714
Sua, what guy wouldn't want to date you?

528
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,055
Can you give me that?

529
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,975
Buy one with your money.

530
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,646
I was just kidding.

531
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:41,152
They're just standing, and yet
it looks like a scene from a movie.

532
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,571
They're making our school
look like a film set.

533
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,531
It'll be crazy
if they actually date.

534
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,824
Right?

535
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,492
Yes, totally.

536
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,664
-Thanks for the drink.
-Mi-rae.

537
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,714
Let's have a quick talk.

538
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,471
What's going on?
A secret chat between just you and him?

539
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,890
We don't have any secrets.

540
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,516
Go on.

541
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,144
Okay.

542
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,983
What's going on?
What could it be about?

543
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,694
I'm not sure.

544
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,324
-This is yours, right?
-Yes.

545
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,411
-It was on the cafeteria floor.
-I see.

546
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,248
What?

547
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,126
Are you really not Mi-rae
from Jaryong Middle School?

548
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,755
The bus stop.

549
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,424
Pomelo.

550
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,020
Don't tell anyone.

551
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,898
-About what?
-What I used to look like.

552
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,527
Keep it to yourself.

553
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:11,992
Kyung-seok.

554
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,453
Do Kyung-seok.

555
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,289
See you.

556
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,351
Hey.

557
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,813
Are you wearing perfume?

558
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,898
KANG MI-RAE

559
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,029
Yes. Am I not even allowed
to wear perfume?

560
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,854
Will my undergraduate years end up
turning into another disaster?

561
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,150
Pomelo.

562
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:31,238
By the way,
how does he remember my perfume?

563
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,378
There will be a freshman week party here.
For your department.

564
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,547
I have so much to do.

565
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,305
Help me put this up.

566
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,600
I haven't found a part-timer yet.

567
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,396
Kyung-seok, please?

568
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,402
Kyung-seok, help me with this.

569
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,368
I must say, you're such a nice guy.

570
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,619
Shut it.

571
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,913
Although you're very rude to me.

572
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,749
I mean, you're nice. So nice.

573
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,799
By the way, who's that girl?
No way.

574
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,009
Are you interested in girls now?

575
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,972
Or was she hitting on you? Tell me.

576
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,184
Don't tell anyone.

577
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,812
What I used to look like.

578
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,482
Keep it to yourself.

579
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,405
-Are you an idiot or what?
-Hey.

580
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:58,367
That totally startled me. How could you...
You're not nice at all.

581
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,120
I take back what I said earlier.

582
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,250
Shall I...

583
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,670
just not go to the freshman week party?

584
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,258
Don't you worry.
He doesn't even care about you.

585
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,802
I mean, don't you know him?

586
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,681
But still, I'll be so uncomfortable.

587
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:23,809
Hey.

588
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,981
It's not like you spent all that money
and risked your life to get the surgery

589
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,899
so that you can keep avoiding people.

590
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,488
Right.

591
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:40,701
Or should I go ask him
for a favor in person?

592
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,205
How about you get close with him
and make him on our side?

593
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,128
It'll be more of a hassle
if things go worse.

594
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,381
Let's wait and see for now.

595
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,134
It's because you're anxious.

596
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,512
Still,

597
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:06,769
I have a friend in my department who'll
take my side if something happens to me.

598
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,562
Who is that?

599
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:11,607
Hyun Sua.

600
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,612
Have you become close with her?

601
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,447
Yes.

602
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,342
I'm telling you, he's interested in you.

603
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,886
-No way.
-This is really frustrating.

604
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,598
He should've returned the perfume
to you when we were there.

605
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,141
Why did he call you outside?

606
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,227
That's really not it.

607
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,123
-Mi-rae.
-Hi.

608
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,374
Hi, Mi-rae.

609
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,210
-Hello.
-Hi.

610
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,171
What is Kyung-seok doing over there?

611
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,632
The owner here is his close friend.

612
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,968
-Is that right?
-Hello.

613
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,469
-Hello.
-Hello.

614
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,304
This is on the house.

615
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,225
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

616
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,396
Welcome to the start
of the freshman week party!

617
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,315
-Hello.
-Welcome.

618
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,735
-Hi.
-Hello.

619
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,575
I care more about face than body figure.

620
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:48,120
It's a no for me if she's ugly
no matter how nice her figure is.

621
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,955
Face can be fixed.

622
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:54,793
Whatever. Sua. What do you care the most
when it comes to men?

623
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,670
Well...

624
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,966
I think personality matters the most.

625
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,556
-Great.
-What are you doing? Sit down.

626
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:09,683
What's that?

627
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,060
All the seniors are gathered around Sua.

628
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,441
How about we play the image game?

629
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,277
-Sure, that sounds fun.
-Let's play the image game.

630
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,362
-I'll go first. Let's go this way.
-Okay.

631
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,491
I'll start with a weak question.

632
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:29,745
Who do you think was most delinquent
in high school?

633
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,872
1, 2, 3.

634
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,458
Mi-rae has got all the votes.

635
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,169
It's not true though.

636
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,587
-Bottoms up.
-Bottoms up.

637
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:44,384
It's my turn.
Who do you think dated the most among us?

638
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,428
1, 2, 3.

639
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,433
It's me again?
I've never dated anyone.

640
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,228
-Alcohol is drinking me.
-I am drinking alcohol.

641
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,187
-Kang!
-Kang!

642
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:56,814
-Mi!
-Mi!

643
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,106
-Rae!
-Rae!

644
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,983
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

645
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,862
She's so cool. Mi-rae's good at drinking.

646
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,242
-Hey, it's your turn.
-Oh, right.

647
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,036
-What should I do?
-Gosh.

648
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,704
Hold on.

649
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,415
Are you okay?

650
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,042
Yes.

651
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,337
Well, I don't know.

652
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,965
Oh, okay.

653
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:26,051
Who do you think
kissed the earliest among us?

654
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,720
-You mean, kiss? Not a peck?
-Kiss.

655
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,639
1, 2, 3.

656
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,017
Kyung-seok, it's you.

657
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,519
-Wait, hold on.
-What?

658
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,979
Who voted for him?

659
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,064
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

660
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,483
Who voted for Mi-rae?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

661
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,694
It's half and half.
A couple drinking?

662
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,820
-Will do.
-Will do.

663
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:49,491
-Couple drinking.
-Couple drinking.

664
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,159
We'll just drink separately.

665
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,079
Yes, she's drinking
three times in a row.

666
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,164
I'll drink two shots then.

667
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,875
Wow.

668
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,255
He's really good at drinking.

669
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,172
Oh, Kyung-seok.

670
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,008
-Give me that.
-What?

671
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,262
Thank you.

672
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:13,140
Shouldn't he make a wish for this favor?

673
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,475
Great!

674
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,895
I think they really have something.

675
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,146
I guess so.

676
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,358
He's cool.

677
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,862
It's my turn now, right?

678
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:32,451
Who do you think got the most professions
from the opposite sex?

679
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,913
1, 2, 3.

680
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,044
Me? No, that never happened for me.

681
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:45,130
Come on. It's the image game,
not truth or dare.

682
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,302
-Drink!
-Drink it.

683
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,929
I drank a lot already though.

684
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:57,142
-Drink.
-Drink it.

685
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,479
Goodness.

686
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,773
Is he out of his mind?

687
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,651
Are you really going to do it?

688
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,740
Sua, can you stand up for a second?

689
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,534
Why?

690
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,875
Freshman Week Party
for Chemistry Department

691
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:27,589
Actually, I wasn't thinking of expressing
my feelings for you this soon.

692
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,801
But there were just too many guys
going for you,

693
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:33,345
so I thought
I should make you mine quickly.

694
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,307
-It's crazy.
-Goodness.

695
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,684
It's too corny.

696
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,189
I like you.
Would you like to go out with me?

697
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,487
What a man.

698
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,491
Great.

699
00:49:58,954 --> 00:49:59,955
I...

700
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:04,459
I never imagined
you'd think of me this way.

701
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:11,174
But I don't think I'm ready
to go out with someone yet.

702
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:13,885
I'm sorry.

703
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,473
Still,

704
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:23,812
we're good friends to each other.
We'll stay the same, right?

705
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,564
Right?

706
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,610
Of course, we're all friends.

707
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,239
Right?
Let's go take some fresh air.

708
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:38,535
Gosh, that idiot doesn't know
who she likes.

709
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,537
-Hope you become closer.
-Be friends.

710
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,247
Just be friends.

711
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,422
Goodness.

712
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,673
Are you having fun?

713
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,759
-Hello.
-Hello.

714
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,273
Face the reality.

715
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,233
I told you not to do it.

716
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,528
You think it makes sense
to profess to a girl

717
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,031
without giving her any gift
in such a generation?

718
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:20,577
Or prepare some balloons and flowers
and try again.

719
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,871
I'll help you out.

720
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,628
-Do you remember my name?
-Of course, I remember it.

721
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,798
Because your voice sounded nice
when you introduced yourself.

722
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,342
How about fried chicken
and beer after class?

723
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:41,223
Well, I'm up for it if Sua is.

724
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:44,893
How cute.

725
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,146
What?

726
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,024
You cute boy.

727
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,402
Okay?

728
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,492
Okay.

729
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,203
"Okay."

730
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,626
It'll be awesome
if they become a campus couple. Right?

731
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,461
I guess so.

732
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,507
It was a joke.

733
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,679
Thanks for the drink.

734
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,600
Kyung-seok, that...

735
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,484
Sua.

736
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,989
you must be surprised a lot.
There are those strong-headed punks.

737
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:42,117
If it's uncomfortable, you may go first.
I'll take you home.

738
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,578
No, I'm all right.

739
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,246
Really?

740
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,584
How dare he try to hit on you, seriously?

741
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,794
I can't believe it.

742
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:57,007
Then again, being pretty
is a headache indeed.

743
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:01,720
I know. Sua's face looks like
it has been sculpted.

744
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,973
What? I didn't do
any plastic surgery though.

745
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,312
Mi-rae is pretty like a doll.

746
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,315
Her face and body figure.

747
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,155
-Right.
-Mi-rae's pretty.

748
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,198
That's right.

749
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,993
Mi-rae didn't do
any plastic surgery either.

750
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,507
Hey. You think it's funny?

751
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,385
What do you mean?

752
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:45,597
Is it fun?

753
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,683
You mean, the freshman week party?

754
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,977
Of course, it's fun.

755
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,314
The party?
I'm talking about your ridiculous act.

756
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,198
I don't understand what you're saying.

757
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,991
You're pretending like you don't.

758
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,379
Sua, are you crying?

759
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,673
-Why this punk...
-Don't cry.

760
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,467
-Why are you crying?
-What's wrong with you?

761
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,219
-Apologize right now.
-Apologize.

762
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,054
Kyung-seok!

763
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,311
I'm sorry.

764
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,356
I guess I did something wrong.

765
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,108
You did nothing wrong.

766
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,859
Apologize to her, punk!

767
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,196
Don't cry, Sua.
I guess he's mistaken.

768
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,452
Sua.

769
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,002
Hey, what's wrong with you?

770
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,755
Are you a fool or an idiot?

771
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,221
Why does that jerk behave
so rudely like that?

772
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,973
Let's not swear.

773
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,808
Can't you see the situation?

774
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:15,186
Are you taking his side because
he's handsome? Stop adding to it!

775
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,231
The girls aren't saying anything
about his terrible manner.

776
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,358
They're crazy about handsome looks.

777
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:24,946
You're crazy about pretty girls too.
You guys got so hyper when Sua came here.

778
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,532
Are you mad
that you're not a match to Sua?

779
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,450
What?

780
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,661
-Hey, don't bother them.
-Did you talk about me just now?

781
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,372
Girls need to serve military
and fix their attitudes.

782
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,667
Why are you bringing up military?
You haven't even served yet!

783
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,295
-I'm going to!
-Why don't you go now?

784
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,505
Did I enter an elementary school or what?

785
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,050
What's wrong? What happened?

786
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,636
Some girl was putting up a show. See you.

787
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,638
Hey, Kyung-seok!

788
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,561
I need to talk to you for a second.

789
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,780
What's wrong with him?

790
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,080
Sua.

791
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,589
I really didn't know. I'm sorry.

792
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,509
No, it's okay.

793
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,678
I should've told you first.

794
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:34,099
I know it's hard to tell
that kind of story first.

795
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,063
Why am I so slow-witted?

796
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,899
Sua. Are you okay?

797
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,036
Don't think about running away
like a coward.

798
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:02,669
The loser will give up on Sua like a man.
Understand?

799
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,092
Do you feel better now?

800
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,138
Yes, thank you.

801
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,683
Don't mention it.
I'm glad you feel better.

802
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,646
By the way, have you thought about it?

803
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,859
About our relationship.

804
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,156
Yes, I've given it some thought,

805
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:36,828
but I don't think
you and I can be together.

806
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,496
Why?

807
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:42,459
I think it'll be better for us
to stay as friends.

808
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,002
Why do we have to?

809
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:48,214
Is it uncomfortable to go out
with a senior? Let's make it a secret.

810
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,759
That's not the reason.

811
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,511
Then what is it?

812
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,722
What's the reason?

813
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:59,309
You said you liked me too.
Did I misunderstand?

814
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,020
That's not it.

815
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,857
I'm friends with Mi-rae.

816
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,233
What?

817
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:11,112
How can I go out with my friend's crush?

818
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,240
Sua, that's...

819
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,867
I told you. That's not it.

820
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,036
I'm sorry. I'll go first.

821
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:21,331
Sua, hold on. Sua.

822
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:22,957
Sua.

823
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,668
That's not...

824
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,640
Hey, calm down.

825
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,524
It's your turn. Drink it.

826
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,568
Are you giving up because you might lose?

827
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,990
Then give up on Sua.
Don't change words later.

828
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,661
Give up on what?
Is she an object or what?

829
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,662
What did you say?

830
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:04,123
You got rejected simply because
you were not good enough.

831
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,001
-What, you punk?
-Calm down.

832
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,921
What do you know about Sua?

833
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,676
If you play with Sua, depending on
that handsome face of yours,

834
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,054
I won't let it slide.

835
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:20,515
Understand?

836
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,736
You're too drunk. Let's hurry and go.

837
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,699
-Can I really go?
-Yes.

838
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,950
It's really fine.

839
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,453
It seems like
it will end soon though.

840
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:46,541
No, it might last for a long time
this way. You must be tired, so go.

841
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:47,875
Right, go home.

842
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,002
Still...

843
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,254
-Hurry and go.
-It's okay, so go.

844
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,552
Then I'll go first.

845
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,721
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

846
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,264
Bye.

847
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,075
Do you like me?

848
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,452
What?

849
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:25,288
Do you like me?
Do you want to go out with me?

850
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,581
No.

851
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:32,587
Then did you babble on to Sua
to stab me in the back?

852
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,588
What?

853
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:36,382
She says she can't go out with me
because you like me.

854
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,928
Who said that?
Because I've never said such a thing.

855
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:45,475
Then go tell her directly yourself that
you don't care if she goes out with me.

856
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,478
Why should I do that?

857
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,272
Hey, stop right there.

858
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:53,983
What are you doing?

859
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,194
Are you crazy?

860
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,989
-What did I do?
-What did you do?

861
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,908
You flirted with me first.

862
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,285
How dare you act like
you don't know, wench?

863
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,288
Did you think things would work out
for real?

864
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,666
People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

865
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,045
Gosh, you plastic monster.

866
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:26,557
How dare you swear at me?
What did I do so wrong?

867
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,102
What did I do?

868
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,021
Why that crazy... Do you want to die?

869
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,440
That crazy witch. Hey!

870
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,779
People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

871
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:43,449
Gosh, you plastic monster.

872
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,836
Hey, gosh.

873
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,869
Aren't you curious
what Mi-rae looked like in the past?

874
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:30,288
Mi-rae and Kyung-seok
went to the same school.

875
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,749
It's nothing to hide.
Why didn't they tell us?

876
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,625
Maybe he liked her.

877
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:38,045
If I didn't know, why should I ask her
about it when she didn't?

878
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,756
You don't look that thoughtless.

879
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,299
He gathered all the freshmen.

880
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:44,635
Tell Kyung-seok and Kyung-hee
that their mom wants to see them.

881
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,138
All the girls can leave
except for Kang Mi-rae.

882
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:49,807
Mi-rae.

883
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:50,808
Let's go.

884
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,435
What are you doing right now?
