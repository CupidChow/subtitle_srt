00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,500
Why do yours taste juicier than mine?

81
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,490
Why does it have a more pleasant aftertaste and why is it nicer to chew?

82
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:43,080
Why? Why? Why? Are you "Miss One Hundred Thousand Whys"?

So, looks like I don't have to taste your dish.

Quickly tell me why!

85
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,560
First of all, you removed the prawn tails, while I kept them.

86
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,660
This way, my dish looks better in appearance.

87
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,660
Next, I shelled my prawns in ice water

88
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,700
to keep them looking translucent and from oxidizing.

89
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,230
I also added lotus seeds.
(TN: Lotus seeds are also known as fox nuts or Makhana)

90
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,800
As prawns and peas are both squishy and mushy,

91
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,570
they lack texture,

92
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,730
but lotus seeds can add some crunch to them.

93
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,670
And the last trick is...

94
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:26,090
my livestream audience, listen carefully.

95
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,930
Before serving, I turned up the flames

96
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,000
and cooked them for

97
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,460
three seconds more than Lin Xiaoyu.

98
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,090
Don't underestimate three seconds.

99
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,920
They make a big difference

100
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,160
in both the taste and temperature.

101
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,660
That's where the difference lies.

102
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,730
I've actually known for a long time

103
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,100
- that you…
- Is it because you follow Jiang Qianfan?

104
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,930
Yes. I know you're not on good terms with him.

105
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,530
At that time,

106
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,830
Montgomery chose him for the Future Star Competition, and not you.

107
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,060
That's right.

108
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,090
If he had chosen me,

109
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,080
everyone would have considered me a legend.

It should've been me delivering the eulogy at Montgomery's funeral instead of Jiang—

111

You started learning from Montgomery before he did.

112
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,520
Why did things turn out that way?

113
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,990
You would have to ask Jiang Qianfan about that.

114
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,120
I would also like to ask him, but now's not the right time.

115
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,680
I won't get the truth from him even if I asked him now.

116
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,460
I know Jiang Qianfan better than anyone else.

117
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,350
He's a very competitive person.

118
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:00,220
By right, he shouldn't have taken Evil Dragon Princess as his apprentice.

119
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,590
I still haven't figured out why he did this.

But it's almost

dinner time. How is it that you're going fishing now?

Didn't you notice the weather today?

147
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,970
In such good weather, the water temperature rises,

148
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,830
and the Mandarin fish will come up from deep waters to search for food.

149
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,790
I‘ve got to fishing now if I want to make an authentic sweet and sour Mandarin Fish.

It's indeed a good choice to go fishing in this weather.

Carry the box for me.

167
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,700
- There's the speakers too.
- All right!

168
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,600
Jiang Qianfan, open the door.

169
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,340
Kesong! Lin Kesong!

170
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,880
- Hello.
- Beautiful Sister.

171
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,000
- Where's Lin Kesong?
- Miss Lin is—

172
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,940
She's practicing.

173
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,760
What's the situation?

174
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,770
Lin Kesong called me last night to say that you won't let her eat.

175
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,170
So you're here to condemn me for my crimes because she called you last night?

176
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,990
That's right. I'm here to condemn you. Let me see her.

177
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,570
You know what her level is. She'll have to use the next month

178
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,000
to intensely study what she would normally do in a year.

179
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,600
Use a month as a year?

180
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,330
Even if she doesn't sleep in the next month, she'll only be able to use it as two months.

181
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,750
All right, cut the crap. Quickly, let me see her. I'm taking her out for good food.

182
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,030
You... Are you not leaving until I let you see her today?

183
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,470
That's right.

184
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,110
Fine. Come with me.

185
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,630
Lin—

186
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,460
Lin Kesong!

187
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,580
Lin Kesong!

188
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,500
Where's Old Lin?

189
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,520
Didn't you bring me up here to see her? Where is she?

190
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,190
Nina!

191
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,730
Lin Kesong's missing. Check over there.

192
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,640
Okay.

193
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,200
Lin Kesong!

194
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,280
- Mr. Jiang.
- Did you find her?

195
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,230
I’ve checked and she's not there.

196
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,740
What exactly is going on?

197
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,470
Little Bun.

198
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,570
Nina, I'm going to look for her.

199
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,250
Immediately notify me if she comes home first.

200
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,330
Okay, Mr. Jiang.

201
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,570
I'm going to change now. Do you want to come with me?

202
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,430
Then, go look for her!

203
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,100
Let me know if you have any updates.

204
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,620
- How much is it?
- ¥160 ($25.15 USD).
- I've transferred it.

205
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,720
- Thank you.
- Mister, please wait a moment.

206
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,060
Take care, take care.

207
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,320
- Uncle. I'm here.
- Kesong, you're back.

208
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,640
Well, can you help me pay for the taxi fare?

209
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,060
- Sure.
- I don't have my phone or any money with me.

210
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,780
Sure, go on in.

211
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,490
- Then, I'll go in first!
- Don't worry, your uncle has money.

212
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,630
Mister, how much is it?

213
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,830
Slow down.

214
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,810
Look at you.

215
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,950
So, you snuck out.

216
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,290
You should still give Mr. Jiang a call.

217
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,360
Otherwise, he'll worry if he can't find you.

218
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,280
I don't think he cares about whether I'm alive or not.

219
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,230
Jiang Qianfan is indeed ruthless,

220
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,380
but you should still let him know of your whereabouts.

221
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,160
What if he calls the police? Wouldn't that be troublesome?

222
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,100
Hello? Hello?

223
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,570
Lin Kesong, where are you?

224
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,790
I'm getting food outside. I'll be back after I'm done. Bye.

225
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,300
Hello?

226
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,280
All right. Thank you!

227
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,630
So, what now?

228
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,710
You want another bowl of noodles?

229
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,600
I can't eat anymore.

230
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,150
You should be full.

231
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,440
Otherwise, I'd have to take you to the hospital for a stomach checkup.

232
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,000
Is Xiaoyu in the back? I'll go hang out with her.

233
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,630
Go ahead.

234
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,390
- Bye-bye!
- Take it easy.

235
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,520
This child.

236
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,190
I'm back! Xiaoyu!

237
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,550
So, you still remember to come back?

238
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,030
I missed home.

239
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,470
You really have no shame. This is my house, not yours.

240
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,260
What's wrong?

241
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,360
Are you angry? Because of Jiang Qianfan?

242
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,410
Didn't you say you didn't mind?

243
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,800
How about this?

244
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,570
If you really like him so much,

245
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,250
why don't I beg him to teach us both, okay?

246
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,870
Stop being pretentious. You're feeling so smug now, aren't you?

247
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,580
To think that you've worn my hand-me-downs since we were young.

248
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,300
That's because... you're taller.

249
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,480
Is it you who's sly, or is it me that's too naive?

250
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,920
I should've seen through you long ago. Then, I wouldn't have been used by you.

251
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,420
One's heart really is unpredictable. It seems that anyone is capable of lying to me, including my family.

252
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,340
What nonsense are you talking about? I'm your sister. Why would I lie to you?

253
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,330
You didn't really come to Shanghai for Song Yiran.

254
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,680
You're actually here for Jiang Qianfan, right?

255
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,250
Your relationship with Jiang Qianfan isn't as simple as you say it is, right?

256
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,740
You even pretended to hate Jiang Qianfan during the auditions.

257
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,440
You really are a great actress.

258
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,170
You clearly know how I met him.

259
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,740
Do you have to say it so insultingly?

260
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,330
Get lost if you don't like what you're hearing!

261
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,810
Check the garbage for the next two days. Make sure to separate the food waste and recyclable waste.

262
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,020
- Got it.
- All right, get back to work.
- Okay.

263
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,790
Kesong. What...

264
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,490
- Uncle, I'll get going.
- You…

265
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,150
Did Xiaoyu say some hurtful words to you? I...

266
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,030
No.

267
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,410
I should head back. Take care of yourself.

268
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,350
Am I really as scheming as Xiaoyu says I am?

269
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,360
Why do I always feel that I'm not smart enough

270
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,690
to understand all that's going on around me?

271
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,390
What can I do so that Xiaoyu isn't upset with me?

272
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,020
Should I purposely lose to Xiaoyu during the competition?

273
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,250
That's just wishful thinking. With her level, I'll never beat her.

274
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,740
What should I do?

275
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,510
You look so familiar.

276
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,150
One, two.

277
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,800
Stop. Do it when we get home. There are lots of people here. It's embarrassing.

278
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:39,440
Tell me why you looked so miserable after leaving your uncle's house.

279
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,060
As it so happens, I've encountered this before.

280
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,400
Have you heard of Boris before?

281
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,460
One of the Future Star Competiton mentors?

282
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,360
He's actually my senior brother.

283
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,880
During that time, Montgomery chose me instead of him to take part in the Future Star Competiton.

284
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,460
So he hates me too.

285
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,510
What did you do then?

286
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,510
I won the competition.

287
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,100
Then, doesn't he hate you even more?

288
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,070
What else am I supposed to do? Let him ridicule me for my incompetence the rest of my life?

289
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,650
Will that help the situation?

290
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,760
Lin Kesong, listen to me.

291
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,580
A pat on the shoulder is not enough for others to listen to you.

292
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,510
You have to be strong and powerful.

293
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,750
You have to become the winner.

294
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,510
You're definitely not talking about me.

295
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,850
Old Lin, where have you been?

296
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,250
What are you doing here?

297
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,010
Where were you?

298
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,260
I can't seem to escape Mr. Jiang no matter where I go.

299
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,860
Fine, Jiang Qianfan. How dare you lie to me?

300
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,210
What did he lie to you about?

301
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,380
He said you were missing. So, I spent almost half the day looking for you around Shanghai.

302
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,310
You can continue chatting. You might as well sit on the sofa too.

303
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,540
Haven't you wasted enough time?

304
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,360
I'll go get changed first.

305
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,650
Wait.

306
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,590
Old Lin, why exactly did you run away?

307
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,680
You can tell me if you're unhappy here.

308
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,220
Since I'm here, he won't be able to keep you here.

309
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,740
I…

310
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,090
What? You're not made for this at all.

311
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,460
Just happily be a foodie with me. Come on.

312
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,800
You're the one not made for this!

313
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,900
Little Bun.

314
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,130
Sister Nina. This is…

315
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,230
Mr. Jiang asked me to prepare this for you.

316
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,420
Jiang Qianfan personally asked you to prepare this?

317
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,870
Of course. Is there anything else you need?

318
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,560
I don't need anything else.

319
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,210
All right. Then, enjoy your meal.

320
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,020
How did you know I would be looking for you?

321
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,410
Do you have a question for me?

322
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,950
How are you going to punish me?

323
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:40,070
I can't help but feel uneasy because you haven't told me yet. I feel anxious.

324
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,350
I wasn't going to punish you anymore,

325
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,120
but since you're asking me so sincerely…

326
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,720
I'm going!

The highly anticipated Future Star Cooking Competition

347
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,320
has announced their final eight contestants and their mentors.

348
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,860
They are Victor and his mentor, Mrs. Quentin.

349
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,290
Lin Xiaoyu and her mentor, Boris.

350
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,560
Lin Kesong and her mentor, Jiang Qianfan.

351
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,030
Blu and his mentor, Huang Shi, and

352
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:19,290
Shin Goto and his mentor, Huggins.

353
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,970
They have announced the contestants.

354
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,530
It looks like Jiang Qianfan has made his decision.

355
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:55,140
Mother, if you have a flower that

356
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,290
you've waited for so long to bloom,

357
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,810
but it bloomed for someone else,

358
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:03,240
- what would you do?
- That clearly means it doesn't belong to me.

359
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,930
- I'll give it my blessings.
- But I can't do it.

360
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,540
I'd rather cut it and let it wither in my vase.

361
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,030
Elise.

362
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,000
Who wants to try my new dish?

363
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,620
Victor's honey chicken roll.

364
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,220
Darling, don't you think it's weird to have a chicken roll for afternoon tea?

365
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,070
You're the organizing committee's favorite to win the competition. Don't be so nervous.

366
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,370
Me? Nervous?

367
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,440
In the entire competition, I'm only interested in Jiang Qianfan.

368
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,350
Mother, to make this chicken roll,

369
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,680
I first blended truffle, foie gras, and chicken thigh meat into mousse,

370
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,530
then stuffed it inside the chicken skin and spread rosemary and honey on it before baking.

371
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:54,170
- I can only say that nothing is more enticing than this.
- Of course.

372
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:58,890
Only good food can likely cheer up your sister now.

373
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,930
My beauty who is as sorrowful as rosemary, please come to the "restaurant" with me.

374
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,700
Thank you.

375
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:13,050
It is reported that Evil Dragon Princess is undergoing secluded training with her mentor, Jiang Qianfan.

376
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,180
Can secluded training turn Evil Dragon Princess

377
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,570
into a dragon slayer?

378
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:25,170
Jiang Qianfan, you are overconfident.

379
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,080
Mr. Boris, I beg you to also

380
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,200
train me behind closed doors.

381
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,000
Are you scared?

382
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,940
I, Boris, have defeated so many Michelin star restaurants.

383
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,390
What's my secret for success?

384
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,100
I use a

385
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:05,430
spear to strike their weakest point.

386

”Little Feather," you can't follow other people's footsteps.

387
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,710
You need to go at your own pace

388
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,580
while preventing your opponent from advancing.

389
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,590
Come, let's go intimidate them.

390
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:37,200
Hello everyone, I'm Lin Xiaoyu. On behalf of my mentor, Boris, I would like to

391
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,010
officially "declare war" on Jiang Qianfan.

392
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,390
My mentor, Boris, and Jiang Qianfan were fellow apprentices under the same chef.

393
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,120
So, whatever he knows, Boris also knows.

394
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,060
And I know too. Ham with Matsutake.
(TN: Matsutake is a luxurious Japanese mushroom)

395
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:03,650
Sister, Jiang Qianfan has never taught you this, has he?

396
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:21,450
Jiang Qianfan, I'm coming from hell to look for you.

397
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,930
Spare no effort in dealing with me.

398
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,590
Don't disappoint me.

399
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,620
Xiaoyu's mentor is your senior brother?

400
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,730
Then, why is Xiaoyu doing this?

401
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,440
You don't need to know why. You just need to know that

402
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,940
Xiaoyu and Boris together make a very strong team.

403
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,810
Then, hurry up and teach me some secret tips and tricks.

404
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,130
Xiaoyu has always been more capable than me.

405
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,630
Although I've known this since I was a child,

406
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,510
but I still don't want to disastrously lose to her. That'll be too embarrassing.

407
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:02,520
All right, but the more anxious you are, the more you need to slow down.

408
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,620
Here, continue with the push-ups. When time's up, go back to measuring salt.

409
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,400
Don't even think about adjusting the timer!

410
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,550
- You are here, Li Yan. Please come in.
- Sister Nina.

411
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,190
This is essential oil for the diffuser.

412
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,390
I was going to tell you it's running out, but you brought more already.

413
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,350
Miss Quentin has a good memory.

414
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,820
That's right, where's the master?

415
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,520
- In the kitchen, of course.
- Okay.

416
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,150
- Thanks Sister Nina.
- Sure.

417
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,530
Come in.

418
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,520
It's done, Mr. Jiang. We're just in time for the latest session.

419
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,600
When is it?

420
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,670
Today.

421
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,450
- That's great. Deliver it to him at once.
- Okay.

422
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:09,430
Mr. Jiang...

423
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,540
Can I speak to you privately?

424
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,500
Just say it here.

425
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,980
Okay.

426
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:26,050
Last time, that was my fault. I promise it won't happen again.

427
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,910
Li Yan, I didn't dismiss you because you've worked hard for me over the years,

428
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,950
but you should know that I hate being lied to.

429
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,340
- Yes, but I—
- Say no more.

430
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,460
I know you have your reasons.

431
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,820
All right. Go now.

432
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,390
Okay.

433
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,560
What did he lie to you about?

434
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
He said you were married.

435
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,630
- Has everyone arrived?
- Yes.

436
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,480
- Serve the cold dishes first.
- Okay.

437
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,530
I'll notify the kitchen.

438
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,780
Hi. Are you Mr. Song Yiran?

439
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,920
Yes, I am. Are you the one looking for me?
