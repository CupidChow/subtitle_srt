9
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,140
This activating collateral oil may help.

10
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,770
Older Sister Nina, fortunately, you are here.

11
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,560
Otherwise, I would be alone and terribly tormented by him.

12
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,710
In the past, I would rub this on him too.

13
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,600
His degree of strain, everywhere, was more serious than yours.

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,260
To be like him, how much has he suffered?

15
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,660
Little Bun, I think you should pass your foundation before you talk about this again.

16
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,260
It's still a long way for you to become like him.

17
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,260
I know.

18
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,530
Older Sister Nina,

19
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,260
- where's your home?
- Malaysia.

20
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,130
I would go back home twice a year.

21
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,860
Are you married?

22
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,310
My mother gave birth to seven children. I'm the eldest.

23
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,290
The youngest brother in my family is 16 years younger than me.

24
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,800
My father is an alcoholic.

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,940
He is drunk every day.

26
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,360
He doesn't care about the family.

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,670
Since I was young, I have followed my mother

28
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,090
to take care of the family and my younger siblings.

29
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,360
I wanted to go to school, fall in love,

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,460
and leave that family.

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,520
But when I looked at how young my siblings were,

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,960
and how they relied on me, my heart went soft.

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,530
I should set aside my life and continue to take care of them.

34
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,730
It's been tough on you.

35
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,900
I dare not look back.

36
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,240
I couldn't figure out how to shoulder this burden.

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,450
After my siblings grew up,

38
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,680
my parents passed away.

39
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,620
I registered with an overseas employment agency.

40
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,100
I wanted to take a look overseas.

41
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,760
Hence, I was with Montgomery's home, and then Oliver's home.

42
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,390
Do you want to get married?

43
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,990
Not anymore. I never think about this.

44
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,990
Oliver is just like my younger brother.

45
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,220
I want to see him marry and have children. I want to help take care of his children,

46
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,490
but looking at this, my wish seems to be uncertain.

47
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,090
Don't say this.

48
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,100
He doesn't have a good temper,

49
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,530
but there's probably still hope.

50
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,020
Furthermore, I can take care of you in the future!

51
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,730
Don't talk nonsense. I can take care of you both.

52
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm happy that you both need me.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,960
In the future, perhaps, you would take work away from me.

54
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,560
Okay, Older Sister Nina.

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,330
Can you help me to flip the pan and participate in the competition?

56
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,600
I can't do that!

57
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,200
Dad, we are on our way. We should arrive in about two hours.

58
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,240
Get ready to set out! Drive to Jiamei Road.

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,760
Via Shenjiahu Expressway, Liankang Expressway,

60
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,670
Kangrui Expressway. The entire journey is 244 miles.

61
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,400
It takes about 2 hours and 19 minutes. It's a long-distance drive.

62
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,550
It's tough for you, Dear.

63
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,790
What's the big deal about this road?

64
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,490
It's just that I'm feeling slightly unwell.

65
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,980
What? What's wrong with you?

66
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,600
I took a course in management training.

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,430
After its conclusion, my legs didn't feel comfortable.

68
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,030
It's normally fine for me to walk or run.

69
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,270
It hurts when I step on the accelerator.

70
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,100
There's a kind of excruciating pain.

71
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,860
Is this urgent? Why don't we go to the hospital later?

72
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,770
No. It's not necessary.

73
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,000
It's just that there's a strange feeling in my neck.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,700
Look. It's usually not a problem when I surf the net.

75
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,220
I can't endure the pain now.

76
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,790
Dear, my dad wants me to go home.

77
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,070
There's something he needs me to settle.

78
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,000
Moreover, can you bear to let me go alone?

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,350
Also, my dad has been nagging and saying it has been a long time since he met you.

80
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,510
Plus, I miss him.

81
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,580
This air conditioner, seriously. It's blowing till my eyes are dry.

82
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,330
Why can't I sleep?

83
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,460
Thinking of how he was a meter away from me last evening,

84
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,450
and the scent of his breath blending with the essential oil,

85
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,510
it was very unique and warm. It was so manly.

86
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,950
I can't describe this feeling.

87
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,530
I seem to be addicted to this scent.

88
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,680
It must be the scent of the essential oil.

89
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,940
How can a man smell so nice?

90
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,270
I'm doomed. I can't sleep when I smell this scent again.

91
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,340
I seem to miss that scent!

92
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,960
Little Bun, don't be restless.

93
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,670
Let's do this. I will light the aroma lamp for you.

94
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,960
There's one in Mr. Jiang's room too. I would light it for him every evening.

95
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,700
It's said that this essential oil has a calming effect. It's very effective.

96
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,310
Essential oil?

97
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,650
Don't waste it.

98
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,560
So noisy the entire day.

99
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,890
Lin Kesong! You have too much physical strength, right?

100
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,260
Dont sleep if you don't want to sleep, I want you to workout now!

101
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,360
Lin...

102
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,770
Where did she go?

103
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,830
Lin Kesong!

104
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,630

106
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,470
Lin Kesong! Lin Kesong!

107
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,350
Wake up.

108
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,840
- Nina! Nina!
- What's wrong?

109
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,130
- Call for the ambulance!
- Okay.

110
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,420
Sorry, you can't come in here.

111
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,850
Let me ask you. When you discovered the patient, did she consume any food or medication?

112
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,270
I cooked fried rice with ham, sausage, and vegetables too.

113
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,510
We ate that too and didn't have any problems.

114
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,400
She didn't take any medications. She's usually very healthy.

115
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,440
Does she have any past history of illnesses?

116
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,410
I'm not very sure,

117
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,790
but before she was taken to the hospital, there was an aroma lamp next to her.

118
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,260
Okay, I got it.

119
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,810
Apply the defibrillator

120
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,190
and 0.3 mg of Epinephrine muscular injection.

121
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,420
Qianfan, what happened?

122
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,880
Are you Mr. Jiang Qianfan?

123
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,620
I am. How is 	Lin Kesong doing?

124
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,100
She is not awake yet. Are you able to contact her family?

125
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,590
Contact her family? Is it that serious?

126
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,920
Yes. The patient was in contact with essential oil before passing out. We ran some tests on the essential oil.

127
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,850
We also did tests on Miss Lin.

128
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,910
We found it's the acetic acid linalool

129
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,380
in her essential oil that triggered her allergy.

130
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,300
It's very serious. We used some anti-allergy medication,

131
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,730
but it's not looking very good.

132
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,160
I have been using that essential oil for a long time. Why am I fine?

133
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,420
This is the notice for the family that stated that the patient is in critical condition. A family member needs to sign.

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,610
That's fine.

138

Okay, all right.

- Hello?
- Elise.

144
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,790
I'm sorry to disturb you so late at night.

145
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,050
I want to ask you something.

146
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,360
The essential oil you gave Qianfang last time. Was it from the same batch as the one you got me?

147
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:45,380
O-Of course, it was. Is there anything wrong? Is Oliver all right?

148
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,220
He's fine. It's Lin Kesong.

149
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,420
She is allergic to essential oil. She's in hospital. It's very serious.

150
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,430
What? How did that happen?

151
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,340
Don't worry. She's being treated by us.

152
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,540
I remember I checked your batch of essential oil. It was fine.

153
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,410
However, the linalool detected doesn't seem to be what she was allergic to this time.

154
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,480
That's impossible.

155
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,890
Nothing, I was just asking.

156
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,090
It's too late. I won't disturb you anymore. Good night.

157
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,730
What? This is...

158
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,240
It's you! You killed Kesong!

159
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,850
Sir, please be calm. Let go of him, Sir.

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,400
- It's all because of you!
- This won't solve anything. This is a hospital.

162
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,140
This is an accident. It has nothing to do with him.

163
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,300
It has nothing to do with you? Does it have anything to do with me then?

164
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,280
If I didn't agree when you took Kesong away, she wouldn't be lying there!

165
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,100
She was such a healthy child!

166

She's suffering like this. Don't you feel sorry?

Ankang dried fish. The requirement for timing is very high.

It has to be cooked as soon as it was taken out of the fish.

H-Hi, Eldest Brother?

Hello? Lin Feng, what's up?

197
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,680
My phone was having issues. So, it just dialed your number on its own.

198
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,980
There's nothing. I'm sorry. You rest.

199

Qianfan.

200
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,890
We have detected a substance in the essential oil that Lin Kesong was allergic to.

201
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,430
It's a slow poison.

202
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,730
It can destroy a person's nervous system slowly.

203
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,840
Is it related to how I lost my sense of taste?

204
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,640
Yes. Even though the official report is not out yet,

205
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,160
theoretically, this is what caused it.

206
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,900
Let me ask you.

207
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,690
Was this substance originally in the essential oil

208
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,640
or added by someone else?

209
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,930
It was added by someone else.

210
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,530
Rest assured, I have called the police.

211
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,670
I have suspected this essential oil because the sample that Elise gave me

212
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,610
didn't include this substance.

213
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,160
If it weren't for the accident,

214
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,930
it was very difficult to detect it.

215
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,500
This is not the point now.

216
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,820
The point is who wants to kill me.

217
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,530
No, the point is...

218
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,650
Since we know what this substance is, we have a treatment for it.

219
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,720
So, your taste could come back.

220
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,410
This is the only good news in the past few days.

221
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,670
Why aren't you happy then?

222
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,710
Should I be happy?

223
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,860
Elise bought the essential oil. Then Li Yan had it, and lastly, Nina.

224
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,510
It only went through three people, all of whom I am so close to.

225
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,020
One of them wants to kill me.

226
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,770
No.

227
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,620
They already killed my sense of taste.

228
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,720
Shouldn't I be afraid?

229
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,030
I believe this is not Elise or Nina's doing.

230
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,100
Is that right?

231
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,620
I won't trust anyone until the result of the police investigation is out.

232
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,720
That includes you.

00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,230
Take a photo of this.

236
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,300
Make a copy of the security camera footage.

237
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,820
Let me ask you, where did you get this essential oil?

238
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,080
Li Yan would deliver it every time it ran out.

239
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,400
How much do you use per day?

240
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,700
A few drops only. One bottle would last about two weeks.

241
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,230
Where do you usually put it?

242
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,120
I used to put it in the storage room, but it was too much hassle. The bottle is small, so I put it in my room instead.

243
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,160
The essential oil was made in the UK.

244
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,520
Oliver started using it in London about six months ago.

245
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,140
I bought it. However,

246
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,470
when we got to Shanghai, he was used to it.

247
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,490
So I asked the manufacturer to send them.

248
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,090
If I was busy, I would put Li Yan in charge of it.

249
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,950
So do you use it yourself?

250
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,400
No, I don't need it. I don't have insomnia.

251
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,520
Most crimes involving poison are for revenge.

252
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,880
So, the suspect's motive is very important.

253
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,990
From your understanding of Jiang Qianfan,

254
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,250
would Li Yan be angry at him?

255
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,590
Qianfan's temper is not great, but he's a great guy.

256
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,450
If he criticizes him, it's definitely for work. It would be for good reasons.

257
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,380
He treats Li Yan very well.

258
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,250
Rest assured. We will find the suspect.

Do you know this?

329

Sometimes, dangerous things

330

You look pretty tired. Haven't been sleeping well?

I haven't been sleeping well lately. I've been having nightmares.

Why did you want to see me? Can't we discuss this in the office?

It's awkward to ask you about this.

That's right. He told me.

Oliver, I suggested you use the essential oil.

408
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,700
I'm also the one who bought it. It's normal for you to suspect me, but...

409
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,090
I thought you would trust me unconditionally.

I want to trust you too,

I mean if... If the person who poisoned you

416
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,600
made a confession. Would you forgive that person?

417
00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:00,830
Never. That person made me lose my sense of taste. It's worse than killing me!

418
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,510
The scariest thing is it was all planned.

a person's nature is neither good nor evil but selfish.

If this thing has harmed you in the end, will you give the person a chance for this person to repent?
