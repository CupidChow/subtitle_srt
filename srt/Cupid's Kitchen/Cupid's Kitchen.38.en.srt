[Mueller's Future Star Culinary Competition]

10
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,340
Speaking of the original intent, I'd like to talk with everyone

11
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,920
about my original intent to hold

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,210
the Future Star competition.

13
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,520
Our competition has been held for 20 sessions.

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,090
We've insisted the particular format of having a mentor choose and teach an apprentice,

15
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,420
and let the apprentice participate in the competition.

16
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,330
The format originated from the philosophy of the Mueller's organizing committee,

17
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,080
because we believe culinary arts comes from experience.

18
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,750
It needs to innovate, but even more, it needs to pass on the legacy.

19
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,010
The mentor teaches and explains, the apprentice respects the teacher and honor the learning.

20
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,350
This is the foundation that will guarantee the progress in culinary arts.

21
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,890
Everyone must be thinking now, what is the original intent to become a chef?

22
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,440
It simply is to let someone, after eating a meal

23
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,540
and feeling warm, and sense beauty and joy.

24
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,410
It also coincides with the meaning of the sweet taste.

25
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,690
Today, we are at the competiiton

26
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,400
where a mention who used to hate the sweet taste

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,950
to the point where he rejected all kinds of sugar.

28
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,860
Who am I talking about? Raise your hand.

29
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,090
That's right. He is the one.

30
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,000
But, it's very gratifying that he has wakened up.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,210
We welcome your return.

32
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,330
Next,

33
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,970
let me announce the rules of the competition today.

34
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,720
First, the mentor and apprentice will coordinate in cooking

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,360
to complete a sweet dish.

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,760
Of course, we have a restriction here.

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,750
We are competing in Jiangnan.
(T/N: the region to the south of the lower Yangtze River)

38
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,240
So we should utilize the special food ingredients in Jiangnan.

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,240
Therefore, we've prepared glutinous rice and osmanthus.

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,750
Glutinous rice

41
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,760
originated in Tibet, China,

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,660
in the east part of the Himalayas.

43
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,370
It's now widely spread in southern China.

44
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,260
Glutinous rice was already planted and eaten in China

45
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,960
over 10,000 years ago.

46
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,550
These two are the foods with the most Chinese characteristics.

47
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,350
That's why, today, the two teams of mentor and apprentice

48
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,350
will use glutinous rice and osmanthus to make a sweet dish.

49
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,730
The time for the competition is one hour.

50
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,560
I now officially announce,

51
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,260
the competition starts.

52
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,250
Okay, thanks.

53
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,100
I feel confident. Don't worry.

54
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,880
Okay.

55
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,490
Go ahead.

56
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,590
He is probably estimating the cooking counter's length.

57
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,680
This is so unfair!

58
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,310
Isn't that old lady too embarrassed to compete?

59
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,570
She should cover up her eyes too.

60
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,160
Mr. Jiang is so disadvantaged.

61
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,500
If it's his own cooking counter, he would know where everything is.

62
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,250
But now?

63
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,610
Careful.

64
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,220
Go do your thing.

65
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,080
Take a look. Is it blended well?

66
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,960
It's good.

67
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,030
I thought Xiao Jiang

68
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,970
would only stand there and not able to do anything.

69
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,430
I didn't expect that he could do something.

70
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,590
It's still not good. Look.

71
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,250
Nonsense.

72
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,280
You do it first.

73
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,070
Here.

74
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,960
I'll do it. You do your thing.

75
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Stop. That's enough now. It's good.

76
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,600
It's so heart-wrenching to watch.

77
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,720
It's fine. I can do it.

78
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,850
Before the competition starts, I was surprised

79
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,820
what Victor would do without using the knife.

80
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,450
It turns out that he and Madam Quentin

81
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,710
are perfectly working together to make such a pretty dessert.

82
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,500
The Quentin family's strength really cannot be underestimated.

83
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,350
It's also full of imagination. Let's go take a look at the other team. Go.

84
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,040
Mentor Jiang QIanfan is making a glutinous rice ball.

85
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,570
Is it showing that blindness isn't affecting him as we thought?

86
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,860
Or, he has defeated darkness?

87
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,170
We don't know the answer. Go for it! Go for it!

88
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,110
This... This... This...

89
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,890
Is this baked?

90
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,810
I'm almost done. Wait a little for me.

91
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,030
- What's the matter?
- It's fine.

92
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,290
Want me to help?

93
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,260
It's fine. It's fine. Don't move. I'll get it.

94
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,540
How much time is left?

95
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,960
How much time is left?

96
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,500
Five minutes.

97
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,520
How much dough is left?

98
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,780
It's here, and here.

99
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,170
Here.

100
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,050
We can do it in time.

101
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,880
What's the matter?

102
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,540
I'm wondering.

103
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,060
If Mr. Jiang had chosen me as his apprentice,

104
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,950
would I be able to calmly finish this competition?

105
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,800
Why not? Of course you can.

106
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,740
I can't.

107
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,330
If my score is just a little bad,

108
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,990
my mood would rise and fall greatly.

109
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,690
It's either I scold Boris, or Boris scolds me.

110
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,480
The two of us never helped each other achieve.

111
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,820
For some time, I looked at myself in the mirror

112
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,720
and I looked scary.

113
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,460
Xiaoyu,

114
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,140
your gaze is much more gentle now.

115
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,870
Who says?

116
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,950
Will it do?

117
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,250
Look, look. It's good.

118
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,160
Still missing one.

119
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,520
Okay, Mom.

120
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,030
You are Jiang Qianfan. You should be fine.

121
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,200
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

122
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,750
Ten second countdown. Ten, nine,

123
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,500
eight, seven, six,

124
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,450
five, four, three,

125
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,220
two, one. The time is up.

126
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,060
It's fine.

127
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,000
Sorry.

128
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,560
I've arrived. Where are you?

129
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,690
Automatic locker? I see it.

130
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,700
Okay.

131
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,940
Three, nine, nine, nine,

132
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,000
zero, two.

133
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,320
It's open.

134
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,300
Yes, I got it. I'll let you know if it's genuine.

135
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,960
The judges are starting to score. Before the final result of the competition is revealed,

136
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,710
by custom, I'll interview the two teams of contestants.

137
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,380
Madam Quentin, you were born in England, but the food ingredients are Chinese in this competition.

138
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,870
How do you think you performed?

139
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,240
Pretty good. I'm familiar with glutinous rice.

140
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,020
In other words, I'm familiar with all the ingredients associated with desserts.

141
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,350
Do you have anything thing to say to Victor?

142
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,900
Yes.

143
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,770
When I was making the mousse and cream, I put in a little matcha.

144
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,140
Victor, I hope you will always be like the green tea

145
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,180
stay sober, and not get arrogant.

146
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,860
I understand, Mom.

147
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,960
That's truly sincere inculcation, Victor.

148
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,820
Do you have any innermost thoughts that you want to tell Madam Quentin?

149
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,490
There is an old Chinese saying, Lotus roots may break, but the fibers are connected.
 (T/N: Lovers may part, but still long for each other)

150
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,810
I like China, so I've decided to stay in Shanghai.

151
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,720
Mom, we will be far apart later.

152
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,510
Don't be unhappy. After all, we are connected by our common interest.

153
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,070
Mentor-mother and apprentice-son have a really touching bond. Next, let's interview

154
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,420
Mr. Jiang Qianfan and Miss Lin Kesong.

155
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,780
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

156
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,800
We all saw that your team didn't complete your work.

157
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,880
Do you have anything to say?

158
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,840
About the loss,

159
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,900
I can't find any excuse.

160
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,200
Sorry, I've disappointed everyone.

161
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,690
Especially to my partner, Miss Lin Kesong,

162
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,320
sorry.

163
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,020
Why are you saying sorry to me?

164
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,790
Losing your sight isn't your fault.

165
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,640
How hard you work,

166
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,390
how sad you are, they don't know but I do.

167
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,200
I'm already very happy that you can come with me today.

168
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,110
We've worked hard in this competition.

169
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,210
So we have no regrets, and nothing to be sorry for.

170
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,540
The ingredient for the competition today is osmanthus.

171
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,860
Osmanthus actually has a meaning of beauty and loyalty.

172
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,540
Just like how my mentor, Mr. Jiang Qianfan, is to me.

173
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:25,620
He is my confidant, my muse,

174
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,900
and my only teacher.

175
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,280
Thank you

176
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,040
for appearing in my life.

177
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,020
Jiang Qianfan!

178
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,660
Jiang Qianfan, you are the best!

179
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,960
I want to thank Miss Lin Kesong here.

180
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,790
But even more, I want to thank Mr. Jiang QIanfan.

181
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,900
I want to thank them for their attention to the Future Star Culinary Competition,

182
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,850
and their passion for it.

183
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,450
Of course, I'll also thank Madam Quentin and Victor,

184
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,650
as well as all the mentors and contestants in this competition.

185
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:42,410
Through your hard work, we see hope for the future of culinary arts.

186
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,860
This is really making me very touched.

187
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,810
However, in any competition, there is a result.

188
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,380
Because Mr. Jiang Qianfan and Miss Lin Kesong's team

189
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,590
did not complete their work,

190
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,340
they can only get second place.

191
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,000
The first place belongs to Madam Quentin

192
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,500
and Victor.

193
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,060
Thank you, and I also thank the organizing committee.

194
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,820
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

195
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,010
You have let me learn that the win or loss at a competition isn't important.

196
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,300
What's important is the journey. May I shake your hand?

197
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,130
Lin Kesong, I want to share this with you.

198
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,760
You deserve the trophy.

199
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,580
Everyone, this is the entire story of this competition.

200
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,300
Let us anticipate to meet again in the next session of the competition.

201
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,410
Take me to the back door.

202
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,680
But everyone is waiting.

203
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,440
I don't want to meet anyone. Take me there.

204
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,210
- What's the matter?
- Let's go.

205
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,580
Get in the car. Hurry!

206
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,910
Go.

207
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,230
This way. This way.

208
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,620
Careful with your head.

209
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,040
Drive, you don't have to come.

210
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,670
Where did they go?

211
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,230
The wolves are coming. Sit tight.

212
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,140
- Is that them?
- That's them. That's Jiang Qianfan.

213
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,390
- Hurry and come!
- Coming!

214
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,850
Why are you here?

215
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,580
It's because I'm Boris Rogoff. I really understand him.

216
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,880
If I've become like this,

217
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,730
I wouldn't want to see anyone, and will also go out the back door.

218
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,080
It's not as bad as he says. I want to leave first because I don't want to socialize.

219
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,770
Besides, we only got a zero score.

220
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,650
Haven't you got zero before? It's nothing.

221
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,980
At the worst, people will call us Zero Mentor and Apprentice. That's all.

222
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,400
I could fell that he was pretending to take it lightly, and also believed that it was nothing.

223
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,280
But later on, the reality proved that I was mistaken.

224
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,820
As proud as he was, he wouldn't restart from zero.

225
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,530
What is it?

226
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,990
It's sent from Paris.

227
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,370
You sit there first. Be careful.

228
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,180
It's probably the admission letter from Le Cordon Bleu, the French culinary school.

229
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,410
What does this mean? Didn't I tell you I wasn't going?

230
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,940
It's my wish. You can't refuse me.

231
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,910
So it's your wish, but you also can't ignore what I said.

232
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,340
It's because I didn't ignore what you said.

233
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,400
Didn't you say that you want to become the best chef?

234
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,160
Didn't you say that?

235
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,760
Let me tell you then.

236
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,770
You are probably still at least 100,000 hours away from your goal.

237
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,990
I can't teach you anything now, but you are a good seedling.

238
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,790
I have the duty to send you to a place that can teach you. Besides,

239
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,010
did I say you'll go by yourself?

240
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,530
- Who will go with me?
- I will.

241
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,790
Didn't I get a zero? Shouldn't I start learning from the beginning?

242
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,030
Is this true?

243
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,050
Of course it's true.

244
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,110
We are going to study in France together!

245
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,450
You need to help me with something first.

246
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,730
Don't tell anyone yet that I'm going to France.

247
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,800
At most just you and your parents can know.

248
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,700
I'm afraid if too many people, there will be unnecessary troubles.

249
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,460
I'm going to call my mom.

250
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,370
Hello, Mom.

251
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,260
[Congratulations to Lin Kesong and Lin Xiaoyu's excellent performance in the Future Star Culinary Competition]

252
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,770
Take this over there.

253
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,770
Try the salty taste. How is it?

254
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,820
Why did you put this in? I really don't get you.

255
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,090
This will bring out the fresh flavor.

256
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,520
Put a little more salt in.

257
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,490
Come, dumplings are ready.

258
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,900
This way, please.

259
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,150
Sit here. Sit here.

260
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,400
Just wait a moment for us to tidy it up.

261
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,550
Deliver this to the table.

262
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,220
Dumplings are coming!

263
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,190
Coming.

264
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,860
We really didn't know. You have good dishes, also good dumplings.

265
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,620
Enjoy eating. Everyone, enjoy eating.

266
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,660
They are not bad.

267
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,090
What would you like? Our dumplings are free today.

268
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,870
Dumplings are coming!

269
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,100
- How are the dumplings today?
- Not bad.

270
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,800
Our dumplings are free today.

271
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,620
Come, com.e Our dumplings are free today.

272
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,750
Sit over there.

273
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,400
Dumplings are here.

274
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,750
Kesong is going to Paris for a year and a half.

275
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,210
What will Xiao Jiang do?

276
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,000
He'll get a helper. Even if Kesong doesn't leave, he'd still need a helper.

277
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,500
Didn't Kesong say he doesn't want to see anyone?

278
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,510
If he is willing to come here, I'll take care of him.

279
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,540
Xiaoyu, we're out of fillings. Catch up.

280
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,320
Coming, Uncle Lin.

281
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,110
Blu, I tell you foreign chefs

282
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,680
aren't good. Your fillings can't catch up.

283
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,370
My dumpling skins can't catch up either. I need to get some more.

284
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,450
I can't catch up, that's why I called for help.

285
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,020
You have helpers?

286
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,620
- Come, come.
- Hello, Uncle Lin. I'm back.

287
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,030
Isn't this Comrade Champion?

288
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,070
What's the matter? Are you wanting to duel with our Xiaoyu?

289
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:26,220
Not this time, we'll duel next time. I'm here to help.

290
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,000
Blu told me that he is shorthanded, so I came.

291
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,240
I'm really thankful.

292
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,000
And this is?

293
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,190
Hello, Uncle. I am...

294
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,850
This is...

295
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,650
You two better not show affection. Go. Go boil the dumplings.

296
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,130
Wait. Wouldn't boiling dumplings be boring?

297
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,660
Didn't you say you know some tricks? Let's compare

298
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,380
who has more tricks. How about it?

299
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,140
I just know that you'd feel bad without a duel. Okay.

300
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,610
- I'll satisfy you.
- Go.
- Go.

301
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,640
- Go.
- Go.

302
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,090
You go together. You too.

303
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,590
Sour Soup Dumplings are here. Raise your hand if you want them.

304
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,250
Coming. Coming.

305
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,330
Here's yours.

306
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,910
Our handsome kitchen god has said,

307
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,610
they will make 20 different ways of dumplings.

308
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,370
Steam, boil, pan fry, deep fry. Everyone, eat all you can.

309
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:58,010
Xiao Lin, you are bringing two more plates? I'm really full and can't eat anymore.

310
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,080
That's right. If you can't eat anymore,

311
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,550
just go out to take a stroll. Come back to fight again.

312
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,960
It's delicious. Hurry and eat. These dumplings are really good.

313
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,890
Enjoy.

314
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,400
Thank you.

315
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,160
- It's delicious.
- Take a photo then.

316
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,800
[I'm in front of the restaurant. Can you come out for a moment?]

317
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,390
- Bye-bye. Please come again.
- Okay.

318
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,560
Hi, Boris.

319
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,090
Are you recovering well?

320
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,230
I won't have too big a scar.

321
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,620
Thank heavens.

322
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,150
But the doctor said my arm

323
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,430
will be scarred.

324
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,480
Sorry.

325
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,250
Don't say sorry. I actually feel bad when you say it.

326
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,310
I did it to myself.

327
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,950
But I think it's quite cool to have a scar on my arm.

328
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,200
I'll be an experienced woman.

329
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,520
You're great to be smiling.

330
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,120
- Xiao Lin, where is Xiaoyu.
- Sister Yu is over there.

331
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,130
Boris, be happy. Why are you so sad?

332
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,460
You'll always be my mentor.

333
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,380
When you say this, I feel ashamed.

334
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,220
You are a good talent, and you could have gone far.

335
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,960
But you were ruined in my hands.

336
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,430
When I learn to get along with this world,

337
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,940
it won't be too late if you want to acknowledge me as a mentor.

338
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,580
I think you've already learned. Just now, during the final competition,

339
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,260
you cheered for Jiang Qianfan. I was so surprised.

340
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,860
You made me feel touched.

341
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,940
You are the same.

342
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,950
I saw you were moved to cry a lot by Lin Kesong.

343
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,600
Are you leaving?

344
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,280
Yes.

345
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,260
Where to?

346
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,700
It's a secret for now.

347
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,400
Okay. Just tell me when you get there, so that I know you're fine.

348
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,980
Sure.

349
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,590
I also wish you the best to you and your large-eyed seal.

350
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,480
He is really good to you.

351
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,590
You are still giving nicknames to people now? Enough. Give me a hug.

352
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,320
Sorry, sorry.

353
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,650
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

354
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,000
Bye-bye.

355
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,930
- We've arrived. What do you want to eat?
- I want to eat big crabs.

356
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,650
I want to eat big crabs.

357
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,460
I also want to eat them.

358
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,250
Big crabs? Okay.

359
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,770
Let's eat big crabs today.

360
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,510
This restaurant's stuff is really quite ordinary.

361
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,220
Not just ordinary, they taste bad.

362
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,660
But the environment is good, with a good location.

363
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,070
I want to buy it to give to Victor. So I came to inspect a little.

364
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,010
Look at you.

365
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:10,150
You're about to return to England. It's not easy to finally get some time to eat with me.

366
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,280
You had to find such a place.

367
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,120
Why not let me find a place with good surroundings

368
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,540
with great food to let me treat you. Wouldn't that be great?

369
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,260
It's not like I'm not coming back. There'll be plenty of chances.

370
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,250
Oh yes, have you considered going to England to expand?

371
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:32,300
Your skill would attract many more people than you can imagine in England.

372
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,930
It would be a thousand times of what you get in your current restaurant, maybe even more.

373
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,690
Me? Going to England?

374
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,520
Forget it.

375
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,410
Why? Not interested?

376
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,820
I'm not interested.

377
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,650
I can only speak one English sentence.

378
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,400
Bye-bye.

379
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,290
I can say another line, thanks.

380
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,770
Even if I could speak more, I still wouldn't go.

381
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,410
I'm spent most of my life here. This is my home.

382
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,640
Young Sister,

383
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,520
is China not good?

384
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,850
Even your son wants to stay here.

385
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,590
Why won't you?

386
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,810
China has the market,

387
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,640
the opportunities,

388
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,180
and, this old friend is here.

389
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,930
Too bad that I was born in London.

390
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:37,060
I've always lived there. How can I leave so simply?

391
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,500
You are right.

392
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,640
Come. Let's drink then.

393
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,260
Okay.

394
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,780
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

395
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,480
Only six tables were reserved today, not even 30% of the restaurant.

396
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,850
After the competition, people saw Mr. Jiang couldn't do anything.

397
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,390
I think the reservations will be even less.

398
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,200
Damn.

399
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,620
You all listen well, even if there is only one customer left in Yuxuan,

400
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,660
you must give me 100% effort. Do you understand?

401
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,480
Okay.

402
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,360
Hurry and go work.

403
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,210
Xiao Pa.

404
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,940
Didn't you resign? What are you doing here?

405
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,300
Can't I regret? I want to change clothes.

406
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,660
Stop right there.

407
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,540
You're regretting? Let me tell you, no way.

408
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,130
Is Yuxuan a place where you can come and go easily?

409
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,730
No. It's just a resignation letter.

410
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,840
It's not even approved, and I was stopped.

411
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,490
Miss Quentin has agreed to let me stay. I've apologized to her.

412
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:49,580
- Don't delay me from changing.
- Aren't you embarrassed to mention Miss Quentin?

413
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:55,090
You actually submit your resignation when Yuxuan is at such a pivotal point. Aren't you ashamed?

414
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,490
Let me tell you. So you want to come back?

415
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,820
Mr. Jiang isn't here. I'm the one in charge in the kitchen. Do you think you can stay?

416
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,090
Don't you want to protect yourself?

417
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,930
Frankly, I do want to.

418
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,440
But I want to be more like Mr. Jiang to become a respected person.

419
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,880
If he wanted to protect himself, he wouldn't have gotten on stage.

420
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,150
But he went up there. Even though he lost the competition,

421
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,570
but I respect him even more.

422
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,190
Since we are talking about it, I may as well tell you what I'm thinking in my heart.

423
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,180
I've been thinking, and have realized a problem.

424
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,930
No matter how hard one person works, or how talented he is,

425
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,570
how capable can he be?

426
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:45,900
If I leave Yuxuan and go to the next restaurant,

427
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,130
I don't know what new problems will come at me.

428
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,960
Only when I become part of this loving group

429
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,680
and grow up together with everyone, that's when I'll feel truly secure.

430
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,760
Of course, the premise is that this group

431
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,370
must be cohesive and combative.

432
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,910
Fine. I hope that you aren't just full of talks,

433
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:18,750
but you can show us real action. We will be watching you.

434
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,580
I'm changing clothes.

435
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,530
Hello, Miss Nana. I'm Chu Ting Boutique's Xiao Song.

436
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,160
Here's how it is. The skirt that you previously ordered

437
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,280
has arrived in the store. When will be it convenient for you to come pick it up?

438
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,370
Okay. Okay.

439
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,760
Oh yes, there are some new pieces of Turqoise jewelry in the store now.

440
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,190
I think they'll match your skirt really well. You can try when you're here.

441
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,220
Okay. Okay. Thanks.

442
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,820
What are you thinking about?

443
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,450
Nothing much.

444
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:13,590
Forget I asked. Even if you want to tell me, I wouldn't want to listen.

445
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,060
Actually I was thinking of Old Lin.

446
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,840
I was thinking of her gaze when she was looking at Jiang Qianfan on stage.

447
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,460
I think if that isn't love, I really don't know what love is.

448
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,430
Anyway, she's never looked at me with that gaze.

449
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,460
I think I shouldn't meddle in there.

450
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,460
You've lost again?

451
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,090
No.

452
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,430
Actually, just a little bit. But it's really nothing.

453
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,750
It would be great if my boss will treat me to a hotpot meal.

454
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,580
That's easy. We can go now.

455
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,790
No, no, no. I'm still working. Wait until after work.

456
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,040
Considering how hard you are working, I've changed my mind.

457
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,170
I'll treat you to Yuxuan.

458
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,720
Why don't we go now...

459
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,590
Wait for after work.

460
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,130
Hello, Yuxuan Shanghai.

461
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,960
Thank you for your support. Thank you, Mr. Ma.

462
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,860
Hello, Yuxuan Shanghai.

463
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,910
[Reservation for Song party of 6 at 7.30 pm

464
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,730
Hello, Yuxuan Shanghai.

465
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,720
Take care of these details. Before the customers arrive,

466
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,060
get it all cleaned up. Okay? Don't let it happen again.

467
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,360
Everyone, good news!

468
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,170
I've already received three calls when it's time to take reservations.

469
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:37,330
We have three reservations already. Before Mr. Jiang lost his eyesight, this was the average.

470
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:40,430
There's even more to exciting news. Guess,

471
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,580
who was the first one to call?

472
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,560
Who?

473
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,620
That sharp-tongued food critic, Marco.

474
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,020
He said he wanted a big private room.

475
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,170
- It's him?
- After he saw the competition,

476
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,930
he wants to support Mr. Jiang.

477
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:55,150
This is great.

478
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,990
The phone is ringing again.

479
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,750
This is good.

480
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,650
Everyone, listen well. This great opportunity for reversal today

481
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,360
is created by Mr. Jiang.

482
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,920
I don't need to say it, everyone knows what a rare opportunity it is.

483
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,810
So everyone must exert your full strength to do your best,

484
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,800
cook the best food, with the best service, to repay those customers who come to our restaurant.

485
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,500
This is the only way

486
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,730
to deserve their support for Yuxuan

487
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,490
and support for Mr. Jiang.

488
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,620
No problem!

489
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,720
- Hurry up and work!
- Okay.

490
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,450
It looks like a small stand-alone villa.

491
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,920
There are even roses.

492
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,490
The left side looks like a garage.

493
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:44,130
Let me tell you. Actually, I got my license after graduating from college.

494
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,760
But I just never drove, so I don't know how to drive.

495
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,920
Then you should find the time to quickly practice.

496
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,430
Maybe I'll need you to drive me around in the future.

497
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,760
This sofa has a floral pattern.

498
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,090
You don't like that, do you?

499
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,150
It's good if you like it.

500
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,350
We can just change it when we get there.

501
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,990
I don't get how many bedrooms there are.

502
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:16,150
The more bedrooms, the better. If you want, you can take your parents there.

503
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,260
Really?

504
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,740
Of course.

505
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,660
There is even a yard.

506
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:31,400
Why do you have so many questions? Didn't you say you want a vegetable garden?

507
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,070
Once we are in France, you can buy some seeds and we can't plant them together.

508
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,110
Okay.

509
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,900
- How much is it?
- Oh yes.

510
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:50,550
It's less than a month before the school starts there. You should hurry and get your passport.

511
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:56,590
Aren't your parents going back to Wuzheng? Go back with them. Take care of everything and then come back.

512
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,420
What will you do then?

513
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,490
Don't worry. Someone will take care of me.

514
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,770
I'll go open the door.

515
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,300
Sister Nina.

516
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,620
Little Bun.

517
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,650
You are back! I've missed you so much!

518
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,630
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

519
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,640
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

520
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,740
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

521
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:53,000
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

522
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,980
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

523
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:01,070
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

524
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:06,820
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
