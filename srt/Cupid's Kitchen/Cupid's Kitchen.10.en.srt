[Episode 10]

9
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,860
Baby?

10
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,680
I'm here.

11
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,390
I fell asleep yesterday. What time is it now?

12
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,380
Eight o'clock. Yesterday you played till very late. I don't even know what time you went to bed.

13
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,610
Baby, are you hungry? I'll get breakfast for you to eat.

14
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,540
It's you who is hungry.

15
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,150
If you call food delivery, it's too slow. Why don't you change, and I'll accompany you to the restaurant downstairs to eat.

16
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,180
Hello, Guest. This is the breakfast that Director Song prepared for Miss Chu.

17
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,000
How come my brother never prepared for me before?

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,140
Sorry, about that I'm not too sure.

19
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,730
Of course, you are not sure. Come in.

20
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,050
Please.

21
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,260
Come here and eat.

22
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,750
Didn't we say we'll go out and eat? Why did you order so much?

23
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,260
My brother ordered these, especially for you.

24
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,960
He's such a good person.

25
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,570
Chu Ting.

26
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,360
I'll discuss something with you.

27
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,400
What is it?

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,790
I want to move out. What do you think?

29
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,610
Move out?

30
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,060
Will your brother agree?

31
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,490
What has it got to do with my brother?

32
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,880
Okay. Actually, it's related to my brother.

33
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,590
Because I don't want to be controlled by him anymore.

34
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,880
Okay, I'll listen to you.

35
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,520
You are my best, best, best girlfriend!

36
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,260
Let's eat.

37
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,550
They actually look like this when they are working.

38
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,330
It's totally not the same at my uncle's restaurant.

39
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,770
- What can I do? I can be an assistant. I'm very good as an assistant.
- Today you can't.

40
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,770
The work in the back kitchen cannot be learned just by using the eyes to look.

41
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,600
Then why did you ask me to come?

42
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,970
Follow me. Use your eyes to look.

43
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,280
Mr. Jiang.

44
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,650
Hello, Mr. Mark. This way, please.

45
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,140
- This place is not bad.
- It's not bad.

46
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,010
Look over there.

47
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,440
It must be good since Zhao Shuang recommended it. She comes here regularly.

48
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,220
Everyone, what would you like to drink? Water, sparkling water,

49
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,270
or champagne?

50
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,270
- Champagne?
- Okay.
- Champagne. Okay.

51
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,270
- I'll drink sparkling water.
- Okay.

52
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,610
I don't want to use this! Don't treat me like a kid.

53
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,970
- Okay. You are awesome.
- Awesome.

54
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,630
Everybody, wait for a while.

55
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,290
Serve the dish!

56
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,030
Mr. Jiang.

57
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,000
What's wrong?

58
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,580
I felt it was weird when I made it just now.

59
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,420
You try it.

60
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,840
How's it?

61
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,580
A little salty.

62
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,740
How much is little?

63
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,660
Compared to the salt at home, according to the amount that you put,

64
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,770
it's saltier by about 0.4 grams.

65
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,410
Elise, when did this salt arrive?

66
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,530
It's a new batch that arrived. The saltiness level is different, right?

67
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,000
Do you want to try it yourself again—

68
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,530
No need. You tried it, so it's accurate.

69
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,890
I'll go and tell them.

70
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,960
No need. I'll work my magic.

71
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,490
Jiang Qianfan style as always.

72
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,370
No desert. No sugar beverages.

73
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,750
Even the seasoning has no presence of sugar.

74
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,800
No sugar,

75
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,420
the chef is very strange. Why?

76
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,380
Maybe he feels it's not manly.

77
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,260
Sir, I'll take away the plates for you.

78
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,410
Okay.

79
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,310
Thank you.

80
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,560
This approach is very strange.

81
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,520
- Le Le, after eating, do you want to play with me?
- No.

82
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,640
Crab Meat Stuffed in Fragrant Orange. There's one more step,

83
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,320
which will be completed personally by our Head Chef Mr. Jiang for all of you.

84
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,860
Don't worry, there's no crab meat in the child's portion.

85
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,770
That's good.

86
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,740
Crab Meat Stuffed in Fragrant Orange.

87
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,750
Originated from Song Dynasty, it should have the combination of the taste of fruit and seafood,

88
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,390
but at your restaurant, the umami taste of the crab meat stands out very prominently instead.

89
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,360
The crab is even from Yangcheng Lake.

90
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,260
Pity!

91
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,260
Even though the meat of the crabs from Yangcheng Lake is fat and rich,

92
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,320
it's too oily. Rather the crabs from Taihu Lake,

93
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,140
even though they lack oiliness, that is why

94
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,550
they can be combined with the taste of the fragrant orange even better.

95
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,810
It makes the dish a whole unit,

96
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,350
and not the crab meat

97
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,500
separated from the orange.

98
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you for your guidance. Please enjoy.

99
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,640
No! Quick, Le Le! Spit it out!

100
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,450
Spit it out! Hurry! Spit it out!

101
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,270
- What happened?
- He's seriously allergic! He ate my portion!

102
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,330
- He'll have difficulty breathing in a bit!
- Everyone, calm down. Listen to me!

103
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,500
I'm sorry, I lied to everyone. All of your dishes were not crab, but mushrooms.

104
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,890
- Mushrooms?
- No way. Mushrooms?

105
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,070
What I had was clearly a crab.

106
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,210
I was afraid that the kid would eat from the adults' plates.

107
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,380
So, I took the liberty to switch all your plates to mushrooms.

108
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,980
Enjoy.

109
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,560
You're fine.

110
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,760
Hello, sir. Are you looking to buy or rent?

111
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,700
I'm renting.

112
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,370
Feel free to let me know your requirements. I guarantee you'll be satisfied.

113
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,050
Requirements?

114
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,170
Accessible transportation, in new condition, and facing the sun.

115
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,160
It must be soundproof and fully furnished.

116
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,390
Most importantly, it has to be close to…

117
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,740
How did you save that dish?

118
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,310
This is the secret.

119
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,460
Dried tangerine peels?

120
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,720
Yes.

121
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,790
This saved the overly salty dish.

122
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,850
How did you think of this?

123
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,260
Dried tangerine peels have a mildly bitter taste. It can balance out the saltiness.

124
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,630
Grinding and sprinkling it over the dish also doesn't ruin the presentation.

125
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,330
That's so clever!

126
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,310
This is nothing. A chef needs to know how to correct their mistakes,

127
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,110
but most importantly, they need to reduce their mistakes.

128
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,950
Why didn't you try the dish yourself? What if I wasn't able to tell?

129
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,840
You're able to tell.

130
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,410
I was so nervous just now, yet you're still so calm.

131
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,360
That's even simplier.

132
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,800
You won't be nervous after experiencing this a few more times.

133
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,010
Go get changed.

134
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,960
Okay.

135
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,130
Experience it a few more times.

136
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,070
Mr. Jiang.

137
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,500
I paid for crab meat, but I got mushrooms instead.

138
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,940
How are we going to settle this?

139
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,540
You didn't come to Yuxuan to have crab meat. You're here for my work.

140
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,460
I don't mind if you want to make up for the difference.

141
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,120
As expected of you.

142
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,870
All right. I'm here to thank you.

143
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,530
Thank you for what you did for my son.

144
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,480
Even with my amateur cooking knowledge,

145
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,420
I know that you must've experimented many times to fool my taste buds.

146
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,670
We have to be friends.

147
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,150
You're doing amazing as a father,

148
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,950
but as a food critic, you don't seem to stick to your principles.

149
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,330
Where's your sharp tongue?

150
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,240
I have nothing to criticize you about.

151
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,260
Hello? Mom.

152
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,320
No, Mom. I'm really out of money.

153
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,180
I already transferred my last month's paycheck to you. I still haven't gotten this month's.

154
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,440
Mom, can you stop gambling? Will you stop?

155
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,580
What am I supposed to do instead?

156
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,850
You're never home. This is my only hobby.

157
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,530
Will it make you happy if I get sick?

158
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,070
Fine, fine, fine. I got it, I got it.

159
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,220
I'll find a way to get you the money,

160
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,040
but Mom, you have to…

161
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,280
Hello? Mom?

162
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,260
Is this how you do it?

163
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,910
Are you throwing in shot put?

164
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,000
- Cut the crap.
- Come on.

165
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,960
This isn't right.

166
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,170
I'll try again.

167
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,520
Wow! You're amazing!

168
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,450
No, it didn't even bounce once.

169
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,920
I'm getting frustrated just by watching you throw. Let's go.

170
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,110
No. I have to get it at least once before we go.

171
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,880
Bro, I brought you here to relax.

172
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,490
How strange.

173
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,010
Listen, you're just not meant to be good at skipping stones.

174
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,950
I can't believe a divine chef like you

175
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,160
can't even skip stones. How sad.

176
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,440
Say that again.

177
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,720
I'll cook with your tongue if you say that one more time.

178
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,320
I'm just joking. I'm just trying to provoke you.

179
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,200
Why must you excel in everything you do?

180
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,650
What's the point of doing something if I can't do it well?

181
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,930
Sometimes I really can't understand people like you, justifying your losses.

182
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,100
You're just paranoid.

183
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,060
In short, just like stone skipping, you won't be able to defeat me.

184
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,210
Let me tell you. It's not over yet. Just wait and see.

185
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,310
Take these.

186
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,570
Hello, Elise.

187
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,190
I could be too tired.

188
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,290
Yes, it's still unresolved.

189
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,650
Fortunately, Lin Kesong is here.

190
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,900
Of course, I didn't tell her.

191
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,440
I may not be able to afford her not being by my side.

192
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,510
I got it.

193
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,900
Hey.

194
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,300
Let's stop playing. Let's go.

195
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,010
Let's go. I ran out of stones.

196
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,680
What did you just say? No one could defeat you?

197
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,840
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

198
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,080
Don't! Don't!

199
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,160
Boris.

200
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,420
Finally thought it through?

201
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,030
Where's the money?

202
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,390
You said that Lin Kesong has an incredible sense of taste, right?

203
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,520
It's true.

204
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,700
When Mr. Jiang discovered her amazing sense of taste in Hangzhou, he wanted to accept her as his apprentice.

205
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,380
What were you guys doing in Hangzhou?

206
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,470
To recruit an apprentice.

207
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,260
Not only Hangzhou, but we also went to a total of five cities.

208
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,020
Went to five cities

209
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,860
to find an

210
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:11,030
apprentice without any culinary art foundation but has an outstanding sense of taste?

211
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,560
[I want to give you a surprise.]

212
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,530
Why are you so happy and even skipped on your way here?

213
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,280
Song Yiran just texted me to say he wants to give me a surprise.

214
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,150
I don't want to hear this name during class.

215
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,550
Okay.

216
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,460
What surprise would he give me? So silly of him.

217
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:07,430
I'm saying you should focus on your culinary skills when you are in the kitchen.

218
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,960
You are here too.

219
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Yes.

220
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,010
Very sharp ears.

221
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,400
Aren't you curious at all?

222
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,750
I'm not curious about this person at all.

223
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,450
Why would I be curious about his surprise?

224
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,100
Moreover,

225
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,790
you should be curious about how to use this knife instead.

226
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,480
Please.

227
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,340
Lin Kesong, who said you could bring your cellphone in here?

228
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,800
Just this once. He texted me to say he's at the entrance. I'm going to open the door for him.

229
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,360
Restrain yourself.

230
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Lin Kesong, stop there! Lin Kesong!

231
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,850
Surprise!

232
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,630
Yeah!

233
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,240
Are you surprised?

234
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,320
What a surprise!

235
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,140
Hey...

236
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,870
Didn't you wonder why I suddenly showed up here?

237
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,700
It's not your birthday today and not mine too.

238
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,060
Did you sire a kid?

239
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,270
What? I'm still a kid. How can I sire one?

240
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,000
It's to celebrate you as finally becoming my neighbor.

241
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,480
Huh?

242
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,280
Do you still remember there are two high-rise buildings over there?

243
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,870
I rented the entire floor on the 21st level of the left building.

244
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,970
We will be living in the same neighborhood.

245
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,620
Happy?

246
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,370
I'm so happy!

247
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,990
Old Lin, we will be your neighbor in the future. I and...

248
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,610
Chu Ting will frequent here for meals.

249
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,150
Chu Ting is here too?

250
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,300
That's right. Happy?

251
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,760
Of course, she's not happy. The competition is approaching and she's still lacking.

252
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,330
It's just a competition. It's okay. I will help you.

253
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,500
I was waiting for you to say this.

254
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,570
Do her a favor now by making yourself disappear from her sight.

255
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,910
Old Jiang, this is not interesting. What's so hard about cooking?

256
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,130
Tell him.

257
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,890
Well...

258
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,530
- It's really difficult, but I think that...
- There's no "but".

259
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,790
- See you later.
- No. I just arrived

260
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,500
- and you are kicking me out.
- Thanks for the wine.

261
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,370
You are too extreme!

262
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,880
Lin Kesong, get meat from the cold storage room.

263
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,290
What for?

264
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,630
I'm teaching you to cook meat today.

265
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,990
Shanghai is so big.

266
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,950
Why is he unexpectedly living so close to me?

267
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,090
Strange. Why are you saying unexpectedly?

268
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,660
Did he move here because of me?

269
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,930
And he even said that it's fine as he's here.

270
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:27,090
Is he afraid that Jiang Qianfan would bully me or he couldn't bear to leave me?

271
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,620
Anyone there? Why did you lock the door?

272
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,860
Someone's here. Is there a problem?

273
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,100
Something seems to be wrong with the door. It's locked. Open it for me!

274
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,500
How could something be wrong with the door?

275
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,200
Stop fooling around. I'm freezing in here. Open the door now!

276
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,140
I'm not fooling around! Wait for a while. I will get someone to rescue you!

277
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,800
Don't leave!

278
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,080
Don't leave!

279
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,560
I didn't leave. You are suffering. How could I leave?

280
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,280
Let me out now!

281
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,080
Let me advise you. There are all kinds of food and meat in there.

282
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,720
There will be cockroaches and rats in there.

283
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,190
Look carefully. There may be snakes too.

284
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,350
Wouldn't I die?

285
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,580
Keep calm.

286
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,210
I want you to listen carefully.

287
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:41,510
If you dare to break the rules again, this will be your new room.

288
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,600
Understand?

289
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,020
Lin Kesong, I know you can hear me. Speak!

290
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,760
Lin Kesong!

291
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,040
I will kill you!

292
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,880
Baby, it has been tough for you.

293
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,280
How did you find it?

294
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,280
It's easier to find.

295
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,630
Let's go. Let me show you the new house.

296
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,370
What do you think? Do you like it?

297
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,590
This is really great.

298
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,200
I can't find any faults. It has surpassed my expectations.

299
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,890
I knew you would like it.

300
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,700
Two rooms. One each for you and me. Let me show you.

301
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,440
Okay.

302
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,590
I like the color of this room.

303
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,750
There's still something else you will like.

304
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,610
Okay. Let's start the class now.

305
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,780
- There are 40 parts in raw meat. Any idea how to cook them?
- No idea.

306
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,670
I will give you a hint.

307
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,800
Based on the muscles and fibers, it can be divided into three parts.

308
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,230
The flank, shank...

309
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,960
Ribeye, loin, belly!

310
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,780
What's wrong?

311
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,380
My stomach doesn't feel good. I'm going to the toilet. Bye.

312
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,170
Hello, Old Lin. I'm at the terrace. Hurry up.

313
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,360
Big Head, what's going on?

314
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,950
Look up.

315
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,920
Did you see that? Does it look like you?

316
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,730
How does this resemble me?

317
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,930
Just wait.

318
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,880
Stop fooling around. Mr. Jiang is waiting for me to continue with the training.

319
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,930
I'm hanging up.

320
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,400
Bye-bye.

321
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,440
The view is really great.

322
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,910
What are you doing?

323
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,090
I'm surveying the terrain.

324
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,810
What terrain?

325
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,790
Jiang Qianfan's home.

326
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,000
By the way, Lin Kesong is staying there too.

327
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,350
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

328
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,380
What? I didn't tell you? This is also one of the reasons I'm staying here.

329
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,010
My stomach feels so much better.

330
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,240
Feel much better?

331
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,020
You can focus on your lesson now.

332
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,620
Relax your shoulders.

333
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,880
♫  Someone's stealing your heart  ♫

334
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,520
Give me your hand. Don't worry.

335
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,200
I won't let you cut yourself.

336
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,290
♫  No way I can hide  ♫

337
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,750
Take a look.

338
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,170
The meat has its grains. Cut according to the grain.

339
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,000
Don't worry. I won't let you cut yourself.

340
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,940
♫  You're the special one  ♫

341
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,960
Being embraced by him again in this way,

342
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,580
this posture is truly miraculous.

343
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,160
My shoulders relaxed instantly.

344
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,550
How did he do that?

345
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,920
It seems like he can feel my slightest emotion.

346
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,780
I can also feel his warmth.

347
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,850
♫  My daydream is changing  ♫

348
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,400
With the slicing,

349
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,160
the feeling of the meat sticking to the knife and splitting is

350
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,860
so subtle. I could also feel

351
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,350
the slice through every grain.

352
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,950
It seems like I've entered Jiang Qianfan's world

353
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,690
where all his senses are being magnified.

354
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,380
Everything became wonderful.

355
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,570
♫  Escaping from this disappointing night ♫

356
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,040
♫  You have magic touch  ♫

357
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,520
♫ You're the special one ♫

358
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,890
♫  taking me to the light  ♫

359
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,930
Baby, does this look good here?

360
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,730
Yes, it does.

361
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,260
It doesn't.

362
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,730
Baby, how about here?

363
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,850
It's nice too.

364
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,470
What's wrong?

365
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,450
I'm fine. I'm a bit tired.

366
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,880
Tired? I will give you a massage.

367
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,340
Doesn't seem to be a minor problem.

368
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,490
Baby, tell me what's wrong.

369
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,020
I already said I'm fine.

370
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:04,020
Baby, do you want me to tell Lin Kesong to come here and keep you company?

371
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,680
You should tell her to come here and keep you company instead.

372
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,190
How could it be so coincidental and so close too?

373
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,560
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

374
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,840
So, it's about this?

375
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,380
I didn't think it was something important from the start. Also, isn't it good to have a friend as a neighbor too?

376
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,990
Didn't you get along well with her? What's wrong? Don't like her?

377
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,010
She chased after you from Wuzhen to Hangzhou, and now Shanghai.

378
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,520
She even chased after you till here. Who's the one who can't leave the other?

379
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,850
No, Baby. Don't tell me you are jealous of Lin Kesong?

380
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,930
She and I have been together for more than ten years. If there's anything between us, it would have happened a long time ago.

381
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,470
I don't even regard her as a woman.

382
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,500
People will change.

383
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,280
A boyfriend with a beautiful woman as a best friend, who would feel comfortable?

384
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,460
Moreover, she's also an apprentice of a renowned chef.

385
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:57,160
Baby, you used to be tolerant in the past.

386
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,680
I have been observant.

387
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,330
This is the first time someone is jealous of Lin Kesong.

388
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:08,180
What do you mean? Are you saying I'm not as magnanimous as your ex-girlfriends in the past?

389
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,200
How many ex-girlfriends do you have?

390
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,390
Why are you talking about this again? There's none. You are the only one.

391
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,080
Also, they have never been jealous of Lin Kesong.

392
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,990
They? Still say that you don't have any?

393
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:25,530
Okay, I had. Lin Kesong and I are really just friends. Ask her if you don't believe me.

394
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,430
How can I ask her this?

395
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,430
Even if I climb into the bathtub, I won't be able to avoid suspicion.

396
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,940
What are you doing?

397
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,980
Just do your work.

398
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,670
[Jiang Qianfan]

399
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,620
Hello.

400
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,280
It's not convenient now. We are having an agrument.

401
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,680
What?

402
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,030
Okay. Let me ask her.

403
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,890
Baby, let's dine with Lin Kesong. One look and you will know.

404
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,700
This is Jiang Qianfan, and my girlfriend, Chu Ting.

405
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,890
Not only is she beautiful, but she's also very capable too. Just like me.

406
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,950
Old Song, you are very lucky.

407
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,460
I have heard about you for a long time. I have been to both of your Yuxuan restaurants. I really liked them.

408
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,070
Thank you.

409
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,810
When our Kesong heard you were coming, she was ecstatic and insisted on personally cooking to welcome you.

410
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,110
Who's your Kesong?

411
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,640
What's wrong?

412
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,980
N-nothing.

413
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,380
This is a small gesture. Hope you like it.

414
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:05,790
Thank you. It's secondary whether I like it or not, just as long as the hostess likes it.

415
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,550
Honey. Honey!

416
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,270
Please wait for a moment.

417
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,160
You are here.

418
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,670
Why are you standing there? Where are you sitting? I'm brewing tea.

419
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,910
Didn't you say you would help me? Come up now!

420
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,010
I will be there. Go in now.

421
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,070
Hurry up!

422
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,600
Please take a seat. Make yourself at home.

423
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,750
Honey!

424
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,300
Honey.

425
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,250
Speed up.

426
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:57,220
Mr. Jiang, don't you think those two are rather strange?

427
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,840
When you spoke just now, they kept fixing their eyes on me.

428
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,570
Is that so? I didn't see it.

429
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,570
Sorry, this meal is too abrupt today. Today's meal is beef bourguignon.

430
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:13,930
These are boiled lobsters and French chicken breast salad.

431
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,930
These are dishes that I sell at my restaurant.

432
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:22,310
This is beef in lettuce wraps. Our darling Kesong spent the afternoon cooking this.

433
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,760
Miss Chu Ting, our apologies. We are not aware of your taste. Please forgive us.

434
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,170
Mr. Jiang, you are too hospitable. Your dishes look simply delicious.

435
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,450
You are flattering me.

436
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,480
Come, here's to being our new neighbors. Cheers.

437
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,100
Thank you.

438
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,260
Let's start.

439
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,290
Darling, you worked hard in the afternoon.

440
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,590
Come. Have this piece of lobster.

441
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,010
What's going on?

442
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,380
You are shy as others are here. It's okay. Here.

443
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,640
I can eat it on my own.

444
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,290
Hold on.

445
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,630
Okay.

446
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,230
It's clean. Go ahead and eat.

447
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,190
Go ahead and eat.

448
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,920
What are you doing?

449
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,010
Honey,

450
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,780
is the beef bourguignon upstairs done yet?

451
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,690
I'm going to check.

452
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,520
I will go with you.

453
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,770
Apologies. Please wait for a moment.

454
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,220
Mr. Jiang is so romantic.

455
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,590
Is he?

456
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,160
He's so sweet.

457
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,200
Dear, use this opportunity to learn from him.

458
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,490
Let's eat.

459
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,090
What's the meaning of this?

460
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,020
What do you mean?

461
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,930
You treated me in that manner in front of them. What are you doing?

462
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,940
I'm helping you. I was afraid you would be upset by seeing him.

463
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,820
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

464
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,020
If I don't push you for the competition, you won't win.

465
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,020
Trust me. Get the pot.

466
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,850
Okay!

467
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:01,610
I told you I will get the pot and you insisted on doing it. Be careful. It's hot.

468
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,750
Old Lin, we have a housewarming party tomorrow. Join us.

469
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,150
Yes. We invited many friends. Join us.

470
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,800
Okay.

471
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,040
I will give you the day off tomorrow.

472
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,570
By the way, we can't go empty-handed. Let's prepare snacks for the party.

473
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,360
Honey, I will help you.

474
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,530
Don't go overboard. I only know how to make steamed buns.

475
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,150
Baby, I will teach you.

476
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,020
- Careful.
- No need to walk us out.

477
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,620
Kesong, go back with Mr. Jiang.

478
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,090
Seeing how happy you both are, I'm really happy for you both.

479
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,780
Old Song is very happy today too, right?

480
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,450
That's right!

481
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,840
Hey!

482
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,590
Sorry. He drank too much.

483
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,310
It's okay. I will escort him home with you.

484
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,320
Lin Kesong, go with us too.

485
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,910
Okay. Be careful.

486
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,450
- Let's go.
- I'm not drunk.

487
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,280
Don't support me.

488
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,580
Place him on the sofa for now.

489
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,190
Why are we at my home?

490
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,980
Hey.

491
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:35,840
Sorry. We just moved here and haven't tidied up yet. Please don't mind this.

492
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,130
Why don't you guys stay for a bit?

493
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,040
No need. You both should rest.

494
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,550
Okay.

495
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,960
Since we are here, let me remove your shoes.

496
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,120
Little Bun,

497
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,890
let's go home.

498
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:22,110
♫  Sometimes I feel so bored and tired ♫

499
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,160
Upset?

500
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,310
They are inextricably linked.

501
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:36,080
Looking at Song Yiran, they seem so,

502
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,880
but it's also good. He won't disturb you again in the future.

503
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,250
So, this is the reason?

504
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,750
Of course. What do you think?

505
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:52,620
However, the way you eat is charming.

506
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,560
- What?
- Just like a pig.

507
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:03,110
♫  To see, to see the other side ♫

508
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,280
I knew you wouldn't say anything nice.

509
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,770
♫ Follow me, follow me to the future ♫

510
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:18,890
Jiang Qianfan is really strange. When he's being gentle, he's like another person.

511
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:24,170
If you don't really know his true colors, he can really touch your heart.

512
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,850
I have never been in a relationship and cooked with someone I like,

513
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:33,710
and invited friends over for a meal. So, this is what it feels like.

514
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,580
Hold on. Why am I enjoying this?

515
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:43,120
However, pretending to be lovers with Jiang Qianfan

516
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,730
is a sweet sacrifice.

517
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,090
♫ Hey ♫

518
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,470
♫ Me and myself  ♫

519
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,880
Do you need help?

520
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,510
Come here.

521
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,970
Water this.

522
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,490
All right.

523
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,850
Did Victor tell you? This is great.

524
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,320
Everyone knows my hiding place now.

525
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,250
Yes.

526
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,330
Victor is worried about you.

527
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,260
I'm worried about you too.

528
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,210
Is there really no possibility that Oliver can regain his tastebuds?

529
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,910
They still can't find out the cause?

530
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,110
It's very difficult.

531
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:58,560
I found a specialist to treat him. Everyone thinks

532
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,480
it could be a kind of rare allergy resulting in the death of some nerve cells.

533
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,080
Then... What could it be?

534
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:27,390
♫ You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

535
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,380
♫ Don't let me go  ♫

536
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,670
♫ I will do little tricks for you  ♫

537
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,990
♫ Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

538
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,910
♫ Show me who you are  ♫

539
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:48,990
♫ I will sing a song for you  ♫

540
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,620
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
