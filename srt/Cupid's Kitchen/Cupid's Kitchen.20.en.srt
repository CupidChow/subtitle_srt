[Episode 20]

10
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,260
Mom.

11
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,340
What did Jiang Qianfan say to you?

12
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,260
He said he wanted to be with me. Can you believe it?

13
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,440
Yes, I can. Why not?

14
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,720
You were together once before.

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,790
But... I didn't agree.

16
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,400
Because of that contract, I feel uneasy. Give it back to me. Just pretend nothing happened.

17
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,920
Calm down.

18
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,980
Elise, is your unease only because of the contract?

19
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,000
Some things can't be changed anymore, but it's not too late for the contract.

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,950
I am Party B on the contract.

21
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,890
You want me to give up the gains in my hand,

22
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,140
only because of your unreliable relationship?

23
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,710
It's getting late. Wash up and sleep.

24
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,020
Wake up.

25
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,060
Eat breakfast.

26
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,180
Wake up. I'll teach how to make it.

27
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,810
What?

28
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,340
What about my soup?

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,140
The cooking wine should be apportioned depending on the quantity of the seafood.

30
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,070
If there's too much cooking wine, it'll taste too sweet.

31
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,200
If it's not enough, the aroma won't be released.

32
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,410
Turn on high heat now, to quickly cook the seafood and let the sauce soak in.

33
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,090
Remember, seafood can't be cooked too long, or the texture will turn hard.

34
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,900
Try it.

35
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,510
- How is it? Is it too spicy?
- It's not spicy.

36
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,460
Do you know why?

37
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,990
For your portion, you only added the Carolina Reaper Chili after the sauce was mixed.
 (T/N: Known as the hottest chili pepper in the world by Guinness World Records)

38
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,480
So there is too much Carolina Reaper Chili in the soup, that's why it tastes too spicy.

39
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,480
You must put in the Carolina Reaper Chili before mixing the sauce.

40
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,310
That's how it can sufficiently mix with the moisture and then blend perfectly with the other ingredients.

41
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,860
Remember this one thing.

42
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,600
Every dish has its most suitable sauce

43
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,660
and also the best time to create the best flavor.

44
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,020
- You try it next.
- Okay.

45
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,950
I looked at Song Yiran's posts.

46
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,860
I didn't expect that you have a connection with the Carolina Reaper Chili.

47
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,090
I have no idea what I was thinking at that time. I'm scared when I remember it now.

48
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,600
If I get a zero score again,

49
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,960
and can't get into the final four,

50
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,680
does this mean I'm hopeless?

51
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,960
Yes.

52
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,430
Here.

53
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,060
This is for you.

54
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,890
What is it?

55
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,340
Take a look.

56
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,870
Four-leaf clover?

57
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,410
The flour-leaf clover represents good luck.

58
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,430
When you are okay, I'll be okay.

59
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,300
I think we both need some luck.

60
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,320
All right. Keep working hard, Little Friend.

61
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,500
When I'm okay, he'll be okay. I really love this saying.

62
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,650
When I think about it, his pressure is actually greater than mine.

63
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,720
I'm just a regular person, a rookie,

64
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,350
but he is the invincible god of the kitchen.

65
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,270
He's never failed before, except when it comes to me.

66
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,590
Lin Kesong, you must do well!

67
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,280
Do your best, Little Crab.

68
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,940
Where is your four-leaf clover?

69
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,840
I'm wearing it!

70
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,990
Here.

71
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,600
Don't worry.

72
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,920
What needs to be ready is all ready. You can do it.

73
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,280
Why are you so dazed?

74
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,890
I feel very much at ease.

75
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,910
I told you that you must walk fast for this exercise.

76
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,930
Otherwise, you can't achieve aerobic exercise. Did you know?

77
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,970
Faster!

78
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,400
Hey.

79
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,310
What are you looking at?

80
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:13,120
Were you watching that program? Why did we come out to exercise then?

81
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,460
I just wanted to see what dishes she is cooking.

82
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,820
- I won't watch it now.
- What is she cooking?

83
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,630
You don't let me watch, but you still ask?

84
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,180
Fine, fine, fine. I won't ask then. You walk in front.

85
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,110
Judges and audience,

86
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,350
the second round of Mueller's Future Star Culinary Competition is about to start.

87
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,330
In the second round, the contestants will compete on spicy flavors.

88
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,980
The topic of this round is called "Thrill".

89
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,540
Now we can see that

90
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,700
the crew members are distributing eight chili peppers to the contestants.

91
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,710
Each person gets one, and only one.

92
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,570
Some of the audience could be doubtful.

93
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,580
Aren't they competing on the spicy flavor? How is that enough?

94
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,790
Actually, this is a chili pepper called Carolina Reaper Chili.

95
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,000
The usual chili peppers we use have a spiciness that ranges from 30,000 to 80,000 Scoville Heat Units,

96
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,060
but this chili pepper's spiciness ranges from 1,570,000 to 2,200,000 Scoville Heat Units

97
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,080
because it's so spicy that it isn't suited for eating. I'm sure you've never used it.

98
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,690
If you eat this chili pepper, your internal organs will definitely feel burnt,

99
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,390
but when you cook with it,

100
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,070
don't forget our topic is "Thrill".

101
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,800
Talented young people, we are entrusting the problem to you!

102
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,470
Okay. The competition officially starts now!

103
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,570

Blu is dry frying chili.

112
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,960
Oh, I understand.

113
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,050
It turns out that he is using salt, with the spicy taste of the chili as the seasoning.

114
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,130
This move is smart. Okay, let's go and take a look at the next contestant.

115
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,810
What method will Victor use to adjust the spiciness?

116
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,370
He hasn't started on the chili yet.

117
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,340
♫  Like work of art  ♫

118
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,360
The suspense will remain and be revealed at the end.

119
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,290
Since it's so suspenseful, how about taking a look at the next contestant?

120
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,360
According to what Jiang Qianfan taught me previously,

121
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,810
Carolina Reaper Chili rinsed in water for half a second,

122
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,750
it should be okay.

123
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,700
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

124

♫  Don't hide your feelings for love  ♫

125
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,430
♫  Like lonely star, lonely star  ♫

126
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,430
♫ Listen to your heart ♫

127
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:25,250
The taste of the chili in the water, suddenly reminds me of Jiang Qianfan.

128
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,500
♫ Listen to your heart ♫

129
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,780
♫ Listen to your heart ♫

130
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,170
I'll just do it like this.

131
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,530
Oliver's apprentice really doesn't meet everyone's expectations.

132
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,360
I actually think that this girl is not bad.

133
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,250
She's much better than the one my apprentice is interested in.

134
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,860
How come?

135
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,310
Fussy and arrogant. If my disciple is like this,

136
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,670
I need to beat him 300 times in one day.

137
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,290
This is a poor move,

138
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,610
but you can't regret it after you make it.

139
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,220
Eat!

140
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,700
I let you eat it. Try it.

141
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,630
It's... chocolate?

142
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,720
Victor made it.

143
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,170
This kid is good.

144
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,600
I've not been able to understand this Lin Kesong. Look,

145
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,880
she kept cooking this Carolina Reaper Chili,

146
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,270
but no chili water was put into the dish.

147
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,030
Why is it exactly?

148
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,630
I really want to remind her that our competition is on spice, there must be spice!

149
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,110
Okay, I've already reminded her. She has to figure it out.

150
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,490
Are you making ice cream, Victor? Our theme is spicy.

151
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,680
- Do you want to try it?
- Can I?

152
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,060
Thank you.

153
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,950
Victor has never disappointed us,

154
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,440
but in the coolness there's a menace.

155
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Let's wait together for this youth to present his work.

156
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,370
What time is it now?

157
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,870
- 11:30 a.m.
- 11:30 a.m.

158
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,060
I'll go to the toilet first.

159
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,470
Okay, okay. You go quickly.

160
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:47,400
[Mueller's Future Star Culinary Competition]

161
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,320
Just waiting for you.

162
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,520
Spicy foie gras sauce.

163
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,490
I guessed it.

164
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,540
Montgomery thought that you are better than me in everything,

165
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,460
except for spicy foie gras sauce.

166
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,770
Even the ones he cooked, he didn't like to eat them. He liked eating mine the most.

167
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,970
Yes.

168
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,080
It's because you cooked it too well.

169
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,230
I remember that day Montgomery was so happy

170
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,690
that he gave us an hour's leave.

171
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,090
We drank vodka then.

172
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,130
In the end, the three of us were still drunk until the next day.

173
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,010
The alcohol was a little stinging.

174
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,680
Boris,

175
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,700
we can't be drunk today.

176
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,410
Of course.

177
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,600
Because after this competition ends,

178
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,230
I will still finding trouble for you.

179
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,330
Let's toast to Montgomery.

180
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,530
Toast to Montgomery.

181
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,340
- Sorry, come again next time!
- Waiter, hurry up!

182
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,310
- Sorry. I'll come in a while.
- Sorry.

183
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,870
- Wait for a while.
- I'll be right there.

184
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,060
Where are you? Serve the dishes, quick!

185
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,660
Dear audience, there's one minute before the competition ends.

186
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,450
Contestants, please make use of the time to prepare.

187
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,530
- Hurry up.
- Don't... don't shake, it'll make me nervous!

188
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,290
Three, two,

189
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,790
one. Stop!

190
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,680
Competition time is up!

191
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,970
Okay, while the judges are tasting the contestants' work,

192
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,390
I'll take the opportunity to interview the contestants.

193
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,350
Let's start with Lin Kesong.

194
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,250
Miss Lin Kesong, I'm sure many of the audience feel the same as I do. We noticed

195
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,990
you kept using water to boil the chili pepper,

196
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,500
but you didn't add the chili pepper water to the dish.

197
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,620
May I ask, was it a mistake, or you did do it on purpose?

198
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,930
At first, it was a mistake, but later on, it wasn't a mistake.

199
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,140
Oh? What do you mean?

200
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,570
I originally wanted to make Spicy Seafood Rice.

201
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,030
My teacher Jiang Qianfan taught me how to cook chili pepper in boiling water,

202
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,470
but that pot got too hot, and I carelessly dropped the chili pepper into it.

203
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,790
When I picked up the chili pepper, the water was already too spicy to use.

204
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,000
I could pour out the water and boil another pot of it,

205
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,780
but then the chili pepper's flavor will be gone.

206
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:14,190
So, then I thought, I could use the chili pepper's aroma to stimulate the dish.

207
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,630
I don't know how this dish will taste, but this method is really unique.

208
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,020
How was the inspiration thrilled out?

209
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,160
I just kept thinking and thinking, and got thrilled.

210
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,440
Okay. Your score wasn't ideal in the first round of the competition.

211
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,340
In this round of competition, the scoring starts with you,

212
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,820
but given your style, I believe

213
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,460
you should achieve fresh new results this time.

214
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,310
Thanks.

215
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,260
Your apprentice is quite clever.

216
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,920
Yeah.

217
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,740
Yours is good, too.

218
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,620
Next, I'll announce the results of this round of competition.

219
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,530
Regretfully, only four contestants successfully

220
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,200
resolved the scariest chili pepper in the world.

221
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,970
She is the winner of the first round

222
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,300
by perfectly controlling a minuscule amount of the spicy taste. She used apple cider to extract the spiciness to use in foie gras.

223
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,560
Hello, Older Brother.

224
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,920
Wait a moment, I'll be right there.

225
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,930
...accurately completed the topic of this competition, "Thrill".

226
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,300
She is Lin Xiaoyu. Congratulations.

227
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,830
Number two is Victor.

228
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,120
He has left? It would appear that he can't accept this result.

229
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,020
Did she make you come back? If you have anything to tell me, say it quickly. I still have things to do.

230
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,030
Who wants to talk about you?

231
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,520
So why do you want to see me?

232
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,880
Chu Ting hasn't complained to me about you lately. It means you've been doing well.

233
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,970
I'm very satisfied.

234
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,740
Older Brother, don't get into our business. Okay?

235
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,140
Will you die if you don't play with your cellphone?

236
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:22,880
No. A friend is competing. It's particularly crucial.

237
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,740
Dish is up!

238
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,750
Boss, Kesong is number four. This kid is really promising!

239
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,050
Our Lin family's girls are capable of reaching the sky!

240
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,960
Boss, save some respect for others!

241
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,730
Nope!

242
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,150
Hey, hey, hey.

243
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,200
Awesome!

244
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,680
This is my daughter!

245
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,700
Kesong, Mom saw you.

246
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,010
In fourth place, it's great, really great!

247
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,810
Dad is proud of you, very proud of you. Keep doing well!

248
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,420
Mom congratulates you. Also...

249
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,970
I was secretly watching on my cellphone. Don't tell your mom.

250
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,660
Don't let your dad know that I was secretly watching.

251
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,810
Congratulations.

252
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,590
You took so long. Let's go home.

253
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,390
Too many people in the restroom. Let's go home.

254
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,510
What should we eat?

255
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,840
- Something spicy?
- Spicy seafood!

256
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,550
Come back.

257
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,110
- Did you secretly watch?
- No.

258
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,910
Tell me the truth.

259
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,490
If you didn't watch, how would you know that I watched?

260
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,260
I...

261
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:55,710
[Kesong, I've watched the competition. You got fourth place. That's amazing. Don't tell your mom. I watched it secretly.]

262
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,440
Hurry and go. I'll cook seafood for you.

263
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,360
Older Brother, you are right. I agreed to marry first before establishing a career,

264
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,250
but there are some requirements to getting married. it's not the right time for Chu Ting and me yet.

265
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,040
What is considered the right time?

266
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:17,010
Your sister-in-law and I also first married before nurturing our feelings.

267
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,120
Aren't we getting along well now?

268
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,930
If Mom and Dad were still alive, it wouldn't even be me to lecture you,

269
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,750
but I am the only one who can lecture you now.

270
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,220
Of course, I don't have any other demands on you,

271
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,000
but when it comes to marriage, you must listen to me.

272
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,910
What if I propose to Chu Ting, but she doesn't agree?

273
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,410
It's up to her to agree, but it depends on you to propose or not.

274
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,440
I don't believe she won't agree if you sincerely and wholeheartedly propose to her!

275
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,670
Older Brother, let me choose a time to get ready to propose to her, okay?

276
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,200
Sure.

277
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,190
Hey! Lin Kesong.

278
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,560
What's the matter?

279
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,860
What's the matter? I actually want to ask you that.

280
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,190
Why are you so scheming?

281
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,330
What do you mean?

282
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,430
You were so close to me. The spicy vapor from your pot floated to my foie gras.

283
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,350
I could have lowered the spiciness.

284
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,500
It's your fault. Why are you harming me?

285
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,610
Didn't you win? Why are you talking so strangely?

286
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,490
You are really just like your dad.

287
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:49,610
Your dad isn't as good as my dad, but he doesn't treat my dad well.

288
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,780
Even when I win the competition, you still want to harm me.

289
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,000
It's truly the daughter taking after the father.

290
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,660
I've tolerated you for a long time.

291
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,270
I'm competing for myself, not for you.

292
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,560
Lin Kesong!

293
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,800
What are you doing? What are you doing?

294
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,090
- Hit you. Hit you!
- Hit me?

295
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,520
What's going on? Don't hit! Don't hit!

296
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,660
I've been wanting to beat you up!

297
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,460
Jiang Qianfan! Boris! Come quickly!

298
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,460
- What are you doing?
- Who says that you can criticize my dad?

299
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,070
- Xiaoyu.
- Why did you talk about my dad?
- What's going on?

300
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,950
- Calm down.
- What's going on?
- Calm down.

301
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,990
Are you okay?

302
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,800
Enough now.

303
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,070
We are the winner in this round of the competition.

304
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,340
Come, fix your makeup.

305
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,340
Go to the interview with the media.

306
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,820
What is so great about you?

307
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,470
What are you laughing about?

308
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,180
The four-leaf clover you gave me really works.

309
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,980
I won in the competition and also won in beating up Xiaoyu.

310
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,270
Fine. Keep wearing it then.

311
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,950
You really understand a young girl's heart.

312
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,640
Let me tell you. I don't think you won over Lin Xiaoyu.

313
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,520
Her strength is a lot stronger than yours. Do you know why?

314
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,560
She just flipped the wok a few more years than I did, right?

315
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,330
Right.

316
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,980
Also,

317
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,370
that question you answered on stage just now. Tell me,

318
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,440
how did you think of it?

319
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,080
The aroma.

320
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,940
Guess.

321
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Guess?

322
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,950
Sure. Okay.

323
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,180
Do you dare 18 guesses?

324
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,220
Sure. I'll give you a hint.

325
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,120
It's related to you.

326
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,000
It's related to me?

327
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,040
Hey. Hey!

328
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,070
- Old Huang.
- You've finished changing. Sit down.

329
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,520
You were saying it's related to me?

330
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,670
Yes. 17 now.

331
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,610
This-this was a question?

332
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,670
16.

333
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,640
- You learned it in Shanghai?
- Yes.

334
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,830
- Learned it in Yuxuan?
- Yes.

335
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:35,660
Mr. Jiang, Miss Lin. Chairperson Thomas is inviting you to the competition room.

336
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,970
Got it.

337
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,710
Okay.

338
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,480
Thomas?

339
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,130
Let's go.

340
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,690
You've come.

341
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,970
That's good then.

342
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,090
Let's watch the replay of this scene together.

343
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:05,640
At first, both contestants were calm.

344
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:12,040
But something suddenly happened, and they lost control.

345
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,500
They pulled each other's hair.

346
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,260
I really don't get it.

347
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,290
Are they here to compete in a culinary competition or Sanda tournament?

348
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:26,460
Blu came in at this moment.

349
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,840
He tried to separate the two contestants.

350
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,420
I really can't tell who won in this fight.

351
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,740
I think, based on the scores, Xiaoyu won.

352
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,430
But based on momentum, Lin Kesong had the upper hand.

353
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,200
Okay now. I think it's even.

354
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,100
These two contestants will each get a warning as a penalty.

355
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,290
But... she started it first.

356
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,920
It was because you said...

357
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,520
The reason isn't important to me.

358
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,940
What's important is the fact that you fought.

359
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,880
Also, your two mentors were great role models.

360
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,320
If you two continue to fight, then I'm sorry.

361
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,710
I'll have to disqualify you two as mentors.

362
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,720
LIn Kesong, Lin Xiaoyu, there is a rule in the competition.

363
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:42,450
If a contestant gets two or more warnings, it will be immediate discharge from the competition.

364
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,350
No need to keep looking at them. Go.

365
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:27,050
This wheel must have been repeatedly run over

366
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:31,060
by a sedan or a vehicle that's heavier.

367
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,410
After such a huge accident,

368
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,580
the driver is spotless from head to toe.

369
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,020
He must be great in his lightness skill.

370
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,170
Admirable! Admirable!

371
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,180
What's the matter?

372
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,280
It's the new frame for the bike. Unwrap this.

373
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,860
Okay.

374
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,640
Look at the condition of your bike. Aren't your legs hurting?

375
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,920
Don't you know that everything has a life?

376
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,870
None of your business. How much is it? Fix it.

377
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,180
Wheels, hub, spokes, caps for the spokes.

378
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,500
Inner tube, outer tire, 800.

379
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,230
The repair fee is 49,200. Altogether, 50,000.

380
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,820
It only cost me 2,000 to buy.

381
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,190
Scan the QR Code over there.

382
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,390
Promote it in a 300-people group, then you can get 10 or 20% off.

383
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,960
You look human, but actually a scammer.

384
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,210
Hey, hey. Don't you see who is repairing it for you?

385
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,570
Our Sister K is renowned in the field. Great work, little talk,

386
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,370
very adorable.

387
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,490
Be grateful that she can fix your broken bike.

388
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,780
Who said I'll repair it for him?

389
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,470
Only children will vent their frustrations on a vehicle.

390
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:50,190
I don't accept any orders from the under-aged. Take it away.

391
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,390
Only a menopausal woman will get grumpy and unstable.

392
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,970
I'll leave it here. Fix or not, it's up to you.

393
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,610
Victor. Victor!

394
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,120
Where are you going?

395
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,900
I want to go back to England. This is a stupid competition. Stupid!

396
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,000
Getting second place only once, and you can't take it?

397
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,800
You call it second place, but I call it "loser"!

398
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,390
So you are going back to London, and be the loser for the rest of your life?

399
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:27,690
I am protesting. I'm already doing them a favor to be on stage with those people!

400
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,530
Someone actually got a higher score than mine!

401
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,170
It means this competition is a total joke! I'm not competing in it anymore.

402
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,670
Only the weak will protest.

403
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:43,470
Victor, all the ones who are active on the top-tier culinary stage,

404
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,520
including myself, came from this competition.

405
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,590
In order to embellish you with glory, that's why I agreed to be a mentor.

406
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:53,900
Now, you want to throw away our hope?

407
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,080
You aren't only competing on culinary skill, but also on willpower.

408
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,000
This is also what I worry about the most. I've pampered you too much,

409
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,080
but I believe that you will persevere.

410
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,860
Do you know why you lost?

411
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,900
You lost due to not having enough strength in the upper limbs,

412
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,850
and not enough core strength. Watch my moments.

413
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:24,800
Stand straight. Gather force from the core. Lift the arms.

414
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,620
Pay attention to how your arms feel. One,

415
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,690
two...

416
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,530
That arm's muscle looks really good.

417
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,070
Slender when clothed, and an eyeful without clothes. That must describe you.

418
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:43,970
Does he realize his appearance is very mesmerizing?

419
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,770
Why is Elise so lucky? With such a boyfriend by her side,

420
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:52,260
it makes one feel secure and proud.

421
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,690
Little Friend?

422
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,920
You wanted to exercise. Can you focus, please?

423
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,090
Hmm.

424
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,260
Hmm, what? Why are you gazing at me like that?

425
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,050
I'm not a rack of ribs or drumstick. Focus.

426
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,810
Why describe yourself as delicious food?

427
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,380
Stand there.

428
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,220
Hold that.

429
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,820
Hold this.

430
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,880
Core force.

431
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,770
Follow what I did. One,

432
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,110
lift, put down slowly.

433
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,240
Two.

434
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,930
Lift.

435
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,690
Put it down slowly.

436
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,960
Core force. Don't make strange sounds. Don't you want to win easily in fights?

437
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,480
Fight what? Society is harmonious.

438
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,690
So useless. If this were Elise,

439
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,370
she could lift twice the weight.

440
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,640
I bought the groceries. They're really good.

441
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,690
- Be careful! Don't drop the bean paste.
- Okay.

442
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,450
Hello, Boss.

443
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,990
- You're working hard!
- It's fine.

444
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,210
- You two, hurry up! Hurry up!
- Enough, Fatty.

445
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,120
Hurry and check if there's anything new on the competition website.

446
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,710
Didn't you say not to watch in front of you?

447
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,800
When did I ever say that? That was a long time ago.

448
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,690
Hurry.

449
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,340
The two of them are my pride. If I can't see the news for 10 minutes,

450
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,590
I get really anxious.

451
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,650
[Punishment for Contestants Lin Kesong and Lin Xiaoyu]

452
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,810
It hurts! It hurts.

453
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,150
Tolerate it.

454
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,930
- Is it a dish I've made?
- Yes.

455
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,400
You don't have many chances left.

456
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,410
Okay. I won't ask anymore. Change side.

457
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,160
You haven't finished with this side. Keep pressing.

458
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,690
Are you acting shamelessly?

459
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,100
Hello.

460
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,940
I'll come right now.

461
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,560
Uncle wants me to go there.

462
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,880
Is it about the fight?

463
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,950
It probably is.

464
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:46,190
Okay. I'll go with you.

465
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,940
I just thought the two of you are quite good.

466
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,230
I told everyone I met that our Lin family's two girls

467
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,120
are especially excellent.

468
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,110
Now you're really something.

469
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,230
You actually fought in public,

470
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,620
and even got punished.

471
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,770
And even got announced on the official website!

472
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,530
Aren't you two great? Aren't you embarrassed?

473
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,410
Talk. Why did you argue, no, fight?

474
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:15,350
Dad, don't be angry. It's nothing to get one warning.

475
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,490
- It won't happen again.
- Shut up!

476
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:21,920
There'll be a next time? If it happens again, I'll break your legs!

477
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,420
Who moved first?

478
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,290
Xiaoyu, it was you, right?

479
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,230
It was me.

480
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,790
Kesong?

481
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:43,170
This... You moved first?

482
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,990
You're surprising me.

483
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:50,990
What is there that you can't talk it over, but you had to fight?

484
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,900
Sorry. I...

485
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,740
Mr. Lin.

486
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:02,000
Whatever the fact, just say it. I'm here. Don't be afraid.

487
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,170
Dad, you see it, too.

488
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,500
Older Sister has Mr. Jiang to back her up. So fierce.

489
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,560
No, Mr. Jiang.

490
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,450
This is our family's affair. I'm scolding the kids.

491
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,540
Can you not get mixed up in this?

492
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,010
Mr. Lin, sorry. I don't want to see Lin Kesong being wronged.

493
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:27,080
Kesong, are you being wronged?

494
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,790
No.

495
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,050
Hurry and leave!

496
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:39,080
Xiaoyu, let's not fuss anymore.

497
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,750
This is how an older sister should behave.

498
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,140
Okay then, I want to reconcile too.

499
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,590
Let's reconcile then.

500
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,410
No way we'll reconcile.

501
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:01,940
Dad, we've reconciled. Don't get angry anymore.

502
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:20,810
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

503
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,620
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

504
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,990
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

505
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,950
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

506
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,130
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

507
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:43,380
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

508
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,990
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
