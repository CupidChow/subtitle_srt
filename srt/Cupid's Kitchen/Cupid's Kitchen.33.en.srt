[Half a Kilo]

11
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,320
I'm heavier than you.

12
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,380
In the Chinese weight system,

13
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,590
one kilo is 16 taels, half a kilo is 8 taels, who is heavier than the other?

14
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,590
There is an idiom in China, "Half a kilo and eight taels."

15
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,170
This is actually how I see you two.

16
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,750
Between the two of you, in my eyes, one is a traitor,

17
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,830
the other is a coward.

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,100
Neither of you has performed well. If Montgomery were still alive,

19
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,710
I'm sure he would be very angry.

20
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,650
Before Montgomery left for the sea, I had a meal with him.

21
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,270
He told me, if the opportunity is right,

22
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,000
he hoped that I would arrange for the two of you

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,410
to become mentors at the Future Star Culinary Competition.

24
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,100
The reason for him to do this?

25
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,890
It's to hope that, through this competition,

26
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,740
you could understand more deeply what it means to be mentor and apprentice,

27
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,860
and what it means to carry on the legacy.

28
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,260
He also hoped that, in this competition,

29
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,820
you two would compete in a good battle

30
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,610
using your real talents and skills

31
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,130
to resolve all the grievances between you from the past.

32
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,800
What a pity

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,360
that it became our farewell that time.

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,950
Are you sure this is what he said?

35
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,990
Would he really miss me?

36
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,800
Boris, after you left, do you know

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,920
what Montgomery did for you?

38
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,360
Of course, you don't know. Those years ago, after you left,

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,070
Montgomery kept thinking you only became senseless momentarily

40
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,730
and that you'd return soon. But you never returned.

41
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,690
He was very worried about you. He looked for you everywhere.

42
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,770
As soon as he heard any news about you, he would fly over there right away.

43
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,470
He almost went to all corners of the world. For you, he even

44
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,750
resigned his job.

45
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,170
He went around outside for over a year.

46
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,260
By the time he returned to London,

47
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,950
his hair already turned white. Do you know about that?

48
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,910
You disappeared for almost three years. Your first job

49
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,220
was working as an instructor in a culinary school in Poland. Right?

50
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,500
How did you know?

51
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,050
You had a fist fight with the vice principal of the culinary school and even got taken to the police stations.

52
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,180
It was Montgomery who asked a favor from Thomas to tell the school not to fire you.

53
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,050
It was Montgomery who asked local friends to help you get released from the police station.

54
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,120
Later, he even asked someone else to introduce you to become a consultant at a German food company.

55
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,240
But you couldn't get along with anyone, so that job didn't last long.

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,130
Whenever Montgomery heard any bad news about you, he would feel so bad that he couldn't even cook.

57
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,510
When I saw how he looked, I told him,

58
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,970
why not just bring you back?

59
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,000
He only told me, your heart had become wild. There's no coming back.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,720
Don't give me this! Why didn't you tell me this already?

61
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,070
Would you have been willing to hear if I told you before?

62
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,340
Whether I would hear it or not, what doesn't it have to do with you?

63
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,900
Do you two know about this? Montgomery never married in his life,

64
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,020
so he didn't have any children.

65
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,070
But he considered you two to be his children

66
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,450
and even the pride of his life.

67
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,950
- But look at you two—
- Don't keep playing with me!

68
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,130
Thomas, you can announce the committee's result.

69
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,830
No matter what the result it, I can accept it. Because of my personal problem,

70
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,250
I've caused problems for everyone. I'm sorry.

71
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,760
Don't be a hypocrite.

72
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,010
Anyway, you guys don't think I'm suitable to be a mentor.

73
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,100
You shouldn't withdraw. I'll withdraw.

74
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,200
Are you still running away?

75
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,350
Let me tell you the result now.

76
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,570
The committee thinks, even though Jiang Qianfan has lost his taste,

77
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,510
but based on Lin Kesong's performance,

78
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,300
it hasn't affected his teaching. Therefore, Jiang Qianfan,

79
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,940
your mentor qualification is still effective.

80
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,880
Boris,

81
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,420
Montgomery's last wish is for the two of us to participate in the competition.

82
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,570
I need you to complete his wish together.

83
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,850
What's up?

84
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,990
This bike is really good-looking. Is it your favorite?

85
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,300
If you need anything, just say it.

86
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,160
There is nothing much. I'm just looking for some inspiration for the final competition.

87
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,510
Why are you here then? How can you count on an anorexic to inspire you?

88
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,440
Aren't you curious why you don't like eating?

89
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,190
I'm not curious.

90
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,070
Actually, I've been seriously thinking about this matter.

91
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,440
From childhood on,

92
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,420
didn't any food give you a tiny bit of desire?

93
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,140
Not at all.

94
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,470
I don't believe it. I'm sure there is. I'll give you three seconds. If you don't tell me,

95
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,590
you can say bye to your favorite bike.

96
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,170
What do you want? Don't touch it!

97
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,920
- Three.
- Anyway, if you break any bike here,

98
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,070
you will have to pay for the damage.

99
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,480
I'll exchange food for the bike. Two!

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,160
- Are you crazy?
- One!

101
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,060
Cream cake!

102
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,450
Cream cake with glutinous rice filling.

103
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,140
You said it before, everything has a life.

104
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,850
Don't worry. I remember it. I'm very interested in the cream cake that you told me about.

105
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,860
Fatty, so round!

106
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,540
Fat like a pig!

107
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,250
The cake is here.

108
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,350
Here, hurry and eat.

109
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,280
What did you do in this exam? You only knew to steal a bite in class.

110
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,580
It's really delicious.

111
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,130
Eat! Eat! Eat! You only know to eat!

112
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,200
You haven't finished writing homework, and you only know to eat snacks.

113
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,070
Why wouldn't you eat it?

114
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,550
Mom is not nagging you.

115
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,300
If you continue like this, you'll be a lazy person when you grow up.

116
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,980
Try it.

117
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,720
You've eaten the cake. Aren't you satisfied now?

118
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,990
Is it fun to bully me?

119
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,530
No, what do you mean I bully you?

120
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,290
Didn't I bring you here to find the taste you missed?

121
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,310
Sorry. I'm not eating. Thanks.

122
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,690
What do you mean?

123
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,120
Hey, what do you mean?

124
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,070
Chu Ting, coffee.

125
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,560
You can chat.

126
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,310
Thanks.

127
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,200
Can I ask you about something?

128
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,560
Speak.

129
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,070
Why do you look so pretty today?

130
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,100
Thanks. Should I tell you my lipstick's number?

131
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,120
No, no, no. That's not what I meant. I mean, why are you dressed so prettily today?

132
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,350
These are all old clothes that you've seen before.

133
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,770
Ah, really? I didn't notice before.

134
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,100
Sorry, I need to get this call.

135
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,540
Bonjour. How are you doing?
(in French)

136
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,430
Yeah, you're right. So, I'll see you in Paris.

137
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,070
Bye.

138
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,260
Bye.

139
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,450
Italian?

140
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,760
French.

141
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,220
How many languages do you know?

142
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,440
I've never counted. About six or seven.

143
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,130
Some languages are very similar, such as Russian and Ukrainian.

144
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,530
They can be counted as one or two.

145
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,440
You are really awesome. What did you like about me originally?

146
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,620
Probably I was enchanted by your handsome face. Do you like this answer?

147
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,870
No. I remember you said this before. Your biggest dream

148
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,570
is to have your own house, your own store,

149
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,470
and your own husband, children, and a dog. You'll be responsible to support the family.

150
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,530
Even if I wasn't ambitious, it was fine with you.

151
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,160
That's true. I did say something like that.

152
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,420
At that time, you even said that you were only a child.

153
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,140
That's because I was too immature at that time.

154
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,630
I was too silly. I finally understand now

155
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,530
that's how you saw me. Frankly,

156
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,480
I really don't feel good about it.

157
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,760
If the marginal effect decreases to be negative, it means

158
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,440
the total effect will also gradually decrease. Okay.

159
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,200
Our class ends here today. Class is dismissed.

160
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,080
That was a long class.

161
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,490
Let's go to class together next time.

162
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,710
Let's meet next time.

163
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,720
Okay, bye.

164
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,850
[Supreme Treasure]

165
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,020
I'm really sorry.

166
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,220
I didn't know you experienced all those things.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,890
I don't blame you.

168
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,600
I just hate myself.

169
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,090
All those things have been many years in the past.

170
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,880
This hurdle

171
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,470
is something that I just can't get over.

172
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,560
No. How can you hate yourself?

173
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,520
They gave you nicknames and did those things that hurt you.

174
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,340
They committed wrongs. You shouldn't hate yourself.

175
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,820
I don't want to be like this, either.

176
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,560
I-I've always tried many ways to overcome it.

177
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,520
But the lollipop that I wanted to get when I was little, now that I get it,

178
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,890
I already can't taste its flavor.

179
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,650
After a long time, many things

180
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,510
change. If you want to look at them again,

181
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,990
it's really difficult.

182
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,260
I'm here. You won't need to be afraid.

183
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,750
Let me tell you, my cooking is the most unique in the world.

184
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,100
I can definitely help you resolve the problem.

185
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,780
The feeling from being able to tell everything is really good.

186
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,920
It doesn't matter. You just need some time.

187
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,450
I think you are already doing well. See?

188
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,440
You are hard-working and persistent.

189
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,200
Now you have new friends and a new life.

190
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,210
Let me tell you a secret.

191
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,060
Do you know why I draw circles here?

192
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,490
It's because I've had dark circles around my eyes since I was a child.

193
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,940
Okay.

194
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,740
Do you want to try a bite now?

195
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,760
I've got it. I realized how you made the seafood rice.

196
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,500
Floral fragrance, right? You must grow a lot of flowers at your home.

197
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,140
Wrong again. There is only one more guess left of the 18 guesses.

198
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,500
You'd better ask carefully, or you'd be punished again.

199
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,350
Why is it so difficult to guess?

200
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,280
Forget it. I'm not guessing again.

201
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,690
Let me tell you something. From now on, you'll take care of the mint.

202
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,230
Mint is easy to grow. Just remember to water it thoroughly, and prune them regularly.

203
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,170
Once they mature, you can cut them to soak in the water for drinking. You'll definitely like the taste.

204
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,910
I've always wanted to have my own vegetable garden since I was little.

205
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,820
This way, whatever I want to eat, I'll just grow it.

206
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,110
But our house is a single story, and Mom and Dad wouldn't let me do it.

207
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,890
This is strange. Don't girls' usually dream

208
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,890
about browsing in the stores to buy clothes?

209
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:09,270
Your dream is a bit like a regular housewife's.

210
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,580
But it sounds reasonable, too. After all, you are a girl who only likes to shop at the grocery market. Right?

211
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,550
What do you know? My vegetable garden is really nice.
The turbulence passed without dangers.

212
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,470
He said that he realized it wasn't as scary as he had imagined.

213
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,680
I said that's right. This world is a lot warmer than he had imagined.

214
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,400
I thought the most difficult stuff had already happened. So the days in the aftermath

215
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,160
should be full of joy and laughter. But I was wrong.

216
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,290
An even bigger crisis

217
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,920
was already arriving quietly.

218
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,770
Are you getting fat? Very adorable.

219
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,890
Don't fuss! Don't fuss! Enough, enough.

220
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,890
- Come here.
- No more playing.
- Come here.
- No more playing.

221
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,950
Come here!

222
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,890
Why are you always...

223
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,340
Come back.

224
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,950
I'm okay. I'm just a little tired.

225
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,750
You look good this way.

226
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,920
No more kidding.

227
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,890
Let's go. Let's finish planting the mints.

228
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,710
How long does this kind of blindness last?

229
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,480
About half a minute.

230
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,800
Has it occurred before?

231
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,950
Twice in the past. But it lasted longer this time.

232
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,900
I'll prescribe an order for you. You'll get a CT scan for your head.

233
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,850
Is this serious?

234
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,450
It's not easy to say yet.

235
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,730
Come. Let me give you a preliminary exam first.

236
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,520
I'm back.

237
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,120
Sister Ting is back. I was looking for you too.

238
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,630
What's the matter?

239
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,800
Heavens! Really?

240
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,230
Congratulations! I'll give you something. Wait.

241
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,320
Chang Yuan.

242
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,990
Come take a look.

243
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,330
How is it? Is it pretty?

244
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,040
It's pretty. When did you buy it? I didn't know.

245
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,860
I bought it because I thought it was really cute. I didn't know it's perfect to give you.

246
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,520
Sister Ting, you are so thoughtful.

247
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,590
I don't know how to tell you.

248
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,350
What's the matter?

249
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,160
It's...

250
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,660
Your husband wants you to stay home and rest?

251
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,610
Yes. He wants me to rest in the first months before working again.

252
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,470
Let the baby stabilize first. Because in the past...

253
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,290
No problem. You should rest. After all, the baby is the most important now.

254
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,980
Then...

255
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,680
You're welcome to return whenever you want to come back.

256
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,300
Thank you, Sister Ting.

257
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,420
Toxin? What toxin?

258
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,820
What does optic atrophy mean?

259
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,670
Have you come into contact with anything unusual?

260
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,750
Such as?

261
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,620
Such as some unusual food ingredients.

262
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,520
No.

263
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,270
Then, have you gone under any other treatments or taken alternative medications?

264
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,750
I only took the medicine that you gave me last time. Is there a side effect?

265
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,180
Those are vitamins. It should be nothing.

266
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,990
What do you mean?

267
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,720
Don't bother me with that stuff now, okay?

268
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,630
Other than that,

269
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,460
I only took the ones that you asked me to throw out, and I finished them.

270
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,030
All of them?

271
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,660
How many did you take every day?

272
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,730
Four tablets.

273
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,910
Are you crazy?

274
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,170
Don't tell me that now.

275
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,030
Just tell me directly, what will happen to me?

276
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,790
You will become blind.

277
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,020
What? He's losing his sight? Is it because of me?

278
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,490
We can't tell as of right now. It's too complicated.

279
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:51,150
I called you so you can be prepared.

280
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:56,060
You have to be prepared because Qianfan may not be able to work anymore.

281
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,180
I can't keep hiding this from him. Oliver is so miserable.

282
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,160
I'm at ease now that he has Lin Kesong is helping him. There's nothing for me to be concerned about.

283
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,710
Give me back the contract, Mom.

284
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,240
Let's just pretend this never happened.

285
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,820
Let's not make Oliver think that I'm that unforgivable.

286
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,990
Do you think that Jiang Qianfan would forgive you without this contract?

287
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,200
It's fine if he doesn't forgive me. I'm at fault.

288
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,970
I deserve to be punished.

289
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,600
So you don't need this contract.

290
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,770
Can you predict how Jiang Qianfan will react?

291
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,590
You love him so much, but it's obvious how much he hates you.

292
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,030
If he really loses his sight one day,

293
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,520
it's hard to say what he'll do.

294
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,230
What you need to understand now is that me keeping the contract is what's best for you.

295
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,210
It's the bulletproof vest I've prepared for you.

296
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,060
Mom, I don't need a bulletproof vest. I'm not scared.

297
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,360
No, you can't go.

298
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,900
Victor, you know?

299
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,970
He doesn't know anything.

300
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,060
I know. Jiang Qianfan is doing fine. He's not affected at all by his loss of taste.

301
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Losing his sight is nothing at all.

302
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,520
Mom's right. You don't know anything.

303
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,630
You don't know what you're talking about.

304
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,950
I don't care. I don't want you to go to jail. I don't want to be the brother of a criminal.

305
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,650
Victor, calm down.

306
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,250
You're the one who should calm down, Elise.

307
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:32,020
Victor is about to compete soon. I'm sure you know what the competition means to him.

308
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,470
So you better not do anything during this critical time.

309
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,160
Fine.

310
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,130
Sure, bro. You can pay me every three months if it's convenient for you.

311
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,530
Otherwise, just pay once a month. As long as it's on time.

312
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,420
This can be discussed.

313
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,790
Don't worry. I'm not making money from you. I'm renting it to you for how much I'm renting it.

314
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,560
I can show you the contract if you don't believe me.

315
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,870
Don't worry, I'll clean it up for you.

316
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,830
Alright, bye.

317
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,890
Chu Ting, did you see my notebook?

318
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,690
[I have it.]

319
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,430
Why didn't you tell me you found it? I was worried for nothing.

320
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,730
[I don't have it.]

321
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,590
Fine, just keep messing with me.

322
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:48,360
[What are you up to?]

323
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,780
[We had a lot of misunderstanding in the past, but]

324
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,500
[The cake today was actually very delicious!]
[Are you doing okay?]

325
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,490
[The cake today was actually very delicious!]

326
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,700
A bottle of beer, please.

327
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,180
Your beer.

328
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,310
♫ Rainclouds flow above my head ♫

329
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:26,830
♫ Wait for lightning come and go ♫

330
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:34,700
♫ Colors fading when you go ♫

331
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:42,390
♫ Memory is sinking to black hole ♫

332
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,380
♫ I will keep you warm and fine ♫

333
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:57,810
♫ If you're willing to come back ♫

334
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:06,190
♫ To embrace the rising storm ♫

335
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,690
♫ You will find the treasure of your life ♫

336
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:21,260
♫ You will find the treasure of your life ♫

337
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,780
Mr. Jiang.

338
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,820
Mr. Jiang.

339
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,600
You're not asleep either?

340
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,350
The sky looks beautiful today. I wanted to look at the stars.

341
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:20,300
What's up with you? Why are you being so romantic all of a sudden?

342
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,630
Did you have a good sleep?

343
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:26,630
Of course, I slept well. Once my head hits the pillow, I will sleep well.

344
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,120
Are you nervous about my upcoming competition?

345
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,770
Let's say that it is that.

346
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,900
Do you know why I'm not nervous this time?

347
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,860
Because I have realized something.

348
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,950
Actually I also know, that based on my standard

349
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,730
I am far below others

350
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,520
let alone Victor.

351
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,480
So as long as I can even compete with them in the same venue

352
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,190
it already means I have won.

353
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,590
What you said makes a lot of sense.

354
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,260
That is why, when you are in the competition, you should not care about anyone else.

355
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,760
Just concentrate on yourself.

356
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,190
Let's go, have some breakfast, shall we?

357
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,740
Let's go.

358
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,320
dang dang dang dang

359
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,000
At that time I didn't know why he was sitting there watching me make breakfast

360
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,300
and even more did not understand the intensity of his gaze

361
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,350
now I know it is because he was trying to cherish everything that he could see.

362
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,850
What are you watching me so intently, haven't you seen me make breakfast before?

363
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,690
Oh no.

364
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,400
Put it here.

365
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,770
Here, this is for you.

366
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,100
Let's eat.

367
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,830
Xiaoyu!

368
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,960
Xiaoyu, open the door!

369
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,490
Xiaoyu!

370
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,150
How come you are here?

371
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:34,360
Why do you look so bad? Did you not sleep again?

372
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,320
Why do you care?

373
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,490
Xiaoyu, you are making me worry.

374
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,530
When did you start worrying about me, Boris? What happened?

375
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,740
Yes, something actually did happen.

376
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,730
Xiaoyu,

377
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,750
although it is a bit late, I would still like to have a proper chat with you.

378
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,750
Shut up! I should have guessed that you would want to say this type of thing.

379
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,360
We are just about to compete, can you take out your fighting spirit!

380
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,550
If you can't, please leave.

381
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,250
Okay, I wouldn't say anymore.

382
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,980
But you really don't have to be so nervous.

383
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,030
Are you afraid that you can't win against Lin Kesong?

384
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,190
Me afraid? Afraid of her?

385
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,800
You really don't think that much of me, do you. This is me being excited.

386
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,310
You really have no ambition, just a little bit of work and you think it is done.

387
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,390
Anyway I am not like that, I want perfection

388
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,360
Lin Kesong has gotten too much.

389
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,890
I want to beat her down to her original size. And have Jiang Qianfan cry until there is no tomorrow.

390
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,260
Isn't that your purpose too?

391
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,420
Too much excitement is not a good thing.

392
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,520
Just play it out naturally, As long as you play it out naturally you will definitely do well.

393
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,200
Take your time, I am going to take a shower.

394
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,660
Are you having a drink?

395
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,460
No, thank you.

396
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,780
I think you have had enough too. That was quite a number of glasses.

397
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,990
Don't be so nervous.

398
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,950
I'm nervous? Too funny.

399
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,470
Your leg is shaking.

400
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,060
That doesn't mean anything.

401
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:54,130
I'm at my optimal self. Have some confidence in me, Boris.

402
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,000
That's fine, you can go ahead first.

403
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,500
I will look for you if I need you.

404
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,730
Faster, faster.

405
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,990
Sorry, Mister.

406
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,260
This is for personnel only.

407
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,930
I am a parent.

408
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,730
Sorry, even parents can't come in. You need a pass.

409
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,490
What, you need a pass?

410
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,780
I didn't bring a pass.

411
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,130
Sorry if you didn't bring it, you can't enter.

412
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,710
I am Lin Xiaoyu's dad. Lin Kesong's uncle.

413
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,400
What pass do I need?

414
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,310
Sorry you need a pass. Without a pass you cannot enter.

415
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,600
If you say it like that, it doesn't make sense, are you trying to bully me?

416
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,030
Morning Boris.

417
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,110
Hi Blu, what are you doing here? Your competition is tomorrow.

418
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,940
Xiaoyu, I wish you all the best in the competition.

419
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,030
Why aren't you wishing me the win of the competition?

420
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,020
What?

421
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:13,120
I said, why aren't you wishing me the win of the competition, so that I can win the competition?

422
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,490
That is enough Xiaoyu. Isn't wishing you the best the same as wishing that you will win?

423
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,160
Not the same!

424
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,480
Yes, you are right, it is not the same.

425
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,560
To me, all the best is the best wish.

426
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,220
You should enjoy your competition.

427
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,690
You are so certain that I wouldn't win this competition.

428
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,430
Sorry, take it like I didn't say anything.

429
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,520
The competition is starting soon. You should rest.

430
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,730
No, clear this up with me now.

431
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:40,130
I don't want to say anything anymore.

432
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,180
Stop right there!

433
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:48,560
You weren't always like that towards me, it's all because I shot that video and you are not happy with that.

434
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,090
You want me to lose the competition!

435
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,730
You said that, I didn't say that.

436
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,630
But that is what you think! You take me as the bad guy.

437
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,080
You came here so early just to laugh at me, isn't it?

438
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,960
That's enough, Lin Xiaoyu! You're being too stubborn and extreme!

439
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,910
You're right. I came here early to see you,

440
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,580
but I'm not here to laugh at you.

441
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,460
I just wanted to see if you were okay after what happened.

442
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,900
I didn't expect you to think of me in that way.

443
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,960
I'm getting so disappointed in you.

444
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,300
You should be disappointed. I'm only doing what I think is right.

445
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,390
I really hope that you can defeat Victor.

446
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,920
In that way, I can compete with you in the finals. But I have no confidence in you at all.

447
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,310
- How am I not cooperating with you?
- You can't enter without an ID.

448
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,170
- How else can I cooperate with you?
- Uncle.
- Mr. Lin.

449
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,990
- Mr. Jiang.
- He's a participant's family member, it's okay.
- What are you doing here?

450
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,500
I'm here for Lin Xiaoyu.

451
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,750
- You could've just told me.
- Dad, what are you doing here?

452
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,910
Lin Xiaoyu, since you're here, I'll say everything now.

453
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:50,400
Just one sentence. I hope you get utterly defeated in this competition.

454
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,500
- Dad.
- Uncle.

455
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,860
If someone like you can be successful,

456
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,110
I've spent my past fifty years in vain and you're completely hopeless.

457
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,150
Dad, did you just come here to say this to me?

458
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,830
I'm your dad.

459
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,160
I hope that you can fail now

460
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,000
to stop what you're doing. People should have a conscience and be kind.

461
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,640
Do you know that everyone is watching you?

462
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,250
Why do I care what others think of me? I do whatever I want!

463
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,290
What can you do about it? I do what I want!

464
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,960
You're really hopeless!

465
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,550
Uncle Lin!

466
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,870
Uncle, don't get angry.

467
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,500
Don't stop me!

468
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:47,350
Lin Xiaoyu, you must win.

469
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:53,940
Uncle, don't be mad. Xiaoyu just really wants to win.

470
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:01,170
Go back inside and prepare for the competition.

471
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,470
I'm so ashamed to have such a daughter.

472
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,490
Mr. Lin, I don't blame Xiaoyu at all.

473
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:12,480
Xiaoyu is pretty innocent. She's just under the influence of Boris.

474
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,790
You don't have to comfort me.

475
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,460
I'm her dad. How can I not wish her well?

476
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,270
But I am really really scared that if she were to win.

477
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:25,860
Because if she won, then she would think that all the bad things she has done were right

478
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,370
And if it got to that stage, it is over.

479
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,230
She will be totally destroyed.

480
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,270
I'm going now.

481
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,050
I don't know how to console him.

482
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,470
It will all be okay.

483
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,180
Let's go..

484
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:05,620
♫ You are the stranger I want to know ♫

485
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,620
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

486
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,650
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

487
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:19,910
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

488
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,900
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

489
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:28,340
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

490
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,850
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
