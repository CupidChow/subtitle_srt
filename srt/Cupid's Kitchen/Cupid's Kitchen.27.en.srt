00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,400
We are entering the countdown.

1. Time's up.

14
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,120
I would like to have a brief interview with Miss Lin Kesong while the judges are busy.

15
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,280
I believe the audiences were confused by Lin Kesong's actions just like I did.

16
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,170
Miss Lin Kesong, why did you dump the stuffing you almost finished making

17
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,680
and use another pan to make the stuffing again?

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,820
Because Mr. Thomas was using a bronze pan to make his.

19
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,660
The first time I made it, I was using a pan with non-stick layers.

20
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,490
How did you know? Could you taste the bronze?

21
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,210
I can't believe you can taste the tiny bit of bronze.

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,650
So is she right about it?

23
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,730
Who else can make it to the final round?

24
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,230
Sorry.

25
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,560
Are you losing your hair, brother?

26
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,830
Thank you.

27
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,980
Thank you, everyone.

28
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,860
I just tasted eight servings of ducks.

29
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,300
I am feeling a bit full.

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,530
If I slip out a burp later,

31
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,130
please forgive me.

32
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,150
The theme of this competition is "Replication".

33
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,490
So when I was making this Eight Treasure Duck,

34
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,560
I used five different kinds of salt

35
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,590
and ingredients from the same places.

36
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,220
I used Jiancheng Duck

37
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,730
from Sichuan.

38
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,750
Because this kind of duck has tight flesh

39
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,890
and has a lot of oil in it. When I was working on the surface,

40
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,160
I used Shenhaijing Rough Salt,

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,430
from Sichuan, Zigong.

42
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,900
For the stuffing,

43
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,150
I used Qingyuan mushrooms and sautéed them.

44
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,490
And then I used Tongjin Salt to season it.

45
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,630
I also added Iberico ham marinated with Ibiza Sea Salt.

46
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,760
This ham is produced

47
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,700
from the black pork from Iberian Peninsula of Spain.

48
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,390
Because they were fed acron,

49
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,900
so their meat has a special taste.

50
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,800
Finally, the stuffing that was hiding in the deep,

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,950
I used the duck yolks marinated with Huai Salt from Jiangsu.

52
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,160
After mixing these ingredients

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,400
and sautéed them, their tastes merge together

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,860
and really brings out the fragrance of duck meant.

55
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,010
About the sauce,

56
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,800
I used the abalone from Wando, South Korea

57
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,940
to match with

58
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,470
the Korean yellow salt that isn't too salty.

59
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,630
This kind of abalone eats kelp

60
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,030
and see greens while growing up.

61
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,260
So the taste of the finishing dish is very fresh and sweet.

62
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,700
Unfortunately, among our competitors,

63
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,280
only six of them got all six ingredients right.

64
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,360
Of course,

65
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,970
I can also answer Miss Lin Kesong's question here.

66
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,870
That's right. I did use the bronze pan

67
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,730
to sauté these stuffings.

68
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,380
Because bronze pan can better transfer the heat.

69
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,600
Therefore, when sautéing the stuffings,

70
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,060
the ingredients can get heated evenly,

71
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,570
and the texture will also be better.

72
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,400
Let's announce

73
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,970
the final result of this competition.

74
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,890
Miss Lin Kesong

75
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,060
used her shocking exceptional sense of taste

76
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,530
to recreate Babao Duck's meat, stuffing,

77
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,900
and sauce perfectly.

78
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,290
Unfortunately,

79
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,630
the presentation is really lacking.

80
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,950
Also, the color and the arrangement are not thought through.

81
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,140
Those deducted points for you. The perfect combination of color, fragrance, and tastes

82
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,670
is made by Victor.

83
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,900
Therefore, Mr. Victor comes in first.

84
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,230
Miss Lin Kesong comes in second.

85
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,900
Miss Lin Xiaoyu comes in third.

86
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,680
Yay!

87
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,230
That's my daughter.

88
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,820
That's right! She is great!

89
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,740
As this round ends,

90
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,140
we have our top four chefs from Mueller's Future Star Culinary Competition.

91
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,220
Their names are, Victor Quentin.

92
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,040
Lin Xiaoyu,

93
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,740
Blu Weini,

94
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,880
and Lin Kesong. Congratulations!

95
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,590
This is awesome!

96
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,290
Let's cook! Half off for everyone today!

97
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,780
-Alright!
-Everyone!

98
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,570
Let me tell you. Our two Lin girls

99
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,260
both got in the top four. 50% off for everyone!

100
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,630
Half off!

101
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,510
The alcohol is free, right?

102
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,190
That's alright. Let's double the happiness. Two beers for them!

103
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,550
If you have this price every day, we will be here every day!

104
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,210
Great! Order more!

105
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,780
I will order six more.

106
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,850
-Kitchen, hurry up!
-Alright!

107
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,870
Have some water, brother.

108
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,720
What are you watching?

109
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,480
Nothing.

110
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,550
It's a cooking competition website. My friend is in it.

111
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,860
How did he do?

112
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,820
Very good. She was doing so well that I barely recognize her.

113
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,170
So it's a girl. Do I know her?

114
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,040
You don't.

115
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,470
Brother, you are here for Chu Ting, right?

116
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,240
Just yell at me if you want. I will listen.

117
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,900
Chu Ting's father called me this morning.

118
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,460
He knows.

119
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,020
Chu Ting told her father everything. Her father told me that

120
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,780
you young people should resolve it yourselves.

121
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,950
It won't affect our business, so I don't need to feel guilty about it.

122
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,620
-He knows the big picture.
-That's right.

123
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,810
I'm surprised, but at the same time, I'm not. Only people who look at the big picture

124
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,550
can grow big business.

125
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,650
I have so much to learn.

126
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,660
Ran Ran, it was my fault.

127
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,860
I put all the pressure on you.

128
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,770
Brother, don't say that.

129
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,700
You've been taking all the responsibility for the company.

130
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,860
If I could help a little bit,

131
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,420
it wouldn't be so difficult for you right now.

132
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,210
Don't feel guilty about it. Mom and Dad passed away too early.

133
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,560
It's my obligation to take care of you.

134
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,930
Brother, thank you.

135
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,830
Because of you, I get to live such a happy life and don't have to worry about money.

136
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,310
I can wake up whenever I want to.

137
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,520
But because of this, I still haven't done anything and I'm already 24.

138
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,730
I don't want to keep being like this.

139
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,400
Ok. You are already 24.

140
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,360
Do whatever you want with your career, relationships, and your life.

141
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,320
I won't interfere.

142
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:57,070
I have to thank everyone who participated in the competition.

143
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,990
No matter it's the judge or the competitors,

144
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,110
in my eyes, you guys are the greatest.

145
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,900
But now, I have a question.

146
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,980
I would like to ask Miss Lin Kesong.

147
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,460
I saw in the break room camera,

148
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,350
you and Mr. Jiang Qianfan got here half an hour early.

149
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,540
But why were you late for the competition?

150
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,110
If you really can't remember, that's okay.

151
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,350
Then I'll ask Lin Xiaoyu.

152
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,740
Lin Xiaoyu,

153
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,150
In the parking lot's security recording, I saw

154
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,730
you and Lin Kesong get into Boris's car together.

155
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,160
But 12 minutes later,

156
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,690
you came back alone by bike.

157
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,550
Can you explain this to me?

158
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,940
Where did you go during that time?

159
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,320
When you're not at the competition site, that's your personal time.

160
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,560
Lin Xiaoyu has the right to not respond.

161
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,630
Then, Lin Kesong, what about you?

162
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,070
I also have nothing to say. Sorry.

163
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,040
Jiang Qianfan, what about you?

164
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,330
I'll go with Lin Kesong.

165
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,200
Okay, since you all say that,

166
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,120
then I will not pursue this matter anymore.

167
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,680
But I must tell you this.

168
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,520
This is the twentieth Future Star competition.

169
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,670
In other words, I have been the chairman of the competition for 10 years already.

170
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,790
During this time, whether it be darkness and evil,

171
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,430
whether it was warm, or miserable,

172
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,670
or inspiring,

173
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,860
I want to tell you all,

174
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,890
every competitor,

175
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,190
if they are dishonest,

176
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,540
or if they are not completely focused on the competition,

177
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,340
they will definitely lose miserably, with no exception.

178
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,130
I hope you understand what I am saying.

179
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,250
Alright. Now, let's begin

180
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,060
to decide the groups for the semifinals.

181
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,930
Let's start with Lin Kesong.

What a coincidence.

187
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,460
Thomas was targeting me.

188
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,350
Because I don't like lying.

189
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,440
If you don't help me explain, how will others view me?

190
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,320
It can't be that you still want to be friends with them.

191
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,720
So what if Thomas is targeting you?

192
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,530
I've said this before.

193
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,930
No one can do anything to you!

194
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,090
I can't stand the way others are looking at me.

195
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,290
You don't care. I care!

196
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,890
You've worked so hard to get here.

197
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,600
Your name is behind Lin Kesong's!

198
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,200
And you still care about how others look at you?

199
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,160
You should care about the competition. Competition!

200
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,070
Enough! Boris, I've really had enough.

201
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,370
All along, I've listened to you and respected you.

202
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,240
I did everything that you told me to.

203
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,300
The result? This didn't affect Lin Kesong at all. Instead it's me!

204
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,060
My heart is anxious.

205
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,570
When I saw her appear at the competition,

206
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,090
I was shocked.

207
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,860
Only I know how hard I've worked to make it through the competition this far.

208
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,340
Why do you think my results are so bad? It's all because of you!

209
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,820
I won't listen to you anymore.

210
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,210
Useless! Pathetic!

211
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,730
You're so easily defeated by such a minor thing. I was wrong to put my faith in you!

212
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,040
I was wrong to trust you too!

213
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,390
Are you really not going?

214
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,730
I'm not going. Let me ask you,

215
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,000
why is your appetite still so good?

216
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
- Young lady, here are your pot stickers.
- It's because I'm so angry at Xiaoyu.

217
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,830
She is too evil. I won't bother with her ever again.

218
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,530
The things that Boris did to me

219
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,930
are worse than Lin Xiaoyu. Don't think about it anymore.

220
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,000
- Sister, how much?
- ¥6.

221
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,730
- I sent the payment to you.
- Okay, got it.

222
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,860
What did he do to you?

223
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,430
I don't have the spirit or time to think about these things.

224
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,790
I can't remember.

225
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,490
I'm different from you. I can't do that.

226
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,870
- How is it?
- It's delicious.

227
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,570
Do you feel better?

228
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,560
Let me. As a chef, you can't even use chopsticks.

229
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,340
Yes, you're so great and talented.

230

- It's hot!
- Eat it all.

You saw the competition?

Not at all. It's been so long since we've been in touch.

238
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,620
I'm not that impressive.

Hey, Benfen.

240
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,710

244
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,330
The girl that you refused to accept back then.

245
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,480
What are you doing?

246
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,470
To be honest, I really should thank you.

247
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,000
Good thing you didn't take a liking to her.

248
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,040
If you did, she wouldn't be where she is today. Right?

249
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,580
Truth proves that my daughter is the world's most perfect girl.

250
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,650
If anyone doubted her, it's because they have poor judgment.

251
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,800
Do you admit it? Do you admit—

252
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,600
That's enough. That should be about enough.

253
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,960
Give it here. Give it here.

254
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,890
I've held it in for half my life. I must say it until I'm happy.

255
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,850
Did you hear my voice message yet?

256
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,360
If you received it, hurry and apologize to me.

257
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,120
Okay?

258
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,110
I've achieved a complete victory on all sides.

259
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,050
- What did he say?
- He blocked me.

260
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,880
You deserve it.

Okay, call the parcel service.

264
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,780
Dr. Xie, I saw your application to use your home as collateral.

265
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,720
What happened to make you use your home as collateral.

266
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:57,190
Bro. To be honest, I've run into some trouble lately.

267
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,120
I need money quickly. Very, very quickly. Really.

268
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,810
It's like this. For a loan of ¥2,000,000,

269
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,250
you need to tell me a practical use for it.

270
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:13,100
I don't have a practical use for it. I can't make up a reason and lie to you.

271
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,180
It's for personal use.

272
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,160
How about this? I can give you my entire salary when I receive it each month.

273
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,960
I can definitely pay back the loan. And if you have any service fees for an urgent loan, I can pay those fees too.

274
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,380
Don't need anything like a service fee. But for a situation like yours,

275
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,400
if we go by the bank's policy,

276
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,090
the loan's interest rate might be as much as 15% higher.

277
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,580
No problem. No problem. I can do that.

278
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,530
Okay. Then this afternoon, I'll arrange a loan approval meeting.

279
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,000
-Okay.
-If everything goes smoothly, come sign the contract tomorrow.

280
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,170
Okay. Okay. Okay. Too good. Too good. Thank you.

281
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,050
- Remember to put it on tomorrow.
- Okay.

283

Elise, what's wrong?

284
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,580
I'm fine.

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,110
Your foot?!

286
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,150
What happened?

287
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,610
I just twisted it by accident. I already iced it.

288
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,530
Not a big thing. I'll be fine after resting.
[Junbin: The money will be raised soon. Whetherto confess or not, think of yourself. Don't do it. ]

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,660
Victor, go buy medicine for your sister.

290
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,980
Don't need to go through the trouble. I'm fine.

291
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,630
Don't you want to get better faster?

292
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,260
Victor, what are you waiting for? Go quickly.

293
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,020
Okay, mama.

294
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,300
What's with the money?

295
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,240
What do you mean?

296
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,820
I saw Dr. Xie's message. Who is the money for?

297
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,660
Li Yan?

298
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,450
No. No. No. Mama. Nothing. It's nothing.

299
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,820
Okay, if you think that you can hide it from me, then don't tell me the truth.

300
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,620
How much?

301
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,860
Altogether, I already gave him

302
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,960
¥230,000. This time he asked me for ¥2,000,000.

303
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,790
He said that it's the last time.

304
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,520
Do you believe it?

305
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,150
I don't believe it. I don't want to pull Jun Bin into this either. But

306
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,450
I don't know what to do.

307
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,360
So you want to tell Jiang Qianfan everything?

308
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,200
Yes, mama. I want to be honest with him.

309
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,800
Every day, I've been living in fear and anxiety. Afraid that one day Oliver will find out.

310
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,740
This feeling is too hard to take.

311
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,950
I can't take it anymore. I want to tell him myself.

312
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,260
You really are a kind-hearted child. Did you think it through?

313
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,090
If you tell Jiang Qianfan, what will you do if he hands you over to the police?

314
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,660
Are you prepared to go to jail?

315
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,520
I don't want to go to jail. He wouldn't do that.

316
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,390
That is hard to say. With his temper,

317
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,790
when you awaken it, it's frightening.

318
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,270
If he learns that you did it,

319
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,360
there's no saying what he will do.

320
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,410
Especially since what you did is no different from killing him.

321
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,080
Now you know why

322
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,330
I kept persuading you to sign that contract, right?

323
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,690
Yuxuan is like Jiang Qianfan's child.

324
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,140
If the need arises, I will give up his child to protect mine.

325
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:50,150
If Li Yan comes to see you again, tell him to come to me.

326
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,740
Okay.

327
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,490
Alright. I'll go change.

328
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,280
Junbing is so good to you.

329
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,060
[Junbing, I don't know how to thank you.]

330
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,920
[You don't need to thank me. I know that you're struggling a lot right now. I just want you to be able to make your choice without any external pressures.]

331
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,400
[I understand.]

332
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,170
[Xiaoyu's Private Kitchen]

333
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,670
Xiaoyu! It wasn't you, right?

334
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,490
You're so thoughtless. I have no idea what you're saying.

335
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,000
Lin Kesong was late to the competition. It wasn't because of you, was it?

336
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,800
Get your hands off me.

337
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,880
Do you want me to come inside the restaurant?

338
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,930
It wasn't you, right?

339
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,630
You didn't sabotage Lin Kesong. You're different from Boris!

340
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,080
It was me. I'm a bad person.

341
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,320
So please stay far away from me. Don't let me hurt you.

342
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,650
That's impossible! It definitely wasn't your idea.

343
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,140
It was Boris!

344
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,740
He has demons inside! Stay away from him, please!

345
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,700
He's my mentor. What do you want me to do, withdraw from the competition?

346
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,520
Blu. What are your real motives?

347
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,450
That's not what I mean. Don't think of me like that. I only want the best for you!

348
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,430
I don't want him to ruin you!

349
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,080
He got me into the top 4. That's the reality.

350
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,050
All the others too.

351
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,560
Everyone thinks this of me!

352
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,270
I don't know what other people think, but–

353
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,100
You do know! You just won't say it out loud!

354
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,160
No one likes me! Just like how none of you like Boris.

355
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,330
This is perfect. You've shown me that I have no other options.

356
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,780
Goodbye, Blu.

357
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,990
Lin Xiaoyu!

358
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:54,500
♫ Rainclouds float above my head ♫

359
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,420
♫ Wait for lightning come and go ♫

360
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:10,900
♫ Colors fading when you go ♫

361
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:17,640
♫ Memory is sinking to black hole ♫

362
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,260
That's not true!

363
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,680
When you get back, I'll treat you to a meal at Yuxuan. Bye-bye!

364
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,760
My classmate from Singapore said that they watched me on the livestream and I look prettier.

365
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,160
They asked if I got plastic surgery.

366
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,690
Did you hear what I said? They said I got prettier!

367
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,160
Hello? Hello?

368
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,960
Can you hear me?

369
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,980
I'm so pretty.

370
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,700
Sit tight.

371
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,110
I'm not as good as you guys are saying. I only made it to the top 4 so far.

372
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:23,190
You only studied for a month and you made it to the top 4 of an international competition. If you study for 2 months, doesn't that mean you'll be unstoppable?

373
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,170
Old Lin, you're amazing! Stop acting humble.

374
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,720
I'm not acting humble! I'm just average, average.

375
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,300
I always knew you weren't ordinary.

376
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,370
I know this because I was your deskmate for all 3 years of high school.

377
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,690
- You're definitely not average!
- At most, I'm just above average at eating.

378
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,860
I have a suggestion. In order to make sure Lin Kesong doesn't forget us now that she's famous,

379
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,710
shouldn't we go visit her soon?

380
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,270
Actually, you could come visit!

381
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,040
Because I still have another week before the next round of competition.

382
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,490
I can find some time to meet up with you guys. How about it?

383
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,970
Aren't you going to get changed?

384
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,290
I'm chatting with some old classmates.

385
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,380
I'll go get changed right now.

386
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,020
Kesong, are you still there?

387
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,530
We'll wait for you to come back!

388
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:12,470
I'm here, I'm here. I definitely have time! We can just figure out a time that works for all of us.

389
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,960
It's not like I have to train all the time anyway.

390
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm here.

391
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,760
Get out.

392
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,690
Where's your handkerchief?

393
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,040
I forgot it.

394
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,900
I put it on.

395
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,470
Get out.

396
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,700
What is it this time?

397
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,810
Go stand at the entrance. Come back inside when you've calmed down.

398
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,520
But you didn't use to ask this of me.

399
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,720
You didn't use to be this distracted either. Get out!

400
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,240
Give this to me.

401
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,350
What are you doing?

402
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,340
The thing I can't stand the most is when someone doesn't take cooking seriously. Don't you know that?

403
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,770
- What do you mean I'm not taking it seriously?
- Do you think you're almighty now? So you think you can just take it easy?

404
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,900
Do you really think you're better than the competitors who were eliminated?

405
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,730
Well, I made it into the top 4, and they didn't. That must mean I'm better than they are.

406
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,520
You think they couldn't make it into the top 4? Let me tell you the reality of the situation.

407
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,350
The reality is that you're the worst out of all 8 chefs. You don't even have the right to compete with them.

408
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:35,770
You got to where you are today because of me. You were lucky to make it this far in the competition.

409
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:40,030
Let me ask you. After making it into the top 4, what makes you think you can beat Lin Xiaoyu?

410
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,560
Are you going to win using the compliments you received over the phone?

411
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,960
You disagree? Then stand there until you agree with me.

412
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:01,200
Why am I the worst out of all 8 chefs? I clearly made it to the top 4.

413
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,100
Why don't I have the right to compete with them? I worked so hard to get here. You may have forgotten, but I haven't.

414
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,050
I deserve to be where I am today. How can he say I just got lucky?

415
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,610
How am I distracted?

416
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,690
I just wanted to enjoy my victory for a little bit.

417
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,600
Is it fun for you to tell me that I'm worthless?

418
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,650
Coming!

419
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,030
Hello, Ms. Lin Kesong.

420
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,430
Doctor Zhou, hello. Please come in.

421
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,020
You must be here to see Mr. Jiang.

422
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,120
No, actually, I'm here to see you.

423
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,800
Do you have time right now?

424
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,730
Me?

425
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,230
I'm free. Why did you want to see me?

426
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,590
Do you know what place I got in the Future Star Competition?

427
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,570
There were 8 competitors. And I got 8th place.

428
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,160
I'm not happy with this result.

429
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,020
You must be quite upset.

430
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,870
To be specific, I think it's unfair that you won over me.

431
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,460
I came because I want to have a one-on-one competition with you. I want to see what you can do.

432
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,270
I hope you can make me accept my loss.

433
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,090
Dawen. What are you doing here?

434
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,990
I was pretty free, so I came to see you guys.

435
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,950
Mr. Jiang. Doctor Zhou is just like you. He doesn't think it's fair that I made it into the top 4.

436
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,910
So he wants to compete against me.

437
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,240
Is that so? What do you want to compete with?

438
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,930
Mr. Jiang, I see that you made four different crab dishes.

439
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,420
That's right.

440
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,870
The theme of the semifinals is "fresh." Everyone knows the theory of "overflowing butter, soft golden oil."

441
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,870
So I plan to use these four crab dishes to start teaching Ms. Lin.

442
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,450
Then, why don't we compete with this?

443
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,660
Okay. We have all the materials already anyway.

444
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,060
Lin Kesong. Is that okay?

445
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,420
Why wouldn't it be?

446
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,590
Let's compete then.

447
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,170
Isn't it just a crab dish?

448
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,130
"Golden butter overflowing on a cold plate, the crab flavor will shock everyone who tries it."

449
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,420
"As tender as jade, the golden meat is soft and fragrant."

450
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,990
This is the Crab Poem.

451
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,890
It refers to the process of taking the yellow insides of the crab body, and using that to create "One-of-a-kind butter". (This is a dish that involves taking crab meat and mixing it with crab fat, ginger, green onion, pig fat, and wine.)

452
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,470
The taste is fresh and delicious.

453
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,290
Ms. Lin, could it be that you've never heard of this?

454
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,260
You're older than me, of course you would know these things.

455
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,340
How old are you?

456
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,850
I just turned 24.

457
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,390
But I started college when I was 16, so maybe that's why I seem older.

458
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:46,790
Alright. Since you're going to compete, let's get started.

459
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,990
Okay.

460
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,120
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

461
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,150
Please look after me.

462
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,130
Are you ready?

463
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,160
This dish seems to be quite complicated.

464
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,530
How do I make it?

465
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,090
- If you're ready, then start.
- Okay.

466
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,960
Mr. Jiang, can you be our judge?

467
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,530
I'm Lin Kesong's mentor.

468
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,720
It's not fair for me to be the judge.

469
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,450
Why don't you guys decide the winner of this competition yourselves?

470
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:00,350
What's the use in judging? The outcome is obvious.

471
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,260
Can I try the one you made?

472
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,820
Go ahead.

473
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,420
What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

474
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,500
It tastes too good.

475
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:29,050
This doesn't make sense. You made it to the top 4 in the competition.

476
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,380
You're so good at cooking. Why didn't you place higher in the competition?

477
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,760
I'll answer this question for you.

478
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,060
Dawen is a nutrition major. He places too much emphasis on the nutritional balance in a dish.

479
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,970
That's why the dishes he made during the competition didn't completely align with the competition theme.

480
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:50,550
- Isn't that right?
- That's right. For example, take the Eight Treasure Duck.

481
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,990
I think that Thomas's duck filling had an overly high proportion of duck meat.

482
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,000
So I reduced the amount of duck meat and added some vegetables to balance out the nutritional value.

483
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,540
For this steamed crab dish as well, I added some baby cabbage to increase the fiber content.

484
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,560
It's good that you added it. The sweetness of the cabbage enhances the flavor of the crab meat.

485
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,650
This is a stroke of genius. I give you 101 points.

486
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,290
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

487
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:14,160
I think that I'm too stubbornly focused on maintaining nutritional balance.

488
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,310
I'm not suited for a culinary competition. But I don't regret entering the competition, even though I placed in the bottom.

489
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,360
Don't say that.

490
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:26,320
How much time have you spent in the kitchen while learning from me?

491
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,570
24 hours a day...even if I never slept and only practiced cooking,

492
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,370
it would probably be 400-500 hours at most.

493
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,380
400-500?

494
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,650
Oh right. When you were chosen by Mr. Jiang, you weren't a chef yet.

495
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,860
Although I'm not a chef either.

496
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,840
Then how long have you spent in the kitchen?

497
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,720
Not much. Most of my time and energy is spent on nutritional research.

498
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,620
My time in the kitchen is probably...10,000 hours at most.

499
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,690
10,000 hours and you say it isn't much?

500
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,530
It really isn't much. I definitely can't compare to Mr. Jiang.

501
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,820
Even compared to Victor, Lin Xiaoyu, and Blu, it isn't much at all.

502
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,190
Mr. Jiang, I'm quite surprised at the results of today's competition.

503
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,960
I'll take my leave now.

504
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,220
Dawen, I'm sorry this competition wasn't more of a challenge. I'll walk you out.

505
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,990
- This way please.
- Thank you.

506
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,870
- Dawen.
- Yes?
- Thank you for today.

507
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,530
- I'm sorry for troubling you.
- No need to apologize, Mr. Jiang.

508
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,630
You are my idol. I'm very willing to help you.

509
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,820
To be honest, I only entered the competition because of you.

510
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,880
- What?
- I didn't imagine that you would choose Ms. Lin so early on.

511
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,810
Thank you for your admiration.

512
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,990
- But actually, even without Lin Kesong, I wouldn't be able to choose you.
- What?

513
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,830
Because cooking isn't your everything. Nutrition is. Isn't that right?

514
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,700
Thank you, Mr. Jiang. I understand.

515
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:57,570
Ms. Lin is so lucky. I never imagined she would need me to spur her on in her studies.

516
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,060
I didn't imagine it either.

517
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,330
I'll leave now then.

518
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,380
- Take care.
- Okay.

519
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,880
Lin Kesong!

520
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,830
I'm over here!

521
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,990
Lin Kesong?

522
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,060
What are you doing? Are you cosplaying?

523
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,130
Hey, you–

524
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:37,350
You were right. Of all these competitors, I'm the least skilled.

525
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,930
Realistically, I don't even have the right to compete with them.

526
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:45,410
But since I entered the competition already, I'll work hard until the end.

527
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:51,110
When I was little, my mom told me that I look really ugly with a bowl cut.

528
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,480
So I thought about it. I should make myself look ugly,

529
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,780
so that I won't want to go outside and do other things.

530
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,750
I'm ready now.

531
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,160
Ready for what?

532
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,030
Let me see. Let me see!

533
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,000
It's so ugly!

534
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,380
Let me see.

535
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,590
Let me see.

536
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,060
It's okay. I think it looks quite nice.

537
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,170
It does. Believe me.

538
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:29,480
And I feel like that girl who drank the toilet water is finally back now.

539
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,320
Okay?

540
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,500
Hello? Your leg is injured?

541
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,340
Okay. I'll come pick you up now.

542
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,810
Victor, let me.

543
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,390
Sit here.

544
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,590
Your seatbelt.

545
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,090
You shouldn't have come outside since you're injured like this.

546
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,000
I can't sit still at home. I need to work.

547
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,110
- It can't be helped. This is just how I am.
- Yuxuan is lucky to have you.

548
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,270
I'm the one who's lucky to have Yuxuan.

549
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,640
- There was an article that came out today, have you seen it? It's about Da Mei.
- No, I haven't.

550
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,610
Guess what the headline was.

551
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,340
"The pillar of Yuxuan."

552
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,060
If he's the backbone, then what does that make us?

553
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,400
I don't know either. Maybe some ornaments?

554
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,850
I didn't know that's what Da Wei wanted. If that's the case, it makes things easy.

555
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,800
We just need to do our jobs well.

556
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,630
He's really too arrogant. I can't bear to see someone improving themselves by stepping on you.

557
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,830
Even if he wants to step on me, he needs to be able to reach that high up first.
