[Western Food Competition Division]

10
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,800
Victor is awesome, right?

11
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,270
An attention-seeker.

12
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,600
If my guess is right, he probably decided to compete in Shanghai over London

13
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,030
because he not only wanted to dazzle the Western culinary circle.

14
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,030
He wants to show off his abilities to the Chinese chefs.

15
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,980
He came to Shanghai because he admires you.

16
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,630
- Go ahead and have a chat.
- All right.

17
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,720
I should be the one who is grateful. You're very generous.

18
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,360
You gave half of the shares in Yuxuan to Elise.

19
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,520
She deserves them. I was able to establish Yuxuan all thanks to the help Elise has given.

20
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,490
It's also because of her good management skills that we've been able to come this far.

21
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,710
I'm very happy to hear that.

22
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,010
I have a suggestion concerning Yuxuan in Shanghai.

23
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,950
Of course. Please go on.

24
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,120
I'd like to ask you to be Victor's mentor.

25
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,520
Mrs. Quentin, Victor is your child,

26
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,570
and you're one of the mentors of this competition. Wouldn't it be better for you to do that yourself?

27
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,260
No. I'm just a mentor out of respect for Thomas.

28
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,150
I have my own Quentin Group that I need to operate. My interests and energy aren't in cooking either.

29
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,490
At my age, I can't teach him much anymore.

30
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,500
I need you to teach him.

31
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,590
Victor is indeed a rare talent,

32
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,750
but he's not the apprentice I want. He's too proud. I can't teach him.

33
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,830
That's exactly the reason I want you to be his mentor,

34
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,970
to continue to improve his skills, you need to be callous. I can't do it.

35
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,060
I'm afraid I can't do it either.

36
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,890
But you need him.

37
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,600
Elise has already told me about your situation.

38
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,200
So...

39
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,930
all the more reason to use one of our own at a time like this, isn't it?

40
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,930
In short, it can't be Victor. He's too much of a show-off. He can't be depended on.

41
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,750
- No matter what, you won't find a more talented person than Victor—
- Mrs. Quentin.

42
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,770
I understand what you're saying, but I'm sorry.

43
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,780
She chops the ingredients as if she's cutting a corpse.

44
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,180
Her frying technique is like torturing a person.

45
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,280
She seasons her food like she's poisoning someone.

46
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,920
And her plating skills are

47
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,380
totally horrifying.

48
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,840
Not only is this contestant a bad chef,

49
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,570
she's basically a devil in the kitchen.

50
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,370
So, we've given her a pet name,

51
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,060
Evil Dragon Princess. Let's applause and encourage

52
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,810
this courageous contestant.

53
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,130
Number 120, Miss Lin Kesong from Shanghai!

54
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,790
What?

55
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,190
Excuse me.

56
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,350
Hello, Thomas. It's me.

57
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,980
I've found the apprentice that I want.

58
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,770
It's that Evil Dragon Princess. You didn't hear wrong.

59
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,090
Don't let anyone else choose her. Thanks.

60
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,380
Are you crazy, Oli?

61
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,290
Excuse me, Mrs. Quentin. I'll make a move first.

62
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,660
Miss Lin Kesong, why did you participate in this competition?

63
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,360
I didn't want to participate! Let me through.

64
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,990
Is there anything you'd like to say about the judging panel's doubts and comments?

65
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,200
I have nothing to say. Can you let me through please?

66
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,560
This is a cooking competition.

67
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,380
As someone who doesn't have any foundation in cooking,

68
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,840
- how do you feel?
- I didn't want to participate. It's not my fault. I also don't know how it ended up like this.

69
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,600
Anyway, I've already said that I can't cook! Stop filming!

70
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,390
I thought that losing my job and falling in love were already the lowest points in my life.

71
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,540
I didn't expect that I'd hit below rock bottom and end up in a more embarrassing situation.

72
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,750
Why did I come to Shanghai?

73
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,470
What gave me the crazy idea to take part in this competition? My life has been full of drama these past few days.

74
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,650
If I were to write my story one day,

75
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,790
the title would be "How Lin Kesong Destroyed Her Life".

76
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,050
But definitely no one will read it.

77
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,030
- Did Elise force you to do this?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Jiang. I...

78
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,810
Do well in the competition and take care of Kesong, understand?

79
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,760
Let's not talk about my older sister. She's already very nervous.

80
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,740
Hello. Here to eat? This way, please.

81
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,400
Hello. Does Miss Lin live here?

82
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,070
I am her! Looking for me?

83
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,110
My apologies. We're looking for Miss Lin Kesong.

84
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,980
Why are you looking for her?

85
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm the one looking for her. I'm Jiang Qianfan.

86
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,770
- I'm looking for Lin Kesong.
- Jiang Qianfan?

87
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,390
I'm Lin Xiaoyu, Lin Kesong's younger cousin.

88
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,440
Hello.

89
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,160
Are you looking for her to catch up or...

90
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,300
This was the address Lin Kesong put down on her application form for the Future Star Culinary Competition.

91
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,690
May I ask if she's here?

92
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,720
Are you guys here to do a show?

93
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,240
Let me tell you. Although I admire you and would like you to be my mentor,

94
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,970
if you‘re here to make fun of her, I won't agree.

95
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,280
Your idea of humor has already caused her enough hurt.

96
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,220
Please leave now.

97
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,850
Humor? I'm not a humorous person.

98
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm a serious person. I'm serious in accepting her as my apprentice.

99
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,490
Is she in?

100
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,050
But... she has the lowest score.

101
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,340
That is not important.

102
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,880
Is she in?

103
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
About that, Mr. Jiang,

104
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,190
Lin Kesong is in the back. I'll go look for her.

105
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,150
Can I go with you?

106
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,530
Come on then!

107
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,060
Wait here for me.

108
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,420
- Hello, Boss.
- Continue with your work!

109
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,120
Jiang Qianfan!

110
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,080
It's Jiang Qianfan!

111
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,240
Brothers, come here, quick. It's Jiang Qianfan!

112
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,330
- What's the matter?
- It's Jiang Qianfan!

113
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,000
- Is that him?
- Yes, I'm sure.

114
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,350
Kesong.

115
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,470
Kesong, open the door!

116
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,320
Uncle, stop disturbing me!

117
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,190
I just want to be by myself for a while.

118
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,250
Who wants to disturb you? Really, this child.

119
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,880
Someone is looking for you. Come out quickly!

120
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,850
Who is it?

121
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,090
It's Jiang Qianfan!

122
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,840
I'm Thomas then!

123
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,420
I... It is that Jiang Qianfan.

124
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,580
He said something about wanting to be your mentor.

125
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,170
He wants to accept you as his apprentice.

126
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,460
Uncle, stop disturbing me. I'm not in the mood for jokes.

127
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,860
No... You silly child. I'm not joking with you!

128
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,230
Even Xiaoyu wants to be his apprentice but couldn't.

129
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,220
You... You've got such a good opportunity—

130
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,460
Mr. Lin. Can I talk to her myself?

131
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,120
All right.

132
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,490
Lin Kesong.

133
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,390
I'm sorry. Let me introduce myself.

134
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,220
I'm Jiang Qianfan. I'm Yuxuan restaurant's head chef.

135
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,640
There's something I would like to discuss with you.

136
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,600
What is there for us to discuss?

137
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,190
Don't accept me as your apprentice.

138
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,870
Otherwise others will say I'm using you to make connections.

139
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,230
What do you mean? Who says you're using me?

140
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,560
I'm talking about that "tigress" who's always beside you!

141
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,000
Tigress?

142
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,610
Do you mean Elise?

143
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,190
If Elise said something rude to you,

144
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,060
or something that is unpleasant to hear,

145
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,240
I apologize on her behalf.

146
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,210
Stop joking. Why would you want me to be your apprentice?

147
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,770
My younger cousin likes you more. Get her to be your apprentice!

148
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,900
Mr. Lin.

149
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,510
I'm sorry, but can I privately talk to Lin Kesong?

150
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,130
Privately? All right.

151
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,320
Take your time and chat with her.

152
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,780
Come on.

153
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,760
Let's go.

154
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,500
Okay.

155
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,220
Lin Kesong.

156
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,940
It's just me left here. I want to ask you something.

157
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,100
Have you ever had a meal at a Michelin-starred restaurant?

158
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,710
I remember Hangzhou has never had a Michelin Guide,

159
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,750
so I guess you've never had a meal at one either.

160
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,440
Song Yiran is an interesting person. Last time when we had grilled fish at the seafood restaurant,

161
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,880
he told me that he once ate at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Hong Kong.

162
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,320
How did he describe it?

163
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,540
He said the food was insanely deliciously.

164
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,610
Let me ask you.

165
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,910
Have you ever done something crazy in your life?

166
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,630
- Mind your manners
- Is he really Jiang Qianfan?

167
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,560
- When he comes out, take photos.
- You even know that?
- Yes.

168
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,810
- He's the recognized divine chef in the industry.
- He came to your restaurant?

169
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,580
It's truly an honor.

170
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,370
As I've mentioned earlier, I'm the head chef for Yuxuan restaurant in Shanghai,

171
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,520
and Shanghai Yuxuan is currently a two-Michelin-starred restaurant.

172
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,370
Every month, we will also introduce new dishes.

173
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,220

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,050
How about it? Are you interested?

176
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,570
Nothing to say?

177
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,610
Then, that's not good. Perhaps my restaurant isn't that attractive after all.

178
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,120
I should seriously reflect on that.

179
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,640
I'll let Mr. Lin know that I'll accept someone else to be my apprentice.

180

Sorry to have disturbed you.

181
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,270
Then, what about my younger cousin sister?

182
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,320
Your younger cousin sister, Lin Xiaoyu?

183
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,890
She has made it to the quarterfinals of the Future Star Culinary competition.

184
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,990
In this round, besides myself,

185
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,330
there are seven other mentors.

186
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,180
They are all the best chefs in the world,

187
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,880
and I am the least capable amongst them.

188

With the panel of mentors in the Future Star Culinary Competition,

189

she might not want to learn from me.

190
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,960
Is that true?

191
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,610
Of course it's true.

192
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,870
How about this? Why don't you come out now and we'll ask her?

193
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:16,470
Then... the restaurant that you mentioned.

194
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,190
Do I have to pay if I eat there?

195
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,680
Of course not. That can be easily sorted,

196
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,780
and I will teach you everything I know.

197
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,520
You can take part in this competition and win the grand prize.

So will I become one of those powerful women?

200
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,870
Of course. Very powerful.

- Mr. Lin.

It's like this.

203
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,810
I have a friend who's in the Shikumen Chefs Alliance.

204
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,390
- Yes.
- He found out you were coming,

205
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,670
and told the group that you're here, so every...

206
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,480
Everyone is very excited to see you and wanted to take a photo with you.

207
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,710
A photo? Sure.

208
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,830
Are you unhappy?

209
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,590
Why would I be unhappy? I am so happy for you!

210
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,410
I've checked the official website.

211
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,350
The other mentors are much better than him.

212
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,390
Even if he chose me, I may not have chosen him. Go.

213
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,100
- Really?
- I'm really happy.

214
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,570
Really. Don't worry.

215
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,610
Come. Let's go.

216
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,700
In just a few hours, I've bounced back

from being the laughing stock Evil Dragon Princess

218
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,230
to a true princess envied by everyone.

219

I hope I'm not dreaming.

The agreement. It says that you'll take part in the competition and that I'll be your mentor.

228
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,430

Of course.

Before everyone discovered how delicious it was,

239
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,620
it used to be discarded.

it's one of the world's favorite and most popular ingredient.

It's the same with people who work hard too.

As long you keep trying, others will eventually appreciate your true value one day.

244

I've told you before, you're like an unpolished gem,

245
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,610
so you should work hard. Don't live your life being a rock.

246

A gem? That's the first time anyone has called me that.

247
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,210
Then what talent do I have?

248
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,960
You’re passionate about food and you have exceptional determination.

249
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,270
More importantly, you dare to tell the truth.

250
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,250
These are essential qualities to being an outstanding chef.

251

Passionate about food? Isn't that just me being greedy?

so that I could contribute to the culinary world.

I'll be staying here?

Yes. Your basic skills are too weak. You'll need to undergo three months of secluded training.

Secluded training?

Why didn't you mention about the secluded training on our way here?

272

There was no need to tell you earlier. Anyway, you can only accept it.

273

You not only have to stay here but also follow the rules that I set.

274

What rules?

275
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,710
Number one, get up every day at 4 a.m!

276
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,790
Work out and do morning exercises.

277
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,160
That time is too early. I can't get up.

278
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,920
Number two, you'll have three fixed meals at designated times. Being late is not acceptable.

279
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,830
Number three, you can only eat food allocated for you. Put that down!

280
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,540
Number four, no alcohol allowed.

281
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,780
Number five, do not shower after 9 p.m.

282
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,340
No, I think...

283
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,410
your rules are unreasonable.

284
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,600
Your rules should be reversed.

285
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,980
How about this? You have to go to bed before 4 a.m.

286
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,150
Conversely, you can only get out of bed after 9 a.m. What do you think?

287
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,450
I'm used to working out regularly

288
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,060
at a fixed time everyday.

289
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,080
You have to do the same.

290
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,630

Young?

293
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,020
Number six, you can't leave the house as you please!

294
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,320
Number seven, you can only go online for up to one hour a day.

295
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,670
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

296
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,970
I told you I can't follow your requests.

297
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,960
Then I'll add another!

298
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
Number eight, you're not allowed to give personal opinions.

299
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,800
Don't waste my time.

300
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,060
You're the one who's wasting my time! Normal people wouldn't even be able to come up with this!

301
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,120
It's just a house and it's not even yours.

302
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,400
I quit!

303
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,150
Do you think all powerful women are born like that?

304

309

Calling me Ms. Lin is too formal.

Just call me Kesong.

Croissant? Such a warm name.

In that case, I'll call you "Little Bun".

I'm called Nina. I've been working for Mr. Jiang for a number of years.

318
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,790
Look. This is the gym.

319
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,730
Mr. Jiang's room is over there.

320
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,950
Look. This is Mr. Jiang's kitchen,

321
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,900
but not everyone is allowed to enter without his permission.

322
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,090
This is our terrace. These spices are grown by Mr. Jiang.

323
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,560
Look. There's thyme, basil, and this is rosemary.

324
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,470
The air here is cool and refreshing.

325
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,990
This a good place to come if you want to get some fresh air at night.

326
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,080
Mint! I know mint.

327
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,820
Then, Little Bun, have a look around here.

328
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,630
Just call me if you need anything. I'm going downstairs.

329
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,030
- Thank you, Sister Nina.
- You're welcome.

330
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,070
Citronella. There's so much of it.

331
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,930
Chili?

332
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,280
Hello, Uncle.

333
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,220
Kesong, how are you doing?

334
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,670
I'm good.

335
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,030
That... Jiang Qianfan called and told me that you'll be staying there for three months,

336
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:45,310
but the problem is with your Dad. I know how short-tempered he is.

337
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,820
Even if you explained it to him, he won't listen.

338
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,830
What I mean is don't tell him anything yet. I'll slowly explain it to him when I get the chance.

339
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,350
This is a rare opportunity. It would be terrible if he ruined this for you.

340
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,340
Thank you, Uncle. That's so thoughtful of you.

341
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,200
Remember they mustn't come to Shanghai, otherwise I'll be done for.

342
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,700
All right. I understand.

343
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,100
Kesong, I'm busy. Give me a call anytime if there's anything you need.

344
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,040
I'm hanging up!

345
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,350
Jiang Qianfan has been taken away from me. Is my Dad also going to be taken away as well?

346
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,190
What do you mean?

347
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,000
You said you don't mind, but actually, you do. Right?

348
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,520
Hey, girl. I have something to tell you.

349
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,690
I have nothing to say.

350
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,920
Then, you listen to me.

351
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,110
Girl.

352
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:42,920
I know that right now you're unhappy with your sister.

353
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,610
I can understand that.

354
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,520
You wanted to be Jiang Qianfan's apprentice, but he chose Kesong instead.

355
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,300
And you're better than Kesong, right?

356
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:55,570
Understandably, if it were me, I would be disappointed too.

357
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,830
But girl, there is no such thing as "should" in this world,

358
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:03,900
or "if". But you must remember one thing,

359
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,100
that is, hard work is never wasted.

360
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,750
Trust me.

361
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,880
But everyone can see her abilities and yet he'd rather choose her over me.

362
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,430
- I can't accept it.
- Can't accept it?

363
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:22,060
It's good that you can't accept it! Then show them your skills in the competition.

364
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,170
No matter which mentor wants to take me,

365
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:31,690
I'll give it my all. I want Jiang Qianfan to know that he chose the wrong person.

366
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,150
I know, Mother. That‘s just how he is. There's nothing I can do about it.

367
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,490
I think you should personally train Victor.

368
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,140
All right. Love you. Bye-bye.

369
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,870
- Hello.
- Miss Elise.

370
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,490
There are many reporters at the entrance. They say that they must see you. I couldn't stop them.

371
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,850
I don't care. I'm not seeing anyone. Tell them to leave.

372
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,100
But... besides the entertainment reporters,

373
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,180
even reporters from "Celebrity Chef" and "Food Science" are all here too.

374
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,370
They're from some of the top publications in the industry. Should we…

375
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,740
How about this? Tell them it was a misunderstanding.

376
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,470
I’m currently organizing other matters. Later, Mr. Jiang himself will clarify the situation.

377
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,030
Anyway, ask them to leave first. Wait, give them our restaurant's VIP vouchers.

378
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,180
- One per person.
- I know.

379
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,860
Bye-bye.

380
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,800
I've told them to put the interview and photo shoot that was scheduled with the magazine

381
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,760
on hold for the time being. Let's discuss it after this news has calmed down.

382
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,380
That's ideal. After all, I didn't want all this exposure.

383
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,820
Here.

384
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,580
Oh, yeah. Mrs. Quentin didn't make things difficult for you, did she?

385
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,760
It's you who went against her, not me.

386
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,560
Victor is training under her now, but she wants me to tell you,

387
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:01,190
if you apologize to her now, Victor will go easy on Kesong in the competition.

388
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,570
So that it won't be too embarrassing for you.

389
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,010
Why would I need to apologize?

390
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:09,420
You can tell Mrs. Quentin that she doesn't have to be polite.

391
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,130
Yuxuan restaurant is in a complete mess now.

392
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,360
I snuck out to tell you that you should accept the interview.

393
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,200
Tell everyone it was a joke when you accepted Lin Kesong,

394
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,320
that you will seriously select another apprentice.

395
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,040
I can do the interview,

396
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:41,030
but I will say that even if I were to choose again, the result will be the same. It's not a joke.

397
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,960
You...

398
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,400
Do you know how much time and effort I spent to find this person?

399
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,310
If you insist on Lin Kesong being your crutch, we'll have to sort this out in private.

400
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,090
Sort it out in private?

401
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,470
What you mean is to sort this out after she gets married?

402
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,290
Is this what you mean?

403
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,680
I'm not apologizing for that. I did what I thought was the best option.

404
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,720
I know you won't apologize.

405
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,160
That's why I'm also using the best way to keep the person I need the most besides me.

406
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,250
You're the one person who knows my exact situation. Lin Kesong is extremely important to me right now.

407
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,030
This is not just for myself, but also for Yuxuan.

408
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,810
You're not making sense, and I don't want to explain either,

409
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:36,720
but I must remind you that Lin Kesong is the worst amongst the participants.

410
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,910
How will you explain your decision of choosing her?

411
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,470
Don't forget,

412
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:45,000
you're the "Kitchen God". You can only be number one.

413
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,880
That‘s the future. Future matters should be discussed later.

414
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,120
Even if we were to enter the competition today and lost, that wouldn't affect my status.

415
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,490
After all, today I'm just a mentor.

416
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,130
What's most important to me right now

417
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:05,040
is for Shanghai's Yuxuan to get its third Michelin star in the fastest time possible. And this...

418
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,970
is also our common goal. Isn't it?

419
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,270
Jiang Qianfan, it's not that I want to complain,

420
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,620
but you're too petty. Your house is massive but you only let me—

421
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,450
As you've seen, she is upstairs now.

422
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,300
Oli, are you serious?

423
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,260
Yes, I'm very serious!

424
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,090
I can't afford to waste a single minute of my time anymore!

425
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,940
Are you done?

426
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,540
If you're done, please leave.

427
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,790
No, wait Mr. Jiang. I didn't mean to—

428
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,080
It's none of your business!

429
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,790
It was never my business in the first place.

430
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,380
You're so hard at work, Ms. Bun.

431
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,190
You must be exhausted. Have some tea.

432
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,960
Sister Nina.

433
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,460
Mr. Jiang wants me to finish this book today. He says he's also going to test me tomorrow.

434
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,520
Relax, Little Bun. No need to be so nervous.

435
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,630
Here, have some tea.

436
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,810
Sister Nina, you're so kind. Luckily, there's you here.

437
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,710
How nice if Mr. Jiang was as gentle as you.

438
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,210
Do sleep early.

439
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,930
Okay.

440
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,180
Stop.

441
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,380
Who allowed you up here? You're not allowed in here without my permission.

442
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,890
Go back down.

443
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,110
Petty.

444
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:01,320
Good evening, Mr. Jiang. May I borrow one of your T-shirts?

445
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,540
I didn't bring along my pajamas.

446
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,650
What are you doing? You bear half the responsibility for me not having my pajamas.

447
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,520
You put me in solitary confinement without rhyme or reason.

448
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,360
I don't lend my personal belongings to others.

449
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,850
Don't be so mean. Look at how thoughtful I am.

450
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,510
I even prepared some wine for your nightcap to help you relax.

451
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,950
Rule number four. I said you weren't allowed to drink.

452
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,520
It's just a little bit. It should be fine, right?

453
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,090
Besides, don't many chefs drink?

454
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:36,590
A chef must master the art of wine. You're not a chef yet.

455
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,640
All right. I won't drink. You drink.

456
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,170
My rules are to be abided by. You must accept your punishment.

457
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,260
I didn't even drink it. Why do I need to accept the punishment?

458
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,610
Ten sit-ups.

459
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,290
- Stop joking.
- Twenty.

460
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,960
I'll do it.

461
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,320
Thirteen.

462
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,250
Fourteen.

463
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,380
Fifteen.

464
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,920
Sixteen.

465
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,920
Seventeen.

466
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,750
Eighteen.

467
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,670
Nineteen.

468
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,750
Twenty.

469
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,910
Is anyone there?

470
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,030
Mr. Jiang!

471
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,700
Jiang Qianfan!

472
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,620
You house is out of water!

473
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,430
I told you that you're not allowed to shower after 9 p.m. It's now 9:01 p.m.

474
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,590
Are you insane? I have to at least finish showering!

475
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,330
Figure it out yourself.

476
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,730
Take this back to your room. I've set the alarm for 4 a.m.

477
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,130
Goodnight.

478
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:32,290
What does Jiang Qianfan use to do his laundry? It's so fragrant.

479
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,670
It's such a unique scent.

480
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,520
Just like... lying in someone's arms.

481
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,380
No, wait. What am I talking about?

482
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,880
Is it like lying next to Jiang Qianfan?

483
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,620
I don't want that at all!

484
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:56,020
How did these perverted thoughts get into my head?

485
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,500
He must have driven me insane.

486
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,290
I wonder what Song Yiran is doing.

487
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,780
Does he know what happened to me today?

488
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,210
[Parental Supervision Turned On]
[Today's one hour online time limit has been reached]

489
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,600
You...

490
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,970
Jiang Qianfan!

491
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,230
Ran Ran, you're not a child anymore.

492
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,910
Stop goofing around all day.

493
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,850
Spend more time with Chu Ting.

494
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:44,130
Yes, Eldest Brother. I got it, Eldest Brother.

495
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,140
Brother, as you wished, Chu Ting is video-calling me. I'm hanging up now.

496
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,840
All right. Go ahead.

497
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,710
Hello, darling.

498
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,030
How have you been today?

499
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,370
It was fine.

500
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,260
Did you know that there's a place in Shanghai called Xiahai?

501
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,510
It's a temple. I spent half my day there today.

502
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,800
What about you? How was your day?

503
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,240
I'm exhausted. I spent most of the day negotiating with the brand retailers,

504
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,700
then I accompanied my Dad to a social event in the evening.

505
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,740
By the way, your brother came today. It looked like they were discussing some kind of joint-venture.

506
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,070
Is that so?

507
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,820
What's wrong? Are you having a bad day?

508
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,830
No. I just woke up very early today and I'm feeling a bit tired.

509
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,510
Then, have an early rest.

510
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,360
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

511
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,470
Lin Kesong, get up!

512
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,430
Get up! Get up! Get up!

513
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,630
Lin Kesong, get up!

514
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,570
Get up! Get up! Get up!

515
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,400
You're half an hour late. Hurry!

516
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,430
I don't want to do push-ups. Can't I run instead?

517
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,780
Sure.

518
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,100
What does he eat to get such a fit body?

519
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,880
His chest is bigger than mine, and his waist is slimmer than mine.

520
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,930
He also has a well-proportioned body.

521
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:57,190
Why is he a chef when he can be a model?

522
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,890
Why are you looking at me? Hurry up and run.

523
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,290
How did you know I was looking at you if you weren't looking at me?

524
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,410
What a pity. No use having a good figure.

525
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,090
His soul is still that of a devil.

526
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,020
- What are you doing?
- Run continuously for 45 minutes.

527
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,450
Speed nine, no stopping.

528
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,960
What are you doing? That's enough, that's enough.

529
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,920
Stop messing around.

530
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,430
That's enough.

531
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,310
Lift your feet.

532
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,230
- I'm already lifting them! I—
- Shut up and keep running. Run!

533
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,070
- I'm already running.
- Faster!

534
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:49,000
Faster! Even faster!

535
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,160
Stop sitting. Take this.

536
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,870
I'm exhausted... and you're not even letting me sit.

537
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:59,390
Let me tell you. Breakfast is served at six. You have 15 minutes to wash up.

538
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,990
No, wait Mr. Jiang. I don't understand.

539
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,960
What does exercising have to do with cooking?

540
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,630
You will never do your best in everything if you don't challenge yourself.

541
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,500
Why must I do my best? It is enough to be just good enough.

542
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,520
You'll understand when you're older!

543
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,890
Good morning, Little Bun.

544
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,190
Good morning, Sister Nina.

545
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,450
Good morning, Mr. Jiang.

546
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,620
What time is it now?

547
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,370
What time is it?

548
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,670
Go back to your room.

549
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,110
I don't welcome people who do not observe the rules and rituals for mealtimes.

550
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,930
This might only be breakfast, but none of us should treat this meal casually.

551
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,580
You must have a basic level of respect

552
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:08,500
for the food, the chef, and yourself.

553
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:14,080
Why are you taking this so seriously? I'll just get changed.

554
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,470
Come back!

555
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,590
Come back.

556
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,650
What now?

557
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,000
In future, don't put your phone on the table.

558
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,030
Nina! You toasted this bread quite well.

559
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,230
It smells toasty and is soft to eat.

560
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,740
You're getting better at the timing.

561
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,320
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

562
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,080
Then, I'll toast another piece for Ms. Lin. Her piece is about to get cold.

563
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,420
Don't worry about her.

564
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,120
Take a break.

565
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,970
Said casual looking, huh?

566
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,050
I'll show you.

567
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,170
I'll see what he has to say

568
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,250
about this perfectly dressed and sophisticated girl.
