00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,590
If we still can't come up with the main dish,

13
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,310
don't you think there should be fewer new dishes this season? We could...

14
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,250
Understand. I'll talk to him.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,670
No good. The peas have been cooked too long. The color has faded.

16
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,030
Discard them. Do it over.

17
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,140
I'm sorry, Mr. Jiang.

18
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,290
Apologizing is meaningless. You have five minutes to remake it.

19
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,860
Okay.

What is it?

22
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,550
May I have a word?

23
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,860
Okay.

00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,990
Oliver.

25
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,830
In six days, Yuxuan will be releasing the new menu for the upcoming season.

26
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,050
I've just spoken with the manager. They've taken shots of the other dishes,

27
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,650
but they're missing one main dish. London is already rushing us.

28
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,780
Are you having a creative block?

29
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,320
Yes, a little bit. But I can overcome it.

30
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,150
If you really have no idea,

31
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,530
you can just postpone it or drop it altogether. It's fine to have one less dish.

32
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,210
Absolutely not.

33
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,340
For three years, we've always released new seasonal menus on time.

34
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,640
If we deviate from our norm, what would the Michelin inspector think?

35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,280
Without consistency, we can forget about getting a 3-star rating.

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,780
All right. All the best then.

- Is that all?
- What else is there?

38
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,500
I thought...

39
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,570
Oliver,

40
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,670
you told me before that work and personal matters have to be separated, right?

41
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,560
That's right.

42
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,960
I'll head out now.

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Is this a new dish?

44
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,630
Yes.

45
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,060
Sea urchin is an interesting ingredient.

46
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,340
Even if they come from the same sea, the taste will be different due

47
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,000
to differences in temperature and depth. I picked the sweetest one.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,390
It's more suitable for making deep-fried tempura. The others that are more savory can be prepared as sashimi.

49
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,500
But they all look the same. How can you differentiate?

50
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,320
By experience.

51
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,290
You'll know when you try it.

52
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,800
This one is much sweeter than the other one.

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,490
It will be perfect for deep frying. How could he have made such a mistake?

54
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,070
How is it?

55
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,900
It's good. I've never had such a tasty sea urchin before.

56
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,520
That's good.

57
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,740
Practice on your own. I'm going out for a bit.

58
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,240
Okay.

59
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,820
This is on the sweet side.

60
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,370
What's up with Jiang Qianfan? Why did he judge before trying?

61
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,460
What's more, I can't question him.

62
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,210
I'm so glad!

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,080
I'm sorry for misleading you into thinking we could be together.

75
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,440
So, I think it's necessary for me to tell you my honest thoughts.

76
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,510
I'm not the kind of person you think I am.

77
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,450
I won't make a good life partner,

78
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,900
and I can't give you the love you want.

79
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,800
To me, culinary arts are my everything.

80
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,340
I only want to devote myself to it.

81
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,850
So, I can only apologize to you.

82
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,640
Wow.

83
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,860
This has to be the most heartfelt apology I've ever received.

84
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,590
Now I think I should say sorry.

85
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,080
How did I ever come to meet a person like you?

86
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,870
Elise, it's not because you're bad or I have someone else I like that I don't love you.

87
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,590
It's because...

88
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,340
I have no interest in love at all.

89
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,310
It's pointless and a waste of time. That's why I snapped

90
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,290
and hurt you.

91
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,470
People around me are always suffering.

92
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,120
We've known each other for so many years.

93
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,890
You should know that aside from those bikes, I have nothing else.

94
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,470
My share in Yuxuan is my sole asset.

95
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,470
If you're willing, if it makes you feel better,

96
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,730
I can let you have it all.

97
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,310
Wow.

98
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,040
You really are a good person.

99
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,400

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,450
I know, Elise. But I'm sorry I hurt you.

104
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,730
I really feel bad for making you fear to love so much. It's my fault.

105
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,240
I'll change. We can start over.

106
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,130
Forget about starting over. Our partnership is what's best for us.

110

Go to Mr. Jiang's.

111
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,650
Collect all the unused essential oils in this box and bring them back.

112
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,850
Okay. I"ll let Nina do it tomorrow.

113
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,580
No, I want it done now.

114
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,580
This is the door key.

115
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,610
Remember, don't let anyone know.

116
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,870
But... I...

117
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,560
Save it. I don't want to explain.

118
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,670
All you need to know is that this is in Mr. Jiang's best interest.

119
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:31,250
It's not that, Miss Quentin. I'm afraid I can't do it. Mr. Jiang's house has cameras.

120
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,610
Inspect the box in detail. I want you to go back and do it.

121
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,910
Not sleeping yet, Little Bun?

122
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,070
I'm going to sleep soon. Lighting the aroma lamp for Mr. Jiang again?

123
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,090
Yes. He lights this every night. Otherwise, he can't sleep.

124
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,030
It's tough for you.

125
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,820
It's not. You should rest early too.

126
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,080
- Goodnight!
- Goodnight.

127
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,450
- Goodnight!

128
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,070

129
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,330
Who's there?

130
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,630
Who's there?

131
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,740
Don't run away!

132
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,730
Sister Nina! Mr. Jiang!

133
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,060
There's a thief!

134
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,800
- There's a thief!
- What's going on?

135
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,130
There's a thief!

136
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,010
- I'm fine.
- Catch the thief now!

137
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,890
Where are you? Don't move!

138
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,220
- How is it?
- No one's there.

139
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,990
I heard the books falling over there.

140
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,150
I sat up when they fell. I saw someone holding a torchlight and I chased after him.

141
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,710
I fell here when I was chasing him and he escaped.

142
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,110
But... when he ran, and I fell here, I could only see...

143
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,770
Mr. Jiang, I have checked. Seems like we didn't lose anything.

144
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,650
I got it.

145
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,040
Miss Lin,

146
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,680
can you describe the suspect?

147
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,850
It was so dark. I couldn't see clearly,

148
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,050
but that person is probably

149
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,640
the same height as him. He wore a cap

150
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,070
and a mask. He was dressed in a tracksuit.

151
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:30,580
When he left, I saw that he was wearing a pair of grey sports shoes

152
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,860
with pink on the back. Hence, it was very distinct.

153
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:42,340
Mr. Jiang, after our survey, we found no traces of forced entries at your door and windows.

154
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,070
It's possible that the suspect has the keys to your home

155
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,640
or someone that you are close to.

156
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,920
If this is the case, can you think of anyone that you know?

157
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,680
There's a person around me who matches these characteristics.

158
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,920
Do you know him?

159
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,870
He's Li Yan, my assistant.

160
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,440
Contact the supplier in France.

161
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,480
These still don't meet my requirements.

162
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,820
Return them tomorrow.

163
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,750
You can tell them...

164
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,810
I will talk to you later.

165
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,860
Yiran, come here and take a look.

166
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,580
Where should I look?

167
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,260
No. There's a police car in front of Jiang Qianfan's house.

168
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,900
What?

169
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,820
Unbelievable.

170
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,420
What happened? No, I'm going to take a look.

171
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,430
Wait for me!

172
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,930
- Thank you for your trouble.
- It's what we should do.

173
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,510
Thank you.

174
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,620
Beautiful Older Sister, is there a mishap?

175
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,360
It's fine, Mr. Song. There was a thief in the house.

176
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,530
That scary?

177
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,760
Did they catch him?

178
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,430
No. We didn't lose anything too.

179
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,870
Didn't lose anything? Did you discover it?

180
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,590
No. It was Little Bun.

181
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,880
Kesong? Can she catch the thief? How is she?

182
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,350
She's fine.

183
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,420
She's fine? What do you mean? I'm going to check.

184
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,750
Mr. Song, sorry. It's too late.

185
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,530
We can't invite you in. My apologies. Thank you for your concerns.

186
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,860
- No...
- Enough, enough. Let's go. It's not that serious.

187
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,390
- Why do I think it's something major?
- Let's go. Don't affect their rest. Let's go.

188
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,550
No. Look at his glass house.

189
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,700
Miss Quentin!

190
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,340
Why did you arrange to meet here? Were you discovered?

191
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:11,200
It's hard to explain in a few words. Miss Quentin, I may have messed up.

192
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,230
What's wrong?

193
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,780
Lin Kesong discovered me. They must have reported to the police.

194
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,100
Did she recognize you?

195
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,010
I don't know. I wonder if she could recognize me in this outfit.

196
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,080
I have already tried my best.

197
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,010
Take this money.

198
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,630
I can't, Miss Quentin.

199
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,300
I can't take this money.

200
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,900
Tell me the truth. Is there a problem with the essential oil?

201
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,000
There's no problem.

202
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,210
Dr. Xie already checked. There's no problem.

203
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,870
Dr. Xie?

204
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,350
Why would Dr. Xie check this essential oil?

205
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,900
Miss Quentin,

206
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,940
you racked your brains for me to go to Mr. Jiang's house to mess with this essential oil.

207
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,860
What is your motive?

208
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,980
Are you hiding something?

209
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,340
I can't explain it to you,

210
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,730
but you have two choices.

211
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,580
One, call the police.

212
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,620
Two, I'll give you some money. Enough to live out the rest of your life.

213
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,180
You choose.

214
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,470
Hey. Do you think that thief...

215
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,230
would go back there for more?

216
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:41,180
No way. The police were called. They wouldn't dare.

217
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,120
That's the logical deduction,

218
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,120
but we're not the thief. We don't know how they think.

219
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,160
Just stop! Old Lin didn't answer your call.

220
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,470
Meaning she doesn't need you.

221
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,440
That's true.

222
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,140
Do you think she got scared out of her wits?

223
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,720
What are you waiting for? Go give her a hug and comfort her.

224
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,820
Did you want me to put more on?

225
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,040
What's the matter?

226
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,050
I can sleep with you for the night? It's too scary out here.

227
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,340
I... I can sleep on the small sofa.

228
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,920
Come in.

229
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,680
Thanks.

230
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,980
Were you all gung-ho just now? The thief didn't scare you.

231
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,490
I have no idea what got into me just now. The more I think about it, the more scared I am.

232
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,470
Go to sleep. I'm turning off the light.

233
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,190
It's fine to keep the light on.

234
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,380
Not for me. I don't like being watched while I sleep.

235
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,790
Who wants to watch you sleep? I bet you drool in your sleep.

236
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,200
Shut up. I'll kick you out if you keep mumbling.

237
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,590
What are you doing?

238
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,130
What? I'm trying to get comfortable!

239
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,650
Stop it.

240
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,800
I can't sleep even with the calming essential oil.

241
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,650
No tossing and turning. No coughing. No breathing.

242
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,290
I'm not even allowed to breathe.

243
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,460
Can you stop being like this?

244
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,790
What am I supposed to do?

245
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,920
Sleep!

246
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,190
[I'm sleeping. Talk tomorrow.]

247
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,160
That Old Lin.

248
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:56,480
[The house was broken into. Are you all right?]

249
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,790
[I'm fine. Don't worry.]

250
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,280
Are you too scared to sleep?

251
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,610
[Good to know. You must be too scared to sleep.]

252
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,530
[How did you know?]

253
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:16,820
You've always been timid. You wouldn't go to the toilet alone after watching lousy horror movies.

254
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:23,510
[You've always been timid. You wouldn't go to the toilet alone after watching lousy horror movies.]

255
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,160
[Let's not chat anymore. We will wake up Mr Jiang.]

256
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,750
Have you packed everything? Nothing left behind?

257
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,650
All right. Just give me the keys.

258
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,320
Miss Quentin, are you sure this is okay?

259
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,130
I will settle the rent for you, and deal with the rest.

260
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,610
- Good morning, Mr. Jiang.
- Morning.

261
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,840
Miss Elise is here.

262
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,600
You're here very early.

263
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,430
I heard about Li Yan. Are you all right?

264
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,060
I'm okay.

265
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,520
- I brought you breakfast!
- What is it?

266
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,740
I made you some porridge. Especially for you.

267
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,450
- To calm the nerves.
- I'll do it, Miss Elise.

268
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,990
- No, it's fine. Thanks.
- Okay.

269
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,240
I read a folk prescription that said this could help stimulate your tongue.

270
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,700
I will make this porridge for you every day.

271
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,050
You believe the folk prescription?

272
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,010
Yes, so you have to drink it.

273
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,440
You really don't have to.

274
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm not doing it for me. It's for Yuxuan.

275
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,580
You're okay with it after I say that, right?

276
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,490
It's just eating porridge. No need to convince me twice. All right.

277
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,090
I'll drink it after I'm done exercising. I'll be back.

278
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,130
Morning. Did you sleep well?

279
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,520
Yes!

280
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,000
Who made porridge?

281
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,410
Elise brought it over. Is it good?

282
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,290
Of course, it is.

283
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,210
Go on and eat.

284
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,120
What's with the reaction?

285
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,810
Xiaoyu, where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

286
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,050
Can you take me to a place where you aren't there?

287
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:13,100
Logically speaking, isn't that a paradox?

288
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,000
What's with the luggage?

289
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,890
Did you get fired?

290
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,410
Yes.

291
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,420
Why sever your path to wealth?

292
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,660
I hope your tidbit is worth my waking up early.

293
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,840
Didn't we agree on double the price?

294
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,890
You got fired. Why should I trust you?

295
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,950
Tell me what you've got.

296
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,830
I hope your tidbit is worth my waking up early.

297
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,680
Boss, we agreed on a price. It's not right to change it.

298
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,620
Your guess was right. Something is wrong with Jiang Qianfan's sense of taste.

299
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,750
I want proof. Preferably videos.

300
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,280
I don't have it.

301
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,890
Playing me for a fool?

302
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,870
You're still too green.

303
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,000
- I forgot to give this to you.
- What is it now?

304
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,730
Detoxifying beauty drink. It helps to lower body heat. It's for you to drink.

305
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,930
Are you criticizing me now?

306
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,730
Did I?

307
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,920
I just thought you needed it. You always seem very hot-tempered.

308
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,300
Thank you.

309
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:24,120
The best way to keep my temper in control is for you not to appear in front of me.

310
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,710
What exactly did I do to you?

311
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,230
Are you with that guy?

312
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,990
No. I have no mood to entertain him when I haven't won.

313
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,690
Good to know.

314
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,970
Stop tossing. Come and taste.

315
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,150
Wagyu and sea urchin. That's very bold of you.

316
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,720
Try it.

317
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,070
Oh my heavens. He used sea urchin which is more savory.

318
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,750
The umami flavor in the last attempt was already overpowering.

319
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,910
This time, he added beef with a lot more fat.

320
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,880
The overly rich taste is making me gag. What do I do?

321
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,290
Is it because I used the wrong sea urchin?

322
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,880
Am I glad to hear you say it. This sea urchin is too savory.

323
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,030
There were sweeter ones available. Putting these flavors together—

324
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,750
Do you think you're so smart now?

325
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,290
Did I ask you to tell me what to do?

326
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,410
I made a dish that was unforgettable,

327
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,950
A dish that would generate resistance from others. Can't I do that?

328
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,040
Nothing wrong.

329
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,640
Go and toss sand, plus 1,000 times.

330
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,530
- I'm hungry. Let's go eat.
- Okay.

331
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,010
Babe, let me do it.

332
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,620
Go and move the ones there.

333
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,170
Okay.

334
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,930
You finally showed up.

335
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,490
I was busy. I came right after.

336
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,030
Hey. Take a break! I'll move the rest.

337
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,590
The goods are arriving in succession. I need to take stock while getting the displays ready.

338
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,140
Feels like having eight hands isn't even enough.

339
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,600
Eight hands? Wouldn't that make you Spiderwoman?

340
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,310
Careful, I may bite.

341
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,520
Hey.

342
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,310
This top is quite nice. It suits me.

343
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,430
Dear, that's for women.

344
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,420
Really? Isn't it too big for women?

345
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,820
There's a thing called "oversized".

346
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,590
All right.

347
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,000
From now on, you're the boss here.

348
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,230
As for me, I'm the boss' man. That's pretty good.

349
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,030
You're too cute.

350
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:04,140
You managed to make a kept man sound novel and refined.

351
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,200
What's wrong with it? Babe.

352
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,630
What is your opinion if I really were a kept man?

353
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,310
I'd be overjoyed.

354
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,520
Why?

355
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,060
My dream is to have my very own shop.

356
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,580
The shop will be nearby my house.

357
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,320
And my husband, children, and a pet dog will live in the house.

358
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,700
It's fine if the husband has no ambition.

359
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,450
I can support the family. It's fine as long as my dad has ambition.

360
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,140
After meeting you, I've realized

361
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,490
that my dream is only missing a child and dog.

362
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,390
Wrong. Your dream is missing a husband and dog.

363
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,690
I'm just a child.

364
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,300
- Lin Kesong.
- Yes.

365
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,560
Why don't we go out to eat?

366
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,770
Did I hear you right?

367
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,470
Hurry up. Are you craving anything?

368
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,670
Wait. Is this some kind of weird punishment?

369
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,050
Why do you always ask this and that? I'm going if you aren't going.

370
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,270
No, I'm going!

371
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,600
I want to eat crawfish!

372
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,580
Crawfish? You mean freshwater crawfish? Are those even edible?

373
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,780
I really pity you.

374
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,010
I can't believe you've never had crawfish.

375
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:43,190
Now is the best season for crawfish. Every year, during this time, I crave crawfish.

376
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,160
Are you sure they're that good?

377
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,220
You'll know once you try it. Let's go, let's go.

378
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,520
Is it good?
[Longmen Zuike]

379
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,630
It's delicious.

380
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,900
Here you go.

381
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,900
- Thanks.
- Thank you!

382
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,930
Don't be shy!

383
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,080
Lin Kesong.

384
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,100
Are you sure this is edible?

385
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,290
Eat this.

386
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,860
I've been dying for this bite.

387
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,670
Why does the reaction seem so familiar?

388
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,310
Don't worry. The food here doesn't contain weird stuff.

389
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:27,110
Too bad it's still early. If it's nighttime, I would've taken you to a roadside stall.

390
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:31,710
Do you know? When you get off work, you gather with your friends

391
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,520
and order some crawfish and beer.

392
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,820
Then you chat and enjoy the breeze. Have a good sweat. It's a great feeling.

393
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,290
Have you ever cooked crawfish?

394
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,380
Never.

395
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,520
I wonder how you'd prepare crawfish.

396
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,470
If it was part of Yuxuan's menu...

397
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,660
You know what? It might just become Yuxuan's bestseller.

398
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,740
Now you've experienced the crawfish's charm, right?

399
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,370
There are many different kinds. For example, garlic sauce...

400
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,320
Or curry.

401
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,010
You must be very full.

402
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,900
I am but I think I can eat more after I work out some. Why?

403
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,290
I agree. You should exercise more. Continue tossing sand. Another 1,000 times.

404

Little Bun, what's wrong?

00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,350
Older Sister Nina,

407
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:17,910
I have been weighing the pan for a long time.

408
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,770
My hand is going to break, and I still can't do it. My hand is trembling now.

409
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,430
Come with me.

410
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,210
This activating collateral oil may help.

411
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,950
Older Sister Nina, fortunately, you are here.

412
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:39,660
Otherwise, I would be alone and terribly tormented by him.

413
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,030
In the past, I would rub this on him too.

414
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,910
His degree of strain, everywhere, was more serious than yours.

415
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,820
To be like him, how much has he suffered?
