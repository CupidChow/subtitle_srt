He's the winner in the Muellers Future Star Culinary Competition.

He was called the "Chinese Cooking God" for it.

Four years ago, he opened up a restaurant in London called Yuxuan.

After graduating, I joined Liang She Hotel as an intern.

40
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,530
Actually, the reason why I studied hotel management and my interning at Liang She

41
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,180
has to do with the person I have a crush on.

Mr. Jiang specializes in creative Chinese cuisine.

Everyone, your comments and thoughts will be passed down to Mr. Jiang by me.

I will contact you all for the next test.

Thank you again.

Oh my God. Where did you get free food from?

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,790
Not that great. Can you tell your chef

173

to wash the pan used to cook the rattan pepper

174

175
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,960
The taste is terrible.

176
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,970
I don't want to eat it either, now that you said that.

177

There was a girl that came late, but she was gone when I went over there.

194
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,580
I didn't grab her suggestion form.

195
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,610
She didn't even write her name properly, wrote down "Guess,"

196
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,200
then she wrote that the two herbal flavors were too strong.

197
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,590
She's obviously here to cause trouble.

198

Yes.

Are you sure she said the two herbal flavors?

Yes. What's wrong?

202
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,900
We used Sauvignon Blanc white wine when making the sauce.

203

It has the herbal flavor to it.

204
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,350
But how did she taste another herbal flavor?

205
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,760
Elise, do you remember what the dairy farmer who produced this butter said to us

206
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,930
when we went to buy this butter?

207
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,380
He said their cows only ate grass all their lives

208
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,220
and were never fed artificial feed.

209
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,430
Right. What's the problem? Did you find out that they added feed?

210
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,620
No. There's no problem at all. They're absolutely right.

211
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,660
They produced the milk, then made the butter, so the butter will naturally have a herbal flavor.

212
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,540
She's able to taste even that? That's amazing.

213
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,910
Yes.

214
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,940
There were many ingredients and steps to the making of the flounder dish, and the chemical reaction was also very complex.

215
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,340
It's very difficult to taste the herbal flavor in the butter.

216
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,700
Additionally, she was able to taste the herbal flavor that almost completely evaporated from the wine.

217
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,110
She was able to taste traces of each of the two flavors.

218
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,420
It's rare for anyone to have the tasting abilities that "Guess"' has.

219
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,310

00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,570
I was blocked 30 times and was yelled at more than 10 times, and I still haven't found the girl.

318
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,450
It's all right. I've found her.

319
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,740
Elise, I'm not going back to Shanghai tomorrow. I need to look into this person.

320
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,670
- Who is this person?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

321
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,980
She was the intern who fell asleep in my room.

322
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,770
The girl who drank the toilet water?

323
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,500
That's right.

324
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,420
God sent the person I was looking for to my room.

325
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,490
This must be fate. Right, Li Yan?

326
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,810
That's right. It's all fate.

327
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:23,010
But this person not only is not a chef, but she also trespassed into your room.

328
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,710
She doesn't follow the rules. Even if her sense of taste is an exception, you can't take her in.

329
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,700
Everything else can be taught, but only a sense of taste is a born talent.

330
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,680
I can't pass on a genius like her.

331
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,710
You are finally here.

332
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,910
Good morning, Mr. Jiang!

333
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,930
Good morning. It's almost noon.

334
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,790
Because there wasn't much traffic,

335
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,850
I was only late for 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 minutes.

336
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,480
I will let today pass. Do not be late tomorrow.

337
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,350
All right!

338
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,850
Miss Lin, I said don't be late, and I mean it.

339
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,150
If you keep doing this, we can't work together.

340
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,200
I'm sorry. I will come early tomorrow.

341
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,900
- I will come when it's still dark and before the chickens are awake—
- Let's go.

342
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,040
Back then, I didn't know those three days were a test.

343
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,730
That test decided the rest of my life.

344
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,600
- Right here?
- Yes.

345
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,420
Wait for me.

346
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,420
- Come again.
- Thanks.

347
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,360
- Hello, I would like two boxes of Ding Sheng cakes.
- Okay.

348
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,110
Let's eat. Dingsheng cakes in the morning are for good luck.
(T/N: Dingsheng cakes are Suzhou Style cakes known for being light red, soft, fragrant, and having a sweet bean paste flavor)

349
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,520
I'm good. I hate sweets.

350
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,720
Why? Do you think it's emasculating to eat desserts?

351
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,750
Smell it. It's the smell of sticky rice.

352
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,990
Also, the red bean paste inside is not a regular red bean paste.

353
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,930
- It's made with five different kinds of beans.
- I hate sweets.

354
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,860
Do I need to write that down? Fasten your seatbelt. Let's go.

355
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,330
This way.

356
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,390
Here.

357
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,040
Yours is called Peacock Flying Southeast.

358
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,790
Mine is called Going to the Edge of the World and Never Coming Back.

359
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,490
- Please enjoy.
- Thanks.

360
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:15,230
Why do this again? I said I want to have food. Not names.

361
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,670
What's wrong with naming food with fun names?

362
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,890
You are just too old and judgemental,

363
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,750
and you have a bad temper when you wake up in the morning.

364
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,490
Are you done?

365
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,780
People from Hangzhou love green tea,

366
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,370
but since you haven't eaten anything, green tea would be too strong for you.

367
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,800
So I've ordered you a cold drink with fruit and lemon tea,

368
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,550
so you won't have low blood sugar.

369
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,370
- What's yours?
- Mine? Tangerine and Pu'er.

370
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:47,260
I need to clean the greasiness from the Dingsheng cake, so I can eat more later.

371
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,570
The dessert looks nice. Get more.

372
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,920
So annoying.

373
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,250
Let's eat!

374
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,860
These are Scallion Cheese Scones. This is Ox Tongue Cake. Should be a Northern dish.

375
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,540
This is the Salt Pepper Peach Pastry from Sichuan. Try it.

376
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,120
Why does it taste like salted yolk?

377
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,210
Can I order another one?

378
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,560
Of course. As many as you want.

379
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,370
Waiter!

380
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,720
Hey, when did you discover that you have such a different sense of taste?

381
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,050
You can say it's a blessing in disguise.

382
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,230
The year I started junior high school,

383
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,060
I entered a pepper eating competition for the ¥200 reward,

384
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,830
so I could buy my mother a birthday cake.

385
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,020
I had 14 of the spiciest ghost peppers.

386
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,920
I came out first, but I threw up and passed out.

387
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,760
- It has grapefruit.
- A friend of mine...

388
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,850
- Lemon.
- happened to be there. He took me to the hospital.

389
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,690
- Passion fruit.
- That's how we met.

390
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,190
After I left the hospital, I discovered that my sense of taste

391
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,540
was a thousand times more sensitive than before.

392
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,620
Why is there ink too?

393
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,380
Who did this?

394
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:52,260
Your story is quite amazing. Let me ask you.

395
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,350
Are you sensitive to all flavors?

396
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:59,580
Mostly. I can recognize anything I taste.

397
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,990
But there's one thing.

398
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,190
I just can't tell what it is.

399
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,770
What is it?

400
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,190
There is this restaurant that has the barbecue fish I love.

401
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:14,280
The fish has one seasoning that I just can't tell what it is.

402
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,430
All right. Take me to try it.

403
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:20,050
Let's try it for dinner. They are only open at night.

404
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,620
All right.

405
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,100
Chu Ting is opening a branch in Shanghai, do you know that?

406
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,310
I know that! I've seen the floor plan.

407
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,060
He might stay in Shanghai for a while.

408
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,060
It's fine. Shanghai is not far.

409
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Do you want to go to Shanghai?

410
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,420
What?

411
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,680
Do you eat street food often?

412
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:10,390
Isn't this normal food?

413
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,220
Have you ever had it?

414
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,800
It's my first time.

415
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,490
Is it good?

416
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,050
It does taste good.

417
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,890
Thank you, sir.

418
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,720
- How much, sir?
- ¥12.

419
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,730
Scan the QR code to pay.

420
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,740
Hello? What's up?

421
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,140
Old Lin, what was with the interview?

422
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,860
- Don't mention it.
- Who are you with right now?

423
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,750
It's a long story.

424
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,090
- Let's go!
- Mr. Jiang, I have a friend.

425
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,820
He wants to come to eat the barbecue fish with us. Do you mind?

426
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,330
I do.

427
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,750
- But...
- But what?

428
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,750
I was thinking about convincing you.

429
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,420
Try convincing me then.

430
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,860
He is a very close friend.

431
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,370
Also, he was the one who took me to the hospital back then. So...

432
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,460
You are working right now. Does it have to be today?

433
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,340
- But going to this restaurant—
- Is he very important to you?

434
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,700
All right. He can come.

435
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,680
Thank you, Mr. Jiang!

436
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,670
This is the friend I told you about.

437
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,750
Song Yiran, this is Mr. Jiang. An amazing chef from the UK.

438
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,270
- Hello.
- Hello, Big Shot.

439
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,400
It's going to be far. Can you catch up?

440
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,950
Yes. Let's go.

441
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,460
♫  Look into your eyes  ♫

442
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,420
Get in, Old Lin.

443
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,660
I can't ride with you today.

444
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,560
He is my boss today. I have to ride with him.

445
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,660
Also, it will be bad if he gets lost.

446
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,120
Go ahead. We will catch you.

447
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,660
All right.

448
00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:00,450
♫  Someone steals your heart  ♫

449
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:05,770
From the first day I met him, he was always preoccupied.

450
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,470
Like a huge block of ice, the atmosphere was depressing while with him.

451
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:14,380
I had no idea what he'd been through back then.

452
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,450
I'm sorry.

453
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,890
I have this habit when I'm in his car.

454
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,020
Would you like to listen to some music to beat the silence?

455
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,650
It's all right.

456
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:06,900
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

457
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,890
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

458
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:14,150
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

459
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:21,230
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

460
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,280
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

461
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,550
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

462
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,290
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
