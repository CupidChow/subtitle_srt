You know this. You can't just take medicine carelessly.

Lin Kesong's parents

44
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,400
sent some dishes over.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,390
One of them was her favorite food.

46
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,240
Her dad told me that

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,500
he wanted me to make it for her.

48
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,200
But I couldn't make it. Because I can't taste anything at all.

49
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,440
And I thought it was some terrible thing.

50
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,070
If you can't make that dish, it's fine. Just make the dishes you can make.

51
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,070
I understand what her parents mean.

52
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,070
They want me to be good to her, and to take care of her. I want that too–

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,470
If I can't even make this easy dish,

54
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,250
what right do I have to keep her by my side? Am I even a chef anymore?

55
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,980
Oh right. Does Lin Kesong know about this?

56
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,740
I understand her too well.

57
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,700
She didn't want to put me in a difficult situation.

58
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,940
She helped me conceal it from her parents.

59
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,490
I know that she's pitying me, but I don't want her pity. This is the worst feeling for me.

I understand. I know what you mean.

61
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,240
It's not just you. I would have a hard time if I were in that situation too.

62
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,560
But have you thought about this? Lin Kesong

63
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,210
might not be pitying you.

64
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,620
Because even though you've lost your sense of taste,

65
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,970
in her eyes, you're still an amazing chef.

66
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,330
I'm not amazing at all.

67
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,390
Right now, without her, I'm nothing.

Don't worry. I understand how you feel as the car's previous owner.

110
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,460
After you drive a car for a while, it's like your own child.

111
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,680
You're attached to it. Of course it would be hard for you to give it up so suddenly.

112
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,760
But since you need to give it up, you need to let go.

113
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,670
But don't worry. I will definitely find a good owner for it.

We need the vehicle registration, too.

118

The vehicle registration?

119

This is such a big decision, it makes sense that you're hesitating.

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,620
He's here.

160
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,410
I'll send you the password.

161
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,510
I came because I wanted to tell you in person

162
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,590
that I don't want the money anymore.

163
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,920
What? Why?

164
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,160
Did you guys call the police?

165
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,790
- No, we didn't.
- No.

166
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,510
Get in the car first.

167
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,060
Alright, the police are gone.

168
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,820
Dr. Xie, is your burn wound doing better?

169
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,420
It's fine now.

170
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,260
Dr. Xie, I want to ask you,

171
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,850
if someone were to be burned by asphalt,

172
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,650
would it be very serious? Would they die?

173
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,430
It depends on their immune system and metabolism. It also depends on the surface area of the burn wound.

174
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,330
Why? Did someone get burned?

175
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,580
My mom. My mom is still

176
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,560
lying in the hospital. She hasn't woken up yet.

177
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,830
I deserve this.

178
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,400
I've been blacklisted on the internet.

179
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,830
I can't even buy train or bus tickets now.

180
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,760
I really want to go and see her.

181
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,460
What... what kind of son am I?

182
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,540
My goodness.

183
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,350
Ms. Quentin.

184
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,270
I... I really shouldn't have agreed to do this for you.

185
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,970
Even if I did it, I shouldn't have forced your hand like this.

186
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,570
It's all my fault.

187
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,040
God sees everything we do.

188
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,430
All our debts have to be repaid eventually.

189
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,340
Don't worry.

190
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,370
I won't turn you in. I won't come find you guys again either.

191
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,070
I really won't.

192
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,460
You guys take care of yourselves.

193
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,080
Wait!

194
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,010
Dr. Xie, what are you...?

195
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,420
Take my car. At night, when there's less people around,

196
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,360
go and see your mom.

197
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,070
Take this. I'm sorry, Li Yan.

198
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,430
No, I really can't take this.

199
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,880
Take this to pay for your mom's medical bills. You need to take it in order for me to not worry about you.

200
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,410
Take it. Do it for her. Take this money,

201
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,510
and take care of your mom.

202
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,960
Thank you. Thank you.

203
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,770
Even if I'm caught by the police,

204
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,260
I won't tell them anything.

205
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,220
I won't say anything.

206
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,150
You should eat something. The food is quite light.

207
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,120
When do you think there will be a new medication that can help Oliver recover his sense of taste?

208
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,560
Maybe...tomorrow?

209
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,330
Who knows? But I believe that anything is possible.

210
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,060
Isn't that so?

211
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,260
That's true. The best case scenario

212
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,590
is if Oliver recovers his sense of taste soon, and Li Yan isn't arrested.

213
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,920
And I can take this secret to my grave.

214
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,830
Don't you think that this is very romantic?

215
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,930
It's a cruel kind of romantic.

216
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,360
Now that you say it, it does seem like that.

217
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,490
If things really did turn out like that, it would be great.

218
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,510
No, it wouldn't be great at all.

219
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,370
The bad guys wouldn't have been punished.

220
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,570
The bad guys? Who are the bad guys?

221
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,330
Me.

222
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,090
Fate is too kind to me, even though I'm a bad person.

223
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,740
I sabotaged Oliver, and yet he still trusts me so deeply.

224
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,360
And this had nothing to do with you, but you even put up your house as collateral to help me.

225
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,750
And you have stayed by my side instead of blaming me.

226
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,860
Li Yan should have been my karma.

227
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,450
But he told me that even if the police arrested him, he wouldn't say anything.

228
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,960
It's like all of you are looking past my wrongdoings.

229
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,760
It's like the whole world

230
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,430
is whispering into my ear, "It's okay."

231
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,750
"Just keep living like this."

232
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,120
Don't think about it anymore. Eat some food first.

233
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,070
Look how much weight you've lost recently.

234
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,920
Junbin.

235
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,930
I still want to tell Oliver the truth. If Li Yan can regret his actions, why can't I?

236
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:29,000
It's okay, even if Oliver hates me for the rest of his life.

237
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:34,350
Or even if I go to jail, that's okay too. I'm not afraid.

238
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,710
I deserve this.

239
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,560
It's my fault.

240
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,180
Elise.

241
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,430
I want you to remember.

242
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
No matter what you decide,

243
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,430
I support you unconditionally.

244
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,880
Thank you.

245
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,400
I'm so glad I have you.

246
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:19,070
If you really want to thank me, drink some porridge. If you don't drink it, it's going to get cold.

247
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,620
Here, your two cold cokes.

248
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,300
Thank you.

249
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,290
Brother, here you go.

250
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,790
It's my treat today. Don't even think about fighting me for the bill.

251
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,860
What trouble did you cause this time?

252
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,530
You say it like I cause trouble all the time.

253
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,270
I'm very well-behaved.

254
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,540
The shrimp is here.

255
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,940
Brother, eat some shrimp.

256
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,320
So you must need money. What do you want to buy this time?

257
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,720
You really are my biological brother.

258
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,010
Where... where's my car registration?

259
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,890
Your sister-in-law has the car registration. Why?

260
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:18,570
This car was a birthday gift from your sister-in-law. Do you want to get a new car already?

261
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,760
I want to sell the car.

262
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,960
Ran Ran. The company's finances aren't doing too well recently.

263
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,380
Can you wait a little longer?

264
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,690
I don't want to wait.

265
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,050
Okay. You can switch it out for a new car then. Which car do you want to get?

266
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,110
Brother, actually, I don't want to get a new car.

267
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:53,770
I just want to sell my car because I want to use the money to enroll in a business management class.

268
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,290
I didn't want to ask you for the money, so...

269
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,150
It's this one.

270
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,540
It's quite expensive, but I've already done some research, and there aren't any cheaper ones.

271
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,770
This one is more reputable, so...

272
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,050
And I've already gone to a secondhand car dealership. They said that I need to bring the car registration.

273
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,560
If you sell the car, how will you get to class?

274
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,730
I'll take the subway, or the bus. I can get anywhere on public transportation.

275
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,430
You make it sound easy.

276
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:36,270
But everyone who enrolls in these classes are high-ranking business executives.

277
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,310
Won't you be embarrassed to ride a bicycle to class?

278
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,640
I don't care what others think of me.

279
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,590
I just need to focus on what I'm doing.

280
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,690
And ever since I was a kid, I've never learned how to make money. I've only ever spent money.

281
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,940
I don't deserve to drive that car. I should ride a bicycle.

282
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,050
I didn't imagine that you would suddenly become so ambitious.

283
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,380
You don't need to sell your car. I'll pay the tuition for you.

284
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,790
Brother.

285
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:01,810
I don't want you to do that. If you really want to help me, just ask my sister-in-law to give me the car registration.

286
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,130
This is my first step in starting over. I need to do this right.

287
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,230
No way. How can you ride a bicycle to class?

288
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,300
Your sister-in-law will say that I'm not being a good big brother.

289
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,500
She's going to complain that I didn't take good care of you, and that I'm letting you suffer.

290
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,760
Brother.

291
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,180
Do you still remember what our dad said before? "The most beautiful clothing someone can wear is their talent."

292
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:26,330
And before, our dad also started from nothing, and he built this entire company.

293
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,840
He didn't use any props in the beginning.

294
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,700
We need to adjust to the times. Our dad started from nothing, but we didn't.

295
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,530
Brother, you didn't, but I can.

296
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,260
I want to put some pressure on myself for once. Can you give me a chance to do that?

297
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,390
Okay.

298
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,060
Since you're so determined, we'll do as you said.

299
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,790
Cheers to our Ran Ran finally growing up.

300
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,960
It's been eight hours, and he still won't pick up my calls.

301
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,300
When he puts his mind to something, no one can get through to him.

302
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,000
I suddenly understand Elise's pain.

303
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,520
This won't do.

304
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,130
He can do whatever he wants.

305
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,490
He's so capable, he can definitely take care of himself.

306
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,930
But I can't lie to myself even if I want to.

307
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,920
I should go check on him, or else I won't be able to rest easy.

308

00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,460
I called you, but you didn't pick up, so I came to check on you.

315
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,620
♫ To embrace the rising storm ♫
Are you really that bored? Take a taxi home by yourself!

316
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,350
♫ You will find the treasure of your life ♫
My good intentions completely went to waste.

317
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,840
♫ You will find the treasure of your life ♫

318
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,730
Can you just stay at home instead of running around outside?

319
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,640
What about you?

320
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,880
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

321
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,470
I didn't want to pick up, so I didn't. I thought you understood me really well. Why would you ask me that?

322
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,090
What are you even talking about?

323
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,720
What am I saying?

324
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,220
Do I need to make it even clearer?

325
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,490
Why did you keep calling me, multiple times? Why did you wait for me at Yuxuan?

326
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,170
I don't need your sympathy or pity, okay?

327
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,180
Pitiful.

328
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,600
- What did you say?
- I said you're pitiful!

329
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,400
♫ Rainclouds float above my head ♫

330
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,860
Fine.

331
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,110
At least you finally said it out loud.

332
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,310
When did you find out?

333
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,350
I started suspecting it after Boris spoke at the press conference.

334
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,610
Why didn't you tell me? The incident with the raw vegetables, and everything that happened after that!

335
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,270
Did you think it was funny to see me like that?

336
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,230
Because you didn't want anyone else to know!

337
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:43,090
I just wanted to help you in secret. What's wrong with that?

338
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,670
You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't do anything wrong at all.

339
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,100
It's all my fault. Alright? Everything has been my fault.

340
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,900
But have you ever thought about how I would feel?

341
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,830
I'm a man in his thirties, do you think I need a little girl like you to pity me?

342
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,150
Isn't it pitiful for a chef to lose his sense of taste?

343
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,110
If I were you,

344
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,740
I would have left the kitchen a long time ago. Not just that, I would have felt so miserable I wanted to die.

345
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,900
But what about you? Why do you have to keep struggling like this?

346
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,740
Every day that I'm by your side, I'm so careful about what I say and do.

347
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,630
I'm terrified that I might say something that would hurt your pride.

348
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,300
Yes.

349
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,460
It might look like we are very close,

350
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,390
but actually we are very distant from each other.

351
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,320
I'll just ask you one thing.

352
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,790
Is it really that hard for you

353
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,160
to admit that you need me?

354
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:05,060
♫ Colors fading when you go ♫

355
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,960
♫ Memory is sinking to black hole ♫

356
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:20,350
♫ Memory is sinking to black hole ♫

357
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,490
I'm sorry.

358
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,290
I'm sorry.

359
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,010
It's my fault.

360
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,690
It's all my fault.

361
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,240
I need you.

362
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,510
Don't leave me.
I always thought he was cold and temperamental,

363
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,330
Okay?
but while I was hugging him tightly like this,

364
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,860
I realized that he needs someone to come and warm him up.

365
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,090
This man is big and mighty like a giant, but he's also vulnerable like a child.

366
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,580
He makes me feel sorry for him and worry about him.

367
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:05,230
So when you checked into Liang She Hotel, you already couldn't taste sweetness?

368
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,960
But I couldn't reject all fruits and vegetables that contain sugar.

369
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,030
Or else I wouldn't be able to make any of Yuxuan's dishes.

370
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:22,610
Right before August, on the day that Yuxuan officially opened in Shanghai,

371
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:29,030
I suddenly discovered that I couldn't taste the sweetness of vegetables anymore.

372
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,600
So I went to see Dr. Xie. He told me

373
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,650
my taste bud nerves had started to diminish.

374
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,990
This news made me very anxious.

375
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:48,280
Because I can lose anything, but not my sense of taste.

376
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,540
So under the guise of searching for a disciple,

377
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,770
I started searching, with just one purpose in mind.

378
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:02,870
I wanted to find someone who could replace my sense of taste and help me in that way.

379
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,070
So that's why you went to Hangzhou and checked into Liang She Hotel?

380
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,290
And then I met you.

381
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,130
But it was also on that day that I fully lost the taste of sweetness.

382
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,010
No wonder you were so desperate to find me that day.

383
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,720
That's right.

384
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:30,830
At that time, I was terrified of anyone discovering my secret.

385
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:37,000
So when I saw you, I almost fainted from nervousness.

386
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,190
But at the time, you probably didn't hear what I said, right?

387
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,200
Of course, I didn't hear you. I was in a rush to get out of there.

388
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,820
Originally, I had thought I wouldn't be able to find that person anymore.

389
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,100
But then, in the questionnaire, I saw a "Guess."

390
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,780
I desperately wanted to find the person who wrote "Guess", but I couldn't find them no matter how I tried.

391
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,430
There were a few times when I wanted to give up.

392
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,290
But then later, I ran into you again.

393
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:18,600
When I ran into you at the snack restaurant that day, I almost laughed out of pure joy.

394
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,790
Later on, I thought that

395
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,160
maybe this was all meant to be.

396
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,860
That day, I was fired because of you.

397
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,280
I was so miserable.

398
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,530
I know.

399
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,010
I could tell.

400
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:43,370
That's why I held my laugh in. It was so difficult to keep a straight face.

401
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,960
What happened after that?

402
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,550
After that, I discovered that the little girl by my side

403
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,640
would surprise me in a different way every day.

404
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,140
He told me the entire story, beginning to end, of how he lost his sense of taste.

405
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,630
This cold and unapproachable man opened up to me, just like that.

406
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,810
He sat 2 meters away from me,

407
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:13,200
but I felt like we were closer than we would be if we were hugging.

408
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,860
He said that he felt like there was an invisible rope around him.

409
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,260
It kept getting tighter and tighter, and he couldn't escape no matter how he tried.

410
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,730
I said that this invisible rope

411
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:29,280
brought us together from two different worlds, when we might never have crossed paths otherwise.

412
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,810
Could this be what they call "fate"?

413
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,470
I was too embarrassed to ask him that.

414
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,100
It looks quite good.

415
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,090
It tastes pretty good too.

416
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,920
So?

417
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,850
You can't tell me anything else about it?

418
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:29,630
So, since you can make such delicious fish,

419
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:34,030
I was going to give you a beating, but now I won't.

420
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,910
Ha.

421
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,350
Didn't you want to know what happened yesterday? I'll tell you right now.

422
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,290
Yesterday, when no one was looking,

423
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:52,130
I took a packet of sugar this big

424
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,200
and snuck into Mr. Jiang's office.

425
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,800
I poured all of it into the thermos that he usually drinks out of.

426
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,520
And then from the kitchen, I saw him walk into his office,

427
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,950
pick up the thermos, and take a big sip from it.

428
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:08,220
And then, guess what happened next?

429
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,050
What happened?

430
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,450
He threw a fit of anger and asked "Who did this?!"

431
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,100
I was so scared. I'm so smart, of course I would never admit to doing that.

432
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,550
But Boris, is it fun for you to mess with me like this?

433
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,160
How could that be?

434
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,170
Was Elise there?

435
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,060
No, she wasn't. She didn't show up at all yesterday.

436
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:38,500
So you're saying that Jiang Qianfan's sense of taste is perfectly fine. Is that right?

437
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,490
It's completely fine.

438
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:46,440
Alright, your precious disciple is back. I won't disturb you any longer then.

439
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:54,280
Young lady, before I leave, let me give you a word of caution.

440
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,290
If you're looking for a mentor, there are plenty of options out there.

441
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,870
Your mentor has quite a big nose,

442
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,730
but other than that, nothing about him is very reliable.

443
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,060
Who is he?

444
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,310
Jiang Qianfan's head chef.

445
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:11,420
The so-called pillar of Yuxuan?

446
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:17,100
From the article,

447
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,250
it seemed that he was very dissatisfied with Jiang Qianfan.

448
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,800
He has a lot of pent-up anger towards him.

449
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,290
So he should be the person who most wants to see Jiang Qianfan fail.

450
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,870
But he told me that Jiang Qianfan's sense of taste

451
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,480
was completely fine.

452
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,560
Boris. You can't just pick any random method to solve a problem.

453
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,750
No matter how unhappy he is with Jiang Qianfan,

454
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,870
he wouldn't be on your side either. What can you do for him?

455
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,700
You're right. I think I rushed this.

456
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,960
You made the right choice by coming back.

457
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,820
I can already tell.

458
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:03,890
You're ready to sell your soul to the devil.
