00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,620
What is Sister Nina's number?

10
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,680
Why can't I reach Sister Nina?

11
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,050
I don't know.

12
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,430
I just know that you wasted enough time,

13
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,630
so stop wasting time on trivial matters.

14
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,950
Get changed and start practicing in the kitchen now.

15
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,300
She just disappeared like that. At least give me an explanation.

16
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,900
I have none.

17
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,350
Fine. You won't tell me. I'll report it to the police and ask them.

18
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,560
I'll tell you then. I asked her to leave!

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,310
You think you just passed out because of an allergy? You were poisoned!

20
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,510
But the essential oils weren't mine.

21
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,600
So you're saying...

22
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,920
It was Sister Nina who put poison in the essential oil?

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,590
Sister Nina wanted to sabotage you,

24
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,420
so you fired her.

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,290
Am I right?

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,730
I'll take your silence as a yes.

27
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,140
You're heartless

28
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,130
and cruel, you know.

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,860
Nina wanted to sabotage you?

30
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,010
Why would she do that? What did she do to you?

31
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,190
Every day, she takes care of everything for you.

32
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,120
Without any evidence, you think she's guilty.

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,590
Have you considered her feelings? Where is she supposed to go now?

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,350
Just so you know,

35
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,830
I will never keep someone like that around me!

36
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,410
Don't make me repeat myself! Get changed and start your training!

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,670
No.

38
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,920
Little Bread, take care of yourself. Don't ever lose that enthusiasm of yours.

39
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,870
I wish you and Mr. Jiang well.

40
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,770
Forever and ever.

41
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,940
Yours truly, Nina.

42
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,460
Lin Kesong.

43
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,690
I didn't say you could leave.

44
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,250
We have eaten and took lots of breaks. You should be in tip-top shape now?

45
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,940
This is my favorite spot in Hangzhou.

46
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,210
I can sit here all day long without any problem.

47
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,700
I'm just kidding. Where do you want to go next?

48
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,470
I have to attend a designer show later. Come with me.

49
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,750
All right. No problem.

50
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,950
Hello, Old Lin. You finally recalled my presence.

51
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,520
Stop mocking me. I just left Jiang Qianfan's place.

52
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,470
I don't have any place to go. Where are you?

53
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,240
What? What happened? Where are you now?

54
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,360
I'm in front of your house. Where are you?

55
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,230
Doesn't matter. Don't go anywhere. I'm coming now.

56
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,010
Let's go!

57
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,100
Slow down.

58
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,270
Even if we rush back now, it'll still take more than two hours to arrive.

59
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,360
I have to go back.

60
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,840
She needs me right now. I can't just leave her alone.

61
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,940
I didn't say you can't be there for her.

62
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,910
What I'm saying is we could just ask her to check into a hotel room in Bellagio, have a good night's sleep,

63
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,130
and when we finally arrive, she might have already made up with Jiang Qianfan.

64
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,840
So I shouldn't go to her now? That won't do.

65
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,210
She needs me now and not just a place to stay.

66
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,570
I just don't want you to get too tired from driving long hours.

67
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,210
Now you feel bad for me. You didn't say a thing just now.

68
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,060
Where is she?

69
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,370
Didn't I tell her to stay put?

70
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,590
What if she's just joking around?

71
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,150
She wouldn't. She's not that type of person.

72
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,340
Let me call her and ask.

73
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,280
Old Lin. Old Lin.

74
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,840
Are you all right?

75
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,490
Why did it take you so long?

76
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,970
- I...
- Both of you should come inside.

77
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,980
Let's talk inside.

78
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,290
Someone poisoned you?

79
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,260
Old Lin, this is a grave matter. Why didn't you tell me right away?

80
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,540
I understand why Mr. Jiang did what he did.

81
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,470
it's a case of poisoning, he's right to be suspicious of everyone.

82
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,220
I'm glad everyone is all right.

83
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,100
He's fine but Old Lin almost died.

84
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,100
Old Lin, you know what? Let's ditch him.

85
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,790
I'll find you a job with Liang She.

86
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,420
While I was waiting for you two, I had already made up my mind. I'll return to Wuzhen tomorrow.

87
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,740
Fine, as you wish.

88
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,210
Tonight you stay here.

89
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,220
If you still want to go back tomorrow, I'll take you.

90
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,290
But Old Lin, seriously,

91
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,800
this "boyfriend" of yours is no good.

92
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,380
I told you already he's not my boyfriend!

93
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,250
When did you tell me?

94
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,350
She told me.

95
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,670
- Who's there?
- Who else could it be?

96
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,460
Song Yiran!

97
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,110
How does he know I'm here?

98
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,280
How dare you show up here?

99
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,040
Yiran!

100
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,350
Can I talk to her in private?

101
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,380
No. You stay away from her.

102
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,610
Enough. Let go of him.

103
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,480
Yiran!

104
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,150
Let's go!

105
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,260
Don't shove me.

106
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
Calm yourself down. It's their business. You shouldn't come between them.

107
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,760
I don't want Old Lin to be taken advantage of.

108
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,930
When did she tell you?

109
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,030
During the housewarming party.

110
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,280
If you're done with your tantrum, let's go back. It's quite late already.

111
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,480
Don't trouble them. All right?

112
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,970
No. If you don't reinstate Nina, I'm not going with you.

113
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,890
I'll decide after the police investigation.

114
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,010
Sister Nina took care of you for so many years. She regards you as her little brother.

115
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,530
If she wanted to poison you, she'd have done it ages ago. She wouldn't wait till now to do it!

116
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,890
Finally, your brain is functioning again!

117
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,150
Even if Nina is my older sister, I will still ask her to leave!

118
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,430
Everything in this world can change. Anything can happen.

119
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,960
Others will, but she won't!

120
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,650
Besides, what makes you think that someone didn't pay me to sabotage you?

121
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,510
At the cost of your own life?

122
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,230
I don't care. You fired her. You hurt my feelings.

123
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,350
I'm not going back with you!

124
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,330
Fine. What about the competition?

125
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,490
If you run away now, you'll be Evil Dragon Princess forever. Isn't it embarrassing?

126
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,410
I'm not afraid.

127
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,400
So you went through everything for nothing?

128
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,790
So be it. I'll go back to Wuzhen tomorrow anyway.

129
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,930

130
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,180
Fine.

131
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,540
I'm afraid it's not up to you to decide whether you'll go back with me.

132
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,260
Take it.

No, when did I sign this contract?

Why don't I remember any of it?

On the way after I picked you up from Xiaoyu's Private Kitchen.

140

Didn't I sign a contract for some big competition?

141
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,630
It was also in English. Didn't you say everyone signed?

142
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,280
Yeah. Do you remember how many copies you signed?

143
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,160
Two copies?

144
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,230
That's right. This is one of them.

145
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,320
- How could you do this? Why didn't you explain clearly?
- You didn't look closely.

146
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,570
Sure. You set me up.

Song Yi...

148

Let me tell you. The contract is written very clearly. No other person can know. Otherwise...

Open-Open your mouth.

- Are you threatening me with this?
- Yes.

Go home.

152

I don't have this type of male friend.

154
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,560
- Does it have anything to do with males or females?
- Yes!

155
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,620
What's going on with those two? Why did they leave without saying anything?

156

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,290
As his assistant and apprentice, I'll get free room and board, but can't terminate the contract for three years.

162
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,450
The penalty for contract violation is ¥‎1 million. The most liable Jiang Qianfan

163
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,060
is actually using such a trick to keep me.

164
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,630
I really want to leave him now!

165
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,210
He is really heartless and scary,

166
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,910
but why exactly is he plotting and scheming against me?

167
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,020
Lin Kesong, it's past 9 p.m. tonight. I'm making an except...

168
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,800
Lin Kesong!

169
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,020
An exception.

170
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,920
[How did you come around? Tell me, otherwise I'll not have peace of mind. Did the guy with the surname Jiang treat you badly?]

171
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,170
[I want to kill him.]

172
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
[I'm fine.]

173
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,020
That's a bad habit. Give it back.

174
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,090
She already said that she is okay. Why are you still so sad?

175
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,530
Song Yiran, what is your relationship with Lin Kesong?

176
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,070
What can there be between her and me? I already told you, we're just friends.

177
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,130
In that case, I'd like to ask you.

178
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,720
Don't you think the two of you are too close?

179
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,240
Really? We used to be closer. We were together every day.

180
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,090
That's why you came to Shanghai, and she came to Shanghai.

181
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,970
She moved in here, and you also moved in here.

182
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:47,120
When she's upset, you get really anxious. I've been upset for a long time, but you haven't noticed.

183
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,670
This is your relationship, right?

184
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,090
Chu Ting, are you jealous of Old Lin?

185
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,090
I've been friends with Old Lin for many years.

186
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,140
If she is in trouble, I can't ignore it. Her problems are my problems too.

187
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,580
What about my problems?

188
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,100
You are capable of handling your own problem. You don't need me.

189
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,250
Song Yiran!

190
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,830
When you say that, it's especially difficult for me to tolerate this.

191
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,440
Let's make it clear today between us.

192
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,550
Either you stay with me and stay away from her,

193
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,700
or we can break up.

194
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,660
Let's break up then.

195
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,380
[Boris]

196
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,490
Hello.

197
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,710
Boris, say whatever you need quickly.

198
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,650
I'm enjoying stir-fried liver slices now.

199
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,710
Thomas, does the committee have the contestants' registration applications?

200
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:31,560
Get someone to send me Lin Xiaoyu's address.

201
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,900
You can't even find your own disciple.

202
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,940
You're really something.

203
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,620
Hi, Lucy. It's me.

204
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,850
Please send me Miss Lin Xiaoyu's address. Thank you.

205
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,370
Boss, look at this.

206
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,540
Could he be the legendary napkin hero?

207
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,500
What?

208
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,500
I saw it in my chat group. They say there is someone

209
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,630
who always likes to write his food critique on the napkins.

210
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,190
Also, he is always exactly right.

211
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,210
But... no one has ever seen him.

212
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,590
Still sleeping?

213
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,500
Why aren't you eating?

214
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,190
If you don't let me out, I won't eat.

215
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,050
Sure, no problem.

216
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,260
I heard that people

217
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,330
won't die even if they don't eat for one or two months.

218
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,570
Also, let me tell you.

219
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:02,980
After the competition, that's when I'll let you go.

220
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,860
No, Dad! What have I done wrong, why are you so extreme?

221
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,710
You are ruining my future.

222
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,180
Give me the cellphone.

223
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,090
I'll give it to you after you've self-reflected.

224
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:25,510
You should learn to behave first.

225
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,960
Let me, let me.

226
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,120
Uncle, what has Sister Yu done wrong?

227
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,030
You've locked her in and even cut off the electricity. So ruthless.

228
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,000
It's embarrassing to talk about it.

229
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,380
- At least let her use the cellphone.
- How will she self-reflect then?

230
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,180
[Walk straight, 20 meters]

231
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,810
May I ask, is this Lin Xiaoyu's home?

232
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,980
No.

233
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,560
That can't be right.

234
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,710
It's clearly written on the committee's registration form.

235
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,060
I have no idea what you're saying.

236
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,980
Isn't this Lin Xiaoyu's cellphone?

237
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,010
You still say this is not her home?

238
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,020
You don't know who I am.

239
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,520
My name is Boris.

240
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,340
I know. Aren't you that Jiang Qianfan's senior brother who wants Xiaoyu as a disciple?

241
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,420
Let me tell you. Xiaoyu isn't going to the competition. You can find anyone else.

242
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,820
Why?

243
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,560
Have I done something wrong?

244
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,460
What have you taught her?

245
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,260
A lot. Many things that your little eatery has never seen.

246
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,190
I'll say.

247
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,340
I wonder why the kid doesn't seem human anymore.

248
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,570
Do you know this?

249
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,750
Her sister was in the hospital, and an urgent notice of medical crisis was issued!

250
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,240
She wouldn't even show her face, and went to your place to make some stupid fish liver.

251
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,290
You actually have the gall to come here.

252
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,070
No parent would hand over their kids to you!

253
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,820
You don't understand priorities.

254
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,110
It's just for that matter?

255
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,090
If she did go there, would her sister recover?

256
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,210
That's for family affection! Don't you understand?

257
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,910
If she had really gone there,

258
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,330
not only expensive food ingredients would have been wasted,

259
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,240
she would have lost the chance to learn a dish.

260
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,220
During the first round of the competition,

261
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,730
she might even lose for this very reason!

262
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,950
And then, she would return to this

263
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,590
ragged and damp little eatery

264
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,830
and live an ordinary life. Just like you!

265
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,890
At least she would still be a human being!

266
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,100
Her heart would be more at ease than yours.

267
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,460
What do you know? All you know is win or lose.

268
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,640
Only the weak think this way.

269
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,400
They have nothing to show off, so they sit on their moral high ground.

270
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,050
Look at you!

271
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,350
Why would Xiaoyu ever ask you to be her mentor?

272
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,490
Bugger off now!

273
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,160
Want to go at it?

274
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,880
I'll leave then.

275
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,390
I want to see how long you can imprison Xiaoyu.

276
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,180
it's none of your business, she's my daughter!

277
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,820
Thank you.

278
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,660
Thank you.

279
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,490
Lin Kesong.

280
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,070
Lin Kesong. Can't you mix faster?

281
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,460
The dough won't rise like that.

282
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,370
Here. Try it.

283
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,070
I asked you to try it.

284
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,120
I...

285
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,350
This is the emerald Chinese cabbage dumpling that I made with truffles and cauliflower fungus. You won't try it?

286
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,210
All right then. I won't let you off later if the one you made is worse than mine.

287
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,220
You think you can upset me like this?

288
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,750
On the contrary, actually.

289
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,900
I'm not the one making a fool of myself on the stage anyway. You'll see.

290
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,280
One square forward.

291
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,520
One square forward?

292
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,930
Disgusting move.

293
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,450
My middle name is digusting.

294
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,280
Hi, Uncle Lin.

295
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,090
Blu, you're here.

296
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,010
Is Xiaoyu here?

297
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,500
Hold right there. I'm playing chess now.

298
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,860
This is Chinese chess.

299
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,520
Foreigners like you surely haven't heard of it.

300
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,620
- Let me show you.
- Okay.

301
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,410
Chariot, from three,

302
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,370
move horizontally, to six.

303
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,310
What's your move, Fatty?

304
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,860
Come on, think hard.

305
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,060
Did you get it?

306
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,720
That was a brillant move.

307
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,170
You understand it?

308
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,930
Of course.

309
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,670
Your next move will be

310
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,980
your chariot, eliminating his advisor.

311
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,860
Then he has to use

312
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,870
his general to remove your chariot.

313
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,380
And lastly,

314
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,610
you'll move your horse here.

315
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,500
Horse, checkmate.

316
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,410
Chariot, checkmate.

317
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,620
Game over.

318
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,800
Right, right, right.

319
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,690
Fatty, you can't move it now. S-stop it! Stop!

320
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,980
Don't you know the rule of not talking when watching a chess game?

321
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,570
Don't you understand not talking when watching a chess game?

322
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,150
Xiaoyu isn't here. You'd better leave quickly and not hinder my game!

323
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,570
Hurry and leave. Go, go, go!

324
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,470
Go. Go.

325
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:46,480
Your horse is here. How can my chariot come over? This doesn't work!

326
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,520
[Important Reminder: Chu Ting's Buyer's Store Opening Today!!!]

327
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,410
Who are you?

328
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,420
Hello. I'm the new housekeeping person.

329
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,080
Housekeeping person?

330
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,410
I don't recall hiring a housekeeping service.

331
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,230
I hired him to replace Nina.

332
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,680
Pal.

333
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,590
I advise you to leave quickly.

334
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,470
He is the kind of person, no matter how good or thoughtful you are to him,

335
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,070
he will turn good intentions into bad and will falsely blame you.

336
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,170
Moreover,

337
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,720
doing this little housekeeping work here,

338
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,580
do you think we need help?

339
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,700
We don't need it, do we?

340
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,140
Lin Kesong, do you know what you are saying?

341
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,910
If I didn't hire him to do this work,

342
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,430
will you do it? Will I do it?

343
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,550
You are fired. Go!

344
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,560
Wait. Don't leave!

345
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,990
Lin Kesong, are you messing with me?

346
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,040
Look at me!

347
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,650
Fine. You want it this way.

348
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,610
From now on, there's a new rule. You do all this housework!

349
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,460
What? You aren't used to it?

350
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,310
If you aren't used to it, you can do it.

351
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,560
Lin Kesong, come back!

352
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,820
Lin Kesong, come get the chef's uniform.

353
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,440
Do you hear?

354
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,130
I'm going to Yuxuan to teach everyone a new dish. You are coming too.

355
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,390
Lin Kesong, speak!

356
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,090
I'm asleep, didn't hear it!

357
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,850
I'm leaving the chef's uniform here. It doesn't matter if you come or not.

358
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,190
How about it, Mom?

359
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,880
Was your flight good? Did you sleep?

360
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,150
- It was good.
- Good.

361
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,100
Can we go home to pick up the stuff?

362
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,380
That's great. I'm so hungry.

363
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,270
You are always hungry, Victor.

364
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:39,460
[Do you think me and Chu Ting are suited for each other?]

365
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:51,020
[What did you do to her?]

366
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:01,870
[If you thought you liked a person very much, but after spending time with the person, you realized that you don't really like her that much, what would you do?]

367
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:12,250
[Don't you have a lot of experience in these kinds of things?]

368
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,100
Elise, is there anything to eat? I'm starving to death.

369
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,900
- There are a lot of your favorite foods in the kitchen.
- Really?

370
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,970
- Help yourself.
- Okay.

371
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,680
Mom, I still need to go to work. I'll come back later to be with you.

372
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,140
Elise, I want to ask you something. Come here.

373
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,070
After Li Yan's incident, I wanted to ask you something,

374
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:48,330
but it wasn't convenient to talk over the phone. You know what I want to say.

375
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,310
I don't know.

376
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,140
Strangle a rose. Let him wither in your vase.

377
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,870
What does that mean?

378
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,830
I... That's just a metaphor.

379
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,710
Is it really only a metaphor?

380
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,210
I find it very strange.

381
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,360
I remember, when you were a child,

382
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,950
you liked an antique vase in the house

383
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,130
and wanted to take it to your room as a piggybank.

384
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,850
I didn't allow it, so you shattered it into pieces.

385
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,440
You never considered how valuable it was,

386
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,840
and now,

387
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,890
you have invested a lot of feelings in Jiang Qianfan but don't receive anything back.

388
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,600
Will you really let it go?

389
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
What else can I do then?

390
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,160
I am your mother.

391
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,430
No matter what you do, I'll always support you,

392
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,160
but the condition is,

393
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,740
you must tell me the truth.

394
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,980
Mom, what do you already know?

395
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,430
I know that Li Yan is a coward.

396
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,910
I also know Nina is very loyal.

397
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,950
Neither of them would do anything like poisoning Jiang Qianfan.

398
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,330
Do not cry!

399
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,560
Leave the sadness to those people who are injured.

400
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,920
What you should do now since you can't even keep him with that method,

401
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,750
think about what we should do now.

402
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,090
I don't know, Mom. I don't know.

403
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,290
Jiang Qianfan has lost his sense of taste.

404
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,850
How has he resolved it?

405
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,310
Isn't it obvious?

406
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,190
Yes, that girl.

407
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,820
JIang Qianfan has started to rely on other people.

408
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,850
Do you know what this means?

409
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,380
It's fine that you can't get love from him,

410
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,790
but it's possible that you can't even get what you should get.

411
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,190
I will not let my child suffer this kind of humiliation.

412
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,520
It's only fair that you have Yuxian.

413
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,450
Oliver told me that he could give everything to me. He would do it,

414
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,850
but I can't take it. I was wrong to him.

415
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,440
Is that so? A man will say anything.

416
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,210
But one day, when he discovers that his loss of taste is related to you,

417
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,730
will he still be so generous?

418
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,740
If you don't control the stocks now,

419
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,860
later when he gets closer to Lin Kesong more and more,

420
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,220
what happens if he hands her the success you fought hard for?

421
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:42,280
This is freshwater crayfish, also called small lobster.

422
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,290
Pass it around to let them see.

423
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,060
Because the crayfish is raised in freshwater,

424
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,760
we have to use green tea

425
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,360
to remove its fishy odor.

426
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,690
Before using the green tea to remove the fish odor, you must pay special attention

427
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,830
not to let the tea's taste overpower the food ingredient's natural taste.

428
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,280
So we'll place the little lobsters in the tea.

429
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,240
Remove them after soaking for 20 minutes.

430
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,740
After taking them out, dry up any excess tea.

431
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:09,090
Even though they are small lobsters, I want you to make sure they are cooked to 30% done.

432
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:30,150
Also, the sirloin beef must reach 54 degrees Celcius inside and out,

433
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:33,180
so that the texture and temperature will be balanced.

434
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:57,440
This dish combines Wagyu beef and red crayfish.

435
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,090
In other words, it also unites Eastern and Western foods

436
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,290
and cuisine.

437
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,950
I've named this dish "Meeting of Two Seasons".

438
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,650
With your new menu, there's a chance to win the stars.

439
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,600
I hope so.

440
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,920
I've found a few alternative treatments. Do you want to try?

441
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,370
No.

442
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,860
Why? Don't you trust me?

443
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,330
I'll look for them myself.

444
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,360
Wow, look at all this!

445
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,890
Where are you?

446
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,570
What do you mean by where?

447
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,700
It's the grand opening of Chu TIng's boutique.

448
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,070
You are coming too, Older Brother?

449
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,870
Useless talk. Of course, I have to come.

450
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,130
I'll be right there. I just bought the flowers.

451
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,770
Flowers? Who are you buying the flowers for?

452
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,980
Who else? It's for Chu Ting.

453
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,030
That's more like it.

454
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,160
I prepared a suit for you and also hired the best photographer.

455
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,580
Why did you hire a photographer?

456
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,270
Aren't you stupid? Of course, it's to take photos for you and Chu Ting.

457
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,380
Let me tell you. I want to make the two of you

458
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,540
into the most perfect couple in town,

459
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,400
so you'd better hurry.

460
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,140
Yes.

461
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,650
- Hello.
- Hello.

462
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,360
The flowers you ordered are ready. Where do you want to send them?

463
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,720
I don't want them anymore. Throw them away.

464
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,720
Sister, why isn't it starting yet?

465
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,700
- Beauty, it's been 20 minutes. When are we starting yet?
- Right away.

466
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,520
- Beauty, we only signed for one hour.
- I'm going to talk to the boss.

467
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,450
When the time is up, we'll leave.

468
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,930
I don't care. I'll just leave when it's time.

469
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,780
I have other shoots.

470
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,540
I can't keep wasting time here.

471
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,910
Is he here yet?

472
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:19,300
No. Why don't you call him?

473
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,630
The models are rushing, and the media are about to curse.

474
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:29,720
You know it too. They are so important that we can't offend any of them now.

475
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,490
Okay, got it. Let's not wait any longer.

476
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,260
This is our designer.

477
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,490
- Hello.
- Sorry, you've been waiting.

478
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,070

They are reporters from Guangming Entertainment.

00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,240
Hello, everyone. We're ready to start.

481
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,780
Okay. Let's go.

482
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,490
Hello, sorry that you've been waiting.

483
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,580
We're ready to start.

484
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,950
- Okay.
- Okay.

485
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,940
What's going on? It's starting, but you aren't here yet.

486
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:12,680
Older Brother, she's quite happy without me. I won't be there then.

487
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,390
That stinky rascal.

488
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:01,070
♫  Someone steals your heart  ♫

489
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,610
♫  Silence you can't find  ♫

490
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,150
♫  Look into your eyes  ♫

491
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,650
♫  Nowhere I can hide  ♫

492
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,780
♫  My daydream is changing  ♫

493
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,530
Do you want to talk about today's plan?

494
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,180
Today?

495
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,350
Play with the cellphone, lying down.

496
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:32,590
♫  Silence you can't find  ♫

497
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,530
♫ Look into your eyes  ♫

498
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,900
It's the press conference tomorrow.

499
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,610
A week after the press conference, it's the competition.

500
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,680
Don't you think it's a pity that you are wasting time?

501
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,060
It is a pity. I feel sorry for myself.

502
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,520
I should eat more of the good food.

503
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,400
♫  Take my broken soul  ♫

504
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,230
Aren't you scared of making a fool of yourself?

505
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,140
If the sky falls, the god of the kitchen will hold it up. Why should I be scared?

506
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,000
♫  You have a magic touch  ♫

507
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,720
♫  You're the special one ♫

508
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,500
Okay. Last question.

509
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,930
Have you thought it over?

510
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,190
You fight so hard against me. What do you want?

511
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,990
What do I want?

512
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,280
When you are not happy, I'm happy.

513
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:52,280
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

514
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,090
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

515
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,730
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

516
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,720
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

517
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,590
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

518
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:14,930
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

519
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,460
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
