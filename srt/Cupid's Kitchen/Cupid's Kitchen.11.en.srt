[Episode 11]

9
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,430
Victor must have told you. That's just great.

10
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,910
Everyone knows my hiding place now.

11
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,980
Yes. Victor is worried about you.

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
I'm also worried about you.

13
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,780
Is there really a possibility that Oliver can't regain his taste buds?

14
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,590
They still can't find the cause?

15
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,010
It's very difficult. I found a specialist for the treatment.

16
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,520
Everyone thinks that it could be a rare allergy

17
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,070
resulting in the death of nerve cells.

18
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,460
Then, what could it be?

19
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,490
It's very hard to figure out.

20
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,810
He lost his sense of taste about seven months ago.

21
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,590
In terms of the timeline, it should be

22
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,950
when London‘s Yuxuan just got 3 stars,

23
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,870
or in Shanghai when he was in the preparation stage.

24
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,380
So...

25
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,500
Oh, right.

26
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,800
Is there anything in these past 6 months

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,600
that he just started using and uses frequently?

28
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,730
Such as?

29
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,010
Such as...

30
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,670
Such as a shampoo or lotion

31
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,460
or perfume. Things with fragrance.

32
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,590
The other things are used by other people too. The essential oil is used by only him.

33
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,110
He has always liked to use aromatherapy oils to aid sleep.

34
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,880
He has maintained this habit for three years already.

35
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,630
I buy it for him from a friend. I also use it.

36
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,690
I'll send you one tomorrow to test.

37
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,080
Okay, but please make sure that you give me an unopened one.

38
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay, of course.

39
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,460
Stop drinking. I know that you're very stressed lately.

40
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,710
I can handle even more stress. I'm just in a bad mood.

41
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,240
I remember three years ago

42
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,810
when I visited both of you in London, I feel that at that time

43
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,280
you were much happier.

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,600
Yes, but too bad we can't go back.

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,290
You and Qianfan are very competitive people.

46
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,880
In order for Yuxuan to get 3 stars quickly, you both...

47
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,580
But I really don't understand.

48
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,260
What's the point of you two wanting so many stars?

49
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,660
There is for Oliver.

50
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,990
For me, without love,

51
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,290
the stars mean absolutely nothing.

52
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,670
- I can still drink.
- You're drunk.

53
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,940
I'm not. I'm not drunk at all. I'll feel better if I'm drunk.

54
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,120
You already drank 20 cups. You can't drink anymore.

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,350
I'll take you home.

56
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,790
Okay.

57
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,650
Little Bun, did you burn something when you were baking, right?

58
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,360
Sister Nina, you don't need to use so many fresh flowers even if you are making fresh flower cake.

59
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,120
This is not for eating. Mr. Jiang wants to use the flower petals.

60
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,660
Flower petals? Not for eating?

61
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,460
Scattering them on the bed? Scattering them in the bathtub?

62
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,290
Jiang Qianfan has fallen in love?

63
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,490
What nonsense are you saying?

64
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,990
You are not in the kitchen upstairs, what are you doing here? How's the knife skill practice going?

65
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,150
Didn't you agree to make the party snacks with me?

66
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,790
Honey, rest assured. I will help you.

67
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,030
Honey needs your... h-help.

68
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,550
Did I say "Honey"?

69
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,800
Don't deny it. It's no fun if you are like that.

70
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,490
Why is your face red?

71
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,860
What nonsense are you talking about? I see... When I see you, why would my face be red?

72
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,360
It's red here and here.

73
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,060
My... that... is this... the heat of the oven. If you don't believe it, you can try.

74
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,530
I think you're too immersed in the acting.

75
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,860
Have your friends not eaten any good food before? Do you intend to greet them with these burnt things?

76
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,280
If you don't want me to make you lose face too terribly, then help me.

77
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,180
I'm busy now.

78
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,960
If you help me today, then you are the world's best head chef.

79
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,930
I'll give you a 15-minute massage.

80
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,810
- Then, I can act like a pig, dog—
- Stop.

81
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,120
Save it first. I don't have the mood today.

82
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,130
Little cabbage

83
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,220
in the yellow field.
(T/N: It's the first line of a Chinese folk song "Little Cabbage")

84
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,460
Go get some baguette and bring it over.

85
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,920
What for?

86
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,630
Teaching you to make Bruschetta. Easy, saves time, and delicious.

87
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,500

106
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,990
Why is it that when he's beside me, I can do it fast and well?

107
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,860
I can't do it when I watch videos.

108
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,470
He has a magical aura that is especially reassuring.

109
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,520
Could I be relying on him?

110
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,750
I can't rely on him. I need him to rely on me.

111
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,660
Oh heavens! What am I thinking?

112
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,660
I like Song Yiran.

113
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,830
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

114
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,460
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫

115
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,860
Why is my heart beating a bit fast? No, no, no.

116
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,560
I need to calm down. But still...

117
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,620
want to take a look. Just one look.

118
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,520
Whenever he makes a strong action, I feel

119
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,720
like through the chef uniform,

120
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,920
I can see his muscles on his arm.

121
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,390
Why are his muscle lines so good-looking?

122
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,730
Like the Ancient Greek sculptures.

123
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,330
God. Your recent arrangements are making me a little fascinated.

124
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,360
I have no way to repay it. I can only repay you by eating more good food.

125
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,260
So beautiful.

126
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,560
Know how to do it now?

127
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,870
Do the rest yourself. I need to go out for a while.

128
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,660
Have fun tonight.

129
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,000
Won't you go with me?

130
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,950
I have something I need to do.

131
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,780
Who is it?

132
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,420
Express delivery.

133
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,540
Wait for a moment.

134
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,040
Hello. What is this?

135
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,020
Air-flown from London. A cake.

136
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,680
Fridge it quickly. It's cold-chain transported.

137
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,740
Mr. Jiang doesn't eat sweet stuff.

138
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,260
That I don't know. Sign here, please.

139
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,630
Okay.

140
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,340
Here.

141
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,960
Thank you.

142
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,340
Sister Nina, let me do it. Put this inside.

143
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,270
- I think it needs to be put in the fridge.
- Okay.

144
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,420
Be careful.

145
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,110
- What is this?
- It was sent by London's Yuxuan.

146
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,740
- Whose birthday is it today?
- Mr. Jiang's birthday.

147
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,610
Everyone in London must be missing him.

148
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,380
Today is Mr. Jiang's birthday?

149
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,070
He didn't say anything about it.

150
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,090
He doesn't celebrate it.

151
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,180
He doesn't like to celebrate birthdays?

152
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,160
Is there anyone who dislikes birthdays?

153
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,790
If he doesn't like birthdays,

154
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,580
why does he take flowers to visit Elise?

155
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,160
Ask him yourself about this.

156
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,700
Braised Eel and Pork. Of course, the eel is segmented.

157
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,780
This is a traditional local dish.

158
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,170
It is Jiangsu cuisine.

159
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,020
For this dish, the crucial thing

160
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,080
is to highlight four words.

161
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,230
Smooth, tender, fresh, and fragrant.

162
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,490
Can you remember that?

163
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,690
I'm talking to you.

164
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,580
Sorry.

165
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,480
I wasn't paying attention.

166
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,860
Tell me, what were you thinking about?

167
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,850
Something on your mind?

168
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,420
No.

169
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,940
Really?

170
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,520
When you want to talk, I might not want to listen.

171
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,300
No, I'll talk.

172
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,290
Mr. Huang, I'm in love.

173
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,060
Your heart pines for someone, but nothing is assured.

174
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,270
Is it that obvious?

175
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,400
I was also young before.

176
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,250
I know. When I was your age,

177
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,620
there is no pretty woman in the world that I didn't love.

178
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,400
I wasn't picky.

179
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,970
Mr. Huang, I couldn't tell

180
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,490
that you were actually a Romeo. Quick, tell me,

181
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,270
how can I get the girl that I like?

182
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:05,290
First, be sincere.

183
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,490
I am. I only have her in my heart.

184
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,910
Second, do what she likes.

185
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,400
I'll remember it.

186
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,930
Did you use these two points to get the girls you liked back then?

187
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,960
No.

188
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,130
What do you mean? Didn't you just say you liked all the beauties and weren't picky?

189
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,770
But those girls didn't like me.

190
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,550
What's worse is that the girls I liked

191
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,710
had suitors. I was too lazy to compete.

192
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,880
So I remained single until now.

193
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,030
I don't want to be like you. I don't want to miss my chance with Xiaoyu.

194
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:47,360
And from what I observe, she doesn't seem to have any suitors.

195
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,310
She's just very difficult to deal with.

196
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,660
Which Xiaoyu are you talking about?

197
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,560
- Boris'?
- Yes.

198
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,480
This Boris,

199
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,560
I met him at an event in Hong Kong.

200
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,670
He had a sullen look as if the whole world owed him.

201
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,900
He even wanted to compete with everyone he met.

202
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,270
Then he met me, so he insisted on challenging me. He even wanted to do a live broadcast.

203
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,840
I didn't accept it.

204
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,940
No wonder Xiaoyu looks sullen all the time.

205
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,440
I wonder what she was thinking when she chose her mentor.

206
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,420
Mr. Huang, what should I do?

207
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:34,950
Pester her. If a flower won't bloom, then squat in front of it,

208
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,420
until it blooms.

209
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,860
Xiaoyu, Xiaoyu! Come here!

210
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,530
Why are you everywhere?

211
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,720
I guessed that you just finished your class.

212
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,390
This is for you.

213
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,260
What is it? Don't tell me it's jewelry?

214
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,400
You want jewelry?

215
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,870
I'm sorry. That's too early to ask for it.

216
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,920
Too early? I don't even want it!

217
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,050
No, no. Sorry. Sorry. I just don't have a glib tongue.

218
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,880
Does this look like you?

219
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,470
I'm sorry. What did you say just now, I didn't hear it clearly?

220
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,980
The Chinese people are each born under a zodiac animal sign.

221
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,220
Some are snakes, while others are tigers.

222
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,540
You are a tiger.

223
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,660
So you are saying that I am a tigress?

224
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,250
Yes!

225
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,190
Take back your gift and get out of my face!

226
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,790
What's wrong?

227
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,780
Scram!

228
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,300
Okay. Sure.

229
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,920
Then...

230
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,800
See you tomorrow.

231
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,180
Take care. I won't see you off.

232
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,020
No problem. I'll walk home.

233
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,880
He said that he and Elise are just colleagues.

234
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,150
Why does he need to go out with her all the time, then?

235
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,230
He didn't even inform me.

236
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,790
Moreover, it is on his birthday. What's going on?

237
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,160
Lin Kesong, what has it got to do with you?

238
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,720
Jiang Qianfan and you are only linked by culinary skills.

239
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,350
Why would you care about his past?

240
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,020
My dear, you're here. Come in.

241
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,720
How many people are here?

242
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,020
Come in first.

243
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,320
Wow! This is awesome!

244
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,000
Great!

245
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,350
Great!

246
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,430
Excuse me.

247
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,520
- How's the taste?
- Old Lin,

248
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,730
be honest. You didn't make this bread, right?

249
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,650
I sliced the bread, okay?

250
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,860
I knew it.

251
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,930
Song Yiran, you're so annoying.

252
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,450
Where is Chef Jiang?

253
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,140
He has something on.

254
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,000
That's great.

255
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,340
Montgomery.

256
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,300
It's been a while.

257
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,230
How are you?

258
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:02,150
Back then, if you saw me like this,

259
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,410
you'd get mad and kick me out.

260
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,130
You would tell me to get out

261
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,820
and come back when I feel better.

262
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,800
You said

263
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,720
that cooking must make people happy

264
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,900
and joyful.

265
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,790
Therefore, people who cook

266
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,720
should be happy.

267
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,760
But after you left,

268
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,300
no matter how hard I tried,

269
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,590
I couldn't get one step closer to you.

270
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,330
Sometimes...

271
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,900
Sometimes, I would even get scared. That fear

272
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,320
is almost like death.

273
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,260
It's much harder than life,

274
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,520
but it's lesser

275
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,910
than death.

276
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,800
I tried the method that you told me,

277
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,480
to empty myself.

278
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,650
Maybe I'd feel better,

279
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,140
when my heart is empty.

280
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,360
But it didn't work.

281
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,500
I couldn't even get close to who I was before,

282
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,510
the one that loves life

283
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,250
and being adventurous.

284
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:16,580
However... Good things happened too.

285
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,150
Even when things were bad,

286
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,900
I met someone recently.

287
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,330
She's quite special.

288
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,200
Her presence

289
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,690
at least made up

290
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,030
for some regrets in my life.

291
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,840
I'll be all right.

292
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,210
Am I that person? Mr. Montgomery,

293
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,730
I'm visiting you with Qianfan again.

294
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,160
I've only got to meet you at your funeral, but I want to thank you,

295
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,600
for allowing me to meet the most important man in my life.

296
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,420
Although he doesn't think so.

297
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,990
You are very important in my life.

298
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,450
No, Oliver. I want to be the only one.

299
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,800
We are just working partners.

300
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,970
You two are here as expected.

301
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,410
I didn't expect you to come.

302
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,650
I've always remembered what this day is.

303
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,730
- What are you doing?
- What are you looking at?

304
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,910
Nothing.

305
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,860
Nothing? Hurry inside, then. Everyone is waiting for you. Let's go.

306
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,070
Hey! I'll walk on my own.

307
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,980
♪  Happy Birthday to you  ♪

308
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,920
Happy Birthday!

309
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,740
Did I guess your age correctly?

310
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,750
You got it right.

311
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,140
I'm seven years younger than you. Thanks.

312
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,750
Wait.

313
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,250
If you don't eat some cake here, you'll be breaking my heart.

314
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,000
You should know that this is the first time I'm being nice to you.

315
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,950
Forget it, Boris.

316
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,530
- Elise!
- You're up to no good.

317
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,170
Listen up, Qianfan doesn't hold a grudge because he is a forgiving person,

318
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:17,650
but I am not. You messed with Yuxuan twice. You still owe us.

319
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,130
Who wants to eat your lousy cake.

320
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:24,780
Miss Quentin, this is between Jiang Qianfan and me. It's none of your business!

321
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,310
Qianfan, it's not like you to let a woman shield you.

322
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,370
What are you afraid of?

323
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,570
What makes you think so?

324
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,410
Okay. Let me ask you, then.

325
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,060
With your professionalism,

326
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,120
how can you just randomly take the Evil Dragon Princess as your apprentice?

327
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,360
I know the official answer given by Elise,

328
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,350
but you and I both know that it's a lie.

329
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,500
Because I know you too well. I know you better than I know myself.

330
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,900
For you, winning is everything.

331
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,510
By accepting Lin Kesong as your apprentice, you know you won't win.

332
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:07,030
It's uncharacteristic of you unless something else

333
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,340
is more important than winning the competition.

334
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,990
Enough. Bravo, Boris! You have such an imagination.

335
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,930
Even if Qianfan has a problem, I'm here to help him.

336
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,440
There's no need for an apprentice. What a joke!

337
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,940
I want to hear you say it.

338
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,280
Fine, I'll tell you.

339
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,160
You're the reason that I took part in the competition. Even more so, you're the reason

340
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,460
I've accepted Lin Kesong as my apprentice. It's too easy to beat you.

341
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,680
Satisfied now?

342
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,490
You want to make me mad and lose my sense of judgment?

343
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,730
It won't be that easy.

344
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,460
Whatever.

345
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,520
Elise, let's go.

346
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,650
Boris cares more about you than himself.

347
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,340
I wonder how much he knows.

348
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,610
He is probably just guessing. Else, he wouldn't bake the cake.

349
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,470
Thankfully, your quick wit got me out of trouble.

350
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,260
We are an entity, so don't thank me.

351
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,320
Only my mother, Dr. Xie, and I know. Our lips are sealed.

352
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,940
As for Nina and Li Yan,

353
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,480
can we do something so that they won't get suspicious?

354
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,710
Don't do anything. For now, business as usual is the best way.

355
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,990
Without evidence, he can't announce it at will.

356
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,590
Don't worry. I have Lin Kesong.

357
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,890
I'm creating the next season's dishes.

358
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,030
So, Lin Kesong is the first tester.

359
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,720
Oliver, why are you so calm?

360
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,560
Rage and disappointment won't solve anything.

361
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,370
I mean, what if this problem can be solved?

362
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,150
How?

363
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,300
Pray for forgiveness. Think about your sins.

364
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,700
Maybe God will give you a chance.

365
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,830
What sins do I have? I don't need forgiveness.

366
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,800
You have a fever now.

367
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,710
It's okay, I'm fine. I just feel tired.

368
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,710
I'll take you home.

369
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,250
Crap. I forgot.

370
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,710
- What's wrong?
- I mustn't drink.

371
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,670
How can you not drink at a party? Then why did you come?

372
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:10,220
No. Mr. Jiang said no alcohol during my apprenticeship.

373
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,700
- What are you learning?
- Culinary skills. I'm about to enter a competition.

374
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,220
It's quite late. I have class tomorrow morning.

375
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,720
Have fun. I'm heading back.

376
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,810
- I'll take you home, then!
- Wait!

377
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,520
You can't go. The party is only halfway through.

378
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,280
Song Yiran, you're a bore.

379
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,930
You can't leave.

380
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,580
Let me go. You're hurting me.

381
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,760
- Song Yiran.
- Fine. I won't drag you, then.

382
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,300
Anyway, be good and just sit down.

383
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,870
If you go before dawn, you aren't my friend.

384
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,950
Come on, continue.

385
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,860
Seriously?

386
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,680
I've got it here.

387
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,110
Here. Drink some hot water.

388
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,450
I wanted to cook something, but you have nothing here.

389
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,760
Have some hot water first. I'll call Junbin.

390
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,970
No, I'm fine.

391
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,970
Just stay with me.

392
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:30,200
It's late. I won't stay. I'll leave. Rest well.

393
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,530
Oliver, wait!

394
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,610
Stay.

395
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,790
Elise.

396
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,820
Don't go. Don't leave me.

397
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,780
We agreed to be working partners.

398
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,330
Don't you miss me?

399
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,540
We tried, but it didn't work out.

400
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,760
So, let me go, all right?

401
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,230
I can't.

402
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,870
I love you. What about you?

403
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,930
I've told you before, what we had isn't love.

404
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,340
This is not love?

405
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,230
We were together,

406
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:31,370
then you stole my heart and broke up with me. Six months later, you said you didn't love me.

407
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,190
Do you know how hurtful that was?

408
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,620
It was like taking a knife and slashing at my wound.

409
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,710
Only honesty can solve the problem. I never intended to hurt you.

410
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,860
When you're in pain, I feel bad too, but what can I do?

411
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,350
I...

412
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,640
I can only tell you

413
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,340
that you deserve someone better, and it's not me.

414
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,330
Have a good rest. I'm leaving.

415
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,880
♫  I just wait for this moment  ♫

416
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:25,930
♫  Feel the air that you're breathing  ♫

417
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:34,340
♫ This feeling with the loneliness ♫

418
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:41,660
♫  I tell myself there is nothing bad  ♫

419
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,100
[Thank you for putting up with me for so long.]

420
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,060
[You're as beautiful as a goddess.]

421
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,860
[You deserve better.]

422
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:58,600
♫  Seeing something happened  ♫

423
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:06,980
♫  How can I escape  ♫

424
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:14,810
♫  You said don't be afraid  ♫

425
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,000
Jiang Qianfan is so handsome!

426
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,970
He isn't a chef. He's a model!

427
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,960
Jiang Qianfan?

428
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,030
- He is so handsome!
- I was just telling her

429
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,230
whoever becomes his girlfriend

430
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,980
must have good karma.

431
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,840
Hold on, you two. I'll make you jump.

432
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,320
Kesong, come here.

433
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,740
Kesong is the lucky girl.

434
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,040
Heavens! Kesong, did you conquer him?

435
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,440
It's over. My heart can't take it.

436
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,330
No! He's not my boyfriend!

437
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,960
Yes, yes, yes. Don't pretend.

438
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,240
How could it be? You two were so sweet when I saw both of you together.

439
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,700
Chu Ting, you misunderstood.

440
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,490
He was just kidding that day. He's not my boyfriend.

441
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,690
Really?

442
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,980
Yes.

443
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,650
I must leave.

444
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,530
Must you?

445
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,260
Okay. Go before that fool finds out, or he'll make a scene.

446
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,870
- I'm leaving now!
- Hurry up and drink!

447
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,560
Thanks to those gossip girls

448
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,560
who randomly searched for Jiang Qianfan online, an important piece of information was found.

449
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,500
Turns out that four years ago today, Montgomery died in a sea accident.

450
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,460
No wonder he is so depressed.

451
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,090
Why did you leave? Come back!

452
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:05,050
Stop messing around.

453
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,640
You're back.

454
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,370
Mr. Jiang, you are back.

455
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,960
I know what day is today.

456
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,090
Are you all right?

457
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,440
Am I a very lousy person?

458
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,140
No, of course, you are not.

459
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,990
You're too young. There's something you don't understand.

460
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:59,030
I'm very experienced. I watched a lot of TV dramas when I was young.

461
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,710
Did you have fun at the party?

462
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,060
Well...

463
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,720
At least the food was good, right?

464
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,270
Of course. They finished it in five seconds.

465
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,430
Ten seconds. Five seconds was a bit exaggerated.

466
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,500
Good to hear.

467
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,720
Go. Get ready to sleep. I'm going to bed.

468
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:41,310
He appears moody but values personal loyalty.

469
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,100
When I was little and feeling down, my dad would cook these noodles for me.

470
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,590
They are my favorite.

471
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:45,160
First, stirfry the meat in some oil. Then add

472
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,120
the mushrooms and greens. Season and thicken the soup.

473
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,820
After taking the noodles out of the pot, it is crucial to rinse them in cold water.

474
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:57,090
This will cool the noodles and preserve the chewy texture.

475
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,310
Finally,

476
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:03,570
add a little vinegar. Perfect. Dig in!

477
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,930
How's the taste?

478
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,640
I'll add the comments for you. The aroma of the meat

479
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,000
and garlic combined with the mushrooms

480
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,030
warm you up from the tip of the tongue to the heart.

481
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,060
It's so touching.

482
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,730
What a pity.

483
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:40,820
Adding onion and garlic in hot oil is correct, but the time was too short.

484
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,800
The fragrance was not fully released.

485
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,020
- And this shredded pork—
- If you don't want to eat it, I will eat it.

486
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,130
I didn't say I wouldn't eat it.

487
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,930
Is it tasty?

488
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,100
I can't take this anymore. I cooked, but I didn't get to eat.

489
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,000
You are so uncivilized.

490
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,370
My mom said

491
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:23,460
you must slurp when you eat noodles. They'll taste better.

492
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,430
Is that so?

493
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,540
Let me try.

494
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,920
Delicious.

495
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,900
How come your slurp is louder than mine?

496
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,350
You try.

497
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,830
Slurp.

498
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,360
Watch me.

499
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:12,820
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

500
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,890
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

501
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,970
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

502
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:28,130
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

503
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,230
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

504
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:36,270
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

505
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:41,510
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
