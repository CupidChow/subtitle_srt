9
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,120
Jun Bin!

10
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,270
Elise, why did you come here?

11
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,440
Jun Bin, something bad happened.

12
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,540
Li Yan went to look for Oliver.

13
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,310
What?

14
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:21,040
¥20,000,000 is not a small amount. Don't be such a greedy person!

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
I need one week.

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,920
No way. I tell you, at most three days.

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,700
I can promise you, once I get the money I will disappear immediately and will not disturb you anymore.

18
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,380
Okay,

19
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,470
then you must keep to your word. I'll get the money for you.

20
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,920
Okay. You remember,

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,250
if you cannot get the money in three days, I have no choice but to visit Mr. Jiang at his house.

22
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,720
Get the money quickly. Once you have got it, tell me.

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,910
I'll tell you the address another time. Okay.

24
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,900
Jun Bin, sorry, but we cannot give him anymore.

25
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,920
Li Yan asked for money repeatedly. I have already been dragged along by him,

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,250
I absolutely cannot drag you down.

27
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,470
Don't say that.

28
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,770
Actually what I'm afraid of the most is that this thing is a bottomless pit.

29
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,250
Just now he said that it will be the last time.

30
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,380
Don't say ¥20,000,000, even if it's ¥50,000,000, I will give him too.

31
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,110
I still have a house, tomorrow I'll go to the bank and mortgage it.

32
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,600
Jun Bin, don't.

33
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,370
Thank you, really.

34
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,210
You really helped me a lot, but I absolutely cannot drag you down again.

35
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,640
The thing that I should do now is to confess everything to Oliver.

36
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,800
You are confessing everything to him now?

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,000
Have you thought of his feelings?

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,440
If you say it now, then it's like you are passing all your sufferings to him.

39
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,200
He trusts me so much,

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,590
yet I'm harming him.

41
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,940
What's wrong with me?

42
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,120
How can I be such a lunatic?

43
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,960
I'm really terrible.

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,450
Why are you helping me?

45
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,060
Are you not scared of me?

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,500
Why should I be scared of you?

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,210
Elise, in you, I actually

48
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,460
don't see fear,

49
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,470
but...

50
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,390
guilt, you know?

51
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,040
Actually, you are more gentle than you think.

52
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,290
You are so nice to me.

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,210
Okay, don't cry.

54
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,330
Okay, it's installed. I need to give you a safe home.

55
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,840
Oh, dear.

56
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,940
He wants to give me a home. He wants to protect me.

57
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,590
I'm warmed by this iceberg.

58
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,920
It's fine now, I've changed all the door locks.

59
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,870
Next time when you go to the balcony, remember to lock it, it's safer.

60
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,530
Hmm.

61
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,520
Why are you standing there? Your chicken should be done.

62
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,580
I want to check it later.

63
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,330
Quick, go.

64
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,120
Look.

65
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,810
Wow.

66
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,890
It's done so well.

67
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,130
Is it?

68
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,320
The time is over by half a minute.

69
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,370
The water is not enough. The chicken lacks elasticity.

70
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,710
Come. Try it yourself.

71
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,600
So many things.

72
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,990
How's it?

73
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,070
Why is it so salty?

74
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,500
Right?

75
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,360
Because it was half a minute over, the temperature of the salt and chicken kept getting higher.

76
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,910
The effect was a mixed taste, so it got saltier and saltier.

77
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,080
Wait.

78
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,300
The Salt Baked Chicken and Salt Baked Prawns... You haven't done anything salt-baked.

79
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,190
What are you saying?

80
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,980
That water vapor from the chili.

00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,200
18 guesses.

82
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,760
I thought you found inspiration from salt-baked food.

83
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,690
You still remembered?

84
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,850
Which guess is it now?

85
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,870
How about this, you ask me a few questions? I'll just say you lost and forget about it.

86
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,610
This cannot be a random matter, I'm not a fool too.

87
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,230
Eat finish your chicken. Don't waste it.

88
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,050
That is the idea. Send it.

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,270
Incredible.

92
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,060
What nonsense. Talk properly.

93
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,410
The pillar of Yuxuan. We all saw it. It's from the official account.

94
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,990
Is it that article?

95
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,100
Low profile, low profile.

96
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,390
No, Big Brother. You are the pillar now,

97
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,900
I can at least be considered a cornerstone, right?

98
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,690
In the future, whenever there is an interview, mention me.

99
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,660
Me too.

100
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,400
Sure. When something good like this happens again, I will mention you too.

101
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,430
- Good.
- Good.

102
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,300
You're good.

103
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,350
So awesome.

104
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,110
Great Chef Mai, I saw the article.

105
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,900
You are talking like you are better than Mr. Jiang. It is not proper, is it?

106
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,530
It's not proper? Take away the "not".

107
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,380
Ask your conscience. Was he in Yuxuan longer or was I in Yuxuan longer?

108
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,980
If it weren't for me, would Mr. Jiang surrender on that red crayfish incident? You actually dare to lecture me.

109
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,550
We all see your contribution,

110
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,890
but the problem is, if Elise and Mr. Jiang see this, do you think they'll be happy?

111
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,480
What if I'm not happy when they are happy?

112
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,200
Let me tell you. Later, forward it to everyone in your chat group!

113
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,890
I want to see what Jiang Qianfan will say.

114
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,310
These are your scores.

115
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,070
Victor, you, Blu,

116
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,620
are the top three right now.

117
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,650
That one is Lin Kesong's.

118
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,480
Even though the score is low, it's been trending upward.

119
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,250
In this round of competition, if she gets

120
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,110
number one or two, but you get number seven or eight.

121
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,950
What will be the result?

122
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,540
I won't lose again.

123
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,300
Answer my question! What will be the result?

124
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,150
Lin Kesong will enter the final four, and I won't.

125
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,290
You said it yourself. How does it feel?

126
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,350
Humiliation. A lifetime's humiliation.

127
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,430
Don't worry, Boris. I'll definitely enter the final four.

128
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,720
Enter the final four along with Lin Kesong?

129
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,600
She will definitely go astray.

130
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,880
What if she doesn't?

131
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,620
Don't chase me!

132
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,750
Help!

133
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,090
Help!

134
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,440
Don't-Don't come over!

135
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,370
Don't chase me.

136
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,690
Help!

137
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,330
Don't come over.

138
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,260
Help!

139
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,130
Lin Kesong.

140
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,660
Wake up.

141
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,760
Did you have a nightmare?

142
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,270
Hmm.

143
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,220
It's okay.

144
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,870
I dreamt that someone carried a knife to chase me,

145
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,840
and then, I don't know why, a big rock was pressing on me.

146
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,110
I wanted to but couldn't run. I wanted to but couldn't move.

147
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,230
And then that rock got bigger and bigger.

148
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,390
It pressed on me so hard that I couldn't breathe.

149
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,770
Do you want me to go with you to get some fresh air?

150
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,630
Go.

151
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,250
Sorry.

152
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,960
I've given you too much pressure.

153
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,540
You mean, you are that pile of rocks?

154
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,430
Then you should stay far from me.

155
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,590
You said it.

156
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,400
Let me ask you this. If I didn't find you to bring you back,

157
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,730
would you really not go home,

158
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,590
or you'd keep looking for someone else to learn cooking skills?

159
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,880
Let me ask you too. If I had really left,

160
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,220
would you find someone else as your apprentice?

161
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,090
I asked first, so you answer first.

162
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,460
If you don't answer, I won't answer.

163
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,420
Don't answer then.

You little one, how did you skip around me?

167
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,800
Sure, I'll answer you.

168
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,420
I absolutely won't accept anyone as an apprentice anymore.

169
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,000
Get a new replacement, worry every day, argue every day. Isn't it tiring?

170
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,590
Same with me. Same reasons as above.

171
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,750
How about we just put up with each other and live together?

172
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,970
How old are you now, old man? What are you thinking?

173
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,560
But, honestly, if I lose again in the next competition,

174
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,940
will you kick me out again?

175
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,630
But then I'll have to take the effort to find you again. It's very tiring.

176
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,060
Actually, I've thought about it.

177
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,160
If you really lose again,

178
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,460
just think of it as an experience.

179
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,710
As old as I am, I don't think I've ever lost.

180
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,910
It's a kind of a pity.

181
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,210
If that really happens,

182
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,380
we'll just experience it together. No big deal.

186

This man actually said it's okay to lose.

187
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,110
He even said it very calmly.

188
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,110
He is no longer that person who can't accept other people saying he did wrong and instantly gets enraged.

189
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,590
But, why is it he looks even taller and stronger now?

190
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,450
From 2.8 meters to 3.8 meters.

191

Why did I sleep in your room yesterday?

216
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,180
Because I was sleeping in your room.

217
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,060
What are you thinking?

218
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:35,260
Don't you remember anything that happened last night?

219
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,470
I really don't remember. What happend?

220
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,590
Last night, I... We were chatting.

221
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,390
And then you fell asleep.

222
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,010
Later you woke up.

223
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,630
I woke up?

224
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,600
After you woke up, you suddenly neighed like a horse.

225
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,980
After you neighed like a horse, you barked like a dog.

226
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,460
Later, it was even weirder, it was two animals shouting at each other.

You... are okay?

228
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:14,160
I shouldn't have done that. My mom said I recovered two years ago.

[Announcing the topic of the fourth round of the competition]

244
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,300
[Origin]

245
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,900
An old Chinese saying says, "A plot of soil and water raises the people on that plot."
(T/N: The environment influences people)

246
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,420
By the same reasoning, the food ingredients are matched with the salt from the same place.

247
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,460
Only local salt can bring out the best flavor

248
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,940
from local food ingredients. Try it.

249
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,650
Each kind of salt is made differently.

250
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,780
When you taste them on their own, the tastes are similar,

251
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,940
but when you use them in cooking,

252
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,250
the difference is great.

253
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,520
Remembering the origin of each seasoning and the main ingredients

254
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,600
is a basic study for a chef.

255
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,270
When the flavor of the salt matches the flavor of the food ingredients,

256
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,290
the result is the unique flavor of the dish.

257
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,010
Try it.

258
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,950
There is basically only one kind of salt in Chinese food, but there are different kinds in western cooking.

259
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,290
The timing and purpose of putting in the salt are also different.

260
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,720
The salt is different due to where it's produced, even in its appearance.

00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,200
Where are you going?

324
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,930
I can't find Lin Kesong. I'll go to find her.

325
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,260
If she isn't here 10 minutes after the competition starts, she'll be disqualified.

326
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,630
- I know.
- Hurry!

327
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,270
Here. Here.

328
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,280
- Come. Come.
- Big Brother!

329
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,920
- Come. Come.
- Big Brother!

330
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,630
- What's wrong, Miss?
- Can you let me borrow your phone?

331
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,070
What's wrong, Miss?

332
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,880
I don't have my cellphone. I'm in a hurry, Big Brother. Please help.

333
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,260
- Okay.
- Thanks.

334
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,950
- Hello.
- Mr. Jiang.

335
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,900
- Where are you?
- I don't know.

336
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,380
I'll tell him.

337
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,890
Thanks.

338
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:25,090
Hello, hello. We are at Binjian Road. Go straight and turn right.

339
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,040
Okay, I got it. I'll be right there.

340
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,640
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

341
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,120
Mr. Jiang, it's only five minutes to the competition. Where is Miss Lin Kesong?

342
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,070
Okay, just follow the rules.

343
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,940
It's time.

344
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,340
Okay. Let's start.

345
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,650
Greetings to all the viewers in front of the TV sets.

346
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,530
Welcome back to the stage of the Mueller's Future Star Culinary Competition.

347
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:05,220
Today is the fourth round of the competition, and also the final ranking for the eight contestants.

348
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,810
I'm sure the contestants have fully prepared for today's competition.

349
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:13,820
You should notice that we have an extra person on the judging panel, Chairperson Thomas,

350
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,510
because it's related to the topic of the competition today.

351
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,340
Today's topic is called "Replication".

352
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,850
Mr. Jiang!

353
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,960
Lin Kesong, hurry!

354
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,130
- Sit tight.
- Wait!

355
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,470
Sit tight. Hold me well.

356
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,150
Let's go.

357
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,330
In front of everyone is the Eight Treasure Duck that is made by Chairperson Thomas.

358
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,380
After you've tasted it, please go to the shelf area in front of the stage

359
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,030
to pick up the necessary food ingredients,

360
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,800
and then replicate everything from the original one.

361
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,940
What we can tell everyone is, this duck used famous ingredients from five different locations.

362
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,780
It also used the salt from those areas as condiments.

363
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,020
There is even a mystery in the sauce on the surface.

364
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,470
This competition will be ranked based on how close a contestant can replicate the dish.

365
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:35,120
Of course, how closely the dish is replicated, I think Chairperson Thomas has the stronger say.

366
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,630
And now, I'll announce, the competition starts!

367
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,020
Braised Mushroom Stems.

368
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,920
I can't brag about other dishes, but no one else

369
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,290
can compare with me on this dish.

370
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:53,910
That's right. Whether she can enter the final four or not, let's open Mr. Jiang.

371
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:57,310
No, no, I mean to open that bottle of wine from Mr. Jiang.

372
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:03,050
No, don't talk about the wine. Watch! Where is Kesong?

373
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,930
Where is Kesong?

374
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:31,180
♫  Sometimes I feel bored to death  ♫

375
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,880
♫  Don't want the hero or zero  ♫

376
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:43,030
♫  Wait for someone in the black hole  ♫

377
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:48,910
♫ Like a monster talking to the wall ♫

378
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:54,900
♫ Like a monster talking to the wall ♫

379
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,530
♫ To the wall. To the wall ♫

380
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,520
Thomas, the competition started eight minutes ago.

381
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,880
If it goes over ten minutes, count it as a zero score.

382
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,540
I'm here!

383
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,750
Don't worry. We didn't file a complaint against you.

384
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,430
What did we do?

385
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,640
How can she be late for this?

386
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,620
Probably something happened. Don't worry, Mr. Jiang is there.

387
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,060
You still trust Mr. Jiang?

388
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,820
Even if she can't enter the final four, I'm satisfied.

389
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,720
Stimulated Lin Kesong's fighting spirit.

390
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,060
She is too softhearted. You've done a good thing.

391
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,080
Your Chinese is too lousy, I don't understand it.

392
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,250
[HEY! MAN!]

393
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:44,750
Husky? So adorable.

394
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,450
Is this okay? I bought it from across the street.

395
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,070
On sale for ¥19.

396
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:57,080
It looks just like my Lucky. I'll show you.

397
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,290
Later, I'll buy this t-shirt too.

398
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,210
Huh?

399
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,890
You'd better not buy anymore.

400
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,770
Why not?

401
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,830
They really look alike, right?

402
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,020
Dish is ready!

403
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,250
Boss, what is Kesong doing? Some sort of a trick?

404
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,620
This... How would I know?

405
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:39,220
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

406
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,060
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

407
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,580
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

408
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,550
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

409
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,550
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

410
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,860
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

411
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,550
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
