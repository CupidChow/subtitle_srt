My dad also texted me the recipe for the Braised Mushroom Stems, so I'll give it a try.

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,920
What are you buying?

164
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,200
I don't know.

165
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,960
Over there.

166
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,600
Follow closely. Don't run around.

167
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,600
Shopkeeper, how much is the coriander?
1.20.

168
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,750
¥‎1.20?

169
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,560
- Don't get the coriander.
- It's very fresh.

170
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,300
Fine.

171
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,310
I'll take extra coriander. Wrap these up for me.

172
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,050
Okay. Okay.

173
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,730
Why are there so many eggplants?

174
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,080
You didn't know?

175
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,490
See?

176
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,370
This darker kind is locally grown in Shanghai.

177
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,870
This paler one is an eggplant from Hangzhou.

178
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,430
This kind that we see more often is an eggplant from Shangdong.

179
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,580
Sir,, are you an expert?

180
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,480
I'll give you a discount if you buy a lot.

181
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,560
Besides, this is the best season to grill autumn eggplants.

182
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,440
It'll taste good, no matter how you cook it.

183
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,450
That's right. There's an old saying, don't give the autumn eggplants to your wife to eat.

184
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,380
- You must have heard it before.
- What does it mean?

185
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,860
The autumn eggplants are too tasty. The wife will eat too much and not want to work.

186
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,790
I'll have to reconsider whether I want to buy them.

187
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,160
Who is your wife?

188
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,760
I didn't say you are my wife. What's the matter? Your expression is strange.

189
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,580
I was only concerned about my apprentice.

190
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,600
- So sorry.
- It's fine.

191
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,170
You were just joking.

192
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,340
Wrap up some for me. I'll come back to pick them up.

193
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,860
Sure. I'll wrap them up for you.

194
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,410
Lin Kesong!

195
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,750
Hello, Miss.

196
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,910
Shopkeeper, is there a walnut that's suitable for senior citizens?

197
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,880
- Yes.
- You shouldn't run around.

198
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,250
Why? You're buying for your dad?

199
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,860
Hello, Mister.

200
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,040
Oh my.

201
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,170
Shopkeeper, this Sichuan peppercorn looks good.

202
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,740
Yes, look at the red ones,

203
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,220
it's a really fragrant peppercorn. It's a top grade Da Hong Pao.
(T/N: literally Big Red Robe)

204
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,350
You can smell it. Just smell.

205
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,260
- It's really good.
- Also this, green pepper.

206
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,590
Let me see.

207
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,050
It's more numbing.

208
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,610
- If you prefer the numbing kind, get the green pepper.
- Lin Kesong?

209
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,440
Lin Kesong!

210
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,420
Have you seen the girl who was with me?

211
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,840
No.

212
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,690
Okay, thanks.

213
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,380
It's done.

214
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,990
Be careful.

215
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,430
Lin Kesong! Lin Kesong!

216
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,620
Where did you go? I've been looking all over for you.

217
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,860
Buns.

218
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,620
Hello, I want a cream-filled bun.

219
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,810
Are you that greedy for food?

220
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,350
Aren't they adorable? Little piglets.

221
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,530
Just one?

222
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,960
- Then, I'll take another one.
- Okay.

223
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,580
I don't want cream-filled buns. So not nutritious.

224
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,780
Shopkeeper.

225
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,450
- I want the Old Tan's Pickled Cabbage Buns.
- Okay.

226
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,490
- Do you have any water? I want a bottle.
- Okay, okay.

227
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,800
Why are you so bothersome?

228
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,350
A bun for each of you as a couple. Isn't this good?

229
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,330
Who is a couple with him?

230
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,530
Why don't you consider my feelings? Shopkeeper, how much?

231
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,040
- Lin Kesong!
- ¥15.

232
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,190
Lin Kesong, what's the matter with you now?

233
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,040
If you only eat the buns without drinking water, you'll choke. Want some?

234
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,730
I only offer once.

235
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,760
Mr. Jiang.

236
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,950
If it's convenient, please look at the monitoring video at Yuxian from yesterday afternoon, about 4:30 pm.

237
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,230
What's the matter?

238
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,780
It's Da Mai. He told me to watch a monitoring video.

239
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,430
4:30 pm.

240
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,630
What did he add in there?

241
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,110
I don't know.

242
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,490
Da Mai. What do you mean by this?

243
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,070
I'm waiting for you at the Jiexin Park.

244
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,590
I got it. I'll be right there.

245
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,970
Go.

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,460
Da Mai.

247
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,260
You saw the video?

248
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,860
I did.

249
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,330
Relax. We are not in Yuxuan. Don't worry, I didn't put in poison.

250
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,020
What do you mean by this?

251
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,200
I just want to know how bad your taste buds are now?

252
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,940
So you couldn't taste what it was?

253
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,270
Right.

254
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,720
You know it now.

255
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,310
Look at you now.

256
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,870
You are a chef who has no sense of taste.

257
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,200
You'd even cook a stupid dish like that red crayfish. Why do you still go to Yuxuan?

258
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,550
Is it that difficult to admit you can't do it?

259
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,840
I'll tell you.

260
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,940
Yuxuan needs me.

261
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,980
Therefore, I won't stop, and I can't stop.

262
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,600
- I have to bear this responsibility.
- You just want to keep your reputation.

263
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,760
Actually, I think we are about the same in skills.

264
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,010
You are just lucky and got famous early.

265
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,460
You also have a stinky temper. Why should I concede to you?

266
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,890
Don't keep up with this useless talk.

267
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,110
What do you want, just say it. Don't waste time.

268
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,150
Do you still remember that article?

269
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,460
I got someone to write that article just to anger you.

270
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,080
Then I could consequently leave Yuxuan reasonably and satisfy my vanity.

271
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,600
But the result was, you didn't get angry.

272
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,780
You even encouraged me in front of everyone.

273
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,250
From that moment, I knew that

274
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,080
our difference isn't only on cooking skills

275
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,650
but also in how broadminded and big-picture thinking a person is.

276
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,840
It was also a that moment that I was firmly sure

277
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,320
that I'll follow this guy, Jiang Qianfan.

278
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,010
Mr. Jiang,

279
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,350
I hope you'll understand that you're not alone.

280
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,130
The entire Yuxuan is your family.

281
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,120
If you have a problem, tell us, and we can get together to help you.

282
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,640
Thank you.

283
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,420
I actually have never thought...

284
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,070
I never thought this is how you'd feel.

285
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,020
Thank you.

286
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,540
Truly.

287
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,690
Oh yes,

288
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,020
with Boris, I know what to do with him. Don't worry.

289
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,730
But you should be careful too. He will surely keep an eye on you now.

290
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,790
Boris has kept an eye on me for ten years. He also won't let go of me easily.

291
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,580
But I still thank you for reminding me. I will pay attention.

292
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,860
Good.

293
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,370
I'll go to work then.

294
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,750
Bye-bye.

295
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,440
This is the first time I see what the friendship between men is like.

296
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,110
He really admires you from the bottom of his heart, that's why he is willing to help you.

297
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,200
You heard it all?

298
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,990
It's such a good result. Aren't you happy?

299
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,070
I should be happy.

300
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,730
You don't look happy at all.

301
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,110
I have this feeling

302
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,190
that I'll be exposed soon.

303
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,610
Thanks.

304
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,640
What's the matter?

305
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,080
Old Xie, let me ask you this.

306
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,410
Why are some people in the world not interested in gourmet food?

307
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,130
What do you mean?

308
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,350
I used to think those people who didn't like to eat because they had never eaten good food.

309
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,640
But, why is there someone who isn't interested in my cooking at all?

310
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,980
Am I not good enough when it comes to the color, taste, and aroma?

311
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,640
Or, I haven't totally controlled the flavors in sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy?

312
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,720
Victor, why do I think you've changed?

313
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,540
That arrogant and handsome guy, did he

314
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,550
meet some girl? He seems to be tormented.

315
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,590
You still have the mood to embarrass me?

316
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay, I won't say it anymore.

317
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,950
I admit that you are extremely talented in culinary arts.

318
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,850
But, maybe you are still young

319
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,200
so you don't understand what is precious.

320
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,070
Polishing the culinary arts doesn't only require correct guidance

321
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,980
but also diligence in repeated practice.

322
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,640
The skills are never the crux.

323
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,530
It's the emotion.

324
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,940
Even though I'm not a chef,

325
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,060
but I believe, inside everyone,

326
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,990
there is a dish that belongs to one wholeheartedly.

327
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,620
A dish that belongs to one wholeheartedly?

328
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,820
After all these years,

329
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,560
even now, I still remember how your sister looked the first time I saw her.

330
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,030
I remember she liked eating one-sided fried omelette.

331
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,350
I remember she likes a cake baked 60 seconds with marmalade.

332
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,220
Maybe you'll understand it later.

333
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,190
The meaning of the food isn't important.

334
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,670
What's important is what you think it means.

335
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,050
I am really not sure right now.

336
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,910
What is precious?

337
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,270
But I can see that my sister is

338
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,830
quite precious to you.

339
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,760
You little rascal.

340
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,060
Put it down. Put it down.

341
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,320
I carefully developed this appetizing dish.

342
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,430
Try it.

343
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,770
My body is filled with a fantastic power.

344
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,100
I can repair ten more bikes this afternoon.

345
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,580
No, 11 bikes.

346
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,910
Isn't just a chili pepper soaked in soysauce?

347
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,490
Is it that delicious? You act as if you won the lottery.

348
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,730
Boss, we are enjoying life.

349
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,970
We're accumulating energy for work.

350
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,270
This is not a regular chili pepper.

351
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,690
My mom taught me how to make it.

352
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,530
It is a feeling of home, flavor of happiness!

353
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,600
Boss, actually that Brother Black Rooster's

354
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,330
cooking was really a little...

355
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,760
not so good.

356
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,230
Even though you don't like to eat, but Brother Black Rooster

357
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,320
prepared so many good foods.

358
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,480
You even said he's lazy.

359
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,510
That's right. Like us...

360
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,640
we do like to eat,

361
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,280
but we are also working hard.

362
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,590
When we eat good food, we'll make ourselves happy.

363
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,520
When you eat so much every day,

364
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,850
didn't your parents scold you?

365
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,330
When you were growing up, no one laughed at you for being gluttonous?

366
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:01,210
No way. Mom and Dad wanted us to grow and develop.

367
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,270
- They told us to eat more.
- We were kids.

368
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,040
The more we ate, the fatter and adorable we were.

369
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,240
It doesn't matter if you are fat or skinny, being happy is the most important.

370
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,050
Flavor of mom's cooking.

[Last Day]

372
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,130
[Half Off to Celebrate the Lin Sisters Entering the Final Four in Culinary Competition]

373
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,000
-What did I tell you? This restaurant has a high rating.

374
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,500
Your dish. Hello, what would you like to order?

375
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,920
I want your featured special.

376
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,160
- Okay, Fried River Prawns!
- How about it?

377
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,040
- The business looks good.
- Uncle Zhang, Uncle Li, leave safe, come again next time.

378
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,270
Xiao Lin, we just got here.

379
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,860
- I got too busy.
- You rascal.
- Sit here. Sit here.

380
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,190
Come, food's ready!

381
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,670
New order!

382
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,320
Come, food's ready!

383
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,730
Stewed Chicken with Chestnuts?

384
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,600
Boss, you should get some rest.

385
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,020
Your back can't last.

386
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,090
How can I rest? So many customers, and Xiaoyu isn't here. How can I not cook?

387
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,680
Boss, the old ginger is the most spicy. You are so efficient.

388
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,360
I'm already 70 going on 80. What's so efficient?

389
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,030
Boss!

390
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,190
Turn off the stove. Turn off the stove.

391
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,360
Hurry.

392
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,600
- No, No. Slowly. Slowly.
- Help me out of here.

393
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,230
Just help me get out.

394
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,420
Boss, take it slow.

395
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,830
- It's ready.
- Fried eggplants,

396
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,790
egglant with noodles,

397
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,330
braised eggplants, my dad used to always cook them for me. They were so delicious.

398
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,490
If there is a chance, let me learn some from your dad.

399
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,760
Eggplants are used a lot in western cooking too. Look here.

400
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,130
It has a strong fibrous and grainy feel.

401
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,530
I'll prepare the eggplants. You slice the tomatoes and onions into thin strips.

402
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,100
We can make vegetarian caviar.

403
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,800
Okay.

404
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,120
Uncle?

405
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,290
What happened to Uncle?

406
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,140
Don't get anxious. Let me think of a solution.

407
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,600
What's the matter with your uncle?

408
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,980
His back injury is hurting again.

409
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,200
The kitchen is understaffed. When they call Xiaoyu, she doesn't answer. She is probably with Boris.

410
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,460
Okay, let me call him.

411
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,020
No need, I'll just go back to help. I don't want to see her anyway when I get back.

412
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,510
Hey.

413
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,620
What do you want?

414
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,330
Do you think you can really help when you go there?

415
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,060
I should still go. He's my uncle.

416
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,630
What I mean is, don't you think I would be better at helping?

417
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,950
Do you mean it?

418
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,650
Yes.

419
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,820
- Thanks!
- Wait.

420
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,560
Save it. Clean up the counter. Hurry.

421
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,060
Wait for me!

422
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,090
Coming. Here's your dish.

423
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,320
Waiter, why is the food so slow today?

424
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,500
So sorry. We are busy today. I'll rush them again. Just wait a little.

425
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,190
- Xiao Lin, Xiao Lin!
- What's the matter?

426
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,390
Where is our food? We are old customers.

427
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,340
Sorry, uncles. We are really too busy today. Should I refund the money?

428
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,080
Refund money? If I go somewhere else, I'd have to order again, they'd have to start cooking again.

429
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,570
How can that count? Give me two waters first.

430
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,370
Sure, uncles. Just wait a moment. I'll rush them. Right away!

431
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,110
Sorry.

432
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,080
Where's my uncle?

433
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,990
He's resting in the back. He can't even stand up straight.

434
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,860
Uncles, your beverages.

435
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,620
Xiao Lin.

436
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,900
Who was that? He looks like a celebrity.

437
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,400
Not a celebrity. He is a god of cooking.

438
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,970
A Michelin three-star chef. More awesome than a celebrity. Really famous.

439
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,650
Uncle.

440
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,370
Uncle, are you okay?

441
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,180
This... This... Kesong, why are you here?

442
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,650
Are you okay?

443
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,120
Xiao... Have you gotten in touch with Xiaoyu?

444
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,730
Don't worry about her. I've got a savior for you.

445
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,660
Savior?

446
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,300
Mr. Lin.

447
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,370
Mr. Jiang, why are you here?

448
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,500
It's fine. Don't get excited. Leave the rest to me.

449
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,910
Chef, may I ask about something?

450
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,570
The dish you just made is asparagus and mushrooms. Is it supposed to be light in flavor?

451
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,190
- Yes, Mr. Jiang. You are right.
- May I ask another question?

452
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,790
That chef's Shacha Beef uses the Shacha sauce as base,

453
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,490
but his mixture is also leaning toward a lighter flavor, too. Is that right?

454
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,230
You are an expert. You've got it right.

455
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,450
Good. When I start cooking, I may have to ask you two more questions.

456
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,330
Fine. No problem.

457
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,690

459
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,490

that I didn't understand the problem that the lecturer was just talking about. Could you explain it to me?

589
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,760
Then just ask now.

590
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,090
A student who loves learning is surely good at making good use of the time after class.

591
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,060
That's true.

592
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,310
Then I want to ask you about what the lecturer just said

593
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:20,060
about this 'edge effect curve'. What did he mean when he said it can drop?

594
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,890
Diminishing marginal effect means, once the consumption volume reached at certain level,

595
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:27,650
the marginal effect will gradually diminish. It's actually easy to understand.

596
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:32,850
For example if you eat 5 bowls of rice, you'll be full. If you eat a sixth, you won't think it's good.

597
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:37,400
I expect that in the next class, the professor will tell us that when one becomes aware of the decrease in the edge effect,

598
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,030
you should supplement your consumer capital in some other place.

599
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,920
He'll surely analyze other ways to allocate your property or investments.

600
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,840
I really want to hear his line of thinking.

601
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,950
What/s wrong?

602
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,160
Nothing.

603
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,760
It's just that I didn't realize that you were a scholar.

604
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,730
Then, what were you doing spending all those days with me before this?

605
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,170
Back to class.

606
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,890
With a fixed time period, when other factors haven't changed,

607
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:21,280
when consumption just started increasing, the marginal effect will increase.

608
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,540
So the total effect is increased greatly in scale.

609
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,470
But, once the consumption has accumulated to a certain level,

610
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:32,380
with the increase in consumption, the marginal effect will decrease gradually.

611
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:37,550
If the marginal effect is still positive, it means the total effect continues to increase,

612
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,420
but the rate of increase will gradually plateau.

613
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,150
When the consumption is accumulating to saturation,

614
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:48,370
and the marginal utility has decreased to zero, it means the total effect will not increase.

615
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:51,260
At this time, the total effect has reached its maximum,

616
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,750
if the marginal utility becomes negative,

617
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,550
it means the total effect will also gradually diminish.

618
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,590
