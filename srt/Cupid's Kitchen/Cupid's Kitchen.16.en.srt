[Episode 16]

9
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,490
The competition is around the corner. You need to give up this highly stimulating food.

10
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,520
Food that is high in oil, salt, and fat is all forbidden.

11
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,640
Fine.

12
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,550
Are you actually obeying me?

13
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,090
Though I hate you,

14
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,570
but I hate losing like a coward even more.

15
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,220
Is that why you were so dramatic?

16
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,390
I was?

17
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,550
You did very well today.

18
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,570
Can I have one of these?

19
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,250
No, not until after the competition.

20
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,710
As a renowned company in the culinary industry,

21
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,850
Quentin Group is very supportive of the Future Star Culinary Competition.

22
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,810
We've also chosen Victor Quentin as a participant.

23
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,240
My Mother, Mrs. Jessica Quentin, will be the mentor.

24
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,460
Did the Quentin Group contribute financially to this event?

25
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,590
President Thomas has always refused all sponsorship

26
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,940
for the independence and seriousness of the competition, and I respect that.

27
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,860
And can you tell us your prediction for the outcome of this competition?

28
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,900
This might offend someone.

29
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,080
Although Mr. Jiang Qianfan and I are good partners at work,

30
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,090
but we all know that Victor is a genius.

31
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,730
Mr. Boris, you were ready to expose a big secret in this morning's video.

32
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,050
When is that going to happpen?

33
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,530
So you can't wait? But you have to.

34
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,290
This video is for sale.

35
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,830
Whoever offers the highest price gets it.

36
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,820
Mr. Boris...

37
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,400
Stop! Stop following me.

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,280
Mr. Boris.

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,790
Mr. Boris!

40
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,690
- Mr. Boris!
- Mr. Boris!

41
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,010
Xiao Yu, start shooting.

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,930
Excuse me, I'm taking it from here.

43
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,890
Yes.

44
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,140
Bring me some ice.

45
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,650
Yes.

46
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,370
Jiang Qianfan, I'm a man of my word and I will come after you.

47
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,690
I couldn't wait anymore.

48
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,280
Here you go. Brace yourself.

49
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,880
Have a taste. Can you tell me how I made this?

50
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,520
You know I don't drink.

51
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,880
To be honest, my mother is invincible.

52
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,780
I'm sorry. If there are no more questions, I have to leave.

53
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,790
I've been watching you for a long time.

54
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:07,240
From the time you entered until now, you haven't had a sip of water.

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,730
I'm just worried about you.

56
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,830
Thank you.

57
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,610
I'm more concerned about

58
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,830
whether there is actually something wrong with your sense of taste.

59
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,570
Boris, what nonsense are you saying?

60
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,500
You were there messing up everything the last time.

61
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,220
Jiang Qianfan, man up.

62
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,990
Stop using women to hold it for you.

63
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,220
Vodka, apple-flavored liqueur, Old Tom gin,

64
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,190
and a little bit of absinthe.

65
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,630
I was expecting something good. This is awful.

66
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,520
Lucky guess.

67
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,240
Oliver!

68
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,310
- Just now...
- That was close.

69
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,290
It's a good thing I asked for the menu and the wine list in advance.

70
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,360
By the color of his drinks, I could tell.

71
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,690
If he had asked one more question about the modulation ratio, I'd have been a fool.

72
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,460
So, so you knew Boris would do this?

73
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,840
Last time you took the cake away, I thought he might change his moves this time.

74
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,630
So this time I asked Thomas for the menu in advance. I told him I'm on medication

75
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,630
and that I was afraid that the medicine would conflict with the menu and the drinks.

76
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,220
Did he ask why you were on medication?

77
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,200
No.

78
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,000
That's good.

79
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,300
What's wrong?

80
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,090
So there is nothing wrong with Jiang Qianfan?

81
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,460
Did you make a mistake?

82
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,670
No! My judgment was never wrong!

83
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,440
I just couldn't think of how he did it.

84
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,850
Is it possible that because you sent out the video in advance,

85
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,040
after seeing the video, he got himself prepared.

86
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,490
That makes sense.

87
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,470
Although...

88
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,440
I don't know what preparation he got himself into,

89
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,080
but I will definitely get him unguarded next time!

90
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,330
I, Boris, would never

91
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,350
lose my prey.

92
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,320
He asked Thomas for the drinking menu in advance,

93
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,820
so he did not taste it himself.

94
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,330
That means Boris was right about him losing his taste.

95
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,520
And that's why he couldn't taste the saltiness of the chrysanthemum fish,

96
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,690
and also why he missed the mark when making crab stuffed orange,

97
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,820
as well as the secret technique for taste ratings.

98
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,050
Has he been lying to me?

99
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,760
I have so many questions. I feel like my brain is going to explode.

100
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,920
I am so bad at reasoning that I want to just ask him in person,

101
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,260
but I'm afraid he will get mad.

102
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,150
But I'm also too scared to test him.

103
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,390
If he finds out, it will be worse.

104
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,130
Forget it, I should just let it go.

105
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,210
But I really want to know the truth!

106
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,580
Hey Boris, I'm leaving.

107
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,380
Curse that Jiang Qianfan!

108
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,440
What's wrong with him?

109
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,010
I deleted the video, but still got trolled online.

110
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,520
This is your fault as well!

111
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,740
We have a visitor.

112
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,730
Would it be Jiang Qianfan

113
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,980
coming to beg me for mercy?

114
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,820
You are?

115
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,770
We are from the City Police Office. Is Boris Rogoff here?

116
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,670
Yes.

117
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,550
We checked Li Yan's phone records for the past three months.

118
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,220
We found out you've been in contact with him.

119
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,020
I was offering him to work for me,

120
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,360
but he declined my offer.

121
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,320
So, what did you talk about in your last phone call?

122
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,010
I don't remember.

123
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,020
Why don't you ask Li Yan instead?

124
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,360
Have you again seen Li Yan afterward?

125
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,570
No.

126
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,700
All right. Thank you for your cooperation.

127
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,020
This is my name card. If you recall anything,

128
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,790
contact us at once.

129
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,090
Goodbye, officers!

130
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,900
Who was the person they were talking about?

131
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,310
Jiang Qianfan's assistant.

132
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,040
I thought Jiang Qianfan sacked him.

133
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,330
Surprisingly, he fled after committing a crime!

134
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,920
But wouldn't you be implicated as well?

135
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,090
Certainly not.

136
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,260
It's getting late.

137
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,840
After midnight, the challenge for the first round

138
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,470
will be announced. Stay tuned.

139
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,960
Okay. Good night, Boris.

140
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,840
Good night.

141
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,020
[Mr. Jiang, long time no see. If you don't want your secret to be revealed to the public, prepare ¥10,000 in cash. Before 2 a.m, put it under the second bench at the west side of Bin Jiang Garden. Calling the police will do you no good.]

142
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,000
[When you need money, you look for me, but we have to talk things clearly. I will not call the police. Two hours later, meet you at the old place.]

143
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,760
[There's nothing to say.]

144
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,100
[I have no money to give.]

145
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,350
[I have no money to give.]

146
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,410
[You just wait!]

147
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,300
The challenge is out. It's wild greens.

148
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,730
What is Victor going to make?

149
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,580
He never likes Okinawa spinach, so I'm guessing he'll use Shepherd's Purse.

150
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,080
Good. I'm going to use Okinawa spinach.

151
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,970
Let me know when you're leaving.

152
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,190
No problem.

153
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,150
By the way, has the police found any news on Li Yan?

154
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,390
No. What's wrong?

155
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,140
Just asking.

156
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,800
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

157
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,190
Did you check the challenge? It's wild greens.

158
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,420
- Yes.
- Good.

159
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,350
We'll do basic training in the morning as usual. After eating lunch in the afternoon,

160
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,180
we'll go searching for wild greens.

161
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,350
Where are we going?

162
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,230
That's not your concern. Just know that there will be mountains and a body of water.

163
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,800
Carry on.

164
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,370
Is technology so advanced nowadays? Can it even detect where the greens are?

165
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,860
Of course not.

166
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,280
I'm looking for a body of water. Plants are simple beings.

167
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,470
Where there is water, they grow better.

168
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,540
There is water here.

169
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,220
I'll listen to you. That's where we'll go.

170
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,230
The wild greens in China should be very different from foreign wild greens.

171
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,930
I need to taste it before I can start using it.

172
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,310
He just agreed to go wherever I pointed. He's not afraid at all.

173
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,360
Does it mean everything is all right?

174
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,340
Break.

175
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,330
What is that? It looks professional.

176
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,950
Survival gear. When we go out to hunt for ingredients, we often go alone.

177
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,170
There's no telling what's out there, so we must prepare.

178
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,440
Have you ever run into animals like tigers and bears?

179
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,600
Not tigers and bears, but we've seen lots of snakes.

180
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,240
We need to act smart and not compete with the wildlife for food.

181
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,960
We are just looking for the wild greens.

182
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,900
What are you doing?

183
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,690
I'm making tea eggs.

184
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,660
When I went on spring outings as a kid, my mom would prepare a lot of tea eggs for me.

185
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,470
This is not a spring outing.

186
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,350
You're right. It's a different season.

187
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,500
This is the fall outing.

188
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,140
You are unbelievable.

189
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,510
How many do you want?

190
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,160
I'll have whatever you have. Hurry.

191
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,070
[We have set off.]

192
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,340
- Are you ready yet?
- I'm done after putting them into a container.

193
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,080
Hurry up.

194
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,070
Come here.

195
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:20,340
Oh my...

196
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,610
Watch your steps.

197
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,580
Here.

198
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,520
If there are greens around here, there will be trace elements in the water.

199
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,030
You try.

200
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,800
Hurry up, give it a try.

201
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,780
Can I even drink this?

202
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,990
This is the taste of Shepherd's Purse. He wants me to try it because he can't taste it?

203
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,880
This tastes familiar, but I can't really remember what it is.

204
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,090
Let's go, it's Shepherd's Purse.

205
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,460
I remember it now!

206
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,210
I'm asking you.

207
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,130
Do you like to eat Shepherd's Purse?

208
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,590
I do. My mom makes great wontons with it.

209
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,640
I couldn't recall the taste just now because I haven't had any in a long time.

210
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,190
Okay. We should be able to find some later.

211
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,220
Hi.

212
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,070
You are here too.

213
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,620
What a coincidence. Okay,

214
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,330
Kesong, we'll look up ahead.

215
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,670
What's wrong? Are you scared we will use the same wild green?

216
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,710
Victor, don't say that. Oliver is being courteous.

217
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,260
It's okay. That's not the case.

218
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,350
Let's not be the same as others. Let's go.

219
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,170
Where are we going? Shouldn't you check the GPS or something?

220
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:30,490
No. This is a great place for wild greens to grow. There must be other species here.

221
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,040
I'm asking you.

222
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,360
When you tasted the water, did you notice other tastes?

223
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,270
A little bitter, spicy, and with a hint of fruity taste.

224
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,590
It also tastes like garlic and spring onion, or garlic chives.

225
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,680
- What is that?
- Can you not tell at all?

226
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,430
I'm guessing it's my favorite, the Okinawa spinach.

227
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,830
The plant has a very unique flavor, and most importantly, it's easy to cook.

228
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:03,260
Tomorrow is your first time in a competition. You will surely get nervous. This is the perfect ingredient for you.

229
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,860
For real?

230
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,840
Even I had trouble differentiating the tastes, but he could tell with ease.

231
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,410
Don't tell me his sense of taste is just as great as mine?

232
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,840
Is he tricking me?

233
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,360
What's on your mind? Keep walking.

234
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,190
Move forward.

235
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,540
Victor, I still have some work to see to.

236
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,660
I need to get going.

237
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,690
No, I don't know the way home.

238
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,480
Come on, I really need to go.

239
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,040
Are you meeting up with those two?

240
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,250
This is between the adults, stay out of it.

241
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,720
Elise, I am not a child anymore. I am already 20 years old.

242
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,510
I know that you are going to look for them, but sneaking up behind them

243
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,170
is too odd. That's not the person I know.

244
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,890
Elise, we'll keep digging for greens.

245
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,450
Then, I'll make some soup with Shepherd's Purse for you.

246
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,920
Please.

247
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,530
Fine.

248
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,730
This plant seems good. Let's dig it out.

249
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,870
- This?
- Yes.

250
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,400
Let's go.

251
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,830
Slow down!

252
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,100
Don't fall down.

253
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,750
Old Huang!

254
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,670
Look at this. I picked up a lot of water hyacinth.

255
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,570
Okay, that's enough!

256
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,450
Think about it. It's all a man-made disaster.

257
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,790
When wastewater is poured into the river,

258
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,180
the high nutrition in the wastewater

259
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,050
will make these water hyacinths grow rampantly.

260
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,390
The environment is interconnected with people,

261
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,840
but many people don't care.

262
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,450
Then, we must make them into a really tasty dish.

263
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,210
It's winning a round for the environment lovers.

264
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,160
Let's see how you do it then.

265
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,090
Come, drink some wine with me.

266
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,630
- Thanks.
- Here.

267
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,600
Victor and I picked some Shepherd's Purse from the mountain during the day.

268
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,660
Let me see them.

269
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,970
Very good. I remember from a few years ago, a staff member

270
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,000
took Shepherd's Purse to London.

271
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,500
All the staff loved eating it. I was curious and asked for some to bring back for cooking.

272
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,100
Unexpectedly, you two loved eating it. Do you still remember?

273
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,820
That Shepherd's Purse wasn't as good as what Jiang Qianfan grew.

274
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,040
This Shepherd's Purse was grown by Jiang Qianfan?

275
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,850
Why didn't you tell me already? Can it still be used?

276
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,120
Yes. He and I spread the seeds using drones.

277
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,000
If we had told you this was related to Jiang,

278
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,290
we were afraid you wouldn't go.

279
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,050
I don't have to use them now either.

280
00:22:54,050 --> 00:23:00,050
Victor, just think of these as grown by me, not by Jiang Qianfan, okay?

281
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,100
Since Jiang Qianfan doesn't use his own Shepherd's Purse, what does he use?

282
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,680
He uses Okinawa spinach. Where it's not too far from Shepherd's Purse,

283
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,190
I planted his favorite Okinawa spinach there. Only he and I know the place.

284
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,310
So, Lin Kesong knows about it too now.

285
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,910
Elise, is it because of this that you've been so absent-minded lately?

286
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,230
It's getting dark, but we haven't found anything.

287
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,340
Why don't we go back?

288
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,500
- We can—
- If you are telling me to go back to find Shepherd's Purse, you can do push-ups right now.

289
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,250
This place looks good. Let's look for them here.

290
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,890
Lin Kesong. Come here.

291
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,470
Look over there. Aren't they there?

292
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,290
Go.

293
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,000
Go down.

294
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,810
- Really go down?
- Come down.

295
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,350
Come down.

296
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,100
Really here?

297
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,530
Haven't we passed by here?

298
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,380
Oh my... slowly, slowly.

299
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,770
Slowly. Slowly, slowly.

300
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:05,430
Of course, you haven't been here. It looks the same everywhere in the wild. Go.

301
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,690
Hurry.

302
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,370
That plant in front of you, and these. They're all Okinawa spinach.

303
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,590
This?

304
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,330
Want to try it?

305
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,940
It's bitter!

306
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,560
Aren't they?

307
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,210
Even though it's really bitter, but I can taste

308
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,060
it from the water I sipped.

309
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,260
It really is the Okinawa spinach that he talked about. I was scared for nothing.

310
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,310
Jiang Qianfan's sense of taste is good. I really want to announce it to the world.

311
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,880
What's wrong with you? You are smiling even though it's bitter?

312
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,230
I am crying.

313
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,750
Listen to me. The one you're holding is probably too old.

314
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,510
It's more bitter when it's old. If you pick, pick the tender ones.

315
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,990
The tender ones are better for eating.

316
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,500
- This one? Let me see.
- Wait!

317
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,100
Pick them later. Wait for three or four o'clock,

318
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,440
that's when Okinawa spinach tastes the best. Wait for a little.

319
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,650
Here. You can sit on this.

320
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,170
- Are we staying here tonight then?
- Yes. Sit.

321
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,600
- Really?
- Really.

322
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,590
Let me tell you. I've always wanted to go camping since I was little,

323
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,720
but my mom always told me that camping is dangerous and there are many bad people.

324
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,740
This is not a game. Rest for a while.

325
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,540
Will we toast marshmallows?

326
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,300
- Here's your dish.
- Thanks.

327
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,070
Please enjoy Meeting of Two Seasons.

328
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,470
Why is the flavor so strange?

329
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,220
Yeah.

330
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,620
Come in.

331
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,760
Sorry to disturb you, Miss Elise.

332
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,260
Have you tried this Wagyu Sirloin and Red Crayfish?

333
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,170
No. What's the matter?

334
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,360
Try it please. I've already sliced it for you.

335
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,670
Is there a problem?

336
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,580
I think there's a big problem.

337
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:43,290
When I first tried the dish, I thought the fishy taste inside the crayfish wasn't removed.

338
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,800
The taste is unbearable. At first, I thought I was mistaken,

339
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,930
so I let everyone on the team try it, and all the chefs thought so too.

340
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:54,090
Later on, I paid attention to all the customers who ordered this dish.

341
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,500
When they took the first bite, everyone had an unbearable expression.

342
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,590
So I think this is a big problem and wanted to remind you in time.

343
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,240
Got it. But on the contrary,

344
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,290
I think this dish is really delicious. Fresh, rich, it's superb.

345
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,790
Any other question?

346
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,430
Nothing then. I'll go do my work.

347
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,440
Okay. Thank you, Damai.

348
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,140
Oh, yes. This delicious crayfish dish,

349
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,480
I'll leave it here for you to enjoy slowly.

350
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,910
Thanks. You can go.

351
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,320
Why are you in such a good mood today to especially accompany me to a meal?

352
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,550
What are you saying?

353
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:54,480
Who else will I accompany? Accompanying you is my most important job.

354
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,590
You're talking sweetly today. I haven't heard it for a long time.

355
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,690
What's the matter?

356
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,860
Nothing. The flowers look pretty. Let's go, I'll walk you to the shop.

357
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,290
Shopkeer!

358
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,680
- Order 10 floral baskets for me. The kind that's pretty and has balloons.
- Okay.

359
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,310
Do you need any greetings on them?

360
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:26,610
Just say, "My best wishes for Lin Kesong's success in the competition."

361
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,980
Why are you buying flowers for Kesong?

362
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,850
I'm cheering for her.

363
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,910
Are these things are what you want to do?

364
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,170
I'll do them for you.

365
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,710
Aren't you angry with me anymore?

366
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,140
Yiran, I'm willing to believe you.

367
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,800
Previously, I was too narrow-minded.

368
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,300
So, I hope you will tolerate me too.

369
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,200
What are you saying?

370
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,670
Chu Ting, you are the best woman I've ever met.

371
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,620
Enough now. Let's go pick the flowers.

372
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,790
You're back?

373
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,490
Hungry?

374
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,490
Water hyacinths?

375
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,180
- You're cooking this tomorrow?
- Yes.

376
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,020
Is this edible?

377
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,080
Of course it's edible. Old Huang taught me.

378
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,030
It's delicious, it tastes like white cabbage.

379
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,870
If you use this to compete tomorrow, you probably won't even defeat my sister.

380
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,950
It's fine.

381
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,140
What are you cooking?

382
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,900
Not telling you!

383
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,030
Oh yes, Xiaoyu.

384
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,500
I want to specially remind you about something.

385
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,660
What is it?

386
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:58,120
In the competition, tomorrow, the stove and the heat strength will be different from normal ones.

387
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,470
So you must pay attention in choosing the wok.

388
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,930
Choosing the wok?

389
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,060
Yes.

390
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,370
You must choose a kind of newly improved woks.

391
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,700
The heat will be better distributed. Most importantly,

392
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,060
it won't be that heavy.

393
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,200
The noodles are ready.

394
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,070
Hot soup noodles? I've eaten them since I was young.

395
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,900
- Try it.
- How does a foreigner like you know how to cook this?

396
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,060
You can't be a foreigner!

397
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,030
Are you from Xinjiang? Can you make hand-pulled noodles?

398
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,370
Hand-pulled noodles?

399
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,970
Okinawa spinach is so bitter, so why do you like it the most?

400
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,930
Is it bitter?

401
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,920
Okinawa's bitterness

402
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,690
isn't as bad as the hardship that people endure.

403
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:09,150
You like it so much, so why don't you turn it into a dish in Yuxuan?

404
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,070
Some things can't be shared with others.

405
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:21,060
I get it. You've endured more bitterness.

406
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,950
I can see from the wounds in your hands.

407
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,800
You should know

408
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,670
no one is naturally born to endure bitterness.
 (T/N: Bitter also means a difficult life in Chinese)

409
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,940
Most of the times, you just endure and gradually get used to it.

410
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,620
Have you endured bitterness?

411
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,920
I never did before I met you.

412
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,730
I'm sorry to you then.

413
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,860
I really never endured much bitterness before.

414
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,350
When I took medicine in childhood,

415
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:01,300
my dad always squeezed my nose and my mom poured it into my mouth.

416
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,870
After taking the medicine, they'd give me a big piece of chocolate to eat.

417
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,340
Then I should congratulate you.

418
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,640
It won't be that bothersome in the future.

419
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,360
Remember what I told you before?

420
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,670
All the scars on a cook's hands are medals.

421
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:29,260
When I studied with Montgomery at first, I was just like you,

422
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,690
I never could cut the ingredients well.

423
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,830
The pieces were big and small.

424
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:39,450
For that, I didn't close my eyes for two days and nights.

425
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,680
I kept cutting and slicing until I could do it well.

426
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,780
At that time, to me,

427
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,030
getting the right temperature was the most difficult.

428
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,680
I couldn't get it right no matter how I tried.

429
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,370
All the fingernails on this hand

430
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:02,500
were regrown after they were scalded. But one day, you'll get it right.

431
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,730
Hearing this from you, I don't want to be a successful person.

432
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,900
I remember you said you wanted to be a strong woman.

433
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,570
You have no choice anyway, right now.

434
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,270
Come.

435
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,570
A toast to the strong woman.

436
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,510
Why is this still so hot after we've been out so long?

437
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,760
[Dear Guest, Shanghai Yuxuan - MEMO Restaurant's hours are as follows:]

438
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,150
Everyone has tried it, right? It really has a problem.

439
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,880
- So just say what we should say in a while.
- Okay.

440
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,780
Wait for her to come out.

441
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,440
Why are you all standing here?

442
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,310
Miss Elise, it's still about the crayfish.

443
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,910
Didn't I already tell you how I felt?

444
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:19,940
You can see this. People probably don't agree with how you feel.

445
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,030
Miss Elise, I've carefully observed customers' facial expressions.

446
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,400
None of their reacion is good.

447
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,370
We don't dare to tell Mr. Jiang, so we can only tell you.

448
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,080
Therefore, you are doubting Mr. Jiang?

449
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,940
I must stress one thing. In Yuxuan, what people think is good isn't really good.

450
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,310
Mr. Jiang is the correct answer.

451
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,970
Everyone, you've worked hard all day. You can go home now and rest. Goodbye.

452
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,240
This...

453
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,640
What is this?

454
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,600
We can't help it. It's his territory.

455
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,560
This isn't about territory! Why are we doing this for? Isn't it for Yuxuan?

456
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,960
That's right.

457
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,060
Yeah.

458
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,800
- Forget it. Let's go.
- Something bad will happen if this continues.

459
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,930
Why do I think you are getting closer and closer to me?

460
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,490
No. I'm not moving at all.

461
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,460
Stay away from me. Five meters away!

462
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,390
This room isn't even as wide as five meters.

463
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,360
Shut up.

464
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,180
You are sleepless?

465
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,340
Aren't you sleepless too?

466
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,020
I am feeling what you are feeling. This aura.

467
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,850
What's this you're feeling?

468
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,220
You must be nervous.

469
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,330
Aren't you nervous? The competition is tomorrow.

470
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,810
I've learned all the dishes that I'll cook.

471
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:09,630
Competition is just when I show off all the dishes I've learned.

472
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,260
Why should I be nervous?

473
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,200
Where are people like you?

474
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,430
Someone who is nervous like you, and someone who is not nervous like me,

475
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,570
our auras cancel each other out.

476
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,010
Isn't it just right?

477
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,300
I've participated in so many competitions,

478
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,280
I've never lost sleep because of the competition.

479
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,750
I don't know why.

480
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,000
It's probably because it's a different surrounding?

481
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,230
Maybe you just want to win too much.

482
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,790
You'd better shut up.

483
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:41,560
I-I want to be your sleep-aiding APP.

484

What the...

485
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,960
Now, follow my voice

486
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,050
to forget everything around you.

487
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,670
Forget yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

488
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:00,440
Imagine your body is lying in a cloud.

489
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,990
Your body is becoming very light, very light...

490
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,200
Hey. Hey!

491
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,750
Be careful. Don't break the roots when you dig.

492
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,120
Keep the roots, then they'll live longer.

493
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,080
Like this?

494
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,400
Yes.

495
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,180
I've finally reached this today. I'm going to compete.

496
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,000
With the unique wild vegetables that he found, and also the unique cooking method that I learned from him,

497
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,310
the first round of the competition should be fine.

498
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,250
It's just that, I really don't want to leave this place for the competition.

499
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,970
Why can't I spend everyday being happy instead of being stressed?

500
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,670
I don't want stress.

501
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,870
Put away the stuff, and we should go back now.

502
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,780
We are going back already?

503
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,520
Yeah. It's about four o'clock now.

504
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,640
When you go back, you still need to shower and change,

505
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,480
and get familiar with how to cook the Okinawa spinach.

506
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,730
You'll be competing in a short while.

507
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,450
I don't want to go back.

508
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,170
Go.

509
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,760
Go!

- There are many kinds of curry.
- I've already kept them separated. Don't worry.

Don't worry.

Why did Big Head and Chu Ting send me so many floral baskets?

521
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:06,380
I don't want to attract so much attention. What if I lose?

522
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,630
What's so scary about losing?

The pressure is all on them. They are jealous of you.
