9
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,310
Is this okay?

10
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,170
Where is my food?

11
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,300
What are you doing, Sister Nina? I haven't eaten yet.

12
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,290
I asked her to do so.

13
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,490
If she neglects her duties and lets you have your breakfast, I'll fire her.

14
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,880
What?

15
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,380
And what is this about?

16
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,980
Get up at four to exercise and eat breakfast at six.

17
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,010
This has been my unchanging habit for years.

18
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,060
The rules don't change just because you slip-up.

19
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,070
You have to change yourself and cater to the rules.

20
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,490
There is an old saying...

21
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,870
The fittest survive.

22
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,290
How can you survive when you're starving to death?

23
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,260
You've been tormenting me in so many ways since yesterday.

24
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,720
How can I survive without any dignity?

25
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,240
It's just one less meal, what does dignity have to do with it?

26
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,900
Cheapskate.

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,790
Are you not ashamed?

28
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,030
What did you say? I'm looking to see if you're wasting food.

29
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,750
I hate wasting food.

30
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,440
But it's worth it to get you to understand the rule.

31
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,870
Little Bun, it's your first day of class.

32
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,540
Go for it.

33
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,360
Five minutes to class. I'm warning you not to be late, or else...

34
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,870
God. This outfit is magical.

35
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,850
It's so cool to wear.

36
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,260
I'm tempted by my own uniform look.

37
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,700
It fits so well as if I was born wearing it.

38
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,510
I myself almost believed I can cook.

39
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,850
Beautiful clothes are so powerful.

40
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,180
I'm not even mad at Jiang Qianfan.

41
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,090
Grilled steak at table six and hot candied apples at table eight.

42
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,270
Nope. Chefs are not like this.

43
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,570
You can't even soak the vermicelli well, how can I trust you with cooking?

44
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,780
How do you know you can do your best

45
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,710
if you don't give yourself a hard time?

46
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,950
Push-ups! Sit-ups!

47
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,140
600 each. You have to follow my rules.

48
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,370
Thank you.

49
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,120
This uniform fits so well. It's like it was made for me.

50
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,170
This was made for you.

51
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,140
How did you know my measurements?

52
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,690
75, 58.5, 89.

53
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,180
Really?

54
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,660
The chef should be able to see the size of the ingredients at a glance, so that the plating won't be off.

55
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,570
You're good.

56
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,320
The money for this outfit...

57
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
It's on me.

58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,260
Good. Let's go!

59
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,800
Wait!

60
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,290
I'll only say this once.

61
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,350
Tie the triangular towel before entering the kitchen.

62
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,370
It is one way to avoid presenting dirty things to the guests.

63
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,560
Also, it's easy for the kitchen to catch fire.

64
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,900
In case of a dangerous situation, you can cover your mouth and nose with a triangular towel to escape.

65
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,320
Is being a chef life-threatening?

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,320
If you don't learn to be smart, I can't guarantee that your life won't be in danger.

67
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,850
Go.

68
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,480
Wow.

69
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,720
I didn't observe closely yesterday.

70
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,400
This kitchen is so fancy.

71
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,820
I'm glad you like it. This is where you'll have private training for the next month.

72
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,250
People call you the god of cooking.

73
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,780
You must have some unique techniques.

74
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,570
Are you going to teach me here?

75
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,810
I am. Are you ready?

76
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,070
I'm ready!

77
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,440
Good. Your task is simple today, measuring salt.

78
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
Measure salt?

79
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,660
What's there to practice?

80
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,690
It's all written in the book, a little bit of salt and the right amount of sugar.

81
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,360
It all depends on the feel of it.

82
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,570
I hate obscurity. Only precision can standardize dishes.

83
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,010
Two grams.

84
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,320
That's simple.

85
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,300
Hey.

86
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,410
Stop!

87
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,200
That's about it. Two grams right there.

88
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,150
Do you know how long it took for you to measure two grams of salt?

89
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,510
32 seconds.

90
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,470
A normal chef has to come up with 100 dishes in one hour.

91
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,440
You measure salt once in 32 seconds, and for 100 dishes, you'll take 53 minutes.

92
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,620
You will spend almost an hour just measuring the salt.

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,750
Then, you try it once, and let's see how long it takes.

94
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,460
In one second?

95
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:41,830
One-third of a second to be exact. A 100 dishes, that's 33 seconds.

96
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,010
How long do I have to train to be like you?

97
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,630
I won't be able to do it before the competition.

98
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,100
Hurry up. It's never too late to start practicing.

99
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,720
Did you make a wild guess?

100
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,340
Can you measure 5.4 grams?

101
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,590
Are you sure that's a master in Huaiyang cuisine?

102
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,820
I'll blame you if it's not good.

103
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,950
Okay, I know. Bye.

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,880
Old Lin, you are in luck.

106
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,640
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

107
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,930
Sorry, the subscriber—

108
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,900
Switched off?

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,870
What happened?

110
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,480
- Hello?
- Is this Xiaoyu Private Kitchen? I'm looking for Lin Kesong.

111
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,450
She is not here. She left.

112
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,980
What does that mean?

113
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,730
Going off the grid?

114
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,340
Put 20 grams in my hand. Let me feel it. The feel is important.

115
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,870
Got it.

116
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,350
Start.

117
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,080
20 grams, right?

118
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,700
That's about right.

119
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,090
Why is there so much less?

120
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,670
Keep going.

121
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,500
Make up for the shortfall?

122
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,780
Fill it up. Continue.

123
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,940
That's too much.

124
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,410
Not enough.

125
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,790
Too much!

126
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,590
A little more.

127
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,140
It's 19.9 grams. What difference does it make?

128
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,840
You go down first and wait for me in the dining room.

129
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,910
Hello. For how many?

130
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm not here to eat. Is Lin Kesong here?

131
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,800
- She was...
-She's not here!

Tell me what you feel.

134
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,900
It's delicious.

135
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,450
It's too salty and strong.

136
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,610
This one is too bland.

137
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,320
This bowl is too salty, so your emotions will be affected.

138
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,760
You will feel annoyed.

139
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,520
This bowl is too bland to stimulate your taste buds.

140
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,230
You will then feel tired.

141
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,110
The amount of salt used for these three servings is 0.5,

142
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,920
0.6, and 0.4.

143
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,790
Your sense of taste allows you to clearly detect the difference.

144
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,290
Maybe most people can't detect that, but their emotions do get affected.

145
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,940
Only by controlling the amount of salt precisely

146
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,480
can we give each diner the perfect feeling.

147
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,090
This perfection is something we must do in our job.

148
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,470
You make a particularly good point,

149
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,910
but after hearing what you said, I'm less inclined to be a chef.

150
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,890
You don't get to choose.

151
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,490
How could this happen? She didn't tell me anything. Did they give her a hard time?

152
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,530
I didn't expect Lin Kesong to be so well liked.

153
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,660
Where is she now?

154
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,310
She was picked up by Jiang Qianfan for private training.

155
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,230
Jiang Qianfan?

156
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,550
How did the two of them get together again? Also, private training?

157
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:25,740
I asked her why she came to Shanghai before, and she didn't tell me. It can't be for Jiang Qianfan, right?

158
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,800
I have no idea.

159
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,950
How can you not know? Didn't she tell you?

160
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,330
I can't tell which of her words are true,

161
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,320
and which are not.

162
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,800
That's not right. Aren't you her sister?

163
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,600
How did she offend you? You can tell me.

164
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,950
Nothing to do with you. I'm busy.

165
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,870
Old Lin's phone is powered off.

166
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,690
Do you have Jiang Qianfan's address?

167
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,140
I have no idea.

168
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,840
This girl...

169
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,810
I'm telling you,

170
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,260
rock music is great for boring exercises.

171
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,080
You are in luck. Cheer up.

172
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,270
What?

173
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,590
Ugh!

174
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,150
What kind of rock music is that? That sounded like a power drill.

175
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,290
Just listen to JJ Lin's songs. You've got no taste.

176
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,730
JJ Lin? Do you still want to listen to his songs?

177
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,260
Are you practicing or not?

178
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,100
I was wrong, I was wrong. Please stop!

179
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,270
Sounds nice, right? How about listening to this?

180
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,380
I like it so much!

181
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,480
Mr. Jiang.

182
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,500
Are you there?

183
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,190
Here's the thing.

184
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,320
I've already been punished.

185
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,830
I'm too hungry to concentrate on my practice right now.

186
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:04,130
What do you think if we move up the lunch time a bit?

187
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,350
Is that okay with you?

188
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,910
He's not listening.

189
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,350
As long as I measured the right amount...

190
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,830
Right?

191
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,900
It doesn't matter what it is that I measured, right?

192
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,060
How is this also salt?

193
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,170
It's so salty.

194
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,050
I need to drink some iced water.

You naughty thing.

197
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:24,360
I'm so hungry, and I'll be scolded later.

198
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,740
Is it okay if you sit over here?

199
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,260
Enjoy your meal.

200
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,650
Good afternoon, sir and madam. Here’s your menu.

201
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,680
Here's the wine list. You can take a look if you want to.

202
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,890
Two Days and Nights of Joy.

203
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,610
Interesting name.

204
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,780
This is a beef Bourguignon that needs to be braised for 48 hours.

205
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,510
What's so special about it?

206
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,350
This is the main course of a set menu selected by our chef.

207
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,640
What's special about it...

208
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,620
Our customers believe in Mr. Jiang's selection, which makes it special.

209
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,520
Your answer is not professional enough.

210
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,730
This is not Yuxuan's level.

211
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,750
Hello, I'm Elise Quentin. Sorry, sir.

212
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,990
The dish, Two Days and Nights of Joy, uses a special cooking method.

213
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,910
It is slow-cooked at a constant temperature of 60 degrees for 48 hours,

214
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,130
using premium grass-fed beef from Yuxuan Farm.

215
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:40,570
This beef has less fat and possesses a unique texture and aroma. Would you like to try it?

216
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,630
Sounds good.

217
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,980
- What do you think?
- Okay.

218
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,800
Two servings of Two Days and Nights of Joy.

219
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,090
I will prepare the dishes for you two right away.

220
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,310
Call me if you need anything.

221
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,630
- Okay.
- Okay.

222
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,800
She is very professional.

223
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,760
Little Bun.

224
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,500
What are you doing here? If Mr. Jiang sees you...

225
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,190
I don't care if he sees me.

226
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,600
I only have the strength to lie down now.

227
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
It's a farce.

228
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,770
Sister Nina, it's time to eat, right?

229
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:24,470
It is, but Mr. Jiang called just now to say that

230
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,690
you didn't practice well and left the kitchen,

231
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,650
so your lunch is also canceled.

232
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,160
What?

233
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,620
I'm going to starve to death.

234
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,130
Don't get anxious, Little Bun.

235
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,960
I'll light an incense lamp for you.

236
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,250
There's one in Mr. Jiang's bedroom. I light it for him every night.

237
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,970
I heard this essential oil is particularly effective in calming emotions.

238
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,020
It does smell good, but it's not edible!

239
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,910
This evil Jiang Qianfan takes care of himself so well.

240
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,230
He has a girlish heart.

241
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,600
It's not like that. This is a gift from Miss Elise.

242
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,090
If you really don't have the strength, you can rest here, Little Bun.

243
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,620
This is the only way.

244

I'm so hungry!

245
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,920
Xiong, you received rigorous training when you first entered the restaurant.

246
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,910
You have to prepare a service briefing every day, even if it's a new dish.

247
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,990
You have to remember the ingredients and origin of the dish.

248
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,520
This is crucial.

249
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,430
How come you can't even answer the guest's questions?

250
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,930
I'm sorry. I'll be sure to do so next—

251
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,360
There is no next time!

252
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,760
What did I hire you for?

253
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,670
And you!

254
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,850
- To serve the guests.
- Wrong!

255
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,560
I hired you to tell a story, a good story!

256
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,330
The fact that you made a mistake means that the whole restaurant made a mistake!

257
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,870
My restaurant doesn't need people like you who have no sense of conviction.

258
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,730
You may leave now.

259
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,330
Elise, take him to settle his salary.

260
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,450
- Mr. Jiang—
- Don't touch me!

261
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,520
I'm sorry. Please give me another chance.

262
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,070
If I give you a chance, who will give me a chance?

263
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,330
Have you ever realized that there are people who have never dined at a Michelin restaurant in their lives,

264
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,390
came in with imagination and expectation,

265
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,260
only to get the service that you provided.

266
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,860
Will they give Yuxuan another chance?

267
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,660
Remember this by heart, all of you.

268
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,140
I want you to work in Yuxuan with pride,

269
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,980
and you must also have the ability to make Yuxuan proud!

Please, Oliver, if you want to fire a waiter in the future,

274
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,670
you need to run it by me first. I was put on the spot out there!

275
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,830
It's certainly not the first time he's been like that. Shouldn't he be fired?

276
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,930
I should be the one to decide who goes and who stays!

277

You have the final say in the kitchen, but the front hall is my domain!

00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,480
I don't want to talk to you. Enjoy your meal!

326
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,640
Xiaoyu! Wait, wait.

327
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,790
Are you free later?

328
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,050
Actually, I want to invite you to see my studio.

329
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,900
What studio?

330
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,810
There would be no mystery if I told you.

331
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,250
Don't tantalize me.

332
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,050
Here comes the dish!

333
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,650
Please pack it.

334
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,480
Here it is.

335
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,180
Please, come in. This is my little nest.

336
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,800
So you are a painter.

337
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,180
I'm still learning.

338
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,790
Did you paint all these?

339
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,010
Yes.

340
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,370
Instead of painting, why did you come to the cooking competition?

341
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,050
I didn't think about it that much. I just like cooking too much.

342
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,800
That's why I entered the competition.

343
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,830
It doesn't matter to me how far I can go.

344
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:17,190
Of course, you don't care. Cooking is just a hobby for you.

345
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,920
It's not the same for me. I have to win the competition,

346
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,440
so that I can escape from that diner.

347
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,080
Your diner is so cozy.

348
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,440
Why do you want to escape?

349
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,460
Because I need a bigger platform to showcase my talent.

350
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,750
What does that mean?

351
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,610
I'm sorry to have met you. We couldn't understand each other.

352
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,240
She's like a spice strip.

353
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,360
Sit-ups, now.

354
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,050
Do it!

355
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,300
I don't need your emotional intermediate state.

356
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,940
If you feel aggrieved and want to cry,

357
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,220
please cry out loud.

358
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,330
If you feel like laughing, then let me hear your laughter.

359
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,510
Our dishes should be like a symphony.

360
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,900
Sometimes rousing and sometimes harmonious.

361
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,610
I need you to enhance your enthusiasm. To switch from freezing point to boiling point instantly.

362
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,880
The more emotionally charged you are, the more passionate your dishes will be.

363
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,480
Come on. You can do it!

364
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,000
All right.

365
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,210
What did you say? I can't hear you.

366
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,860
I hate you!

367
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,710
Very good. Continue!

368
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:37,370
I'm ready.

369
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,900
I'm ready.

370
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,730
I'm ready.

371
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,560
I'm ready.

372
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,570
Thank you, Sister Nina.

373
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,610
Mind your manners.

374
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,500
I'm so hungry that I can even eat an elephant. How can I mind my manners right now?

375
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,700
Let's play a game.

376
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,430
From now on, every evening you'll summarize

377
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,840
all that you ate the entire day. You'll be rewarded if you're correct.

378
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,000
If you're wrong… You understand.

379
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,290
I don't want to play this game with you.

380
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,140
It's not up to you.

381
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,340
Thanks to you, I didn't have a single bite of food today.

382
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,780
Give it some more thought.

383
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,050
I thought about it.

384
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,850
What about the soup from this morning?

385
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,090
Didn't you tell me to drink that?

386
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,060
What about the egg from just now?

387
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,520
You let me eat that too.

388
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,880
All right.

389
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,570
You ate the salt though, right?

390
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,790
Why are you like this?

391
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,900
Why is it so difficult for me to have a bite of your food?

392
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,210
Stupid food. I don't want it anymore!

393
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,550
Victor. How did you find me?

394
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,090
I know what you like.

395
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,920
Plus, there aren't many bars

396
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,430
in Shanghai that suit your style. Let's go upstairs, Elise.

397
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,460
I'm not done drinking yet.

398
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,630
Come on.

399
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,370
Come on, Elise.

400
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,730
Come on, Elise. If you want to drink,

401
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,530
you should drink in a place where you can see the sky!

402
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,920
What's the difference between drinking up here and drinking inside?

403
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,260
It's definitely different. Here you have the stars and the sky to accompany you.

404
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,260
You'll open up the more you drink.

405
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,030
I've come here to drink many times, but I never felt the feeling you described.

406
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,230
Elise, do you know why I love riding fixie bikes?
[TN: Fixed-Geared Bicycles]

407
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,060
It's because I like to feel the wind blowing against my body.

408
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,200
I like passing through every street,

409
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,790
and I like to experience the night and sky during different seasons.

410
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,430
Elise, the world is huge.

411
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,620
Perhaps you'll see a different view at the next street corner.

412
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,090
Why did you come all the way from London to Shanghai

413
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,000
to cry for such an insignificant man?

414
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,830
The Quentin family are proud people,

415
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,160
but you've recently lost your pride.

416
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,760
Is it just because of Jiang Qianfan?

417
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,270
Sure. Some people might think of him as a man on a pedestal,

418
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,390
but I don't think that.

419
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:20,300
In my opinion, you're the most outstanding.

420
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,790
Are you really going to lose your self-esteem and pride because of someone else?

421
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,210
Victor.

422
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:32,070
You're just a 20-year-old kid. There are some things that you just won't understand.

423
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,930
Elise, I'm not a kid anymore.

424
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,970
You can talk to me about anything.

425
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,940
When did you grow up?

426
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,650
I don't know.

427
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,150
Cheers.

428
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,050
Little Bun.

429
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,660
Little Bun, I brought you your phone. It's time.

430
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,360
Thank you, Sister Nina.

431
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,870
Has Jiang Qianfan always been so insane?

432
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,220
He tortured me for the entire day.

433
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,360
Little Bun, Mr. Jiang is a good person.

434
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,660
You have to trust that there's a reason for his arrangements.

435
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,510
Have an early rest. Goodnight.

436
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,570
Old Lin, where are you? Why is your phone turned off?

437
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:44,400
Tell me honestly. What exactly is going on between you and Jiang Qianfan?

438
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:50,180
I went to your uncle's restaurant. Your cousin told me everything.

439
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,610
Are you there? Are you alive? Turn on your phone if you are.

440
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:01,600
Old Lin, are you staying with Jiang Qianfan?

441
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,510
Why is your phone still turned off?

442
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,140
Old Lin, what's going on with you? Are you doing okay?

443
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,590
Tell us. Did you like Tang Yufei from high school?

444
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,060
Did you?

445
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,430
Not at all. Here's what happened back then.

446
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,720
Hold on. Let me answer my phone call.

447
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,470
He's trying to brush us off!

448
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,580
Let me answer the phone. I'll tell you in a bit.

449
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,710
Come on, let's drink.

450
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,490
It's like this.

451
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,860
Hello?

452
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,920
You really are something. I was about to call the police if you didn't call me soon.

453
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,070
Tell me. Where are you?

454
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:40,150
Did you come to Shanghai for Jiang Qianfan?

455
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,010
Tell me the truth. Do you like him?

456
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,060
What are you going on about?

457
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,500
Why are you worrying about me? I'm doing just fine.

458
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,220
What do you mean?

459
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,600
Are you eating?

460
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,030
Lobster pizza and pasta. Just a variety of Western food.

461
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,400
Of course, it's nothing compared to the food your divine chef makes though.

462
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,880
Forget it. I'll just tell you the truth.

463
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,870
I haven't had a bite of food since I came to his place yesterday.

464
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,290
I'm about to starve to death.

465
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:22,120
Send me the address and I'll bring you some food right now.

466
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,560
You won't get me to starve that easily.

467
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,130
Hello? Old Lin. I'm here. Open the door.

468
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,910
Why can't I ring the doorbell?

469
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,240
All right. Hurry up then.

470
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,450
[Darling Chu Ting]

471
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,880
Hello? Darling.

472
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,040
I'm on the way home. I'll video call you when I get back.

473
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:05,030
Old Lin, I'll hang the food on the door. I have to get going.

474
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,080
Do you think it's any use to call for help?

475
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,040
I'm about to starve to death. How can I not call for help?

476
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,380
I can even eat my feet if I starve for any longer!

477
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,740
Go ahead. Let me see you eat it now.

478
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,360
Also, do you know it's bad for your stomach

479
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,260
if you eat pizza right now after starving for so long?

480
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,520
So for the sake of your health, don't eat this pizza. I'm taking this.

481
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,280
Scrooge!

482
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,160
Call me what you want, but remember that I'm in charge of you.

483
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,830
Even when you need to call for help, you can only call me. Do you hear me?

484
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,520
I won't ask you for help even if I starve to death!

485
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,640
Not bad! You have a backbone.

486
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,290
Nina, that person over there isn't having breakfast tomorrow. You don't have to prepare hers.

487
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,300
Okay, Mr. Jiang.

488
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,010
I won't eat then.

489
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,030
I'm trying to lose weight anyways.

490
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,680
I feel like I'm getting thinner now.

491
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,960
Honey water? Sure.

492
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:14,470
♫ You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

493
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,420
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

494
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,950
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

495
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:28,640
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

496
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,870
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

497
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:35,880
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

498
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:41,800
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
