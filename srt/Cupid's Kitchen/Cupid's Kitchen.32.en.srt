9
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,490
Old Xie, come in.

10
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,400
- Mom.
- Good morning, Madam Quentin.

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,210
Junbin, it's hard on you that we asked you to come so early in the morning.

12
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,680
I should do it. It's my honor.

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,150
Yes, yes, that's what I think too.

14
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,750
My Sister is upstairs. Do you want to go see her?

15
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,830
Is she up yet?

16
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,180
She probably hasn't slept.

17
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,390
Go ahead. Keep her company.

18
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,360
She is in a bad mood. She'll have to face the media in the afternoon.

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,340
I worry that she did what she shouldn't have done impulsively.

20
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,160
She really needs you.

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,690
Rest assured, I'll do my best.

22
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,000
Breakfast is coming!

23
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,920
Hurry and go upstairs to eat breakfast with my sister.

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,050
Okay. Leave it to me.

25
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,020
I'll go up then.

26
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,310
- Morning.
- Morning.

27
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,010
Thomas.

28
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,800
You've worked hard.

29
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,890
It truly is hard.

30
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,410
Yesterday, I just fell asleep

31
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,990
but got woken up by my assistant's phone call. Then I hurried to go to the airport.

32
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,860
I didn't buy coffee for you. I know you can't drink it.

33
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,720
It's a waste to buy it anyway, but I have to drink it.

34
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,000
Because I know I'll be busy with a lot of stuff today.

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,310
Can you please help me

36
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,030
say sorry to Madam Baer?

37
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,710
Sorry?

38
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,600
You have to apologize by yourself.

39
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,080
You are right.

40
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,360
My announcement has been released by Yuxuan's official account.

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,330
I saw it.

42
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,800
Does it look bad?

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,230
Very much so.

44
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,540
Qianfan,

45
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,210
I know that

46
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,120
you are a conceited and aloof person.

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,020
But the three words, Jiang Qianfan, to me

48
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,000
has always been a guarantee of quality. It's a golden banner.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,190
But I couldn't have expected that

50
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,560
you are now connected with dishonesty.

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,490
Do you know that this is really scary?

52
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,280
I do.

53
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,840
Have you made contact with Boris?

54
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,110
Of course, also with Lin Xiaoyu.

55
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,630
It's by procedure.

56
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,290
Qianfan, when your sense of taste developed a problem,

57
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,230
you should have told me immediately.

58
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,830
Do you know that you've

59
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,560
made it very difficult for me?

60
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,890
I'm truly sorry.

61
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,810
It's useless for you to apologize now.

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,820
But I do have a question to ask you.

63
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,810
If Boris hadn't exposed this matter,

64
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,540
how long were you going to keep deceiving?

65
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,290
If possible,

66
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,070
a whole lifetime.

67
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,650
Don't you think that's exhausting?

68
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,070
I'm not qualified to be exhausted.

69
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,670
On my way over here, I kept thinking,

70
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,780
what would I do if this were to happen to me?

71
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,690
Would I choose to tell or not tell?

72
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,720
If I were to tell,

73
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,990
what would I say?

74
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,600
But I thought more about it later.

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,650
I think my final decision would be like yours.

76
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,650
I would choose not to tell,

77
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,360
because no one wants to show their incapability to other people,

78
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,680
especially someone so conceited like you.

79
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,670
You must understand that

80
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,240
you are a mentor.

81
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,520
When your body has such a serious problem,

82
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,560
you are responsible and obligated

83
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,190
to tell me or the entire committee immediately.

84
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,680
The competition is serious,

85
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,430
but it's also cruel at the same time.

86
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,390
I know, that's why I'm willing to accept any punishment.

87
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,850
But this matter has nothing to do with Lin Kesong.

88
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,780
Can she continue to compete?

89
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,410
It's not up to me anymore.

90
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,880
I'll have to meet with the six members

91
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,490
of the committee.

92
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,570
At that meeting, we'll see how they

93
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,130
will make a final decision.

94
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,060
Okay.

95
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,590
Qianfan, the competition is a temporary moment,

96
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,590
but it's a part of your life.

97
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,740
Have you ever thought, if this matter continues on,

98
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,980
what the eventual consequence would be?

99
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,450
Elise has already made arrangements.

100
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,760
This afternoon, there will be a press conference at Yuxuan.

101
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,090
Do you have an explanation?

102
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,740
None.

103
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,770
I don't want to lie anymore.

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,120
Usually this amount of alkali when eaten,

105
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,330
will be very bitter for people.

106
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,890
Blu, open the door. It's me.

107
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,160
This bowl is Jiang Qianfan's

108
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,350
Old Huang, morning.

109
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,320
Go fishing with me.

110
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,140
When we return, I'll teach you Sweet and Sour Live Fish.
 (T/N: a famous dish that is rarely eaten by most Chinese)

111
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,530
Sorry, Old Huang.

112
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,370
I'm not in the mood.

113
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,350
I know that's what you'd say.

114
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,590
I'm not asking if you are in the mood.

115
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,980
This is teaching you.

116
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,820
Old Huang,

117
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,080
I feel awful.

118
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,400
It's like

119
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,900
eating flies.

120
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,490
I understand you.

121
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,520
You are a good kid.

122
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,330
But you didn't know she would be like Bao Si.
 (T/N: famously beautiful but despised concubine that caused the downfall of Western Zhou)

123
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,200
Child, I've suffered this kind of loss too.

124
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,790
You like a girl when you are young.

125
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,150
Actually, you like what you imagined her to be, not who she really is.

126
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,020
When the dream is over,

127
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,390
I suffered and felt awful.

128
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,890
But all of this shall pass.

129
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,520
Come on, go fishing with me.

130
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,390
Let's go.

131
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,520
Uncle. Uncle.

132
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,920
- No.
- All of you move aside.

133
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,590
Y-Your back!

134
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,300
Stay calm. Be careful with your back.

135
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,750
Don't block me. Don't block me.

136
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,910
Don't get impulsive. Watch out your back.

137
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,300
You'd hurt your back.

138
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,430
Don't get impulsive.

139
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,960
- Don't get impulsive.
- Don't hold me back!

140
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,760
Be careful of your back.

141
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,500
Dad.

142
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,150
Why are you doing so early in the morning?

143
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,920
Aren't you ashamed to ask?

144
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,390
Great! I raised you for 20-some years, but didn't see

145
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,810
that you would be repaying kindness with revenge. I'm going to kill you!

146
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,520
Uncle, don't, don't!

147
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,040
Oh, goodness!

148
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,950
It's about Jiang Qianfan, right?

149
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,190
You know already?

150
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,160
Dad, we need to make this clear.

151
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,050
I'm not repaying kindness with revenge. I'm upholding justice!

152
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,110
Disgusting!

153
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,590
Upholding justice?

154
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,990
Upholding justice?

155
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,700
You are tearing down the bridge after you crossed the river.

156
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,320
You are smiling with hidden blades.

157
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,050
Dad, calm down.

158
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,260
I exposed a cheater. What did I do wrong?

159
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,700
What did Mr. Jiang cheat you?

160
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,740
What did he cheat you?

161
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,650
He was kindhearted to help us here. What's the result?

162
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,120
You set him up!

163
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,190
You are using a knife to pierce my heart. Don't you know?

164
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,370
Are you even human? Are you fit to have Lin as your surname?

165
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,520
If I'm not fit to use Lin as my surname? What should be my surname? I'll take Mom's surname!

166
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,360
Get out!

167
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,420
I can't afford to raise this white-eyed wolf.
 (T/N: means traitor)

168
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,120
This is not your home. You, get out!

169
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,770
I'll leave now!

170
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,990
Sister Yu! Sister Yu!

171
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,520
- Sister Yu.
- Xiaoyu!

172
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,560
- Uncle.
- Slowly. Slowly.

173
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,230
- Uncle.
- Get a cup of water.

174
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,240
Slowly. Slowly.

175
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,450
Who's that?

176
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,200
Hello. I'm a reporter from Chefs Circle.

177
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,720
Is Mr. Jiang at home? We have a few questions to ask.

178
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,790
Mr. Jiang isn't home!

179
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,100
Why did she hang up? What's going on?

180
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,600
It's previously arranged. What do we do?

181
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,460
Mr. Jiang, don't come home right now. Many reporters have shown up at the house.

182
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,770
Okay, got it.

183
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,420
Don't worry.

184
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,150
Hey.

185
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,890
Get some time to rest.

186
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,400
When you wake up, start training. Okay?

187
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,360
I'm hanging up now.

188
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,300
It appears that you don't think you will be disqualified from the competition?

189
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,210
Even if we're disqualified, we shouldn't stop training. Isn't that right?

190
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,920
I'm not concerned that you'll be in trouble.

191
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,170
I'm just afraid that, if you get into trouble,

192
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,200
you won't use the correct method to resolve it.

193
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,780
Go get busy.

194
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,470
You've come at just the right time.

195
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,130
Jiang Qianfan is holding a press conference.

196
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,060
What's the matter?

197
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,320
Who hit you?

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,520
Since you're kicked out,

199
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,820
you should sleep comfortably.

200
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,870
Treat yourself well.

201
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,070
When the press conference starts, remember to wake me up.

202
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,230
Fang Chun notified me to come.

203
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,640
- I didn't expect such a hard rain.
- Still haven't seen anyone.

204
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,100
A car is coming! A car is coming!

205
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,660
A car is coming!

206
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,000
Mr. Jiang!

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
- Mr. Jiang!
- Mr. Jiang!

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
Mr. Jiang!

209
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,310
Mr. Jing! Please answer our question.

210
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,170
When did you start losing your sense of taste?

211
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,690
Everyone, listen to me.

212
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,930
The rain is heavy. Let's go inside to talk.

213
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,800
- Mr. Jiang!
- Mr. Jiang!

214
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
Everyone, please come in.

215
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,620
Okay.

216
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,630
Put the umbrellas and raincoats over there.

217
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,360
Put your bags anywhere.

218
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,500
I've already notified my partner, Miss Quentin,

219
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,510
to hold the press conference to start in one hour, at 10 am.

220
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,560
Take it easy.

221
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,380
Elise,

222
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,950
change the press conference to be at my house. Tell everyone it's at 10 am.

223
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,790
Oliver, this won't do. I've already arranged some reporters who have a good relationship with us

224
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,190
to come to Yuxuan at three o'clock this afternoon.

225
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,290
I've already notified the staff to come to Yuxuan early.

226
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,220
You are too sudden in doing it this way.

227
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,570
It's too late. They are already waiting in the living room.

228
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,330
Hurry and come over.

229
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,520
Do you want to watch me change clothes?

230
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,400
No, it's not that.

231
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,210
I was going to ask you a question.

232
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,700
It's not necessary now.

233
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,560
I made some snack upstairs. I'll go get them.

234
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,040
I don't need you to appease them for my sake.

235
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,860
I'm not appeasing them.

236
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,670
Let's not discuss this topic. See you upstairs in five minutes.

237
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,790
- Are you teaching me how to cook now?
- Yes.

238
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,290
Oliver, what time is it now? Why are you acting rashly based on feelings?

239
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,860
You've made a mess of my plan!

240
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,450
So what that the media were at your front door?

241
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,680
Is it that hard to tell them to leave?

242
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,390
They are not reporters that you know. What if they report nonsense,

243
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,880
or deliberately smear you? What will you do?

244
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,250
[See you at 10 am]

245
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,040
How can Oliver do this?

246
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,830
Elise,

247
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,420
I know that you are anxious. But we are already at this point.

248
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,790
Don't get fired up by anything.

249
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,340
I'm sure Oliver has his reason to do it this way.

250
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,730
Besides, it's still raining outside.

251
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,530
Why did he become so thoughtful for other people?

252
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,090
Isn't this good?

253
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,750
No, it's not good for right now.

254
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,550
Junbin, please go out. I need to change.

255
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,710
Okay.

256
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,680
Calm down.

257
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,820
This situation now is best described

258
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,940
as "Enemy at the Gate."

259
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,960
I can't imagine if it were me,

260
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,660
could I still cook with steady hands now?

261
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,460
I would have already lost my composure.

262
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,060
But this man's hands are still steady.

263
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,520
His breathing is still stable.

264
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,020
It's like none of the trouble exists.

265
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,280
Is it because cooking has allowed him to forget the whole world?

266
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,800
Or, is he using cooking to calm himself down?

267
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,650
I don't know.

268
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,140
This is unique.

269
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,950
Let's take some background shots first.

270
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,140
- Here, come here.
- Come here.

271
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,210
The lighting is good here.

272
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,920
It's fine. I can do it myself.

273
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,580
The parking is full here. I'll go park the car.

274
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,400
Okay.

275
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,160
[Come out]

276
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,220
Elise is here. I'll go bring her in.

277
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,690
Go ahead.

278
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,590
- Come on in.
- I want to talk to you.

279
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,320
What is it about?

280
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,520
Please disappear. Don't come back until after the press conference.

281
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,640
Why?

282
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,750
To protect this secret from being known to others.

283
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,000
Oliver and I have been very cautious,

284
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,890
like stepping on thin ice, and have been fine with it.

285
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,220
Who would have known that you'd ruin it in the end?

286
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,160
- I-I didn't do it on purpose.
- Don't deny, Lin Kesong.

287
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,310
You clearly knew that Oliver lost his sense of taste.

288
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,560
You also knew that your sister and Boris have bad intentions.

289
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,820
But you still took Oliver to such a risky environment.

290
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,150
Have I accused you wrongly?

291
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,190
I didn't know Xiaoyu would do something like this.

292
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,190
The unintentional person is the most scary. The press conference today is really important.

293
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,550
I cannot allow any mistakes. It's not safe to have you here.

294
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,880
I am Mr. Jiang's apprentice.

295
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,770
If he doesn't tell me to leave, I'm not leaving.

296
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,640
Why?

297
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,970
Sorry.

298
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,120
What are you doing? What are you doing?

299
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,600
[Announcement: The press conference that was originally scheduled at 3 pm at Shanghai Yuxuan is moved up to 10 am at Mr. Jiang Qianfan's home.]

300
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
[We welcome media friends to attend.]

301
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,620
[We welcome media friends to attend.]

302
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,610
What?

303
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,660
Xiaoyu, wake up!

304
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,050
Hurry up!

305
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,000
Jiang Xianfan is being executed ahead of time.

306
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,850
Stop! What are you two doing?

307
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,960
Get up! Get up!

308
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,220
Don't fight anymore.

309
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,280
What time is it now? You're still fighting now?

310
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,860
Don't you know there are many reporters in the house?

311
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,500
Does this help Jiang Qianfan?

312
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,970
Give me the cellphone.

313
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,570
I'm going inside first to attract their attention.

314
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,520
You two come in quickly.

315
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,260
Sorry, I need everyone's attention, please.

316
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,060
I have a few things to say to everyone.

317
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,330
I am Mr. Jiang Qianfan's lead physician.

318
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,110
I am surnamed Xie. My name is Xie Junbin.

319
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,800
Qianfan's illness was just

320
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,820
diagnosed a few weeks ago by us.

321
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,670
But, because his illness progressed a little fast,

322
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,040
we haven't found an effective therapy to treat it.

323
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,600
Of course, I believe we will definitely cure him.

324
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,690
In a while, if you have any questions,

325
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,310
you can ask me directly, and I will answer each of your questions.

326
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,610
Thank you for your clothes.

327
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,890
Wait.

328
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,330
I'm sorry for just now.

329
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,770
I'm doing it for Oliver's sake. He is really having a hard time.

330
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,320
I should apologize to you, too.

331
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,870
I was too reckless just now.

332
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,820
I know that

333
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,320
you also wish the best for him.

334
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,430
You must feel bad too.

335
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,740
Yes.

336
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,560
I feel bad too.

337
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,980
Enough now.

338
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,790
I believe the person who harmed him will have a bad ending.

339
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,470
First, I would like to thank everyone for taking time out of your busy schedules

340
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,840
to come to this press conference.

341
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,130
I would like to clear some things up

342
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,800
with everyone.

343
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,500
I'm sure everyone's seen Boris' video.

344
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,280
Everything that Boris said in his video

345
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,990
is true.

346
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,530
I really can't taste what was added in the fried rice

347
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,700
or what the fried rice originally tasted like

348
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,830
because I lost my sense of taste a few weeks ago.

349
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,690
Next to me is my attending physician, Xie Junbin.

350
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,220
If you have any other questions about my condition,

351
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,720
you can consult him later.

352
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,830
I want to give my sincere apology

353
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,160
to everyone here and the public

354
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,710
for not telling you about my condition

355
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,400
in a timely manner.

356
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,130
I apologize.

357
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,980
If you have any questions, you can ask them now.

358
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,520
Mr. Jiang, Boris questioned your integrity. How do you explain this?

359
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,030
I'll explain. What is integrity?

360
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,710
For Yuxuan, it's to offer the best dishes and service to our customers.

361
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,000
In this aspect, whether it's London Yuxuan or Shanghai Yuxuan,

362
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,400
- I believe that we've always done our best.
- I don't agree with you.

363
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,940
What are the best dishes for Yuxuan?

364
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,710
It's to offer an innovative dish that can bring everyone a new taste experience.

365
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,640
Of course, this is Mr. Jiang's roots, but he's already lost his sense of taste.

366
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,920
How can he bring forth new innovative dishes? And how can he bring everyone a new taste experience?

367
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,120
In this respect, is there really no problem with your integrity?

368
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,110
As the saying goes, "What is a man good for if he doesn't tell the truth?"

369
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,800
Mr. Jiang, integrity builds the foundation of a human being, and it is also the foundation for an establishment to survive.

370
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,610
You said you would assume all responsibility of the consequences.

371
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,840
How do you intend to assume responsibility? Will you be able to assume all responsibility?

372
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,390
Mr. Jiang, did you lie to the public about anything else besides your loss of taste?

373
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,880
Boris claimed in his livestream that Yuxuan's new dishes for the quarter tasted terrible.

374
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,040
Is this also because of your loss of taste?

375
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,670
It's been said that you're not on good terms with Boris. Why is that?

376
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,910
Is it because of your lack of integrity?

377
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,840
Would you leave the food industry due to your lack of integrity?

378
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,190
The reporters are harder to deal with than you are.

379
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,890
Have you heard of piranhas?

380
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,290
They jump on you without hesitation

381
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,350
once they smell blood.

382
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,520
They're about to eat Jiang Qianfan up.

383
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,860
Are you done with your questions?

384
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,860
Are you done? If you're done,

385
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,880
I'll answer it all right here. I'm a very simple man.

386
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,070
I'd admit to everything I've done,

387
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,420
but I won't explain myself if it's something I didn't do.

388
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,380
In the fifteen years I've been in the food industry,

389
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,180
I've never disappointed anyone who's dined at my restaurant.

390
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:20,060
I respect my profession and every customer.

391
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,990
I've explained everything I needed to. It's your choice whether or not you believe me.

392
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,620
The press conference ends here today. Please leave.

393
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,590
- Mr. Jiang.
- I apologize, everyone.

394
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,190
That's all for the meeting today.

395
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,920
Please leave now. Thank you.

396
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,910
Mr. Jiang, please wait.

397
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,090
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.

398
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,470
I said all I needed to. I don't need to explain myself any further.

399
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,860
I'll explain for you if you won't.

400
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,060
Lin Kesong.

401
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,060
This is the food taste reference table Mr. Jiang asked me to fill out.

402
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,860
You can see that it includes the flavors of sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, salty, and savory.

403
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,360
Each flavor has an ingredient that marks the standard.

404
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,520
Whenever we encounter a new ingredient or flavor,

405
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,340
it'll be compared to the original ingredient and then given a value.

406
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,210
A taste table? Are you using this to prove that your sense of taste is exceptionally sensitive?

407
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,230
Ms. Lin, the final taste of a dish is a result of combinations.

408
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,760
If you can make dishes based on these simple values,

409
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,860
can't anyone be a chef, then?

410
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,120
Don't you think this is ridiculous?

411
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,140
Are you trying to tell us that being a chef is as simple as that?

412
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,010
First, my sense of taste is exceptional.

413
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:04,550
I can't say it's the best in the world,

414
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,640
but I don't think anyone here compares.

415
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,630
Second, I didn't show you this table to prove myself.

416
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:17,160
I'm telling you that even when faced with the greatest misfortune for a chef, he still didn't give up.

417
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,830
And that's all because of his love for food.

418
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,720
It's because of this table that you're looking down upon that he can maintain his standards.

419
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,960
Which one of you here can do that?

420
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,860
Even so, that doesn't change the fact that Mr. Jiang lied to the public.

421
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,310
What did he lie to you about?

422
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,500
- Did you eat a bad dish or what?
- Lin Kesong.

423
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,590
It's no use saying all of this. Why don't we show them?

424
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,020
Please give us a moment. Kesong,

425
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,140
come help me grab some things.

426
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,600
I have some ingredients here.

427
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,650
There are more in the fridge. Feel free to use whatever you want.

428
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:10,470
You're all food journalists. Some of you should know how to cook, right?

429
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,800
Choose one person among yourselves

430
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,450
to make a dish.

431
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,600
Lin Kesong and I will use this taste table

432
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,690
to duplicate the dish.

433
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:27,620
I'll admit defeat if I can't duplicate it. What do you say?

434
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,020
That's not a bad idea. I'll do it.

435
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,850
But I have to inspect the ingredients first, so I don't get tricked by you.

436
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,460
Sure.

437
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,160
They all look pretty normal.

438
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,390
Since there is both chicken and the seasoning for it here,

439
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,350
I'll make Kung Pao chicken. My family created a unique recipe.

440
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,180
You and Ms. Lin can't be here while I make it.

441
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,870
Of course.

442
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,500
I'll leave my phone on the dining table, so you know I'm not cheating. Kesong, let's go.

443
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,920
I think you're pretty impressive.

444
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,230
You put everyone in shock with your words.

445
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:46,960
You forced me to do so. You wouldn't tell them the truth, so I had to do it for you.

446
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,910
I was really frustrated by them just now. I never meant to lie to everyone.

447
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,870
But they accused me of lacking integrity

448
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,530
and questioned me like I was a criminal. Of course I wouldn't be able to stand it.

449
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,970
You're too stubborn.

450
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,940
It's fine now. I can go with your method.

451
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,500
- As long as you're not mad.
- Is there any use getting mad at you?

452
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,090
You do whatever you can think of. It's not like this is the first time it's happened.

453
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,700
It's my fault.

454
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,440
What?

455
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,810
It's my fault for spoiling you so much.

456
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,890
How are you still in the mood to joke around?

457
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:36,690
Do you think his Kung Pao chicken will be really difficult to duplicate?

458
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,560
Kung Pao chicken isn't really difficult to make.

459
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,520
But every family has their own special recipe

460
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,190
so it's hard to say.

461
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,790
Let's just go with the flow.

462
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,100
Brilliant!

463
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,210
How brilliant!

464
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,860
What's going on?

465
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,730
I was worried

466
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,330
Jiang Qianfan can simply copy it but this...

467
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,420
See how this guy turned the heat on high

468
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,600
and put the wok on top.

469
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,820
He stir-fried the ingredients for a while, then removed the wok from the heat source.

470
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,670
Then he did the same thing again.

471
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,530
Why did he do that?

472
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,940
If I'm right,

473
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,760
the temperature of his grandma's stove can't be controlled.

474
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,260
So they used this method to control the temperature.

475
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,590
she even taught him the techniques.

476
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,480
This way, the ingredients won't cook too fast

477
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,320
and absorb more flavor. Plus, the temperature difference

478
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,240
adds to the texture of the chicken.

479
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,260
How one cooks this dish determines the slight difference in texture.

480
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,040
Jiang Qianfan is in trouble.

481
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,300
It tastes pretty good.

482
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,200
If Jiang Qianfan is making this dish, I kind of look forward to it.

483
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,380
Yeah.

484
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,420
That's fine, I know it.

485
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,290
♫  Love is the food for the living heart  ♫

486
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,290
♫  Love is the food for the living heart  ♫

487
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,240
♫  Love  ♫

488
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:41,850
♫  Love is the food for the living heart  ♫

489
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:49,970
♫  Love is the food for the living heart  ♫

490
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,080
♫  Love  ♫

491
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,200
Try it.

492
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,310
♫  Love  ♫

493
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,420
♫  Love  ♫

494
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,720
Actually, when you turned the heat on high in the beginning

495
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,610
and remove the wok from the heat, I knew it would taste the same.

496
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,410
But I'm very curious, this is my grandma's unique way of cooking.

497
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,410
How did you figure it out?

498
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,910
I was able to replicate all aspects of your dish

499
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,250
because Ms. Lin has provided a very accurate flavor index

500
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,750
and level of firmness for the chicken.

501
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,540
Sure enough, there's the so-called inspiration.

502
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,900
But Mr. Jiang, here's the question.

503
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,560
You've replicated the dish.

504
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,770
Now what's your take on the flavors?

505
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,910
Yuxuan Restaurant can't stay in business by replicating others' dishes.

506
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,950
Right?

507
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,200
Of course not.

508
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,690
This

509
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:40,050
is my take on the flavors.

510
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,920
Mr. Jiang, you really didn't have to let the public know you've lost your sense of taste.

511
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,420
You are too skilled.

512
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,380
Losing your sense of taste didn't affect you at all.

513
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,780
I deeply apologize for having said things that question your integrity.

514
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,920
I take them back.

515
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,960
You've won. From now on,

516
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,980
I've a fan of

517
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,450
yours and your Yuxuan Restaurant.

518
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,150
Thank you.

519
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,320
Okay, we have prepared a simple meal for everyone

520
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,920
as a token of appreciation. Everyone has worked hard. Thank you.

521
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,310
Thank you.

522
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,000
That's great.

523
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It was actually a happy ending

524
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,730
if it didn't have anything to do with me

525
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,660
my eyes would have already been welded up with tears

526
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,140
Do you have a backup plan?

527
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,080
That's you.

528
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,550
Boris, you really have let me down.

529
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,550
I finally understand why you taught me anger and hate

530
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,130
because you are useless

531
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,140
only when useless people meet a stronger opponent

532
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,540
do they present their hatred and anger

533
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,510
Are you talking about yourself?

534
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,760
I am of course different from you.

535
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,980
Although I have anger and hatred,

536
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,510
my opponent isn't stronger than I am.

537
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,070
It is just the unfairness of life.

538
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,830
Even if it weren't for you

539
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,560
I would still have the means to deal with Lin Kesong.

540
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,950
That is great.

541
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,690
If you win, that means I have won too.

542
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,950
As for how you see me

543
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,210
I do not care

544
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:09,280
because you are merely one of my chess pieces.

545
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,120
Sorry to disappoint

546
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,670
but you are also just one of my chest pieces as well

547
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,240
Please leave.

548
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,840
On what grounds?

549
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,070
This is my place.

550
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,370
Because I have to practice, if you don't leave, I will not practice.

551
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,910
You are truly hard-hearted.

552
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:37,460
As long as you win, you can do whatever you want.

553
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,410
Why are you sitting there sighing?

554
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,550
You are here so early.

555
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,390
Have you seen the press conference?

556
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:00,530
I couldn't stay at home after what happened.

557
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,950
Yes, I watched it, watched it on the way here.

558
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,200
Have you seen the group chat? They are all talking about this.

559
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,360
Everyone feels like Yuxuan will be affected by this.

560
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,560
Really? I haven't read the group chat, I will go read it now.

561
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,890
Yes, it has already been a month

562
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,060
But at the end of it, the dishes for the new season hasn't even been created

563
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,840
it wouldn't be like that If Mr. Jiang sense of taste was still working.

564
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,620
Without the new dishes

565
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,240
we will have no chance of getting 3 stars this year.

566
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,950
Will the business be affected as well?

567
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,990
That is enough, that is enough, all of you should hold your tongue.

568
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,680
You have all seen Mr. Jiang performance today

569
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,850
It can only be described as brave. What is there to worry about?

570
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,310
[I have absolute faith in Mr. Jiang, even if we ran into some issues.]

571
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,360
[It is momentarily, if we stand together, we can get through this.]

572
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,620
You are actually worried too, aren't you

573
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,220
I just hope that Mr. Jiang

574
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,940
can quickly come up with the dishes

575
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,580
only like that will everyone still have a little bit of confidence in this restaurant

576
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,980
Don't worry.

577
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,380
It will get better.

578
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,470
The committee has already reached a decision.

579
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,760
I asked you all to come over

580
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,540
as I know that you are the ones who are most concerned about the conclusion.

581
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,460
Boris,

582
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,490
can you stop pretending not to care?

583
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,320
Before I announce the result

584
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,720
I want

585
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,140
the two of you

586
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,410
to each pick one.

587
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,800
[Eight Tael]

588
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,020
[Half a Kilo]

589
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,800
I am heavier than you

590
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,780
In the Chinese weight system,

591
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,130
one kilo is 16 taels, half a kilo is 8 taels, who is heavier than the other?

592
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:18,130
♫ You are the stranger I want to know ♫

593
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,900
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

594
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,160
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

595
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,390
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

596
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,370
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

597
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:40,530
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

598
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:46,240
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
