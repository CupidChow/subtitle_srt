9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,010
Thank you all for being here.

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,010
Everyone is here.

11
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,160
Everyone worked together and helped Yuxuan go through its rock bottom.

12
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,550
Now we are getting reservations back. But it will take a long time before we get on the right track.

13
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,890
We must be prepared for a drawn-out battle.

14
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,280
With you guys, I believe Yuxuan will have a bright future.

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,780
Xiao Pa, you made the right choice.

16
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,300
Your potential will only reach the maximum in a team.

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,640
You need Yuxuan and Yuxuan needs you.

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,180
Da Mai. With you in charge of the back kitchen, I am reassured.

19
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,500
You once said, Mr Jiang is your idol.

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,880
The best way to pay tribute to your idol is to become them.

Zhou Zhou. Zheng Zhong.

22

You two make great partners of Da Mai and you complete him.

23
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,240
Thank you for your loyalty to Da Mai and Yuxuan.

24
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,530
Keep up the good work.

You once complained that germophobia is one of your burdens.

27
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,650
However, this burden became a blessing here at Yuxuan. Thank you.

28
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,370
Yuxuan will forever be your home.

29
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,160
Everyone of you. No matter where I go, I will remember you.

30
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,830
Today and forever. I will count on you for everything.

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,530
I'm proud to call you my colleagues.

32

Why did Miss Quentin sound like she was saying goodbye?

I have no idea.

36
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,440
She gave us so many compliments.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,370
I don't know and dare not to ask.

38
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,350
Is she going back to London?

39
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,680
It's possible.

He's in pain!

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,520
I just checked the security footage. He took them.

We are going to the hospital now.

He's not in great condition. You need to be prepared.

- Sorry to disturb you so late at night.

106
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,850
I really don't know whom to turn to.

107

Turning to me is the correct choice.

108
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,750
I'm not sure if this is okay. Please check it for me.

109

Please have a look.

110
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,650
Dear friends,

111
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,980
our executive chef, Mr. Jiang Qianfan,

112
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,470
attempted to find a cure for his loss of taste and smell himself.

113
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,350
He is now in a coma and in critical condition.

114
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,780
The hospital is trying to save his life.

115
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,080
If you love him, please pray with us

116
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,460
for him to survive this.

117
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,490
It's very well-written.

118
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,190
Thank you. That's good.

119
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,660
We will post it to The Star's website immediately.

120
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,000
Okay.

121
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,930
There's one more thing I need to talk to you about.

122
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,450
The eulogy for Qianfan.

123
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,690
I know this might be too cruel.

124
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,630
But I am really worried that

125
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,810
you can't think because you would be too sad.

126
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:26,300
I did come up with one line that sums him up perfectly.

127
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,290
He is a gift

128
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,340
sent from heaven.

129
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,890

130
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,940

- I'll go too.

What can we do?

Qianfan will be okay.

find a place to rehydrate?

170
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,490
Hey, Victor.

171
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,590
Victor!

172
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,760
Hello?

173
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,290
What's wrong?

174
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,800
Tell me. What's going on?

175
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780
Nothing.

176
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,780
Is it about your sister?

177
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,660
How did you know?

178
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,640
After meeting you, I often watch news about the Chef's circle news.

179
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,890
Someone reported that Yuxuan Restaurant is changing the person who operates it.

180
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,340
I... What's the situation? Tell me about it.

181
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,320
Okay, then don't tell me.

182
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,590
But... your sister is a good person. Right?

183
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,560
Of course.

184
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,910
So, what is there to worry about?

185
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:24,100
Victor, I've made mistakes too. Big mistakes.

186
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,920
The type of mistake that I don't want to talk about at all.

187
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,170
But I still got through it. Your sister will definitely get through it.

188
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,380
You need to believe in your sister. Believe in me.

189
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,890
If you believe me, smile then.

190
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,470
I can't smile.

191
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,430
If you can't smile, then cry.

192
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,550
That's right. Together, we'll wait for sister to return.

193
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,090
Whose little cutie is this?

194
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,870
Who are you? Why are you here?

195
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,450
Let me introduce. This is Chu Ting, my boss.

196
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,170
- From now on, when you see each other, call her sister.
- What?

197
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,700
My friend's dog gave birth. Gave birth to five.

198
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,050
I brought one here. Do you like it?

199
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,320
You want to raise him?

200
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
His neck has the answer.

201
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,680
[Chu Ting, can I pursue you again?]

202
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,890
So... your answer?

203
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,550
No.

204
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,610
Why?!

205
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,380
I should be asking you why.

206
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,190
You... why do you want to court me?

207
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,940
That's simple. Because I like you.

208
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,740
I'll give you one more chance. Start over.

209
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,560
Okay. I'll say it seriously.

210
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,010
Actually, in the beginning when I said that I like you,

211
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,870
it's because I felt that you are good in many aspects. But later I realized that

212
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,870
you have more soul than I imagined.

213
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,690
You know six, seven languages, able to manage

214
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,500
and know fashion design. Actually, I thank God for allowing me to have this opportunity.

215
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,920
I experienced life's low point, and arrived here to understand you

216
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:28,110
Actually, you always had this strength. I just didn't realize it.

217
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:32,660
Chu Ting, now in my eyes,

218
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,640
you shine.

219
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,680
Okay. I have a second question.

220
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,250
This little cutie that you're giving me, I really like it.

221
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,830
But because you want to pursue me, you have to raise this small life.

222
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,180
It's a big responsibility. Have you thought of that?

223
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,250
I thought about it. I thought about it thoroughly.

224
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,150
I tell you his name. It's Abu Jr.

225
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,990
How did you know?

226
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,600
Actually, this period I almost became an expert in digging up the past.

227
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,650
I browsed everything on your Weibo, WeChat Moments, Net Ease Cloud Music,

228
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,280
and Qzone, Renren and Xiaonei networks.
(T/N: Social networking websites in China)

229
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,860
I discovered that you used to love doing animal-related charity, old donations.

230
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,480
Because you had a dog last time, which was also a husky, right?

231
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,700
He accompanied me for 16 years. When I grew up, he passed away.

232
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,020
Hasn't he returned? Right? Abu.

233
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,960
When I first saw him, I felt that they are extremely similar.

234
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,030
Previously I browsed all your stuff because I wanted to understand you better initially.

235
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,270
But I later realized that you're even better than I imagined.

236
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,900
So I looked all night.

237
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,590
I looked through all of your things.

238
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,600
Why do I have a kind of unhappy feeling?

239
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,860
Like there's someone staring at me from behind.

240
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,920
What do you mean there's someone staring at you? I want to court you, so of course I need to put in effort seriously.

241
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,650
Understand you more.

242
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,980
That's more like it.

243
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,490
Then... your answer?

244
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,920
If you want to court me, then court me. It's not like I can stop you.

245
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,010
It's no use even if you want to stop me. I have a helper. Right, Abu?

246
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,790
Boss.

247
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,990
-Finished eating? Leaving?
- I'm leaving.

248
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,250
When you have time, come again!

249
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,040
Only these few words you are writing them for so long until now?

250
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,920
Blu, you are finally here.

251
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,330
Xiaoyu waited for you for a long time.

252
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,710
Dad! Who said I was waiting for him?

253
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,200
Okay, take your time chatting.

254
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,670
Eh

255
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,180
Xiaoyu, is there anything that you want to say to me?

256
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,460
Are you leaving?

257
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,300
Yes, I'm returning to Canada.

258
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,350
You're already leaving. Why are you still looking for me?

259
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,850
Go with me.

260
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,290
Go with you? What about my restaurant? Leave it?

261
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,590
That, but I'm already set on you.

262
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,090
I already told my mom and dad. They want to meet you.

263
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,700
If you don't go, then what do I do?

264
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,660
Xiaoyu, if you want to go, then go. I'll watch your restaurant.

265
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,680
Don't dawdle anymore.

266
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,020
No, Dad! Won't you miss me?

267
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,460
Thank you, Uncle Lin. No, Father Lin.

268
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,660
Xiaoyu, do you agree?

269
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,790
It's settled. Blu, this silly boy.

270
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,320
Controlled by Xiaoyu.

271
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,250
How is it, Qianfan? Can you see?

272
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,330
Look at you, you've became skinny.

273
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,570
It's okay. I'm back.

274
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,790
Victor.

275
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,960
Elise, how are you?

276
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,270
Don't worry. I'm doing very well.

277
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:12,360
Mama. Sorry, I made you worry.

278
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,430
Thank you for flying over. Thank you very much.

279
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,880
I slept better instead when I'm inside.

280
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,200
I think your complexion is much better than it used to be.

281
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,830
- Thank you, Junbin.
- With me, don't say thank you.

282
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,660
Once I'm in Transylvania, it will be difficult for us to meet.

283
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,430
So, I must say thank you.

284
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,930
I just don't know how to repay you.

285
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,650
After I leave, I will write to you.

286
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,950
Write letters? That's too much trouble.

287
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,350
Here.

288
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,820
He sold his car to me. Very cheap. The price of one plane ticket.

289
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,000
- Plane ticket?
- That's right. He also bought a plane ticket to Transylvania.

290
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,530
He bought a clinic. He's going to keep you company there.

291
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,570
Thank you, Junbin!

292
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:11,210
Jiang Qianfan wrote a letter of forgiveness for Elise. Because her actions didn't have terrible consequences,

293
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,990
and because she showed remorse,

294
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,260
after being detained for a short time, Elise was allowed to leave.

295
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:25,620
Doctor Xie went with her to a small town in Europe.

296
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:38,650
♫  Love is the food for the living heart  ♫

297
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,180
It's done.

298
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,580
It's just normal tomato scrambled eggs?

299
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,730
Yes. It's just normal tomato scrambled eggs.

300
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,450
You're acting kind of weird today.

301
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,200
You didn't try to teach any lofty concepts, and you didn't try to create a new dish either.

302
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,520
Are you saying I used to nag too much?

303
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,360
Okay. I admit. I used to nag too much.

304
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,120
And oftentimes, when I tried to be creative for the sake of being creative, it was actually counterproductive.

305
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,190
We can tell by looking at this normal tomato scrambled eggs dish. Actually, the most common recipe for this dish

306
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:17,860
is already perfect. There's no need to do something new with it just so I can put my name on it.

307
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,630
Alright. Here, try it.

308
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,670
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

309
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,450
♫ Only for you ♫

310
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,350
I added just the right amount of sugar.

311
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,810
Right?

312
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,010
♫ From the other world ♫

313
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:43,250
♫  I will do silly things for you  ♫

314
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:50,380
You didn't mishear. I said, I added just the right amount of sugar.

315
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,940
You can taste again?

316
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,540
Just sweet things.

317
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,770
♫ Listen to your heart ♫

318
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:07,150
Alright, silly. What are you doing?

319
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,120
He lost his sense of taste starting with sweet, and he began to regain his sense of taste starting with sweet too.

320
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,890
It turns out God heard my wish.

321
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,890
His sense of taste has slowly started to recover.

322
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:24,350
I didn't tell him that my sense of taste was never again as sensitive as it once was.

323
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,620
Especially towards sweet things.

324
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,710
But I don't feel like I lost anything.

325
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,600
As long as I have him, that's enough.

Hi Uncle! Hi Aunty!

329
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,120
This is what Yuxuan Restaurant looks like today.

330
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,360
Don't mess around!

331
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,780
Fans, please look forward to

332
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,970
Jiang Qianfan's thank-you party.

333
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,060
Everyone. It's my fault that

334
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:20,010
Yuxuan has not had any desserts. Here, I'd like to apologize to everyone.

335
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,350
During this period of time, we've gone through many things together.

336
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:32,460
And I've gone to the brink of death and back.

337
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,780
Because of this, I've come to understand many things.

338
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:43,860
I shouldn't place myself between our dishes and our guests.

339
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,610
Instead, I should be a part of our dishes.

340
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,550
Because making our guests happy through our food

341
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:55,760
is the biggest accomplishment for a chef.

342
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,140
So today, I'm very happy to announce that

343
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,610
Yuxuan's history of having no dessert ends here.

344
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,990
Great!

345
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,780
In the past, I always avoided sugar.

346
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,910
Any kitchen that I was in would not have sugar in it.

347
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,230
But now, I understand.

348
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,990
Sugar has always been with me.

349
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,490
It's always been there.
