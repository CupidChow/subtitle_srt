00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,060
- You'll know when you see it.
- Okay.

10
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,090
Brother, I'm here.

11
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,960
You're on time today.

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,220
When am I not on time?

13
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,000
Director Song, what would you like to drink?

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,060
Soda.
(TN: Literally "Happy Junk Food Water")

15
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,310
Give him a glass of water.

16
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,610
All right.

17
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,640
This final game is such a classic. I've been thinking about this for days, but still can't figure it out.

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,300
Take a look.

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,020
Brother, I definitely won't figure anything out if you can't even do it.

20
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,650
You know that I can't do things that require me to exercise my brain.

21
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,010
Wouldn't you have to exercise it harder if it got rusty? Come on, go ahead.

[General]

23
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,480
Bad move. You have no brain.

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,380
Brother, you know I have no patience for chess.

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,830
Ran Ran, you're an adult already.

26
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,200
You can't be so short-tempered anymore. It's time for you to work on controlling your temper.

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,390
It's not like you don't know that I hate playing chess.

28
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,970
Brother, if you have any advice for me before leaving, just say it. Let's not waste our time on this.

29
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,340
Do you think chess is for fun and games?

30
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,570
Chess is a game for two.

31
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,360
Neither one of us can play alone.

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,320
We can only improve if we play together.

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,800
I think you've forgotten what Dad told us.

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,820
Brother.

35
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,660
Brother, I didn't forget, but I really can't do it.

36
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,200
Look, you're smarter and more competent than me.

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,220
You are meant to make the big bucks,

38
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,850
while I make a bit of pocket money. Don't we complement each other perfectly?

39
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,930
Are you done packing for Shanghai?

40
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,490
There's not much for me to pack.

41
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,070
We're playing the long game in trying to expand to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.

42
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,690
And Bellagio is cooperating with Suning. A big move within a long game.

43
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,490
To do well, replace and upgrade. The company's headquarters will move to Shanghai too.

44
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,690
Aren't you worried that I'll ruin your plans if this is that important?

45
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,450
I'm glad you know yourself well. If Chu Ting wasn't moving to Shanghai,

46
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,170
I wouldn't have arranged for you to go to Shanghai.

47
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,300
I just thought that it's not easy for you to meet such a great girl like Chu Ting,

48
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,710
so you must not flirt with other women when in Shanghai.

49
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,280
- Treat her well—
- Brother, wait.

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,210
So you were thinking of me as one of your chess pieces when you introduced Chu Ting to me?

51
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,680
Are you still not satisfied?

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,250
Ran Ran, you've been with many girls since you were young.

53
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,290
I never said anything about it,

54
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,140
but you're grown up now. It's time for you to settle down.

55
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,570
Brother, you're right.

56
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,630
But now that you said that, you've changed my bit of feelings for Chu Ting

57
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,780
into a bad feeling. I don't even really want to see her anymore.

58
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,820
Enough. Treat Chu Ting like how I treat your sister-in-law.

59
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,530
Ran Ran, treat Chu Ting well. Don't let me down.

61
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,830
Kesong, I apologize for earlier. I got there late.

62
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,930
- It's all right.
- First of all, it's because we're extremely busy at the restaurant.

63
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,110
Second of all, there's way too much traffic in Shanghai.

64
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,520
I'm worried that you'll be nervous. We're surrounded by tall buildings.

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,940
I'm not nervous.

66
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,230
We're just about to drive across the Garden Bridge of Shanghai.

67
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,530
It's very famous.

68
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,000
Look ahead. Do you see the tall building over there?

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,760
The round, tall tower is the Oriental Pearl Tower.

70
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,400
It's also very famous.

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,510
My parents quickly agreed to me going to Shanghai to broaden my horizons because my uncle is here.

72
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,610
Would you tell your parents what your real intentions were?

73
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,500
Anyway, I didn't.

74
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,550
This is the first time I'm traveling away from home alone. The first time I'm traveling alone to a completely new place.

75
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:26,080
Although I am a bit nervous, I feel that even if everyone around me is a stranger,

76
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,060
I'll still take this unfamiliarity as happiness because you're here.

77
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,220
If I didn't like you, I would probably never have been so brave.

78
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,230

Of course! Don't you know who runs the restaurant?

99

It's because our restaurant's food is clean,

Come on in, Kesong. Take a look around the room.

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,070
This is Xiaoyu's bed and that's yours.

- This is my bed?
- What do you think? Is it okay?

127
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:21,250
Of course, it is. I'm super satisfied being able to have my own little room in Shanghai.

128
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,300
That's great to hear, but such a great thing doesn't exist in the world.

129
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,920
Get ready and go down to help in five minutes.

130
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,250
Uncle, can I not help in the kitchen? It's terrifying in there!

131
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,410
Child, show some courage.

132
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,000
Remember…

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,470
I thought I finally had a chance to get closer to Song Yiran after I arrived in Shanghai,

134
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,830
but I didn't expect even after I thought of over 100 different possibilities,

135
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,080
I would be met with 101 answers.

136
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,980
Fate arranged for me to get further and further away from Song Yiran,

137
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,350
and closer and closer to Jiang Qianfan.

138
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,910
So the fever further damaged my nervous system?

139
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,000
That's right.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,100
At least the diagnostic was the same as six months ago.

141
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,940
And there's currently no effective treatment. You can only depend on medicine.

142
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,610
How much longer do I have?

143
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:32,720
You are worrying too much. Your illness, at least so far, is not life-threatening.

144
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,390
Loosing my sense of taste...

145
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,280
is more cruel than losing my life.

146
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,370
What I mean is...

147
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,440
how much longer until I completely lose my sense of taste?

148
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,990
It's hard to tell right now.

149
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,410
It took you 183 days to lose your ability to taste sweetness.

150
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,260
I'm afraid it may take less time for your to lose your second sense of taste.

151
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,500
This may not be the worst.

152
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,550
The worst, according to the report...

153
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,570
All of the nerves responsible for your five senses show signs of degeneration.

154
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,400
So not knowing the cause...

155
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,170
is not the worst part?

156
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,150
I'm sorry Qianfan.

157
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,860

Since we can't find the cause of the problem at this time,

168

- Balsamic vinegar.
- Of course, I know that it's balsamic vinegar.

Yes.

184

Don't you know that balsamic vinegar is made from unfermented grape juice? Don't you know that it needs to be aged?

We have grade 5A Matsutake mushrooms from Chuxiong. They are very fresh.

What?

Shipped all the the way from China's southwestern region?

198

Forget it.

199

I only eat food that is freshly picked within 30 minutes.

200

This Matsutake was expedited by air.

201
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,060
Additionally, Mr. Jiang invented a unique method to keep the mushrooms fresh.

202
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,810
The freshness is on par with that of freshly picked ones,

203
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,420
but they only come in a limited amount.

If you want Mr. Jiang to personally cook for you, you need to make a reservation.

Of course, he wouldn't use his name for a reservation.

Where's the sauce?

225
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,930
You have 30 seconds to get me the sauce before the lamp chop cools downs, or you're going to eat it.

Okay. I'll go get it right away.

- Coming! Here's the sauce!
- Here it is.

Mr. Jiang.

229
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,950
This is fermented tomatoes?

230
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,360
Yes. I used fermented tomatoes to replace balsamic vinegar. Is that all right, Mr. Jiang?

231
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,000
The fermented tomatoes give a savory taste. The sourness after fermentation will bring balance to this dish.

232
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,650
I like this adjustment. Good job!

the time it took to receive the Michelin three-star rating was

240

late by a whole year. This restaurant

241

the use of this ham is acceptable,

249

I will let you come in.

317
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,870
Of course, I will come again!

318
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,450
I am in Shanghai for the next three months.

319
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,950
I won't be the only one causing you trouble.

320
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,860
My apprentice will also target your apprentice!

321
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,970
Your apprentice? When did you get an apprentice?

322
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,220
Is that really important?

323
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,020
What matters is that I will defeat you!

324
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,260
What do you mean?

325

The Future Star Culinary Competition.

326
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,490
I'm one of the mentors. I even asked Thomas.

327
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,200
He said he will invite you. You didn't know?

328
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,250
Your nose is itchy?

329
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,060
Go home now. You should take your medication.

330
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,650
What medication?

331
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,350
Aren't you allergic to pine nuts?

332
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,530
I didn't eat pine nuts.

333
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,030
You couldn't detect that I used pine nut oil for the mayonnaise?

334
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,390
You are crazy! You even used pine nut oil?

335
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,790
I advise you to stop competing with me. It won't do you any good.

336
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,700
Don't be too happy with what you said. If you don't participate in Future Star Culinary Competition,

337
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,200
I will mock you 24 hours a day online!

338
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,210
Hey, hold on!

339
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,000
You look adorable. Your fans will like this.

340
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,540
That was a close call.

341
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,220
What's going on with the Future Star Culinary Competition?

342
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,930
Let's chat in private.

343
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,580
Thomas sent someone to deliver this yesterday.

344
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,330
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

345
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,710
You know your own situation.

346
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,300
How can you be a mentor with you losing your sense of taste?

347
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,950
Mentoring is based on experience. What's the problem with this?

348
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,620
More importantly, Boris was here today to provoke me.

349
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,320
I can't turn down this mentorship.

350
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,260
Boris was here with bad intentions. Are you sure you can defeat him?

351
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,380
Montgomery said that Boris will always lose to himself.

352
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,530
Fine. You know Boris.

353
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,180
You know what he's here for.

354
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,810
He won't give it a rest if he doesn't achieve his goal.

355
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,520
Come in!

356
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,860
How did it go?

357
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,830
Liang She Hotel refuses to provide any information about their employees, including Song Yiran.

358
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,100
You didn't find anything then?

359
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,740
Not really.

360
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,430
When I sent Lin Kesong back to her dormitory, I contacted the manager of the dormitory.

361
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,090
She said that when she moved out, she refused to give any way of contacting her.

362
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,470
She also said that she registered for marriage.

363
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,480
What did you say?

364
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,250
Registered for marriage and preparing for the wedding.

365
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,950
Is this a joke?

366
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,720
It has only been a few days. How is possible?

367
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,920
I'm not very sure too. Anyway, this is what they told me.

368
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,980
Are we talking about the same person? Did you make a mistake?

369
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,620
This young girl,

370
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,110
it's not surprising that whatever she does, she's too extreme.

Hello, Older Brother.

I'm here. I arrived earlier.

375
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,670
I was just sleeping.

376
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,570
I haven't eaten yet.

Don't worry. I will start work punctually tomorrow.

Okay.

I haven't figured out when to tell him that I'm in Shanghai.

384
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,480
Seems like this is the best opportunity now.

What's up?

387
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,880
Do me a favor, okay? Cook a meal for Song Yiran.

388
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,360
He's hungry and just texted me.

389
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,050
Are you tired?

00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,120
Go to sleep.

Think on behalf of my love.

He's in a crisis now and could even think of me.

This clearly means he still has me in his heart, right?

At this moment,

395
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,020
if I deliver a hot and caring meal to him,

396
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,470
he will understand who treats him best in this world.

397
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,300
A friend in need is a friend indeed, right?

398
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,590
I will achieve my goal of coming to Shanghai then.

My favorite shampoo is almost out.
