[Episode 28]

9
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,140
Champion Quentin's three dishes from the Future Star Culinary Competition, try it.

10
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,140
Wow.

11
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,540
Sir, please enjoy.

12
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,810
Okay, I'll not stand in ceremony then.

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,210
Xiao K, what are you doing?

14
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,570
Xiao K, you are buying snacks again?

15
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,840
Teacher, Teacher, Xiao K is secretly eating in class again.

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,270
Xiao K, if you eat snacks in class again, then ask your parents to come to the school.

17
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,710
You already conquered your guests, take your bike.

18
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,810
Didn't you say use food to exchange for the bike? In the end you didn't eat it at all. What do you mean by this?

19
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,000
I didn't ask why you smashed the car, you don't ask me why I'm not eating it, okay?

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,370
Nobody ever rejects the food I cooked. Unless you tell me the problem with these dishes.

21
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,190
Otherwise, I won't take this bike.

22
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,020
Don't be emotional like a child, okay?

23
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,420
Let me tell you,

24
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,130
I've never liked eating food since young, not even a little bit.

25
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,510
When we meet the next time, you will definitely not have a reason to reject me.

26
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,740
Xiao Pa, Ms. Quentin already told me. Today you will do the speaking at the front of the restaurant.

27
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,330
Accept it.

28
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,390
Thank you, Ms. Quentin.

29
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,570
I wanted to report it to you personally. Then I'll just say it directly here.

30
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,410
I recategorized our reservation list.

31
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,960
Our leader can bring the guests

32
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,330
who have the similar dishes on the reservation list to adjacent tables.

33
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,020
This way, during the dish serving process, our waiters

34
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,300
can lower the probability of interspersed paths.

35
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,450
Our dish serving process can be faster, and during the dish serving process,

36
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,360
we can avoid a lot of unnecessary risks. Of course,

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,760
we still have to consider the guests.

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,800
If the guest has a special table request,

39
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,390
then we need to take care of the guest's request first. That's all.

40
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,930
Xiao Pa,

41
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,230
you can find out the problem, and optimize your work.

42
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,460
You did very well. You are Yuxuan's pillar.

43
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,760
Thank you, Mr. Jiang. You flatter me.

44
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,990
I'm not flattering. You are.

45
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,770
Da Mai. You too.

46
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,350
Everyone of you are.

47
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,230
I treat all of you as the pillar.

48
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,490
To Yuxuan, everyone of you

49
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,930
are essential and cannot be replaced.

50
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,180
Da Mai, I read that article.

51
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,380
Sine you are the first to jump out and position yourself,

52
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,380
it means that you are already prepared

53
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,080
to bear the responsibility of the pillar.

54
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,060
All of you know,

55
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,050
to us, the most important task

56
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,640
is to get Michelin 3 stars.

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,490
After the evaluation of the Michelin guide ends,

58
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,820
Ms. Quentin and I will be devoting ourselves to preparation work of the third branch.

59
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,400
When the time comes, relatively speaking, the time that we spend in this branch will be much lesser.

60
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,650
Da Mai,

61
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,870
I hope you can truly be prepared

62
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,420
to bear the responsibility of being the pillar and maintain Shanghai Yuxuan's kitchen.

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,370
Mr. Jiang, don't worry. I will definitely not disappoint you.

64
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,050
I believe in you.

65
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,920
All of you need to work hard today too. Dismiss.

66
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,440
You're still awesome.

67
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,010
Who is it?

68
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,830
Me. Open the door.

69
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,880
Why did you come here? I cannot meet you. If there's anything, message me on WeChat.

70
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,650
No, what is going on? You didn't reply me on WeChat so I came here.

71
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,540
If you have anything, say it here.

72
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,190
Why? Did you do any shady things?

73
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,120
I don't care. Open the door, I want to go in.

74
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,430
Wait a while for me.

75
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,270
Old Lin, open the door, open the door.

76
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,040
What are you doing?

77
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,300
Oh my, wait, wait.

78
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,830
Why are you wearing a hat in the house? Balding?

79
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,980
Don't touch me. Can't I shield myself from the sun?

80
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,190
You haven't seen it before? I'm on training, if you have anything, say quickly.

81
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,800
Tomorrow afternoon I'll come and fetch you. We'll go to Wuzhen together.

82
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,080
On the way, I want to tell you some things.

83
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,860
I'm not going to Wuzhen. If you want to go, go yourself.

84
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Why? All the classmates told me you want to go back.

85
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,530
Okay. Help me to tell them, I can't go.

86
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,790
I'm going to compete soon. I need to prepare for the competition.

87
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,530
Okay, then.

88
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,080
D-Didn't you say you want to propose to Chu Ting? Did you?

89
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,170
Such a big thing, only now you thought of asking me? If you asked later, our babies will already be born.

90
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,630
Well...

91
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,590
I broke up with her.

92
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,250
Why?

93
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,320
You are really not going back to Wuzhen?

94
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,780
Not going back.

95
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,480
Let's go and eat later.

96
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Stop fussing. I already told you I have no time.

97
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,300
I'm running out of time.

98
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,920
Did a dog gnaw your hair?

99
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,880
So Old Lin, you are really not going out?

100
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,050
I'm not up to par like those people.

101
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,630
And I wasted too much time in the past.

102
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,480
I need to quickly make up for it. Now I think my time is very insufficient.

103
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,010
You treat yourself so ruthlessly now.

104
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,280
I'll never be as ruthless as Jiang Qianfan is to himself.

105
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,460
Besides, I'm competing with Xiaoyu

106
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,150
in the next competition.

107
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,960
I'm sure you know her skills.

108
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,760
Even if I practice for another 10,000 hours, I won't necessarily be her competition.

109
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,980
Besides, Jiang Qianfan said that the next competition are the semi-finals.

110
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,110
My clever tricks won't be of much use.

111
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,410
I have to work hard. Don't come to me so often anymore.

112
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,730
I don't think I'll be leaving the kitchen.

113
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,610
Give me a second. I'm almost done.

114
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:16,690
♫ I'm not on your menu even though, even though ♫

115
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,140
♫ I'll trace your shadow like a ghost ♫

116
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:33,510
♫ And I will find the delicious meal for myself, for myself ♫

117
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,620
It's done.

118
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,260
It's delicious.

119
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,800
♫  My hungry mind  ♫

120
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,710
No.

121
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,120
It's still not crispy enough.

122
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,600
There must be something wrong with how I set the oven.

123
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,300
Should I have set the temperature higher?

124
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,620
Wait for me here.

125
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,530
I'll make you another plate. This isn't good. Don't eat it anymore.

126
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,890
Wait. Sit down so I can tell you something.

127
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,180
What?

128
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,220
Jiang Qianfan told me that the Tanghulu is about me.

129
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,370
You found out?

130
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,120
I actually thought it over for a couple of days before coming here.

131
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,050
After all, we've been friends for ten years.

132
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,050
We may not be able to go back to the way things were once some words are said.

133
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,250
But I still want to tell you that I know about everything.

134
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,620
I'm so dumb. I never thought about our relationship like that before.

135
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,740
Can you tell me what you like about me?

136
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,260
Well.

137
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,510
I'm not sure myself.

138
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,100
I probably just think that you're silly and everything about you is great.

139
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,600
I also think that I'm silly.

140
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,500
I used to think that everything about me is great too.

141
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,680
I thought that everything I was doing made me a real man.

142
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,940
Yet I've achieved absolutely nothing in my life.

143
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,250
I don't mean it like that. Don't take it that way.

144
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,420
You don't have to comfort me.

145
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,410
I actually understand.

146
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,240
You've already let go of the feelings for me.

147
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,880
I want to say, it's good to let go.

148
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,660
Because the way I was

149
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,480
really isn't worth the present you to like.

150
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,600
Big Head.

151
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,980
Okay, I'm leaving.

152
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,520
Oh yes, Old Lin.

153
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,760
I really think you've become more beautiful

154
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,580
and better.

155
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,010
So much better than what I could imagine.

156
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,620
I thought the way you focused in the kitchen really looked captivating.

157
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,390
So, I've also decided to improve myself.

158
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,480
I want to see if the present you will like me once again.

159
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:58,290
I never expected our relationship would come to this stage.

160
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,030
I've let go of my secret crush.

161
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,980
He picked it up again.

162
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,600
If he didn't say it, I wouldn't have realized that all of this is already in the past.

163
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,900
There is no heartbreaking or deep pain.

164
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,980
But, why is that?

165
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,320
Is it because cooking is occupying all of me?

166
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,910
Or, is it because I have another companion here?

167
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,540
Great Chef Da Mai!

168
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,880
Old Bai, what is this weird place that you wanted to meet at?

169
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,710
Not Old Bai. It's me.

170
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,970
Boris?

171
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,420
I was meeting Old Bai here. Why are you here?

172
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,550
This is my territory.

173
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,370
I told him to set up the meeting with you.

174
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,120
At least you know yourself. You knew that I definitely wouldn't come if you tried to set up the meeting.

175
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,000
What do you want?

176
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,890
Let's go in.

177
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,380
Forget it. I don't have anything to talk to you. It can't be anything good when you want to see me.

178
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,610
Don't be so cold, Yuxuan's pillar.

179
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,700
When Jiang Qianfan saw that article, didn't he deal with you?

180
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,080
Do you think everyone is as narrow-minded as you?

181
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,390
Mr. Jiang is a lot better than what you think.

182
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,510
He's treating you okay, so you believe him now?

183
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,930
What else then, believe you?

184
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,670
No way I'd believe you.

185
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,980
At least I have the sense of taste.

186
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,860
I finally get it. You are only guessing.

187
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,990
You asked me to come so that I can help you

188
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,330
find the proof that Jiang Qianfan has lost the sense of taste.

189
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,940
Yes.

190
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,540
If it's a solid proof, I'll give you this sum.

191
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,300
Look, Boris.

192
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,850
If I help you knock down Jiang Qianfan,

193
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,390
I'll become a traitor.

194
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,210
Then I take your measly sum of money to live.

195
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,950
Are you stupid, or am I stupid?

196
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,610
Da Mai, why did you let Old Bai write that article?

197
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,120
Don't keep talking about that.

198
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,730
I just wanted to please myself. It's okay that I feel good.

199
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,130
It's because you feel insecure.

200
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,710
Nonsense.

201
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,140
I am Yuxuan's Head Chef. Why would I feel insecure? You're kidding.

202
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,810
You're afraid of being squeezed out by Jiang Qianfan, so you made the first move.

203
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,370
Look, Boris. I'll sum it up for you.

204
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,900
When Yuxuan gets the three stars, when Jiang Qianfan opens a new restaurant,

205
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,520
I'll naturally become Yuxuan's Executive Chef.

206
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,100
If he squeezes me out, who will he use?

207
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,600
He'll transfer someone from London.

208
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,190
No one understands Jiang Qianfan better than I do.

209
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,840
It's hard for him to trust anyone.

210
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,760
It's very difficult to get the position of Executive Chef in Shanghai's Yuxuan

211
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,320
unless you hold Jiang Qianfan's secret.

212
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,100
But if I give you the secret, will it still be a secret?

213
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,390
Yuxuan will definitely be impacted.

214
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,780
What will I get in the end?

215
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,030
I am Boris.

216
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,040
I have connections.

217
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,820
If Jiang Qianfan doesn't use you, I'll find people to help you

218
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,760
jump to an even better restaurant.

219
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,420
I deal with Mr. Jiang every day.

220
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,710
I believe his sense of taste is just fine.

221
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,150
Then, explain to me

222
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:15,610
what exactly happened with the Wagyu Sirloin and Red Crayfish dish?

223
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,220
It's late. Go on home.

224
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,140
You can work tomorrow.

225
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,310
That sounds so familiar.

226
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,850
Half a year ago, you used to tell me this a lot.

227
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,710
Time to go home.

228
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,900
I like it that you talk to me this way.

229
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,350
Then...

230
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,210
Let's go home.

231
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,900
Wait. Come.

232
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,410
Come. One, Two, Three. Go.

233
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,190
- Press it.
- Okay.

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,990
I really want to go back to the past.

235
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,420
Press it again.

236
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,180
Are you okay?

237
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,520
Just drive me home.

238
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,980
Okay.

239
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,590
No, it's not necessary.

240
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,460
I'll go home on my own.

241
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,530
What is the matter?

242
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,740
With this attitude from you, I'm already very content.

243
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,580
Thank you, Oliver.

244
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,600
But we can't go back to the past.

245
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,540
[Jun Bin,]

246
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,240
[I wanted to say it today,]

247
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,360
[I couldn't bring myself to say it. I thought, once I say it, I will not have everything anymore, my heart aches until I can't bear it.]

248
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,720
[Don't be hard on yourself. Everything is not as bad as you thought.]

249
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,080
You didn't get a full sleep?

250
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,910
I slept fine.

251
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,310
You're in a bad mood then?

252
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,060
No.

253
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,970
I know Song Yiran came.

254
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,510
Doesn't he come often?

255
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,380
Hey.

256
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,800
You are strange today.

257
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,200
- Turn to me. I want to see your face.
- What are you doing?

258
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,090
- I want to see carefully.
- Don't fuss.

259
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,650
I'll give you a gift to change your mood.

260
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,880
What gift?

261
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,560
Take it out.

262
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,260
My mom said I shouldn't randomly accept gifts from other people.

263
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,000
Your mom isn't here. Hurry and open it.

264
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,560
What is this?

265
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,210
I've put the card in for you. It's your new phone.

266
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,890
Is it for self-defense? It can't even access the internet!

267
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,810
Does the internet help your cooking?

268
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,700
No.

269
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,130
That's it then.

270
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,750
From now on, you only need to contact me.

271
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,830
Oh yes, also your parents.

272
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,650
Isn't this extreme?

273
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,660
I think it's just right.

274
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,410
You're so brain-dead.

275
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,750
Very good.

276
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,230
I still remember, just a month ago,

277
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,410
how she was stunned by Victor.

278
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,190
That's right. She's improved very fast.

279
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,810
Someday I'll definitely make him feel stunned.

280
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:47,390
Just wait. But you may have to wait quite a long time.

281
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,850
Good ambition. Good, I'll wait for how ever long it takes.

282
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,590
So pretty.

283
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,160
Here. Try it yourself.

284
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,890
I can make sashimi now.

285
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,770
Sashimi is a Japanese word.

286
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,720
But ever since the Zhou dynasty in China, people have been eating sliced raw fish.

287
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,010
The word Kuai in "Kuai Zhi Ren Ko" (food that is relished by everyone) means slicing the fish very thinly.
(T/N: Now it extends to mean popular)

288
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,300
You even know that?

289
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,290
Of course.

290
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,590
So that's what it meant.

291
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,670
So fresh.

292
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,310
The freshness that you taste

293
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,160
is actually the taste of the fresh fat.

294
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,840
Once the Channa Argus fish leaves water, the protein will immediately start to break down.

295
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,430
The fresh taste will gradually turn into the fishy odor.

296
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,570
The person who is eating will also turn from feeling pleasant to feeling unpleasant.

297
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,010
So amazing.

298
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,630
That's why the essence of the fresh taste is the energy of life.

299
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,510
Are other fresh foods the same too?

300
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,550
You can say that.

301
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,910
They're washed.

302
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,110
Very good.

303
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,580
Try it.

304
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,600
So fresh.

305
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,590
What do I do? I don't want to be a chef anymore.

306
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,010
I'll stay in this big tent.

307
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,390
Every day, after I finish eating in the tent, I'll go eat by the seaside.

308
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,550
After I finish eating by the seaside, I'll come back to eat in the big tent. I'll eat back-and-forth.

309
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,620
Won't you get bored in eating this way?

310
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,310
That's true. I don't want to be a prehistoric human either.

311
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,730
That's why a mature human like me invented cooking

312
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,990
in order to satiate hungry cats like you.

313
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,980
Learn cooking well, little friend.

314
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,220
Mature human, hurry and keep cutting.

315
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,110
- Does it taste good?
- Very good.

316
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:24,030
Tomatoes are already one of the best vegetables. The ones here are even better.

317
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,880
With this one bite, all the juice is in my mouth.

318
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,990
I don't know what you are saying.

319
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,940
Go. Let's go to the next place to take a look.

320
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,340
Go.

321
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,620
What is this?

322
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,470
This? Chicken Feet Peppers.

323
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,530
What about this?

324
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,550
Parrot Peppers.

325
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,360
And that?

326
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,640
Are you testing me?

327
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,100
It's called Zinnia, also nicknamed Higher Step-by-Step.

328
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,460
The world is huge.

329
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,440
I don't think I can finish exploring it in my lifetime.

330
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,230
I said the same thing before.

331
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,020
Exactly the same. I said it to my mentor Montgomery.

332
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,400
Actually, I'm often envious of you.

333
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,940
You get to experience new things every day.

334
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,750
Don't you have any, Old Grandfather?

335
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,430
Yes.

336
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,920
You.

337
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,470
But, I mean it.

338
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,160
I never know if you'll say something

339
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,080
that will make me die from anger.

340
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,040
But, in another instant, you'll resurrect me by making me happy.

341
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,170
♫  Nowhere I can hide  ♫

342
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,930
I think you actually anger me.

343
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,790
Is it because you were too mean before

344
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,810
that no one dares to joke with you?

345
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,650
Perhaps.

346
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,490
I know my stubbornness gives a lot of pressure to people around me.

347
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,390
After some time, it naturally becomes stagnant.

348
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,160
But you are different.

349
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,790
You never take what I say seriously.

350
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,350
every day, you open your claws and clamor.

351
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,620
At first you were very annoying.

352
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,520
But after a while, I've gotten used to

353
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,050
this noisy clamoring.

354
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,690
I'm not like this to anyone.

355
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,400
I've known Big Head for 10 years.

356
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,530
Even though I also fussed with him when I'm with him,

357
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,110
I've never been my true self.

358
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,350
I kept thinking

359
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,360
how to please him,

360
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,690
how to make myself look suitable at his side.

361
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,820
It's too exhausting.

362
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,140
I'll tell you a secret. Don't tell anyone else.

363
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,090
Okay. I won't tell.

364
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,620
I've let go of Big Head.

365
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,740
I don't know why, but

366
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,330
I don't seem to feel that sad

367
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,890
I actually feel relieved.

368
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:01,290
Maybe I don't like him as much as I thought.

369
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,530
Am I being bad?

370
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,460
Pretty bad.

371
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,290
What do I do then?

372
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,770
It's not true. I was teasing you.

373
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,100
But, I know that

374
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,490
when you meet the wrong person, it's an especially tiring feeling.

375
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,560
When the right person appears, the feeling should be

376
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,120
Should be how?

377
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,440
I don't really know. But at least...

378
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,940
not be a ferocious beast with fangs and claws.

379
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,160
- What are you doing?
- Say you're sorry.

380
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,070
- Say you're sorry.
- Sorry. Sorry.

381
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,840
Don't hit me. No more playing. No more playing.

382
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,540
No, no, no!

383
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,560
I'll beat you up!

384
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,680
Boris.

385
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,100
Come in.

386
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,350
Good morning.

387
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,170
Morning.

388
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,780
Coming to greet me so early in the morning,

389
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,820
there must be good news?

390
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,950
I want to discuss about something with you.

391
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,310
Breakfast?

392
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,280
I've eaten.

393
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,950
Vodka?

394
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,610
No drinking. Thanks.

395
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,030
Speak.

396
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,200
Do you want Xiaoyu to win?

397
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,190
If I withdraw, you'll have one less competitor.

398
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,100
Can you let go of Xiaoyu then, and don't force her to do what she doesn't want to?

399
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,780
Aren't you a naughty kid?

400
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,980
Have you said this to Old Huang?

401
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,620
Not yet. But I know if I ask him,

402
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,080
he will definitely support me.

403
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,180
I'm so sorry, kid.

404
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,190
I really don't think of you as an opponent.

405
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:33,500
If it's Victor, I could consider it.

406
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,850
Or, Lin Kesong.

407
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:42,160
I can tell you are humiliating me. But I won't keep a grudge.

408
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,130
You actually don't get angry?

409
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,230
You really have no sharp edges.

410
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,170
No wonder you have no presence.

411
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,970
Fine, Boris. Since you've told me how you feel about me,

412
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,230
I'll tell you what I think of you.

413
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,000
If I can be reborn, I can be anything,

414
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,750
but I don't want to be you.

415
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,750
I don't want to be a difficult person who has no friends.

416
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,410
I have sympathy for you, Boris. You are just like Salieri.
 (Antonio Salieri)

417
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,550
You lament that there is a Jiang Qianfan in the world,

418
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,650
but you can't be like him to cause Mozart's death.

419
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,170
Get out.

420
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,190
Fine. Bon appétit.

421
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,420
Get out!

422
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,890
Eat. Eat.

423
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,920
Did you get beaten down somewhere?

424
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,690
At Boris' place. I told him I wanted to withdraw from the competition

425
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,660
and asked him to let Xiaoyu go. He kicked me out.

426
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,310
Why didn't you discuss with me?

427
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,680
Xiaoyu isn't competing against you.

428
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,200
What's the use for you to withdraw?

429
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,760
I really couldn't think of a solution.

430
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,880
I'm afraid that Boris will ruin her.

431
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,450
I understand what you're thinking.

432
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,560
You can't see Xiaoyu take a fall.

433
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,440
The problem is that she needs to take a fall once.

434
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,550
After she falls, she'll then know she is wrong.

435
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,130
But, I don't want her to take a fall. It will hurt a lot.

436
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,230
If one can't withstand falling, one won't learn how to walk.

437
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,020
She already looks really scary now.

438
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,390
I'm afraid that she'll become even more extreme when she encounters setbacks.

439
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:25,230
We must think more about it.

440
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,290
If she is really like that, do you still like her?

441
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:32,820
I like her, but I want her to get better.

442
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,580
You are really a good kid. Hurry and eat.

443
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,800
After you finish, go make a bowl of it for me.

444
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,500
Sure.

445
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,090
Quentin's Spicy Shrimp,

446
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,460
matched with Sriracha sauce.

447
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,500
The flavors of food are either sweet, sour, salty, bitter, or spicy.

448
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,660
But you aren't interested in sour, bitter, and salty.

449
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,130
Additionally, you like eating oatmeal. So you definitely don't like sweets.

450
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,530
Your temper is fiery, so you must prefer spicy food.

451
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,440
If you can find fault with this dish, I will disappear immediately.

452
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,570
I don't like sweets.

453
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,870
Sure. I'm not a sweet person anyway.

454
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,760
Every day, I add the colorless capsaicin

455
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,370
into the oatmal. Okay now?

456
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,290
I indeed guessed it right. The usual Sriracha sauce

457
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:31,100
contains mainly chili peppers, sugar, vinegar, garlic. and salt.

458
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,670
I used my secret, exclusive ratios to remove the sweet flavor that you don't like.

459
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,000
And then used dried chili pepper to replace capsaicin.

460
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,040
During the process of cooking, the Maillard reaction and carmelization

461
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,290
released the flavors other than the spiciness.

462
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,940
- Other than that—
- That's enough.

463
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,860
Leave the dish here.

464
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,230
You can take the bike.

465
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,210
What do you mean?

466
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,640
Nothing special. You've made the dish.

467
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,990
I've repaired the bike. Just take it away.

468
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,730
You never eat. Are you playing me?

469
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,030
The day when you brought in the bike, I was indeed unhappy about you,

470
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,260
because I felt you didn't respect fixed-gear bicycles at all.

471
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,860
The day you wanted me to return the bike, I also indeed just wanted to trick you.

472
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,500
It's because I'm really not interested in eating.

473
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,370
I thought it was impossible for you to win. Later, I realized

474
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,570
you are really dedicated and persistent with cuisine.

475
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,540
You are truly capable and talented.

476
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,510
You've done what you should do. I'm convinced.

477
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,630
So our deal is completed. Take the bike away, and you don't need to come here again.

478
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,760
I don't care if you are interested in gourmet food. As long as you don't eat it,

479
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,200
it means I haven't reached the limit in the colors, flavors, and aroma.

480
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,770
Our deal isn't over yet.

481
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,550
Why are you so inflexible? Don't you think

482
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,070
needing to eat to live, isn't that a bug of humans?

483
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,000
If we spend the daily five hours of cooking,

484
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,470
eating, and washing dishes in innovating and creating,

485
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,470
the human beings could have already been having fun beyond the Milky Way.

486
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,090
In Chinese, good eating and liking to eat are the same two characters.

487
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,750
But if you spend too time on eating good food, it's being lazy from eating too much.

488
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,240
Why are you here again?

489
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,160
Go, go, go.

490
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,210
Boss doesn't want to see you. Leave.

491
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,650
Go, go.

492
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,320
- Here. Come again.
- Thanks.

493
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,540
I want this, this, and that.

494
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,940
Okay. Here.

495
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,410
Okay. Thanks.

496
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,430
- Hold it well.
- I don't want coriander.

497
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,590
Hello, Older Brother.

498
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,690
No, what did you say? Say it again!

499
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,980
No, what happened to my mom?

500
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:05,440
No. How is she now? Where did she get scalded?

501
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,590
Okay, okay, Older Brother.

502
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:15,480
You must get the doctor to save her. You must!

503
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,400
You...

504
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,190
What's that?

505
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,820
Are you Lin Kesong? Express delivery.

506
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,980
Mom and Dad sent something?

507
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,810
Are you Lin Kesong?

508
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,480
Okay.

509
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,250
What is it?

510
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,160
I don't know.

511
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,830
- Here, hold it well.
- Thanks.

512
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,800
Here. Take it slowly.

513
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,960
Thanks.

514
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,720
Go slowly.

515
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,090
I knew there's bamboo in here, there must be meat. See the ham?

516
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,790
You can make Yanduxian.
 (T/N: a flavorful soup made with ham, fresh pork, and fresh bamboo shoots)

517
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,800
These are specialties from our hometown.

518
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,730
They sent so many things.

519
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,080
What is this?

520
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,060
This one, too?

521
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:23,020
It's my favorite dish when I was a child. My dad always made a lot of it for me.

522
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,000
It's called Braised Mushroom Stems. So delicious.

523
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,830
You have a lot of favorite eats.

524
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:33,920
This one is my most, very most, really most favorite food to eat.

525
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,840
Try it yourself. It's really delicious.

526
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,530
But some people don't really like it. They just think

527
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,830
they are too salty.

528
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,330
Hello Mom.

529
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,910
My daughter, have you received the stuff?

530
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,220
I've received it.

531
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,260
That's good then. Your dad even reminded the Express Delivery

532
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,110
to put more blocks of ice inside so that hey don't spoil.

533
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,990
They are good.

534
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,580
How about it? Did Mr. Jiang eat any of it?

535
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,590
Let the professional give us some critique and suggestions.

536
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:19,060
My dad said to let the professional give him some critique.

537
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,070
Uncle and Aunt, the Braised Mushroom Stems are excellent. I can't find any flaws.

538
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,890
It's good that you like eating them.

539
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,780
The mushroom stems taste better when they're cooked on the spot.

540
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,140
Once you've eaten them, you'll know how to make them. Laster, please make them for Kesong.

541
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,610
What are you doing? Didn't you say this stuff

542
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,630
will only pass on to daughter and not to sons?

543
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,990
I'm the only one who can cook it. It's enough if I know how to cook it.

544
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:55,100
I know. I know. Don't send so much stuff next time.

545
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,940
I'm really good at cooking now.

546
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,750
He's so busy. How will he have the time to cook?

547
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,190
Okay, okay. I know. Don't send so much stuff next time.

548
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,290
Okay, I know. I'm hanging up.

549
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,640
Are you going out, Mr. Jiang?

550
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,560
Oh no. Something Dad said must have unintentionally poked his sort spot.

551
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,050
I'm careful everywhere but still can't block everything.

552
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,830
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

553
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,810
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

554
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:28,100

00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,330
