00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,870
Brother Fatty.

11
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,010
Kesong, you are here.

12
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,520
Aunty Xu is in the back.

13
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,380
- Okay
- Go ahead.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,340
Kesong?

15
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,460
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry and sit. Come sit.

16
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,530
Sit.

17
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,290
- Sit.
- Okay.

18
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,140
- Kesong.
- What's going on?

19
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,020
Xiao Jiang really can't see?

20
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,770
Yes.

21
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,660
But maybe he'll be able to see tomorrow.

22
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,430
Is his mood especially low?

23
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,440
Do you even need to ask?

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,400
That... That... Xiao Jiang lost his sense of taste,

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,050
your dad and I already saw on TV.

26
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,240
Thinking that with you by his side, it isn't a big problem.

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,910
So we didn't say anything.

28
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,110
Right?

29
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,570
Your mom and I are usually very strict with you.

30
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,420
But now you're grown up. You have your own thoughts.

31
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,580
We shouldn't meddle.

32
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,120
But this time it's different. These are eyes. Eyes are the window to the soul.

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,380
That's a stretch. What do eyes have to do with windows?

34
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,060
Kesong, such a big thing happened. Why didn't you tell us?

35
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,090
This is not an extremely big thing, so I didn't say anything.

36
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,650
You... My daughter, you're putting on too big of an act.

37
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,520
But it hasn't affected me much.

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,600
You really guessed it.

39
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,930
This... Mom will just speak honestly.

40
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,760
That... That... Have you fallen for Xiao Jiang?

41
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,310
Actually, after you left last time,

42
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,030
a lot of things happened.

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,180
He's the type of person...

44
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,460
I won't talk about his cooking.

45
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,720
He's the type of person

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,190
who only looks fierce.

47
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,800
He is very simple-hearted.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,330
He is also good to those around him.

49
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,600
No matter what happens,

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,050
he always wants to be in front of me.

51
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,040
After being with him, I feel like

52
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,160
the days get better and better.

53
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,400
I want to know, is he good to you?

54
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,840
He treats me well. In fact, better and better.

55
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,550
Last time when your dad and I came to Shanghai, we asked about you and Xiao Jiang.

56
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,330
We didn't mean anything by it.

57
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,980
We were just afraid that you'd get hurt and lied to.

58
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,660
After I returned with your dad, we said

59
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,390
that we won't ask about your business as much.

60
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,940
After all, you've grown up.

61
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,990
You should have your own love life.

62
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,610
Right.

63
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,760
But if Xiao Jiang were able to see,

64
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,200
we wouldn't say anything.

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,850
But you chose to be with someone who can't see.

66
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,170
Do you know how hard that path will be?

67
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,740
Do you know?

68
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,100
How would I know?

69
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,190
But I'm not afraid.

70
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,420
I'm very happy being with him now.

71
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,990
If there are problems, we'll overcome them together.

72
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,170
So, do you agree to us being together?

73
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,180
I… Your dad and I are both troubled and confused.

74
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,110
We're concerned about whether you will live well.

75
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,850
No, Kesong,

76
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,490
your mom and I lived life without trial or tribulation.

77
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,200
The more peaceful, the better. We think that this is happiness.

78
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,660
So we want you to walk the same path as us.

79
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,460
- Right. Right. Right. Right.
- But now you've chosen a very tough path.

80
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,530
This path is very hard. You must think it through.

81
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,240
We.. we're not saying this to stop you. We're saying

82
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,430
if you've thought it through, then Dad supports you.

83
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,820
Right?

84
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,330
Right? We won't meddle so much. We'll let our daughter handle it.

85
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,220
As a child, you'll think that mom and dad nag too much.

86
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,190
And that they're so fussy.

87
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,600
But now after running into problems,

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,640
I know how fortunate I am.

89
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,880
They understand you and support you,

90
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,290
and make sure you don't have any worries.

91
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,080
This must be what the world's best parents are like.

92
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,070
Mom and Dad, to be your daughter,

93
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,930
is my life's biggest pride.

94
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,060
I think she fell in love with Jiang Qianfan.

95
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,730
Disappointed?

96
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,470
Not really.

97
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,830
I just feel that Old Lin is drifting away from me.

98
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,640
I used to think that I was a star

99
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,200
and that she was the satellite next to me.

100
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,730
She ran circles around me.

101
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,510
It's like she never strayed off that track.

102
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,740
She became a habit in my life.

103
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,160
But it's not like that anymore. She's a small universe herself now.

104
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,980
She is gaining a lot more capabilities.

105
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,270
And I've become dumber and can't do anything right.

106
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,870
Yours.

107
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,860
This is your first job. Not doing it right is normal.

108
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,180
I'm telling you, at my first job, I was more of a noob than you.

109
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,250
Ah? That can't be.

110
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,390
A rich heiress like you has had a job before?

111
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,100
Yes.

112
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,260
After the college entrance examination,

113
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,000
I worked in a restaurant similar to this one.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,680
At first, I thought that being a waitress would be very simple.

115
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,060
It's just taking orders and carrying trays.

116
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,810
But one time, I took an entire table's order

117
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,280
and lost it.

118
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,490
I thought, since I made a mistake, then I'll go apologize.

119
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,840
I'll take their order again.

120
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,080
But not only did they not accept my apology, they even overturned the table.

121
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,520
The table hit me.

122
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,400
Then what did you do? Did you leave right away, or call your dad over to beat them up?

123
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,200
How could I do that?

124
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,470
My dad said while trying to make a name for myself,

125
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,750
it's only right for me to face the consequences for my mistakes.

126
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,900
If you should compensate, then compensate. If you should apologize, then apologize.

127
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,060
But after work, I went somewhere with nobody around. Cried my eyes out.

128
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,880
Wasn't I silly?

129
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,550
Yes.

130
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,100
I didn't expect you to have such a history.

131
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,720
Alright,

132
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,830
I should be content with a boss like you.

133
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,560
I won't complain anymore. I'll do my best.

134
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,160
You got this.

135
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,320
¥35.

136
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,680
Which one is good?

137
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,510
This one tastes better.

138
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,540
Okay.

139
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,860
Boss.

140
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,510
- How much for one of these?
- That's ¥5 each.

141
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,530
- Give me around seven to eight.
- Alright.

142
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,010
Sure.

143
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,980
What is that?

144
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,570
Do you like it?

145
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,630
You have four leaf clovers here?

146
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,600
That's not for sale. It's our lucky clover.

147
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:16,000
Congratulations. You'll have good luck after seeing it.

148
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,290
I'm home.

149
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,720
You're back.

150
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,840
No need to shake. I can't see.

151
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,250
How did you hold it?

152
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,290
I originally thought I couldn't do it.

153
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,670
I was going to try it while you were away.

154
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,070
But, unexpectedly, I can do it pretty easily.

155
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,360
Later, I realized it's probably I've done it a lot

156
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,130
that they've become an instinct.

157
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,330
Four-leaf clover, thank you.

158
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,940
What clover?

159
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,090
It's nothing.

160
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,820
Do you remember? When we were in Hangzhou,

161
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,750
you even bought me Ice Milk Shake.

162
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,350
I thought it wasn't good, and said the temperature wasn't 80 degrees.

163
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,640
I'm making a correct one for you.

164
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,190
You still remember that time?

165
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,890
If it's anything to do with you, I don't forget.

166
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,250
It should be ready now.

167
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,870
Here.

168
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,760
Drink it. How is it?

169
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,880
Why is it sweet?

170
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,330
I added sugar.

171
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,470
I mean, why did you add sugar?

172
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,150
Actually, I thought it over a lot later on.

173
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,760
Even though my eyes are blind now,

174
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,440
but I can actually see more clearly now, by seeing my heart.

175
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,250
Previously, I resisted sugar. Wherever I was,

176
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,260
I forbade sugar. But later I realized,

177
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,120
I never evaded it. The sugar was always next to me.

178
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,300
Where? I tried looking for it a few times but never saw it.

179
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,640
Aren't you silly?

180
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,880
You are my sugar.

181
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,510
Even though we haven't been together for long,

182
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,380
and we are arguing and fussing most of the time,

183
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,680
but at this time,

184
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,840
when I recall it, it's especially sweet.

185
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Every moment is sweet.

186
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,820
So I can't think of another reason to resist the sugar.

187
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,690
Just like myself, I can't think of a reason to refuse you.

188
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,410
Thank you.

189
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,410
I will never forget

190
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,330
your gaze, when I first

191
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,000
laid eyes on you.

192
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,530
Do you believe it?

193
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,060
I have never seen anyone's eyes like yours.

194
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,090
So clean.

195
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:59,820
So beautiful. When I saw you the first time,

196
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,630
I knew I liked you.

197
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,360
I'll never forget

198
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,620
your confident expression in the hotel.

199
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,690
You looked fearless.

200
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,560
From that moment on, I knew

201
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,730
if I didn't leave right away,

202
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,920
I wouldn't let you go.

203
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,820
So that's what you thought at that time.

204
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,350
Same for me.

205
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,620
I've never met anyone like you who is so double-faced.

206
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,320
You looked so fierce,

207
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,160
but your heart is so soft.

208
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,460
Silly.

209
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,850
Humans are complicated.

210
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,130
Later, when I learned that

211
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,770
you were the person who I was looking for,

212
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,800
I was really shocked.

213
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,290
From the first moment that I saw you,

214
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,990
I kept reminding myself

215
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,190
not to fall for you.

216
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,850
Absolutely not.

217
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,330
But I couldn't do it.

218
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,890
Do you remember the day we argued?

219
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,730
I kicked you out?

220
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,580
That night, I had a nightmare.

221
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,620
In my dream,

222
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,060
you were everywhere.

223
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,600
That's the first time that I felt in my life

224
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,190
that my heart was being held in someone's hand.

225
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,750
It hurt.

226
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,620
It felt real.

227
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,720
Such a coincidence.

228
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,840
I dreamed of you that day, too.

229
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,340
I dreamed that you came in and hugged me like this.

230
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,720
You didn't say a word.

231
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,400
When I woke up, I saw that I was by myself.

232
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,550
I felt sad.

233
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,680
Sorry.

234
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,560
It's my fault.

235
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,060
Can you believe

236
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,080
I had a dream that's just like now.

237
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,400
In the dream, I hugged you like I'm hugging you now.

238
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,130
Exactly the same.

239
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,990
Turns out caring about each other

240
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,030
is so good.

241
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,460
But, I'm sorry.

242
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,700
I know that

243
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,060
I can't not give you the best version of me.

244
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,720
Aren't you silly?

245
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,100
How do you know which version of you

246
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,300
is the best?

247
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,760
Do you know what I like the most about you?

248
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,160
What?

249
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,970
Your persistence.

250
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,230
The persistence to culinary arts.

251
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,190
The persistence to feelings.

252
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,430
But I don't understand any of it.

253
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,820
I don't understand this ridiculous world.

254
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,170
I don't understand those laughable people.

255
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,660
The only thing I know

256
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,430
is cooking.

257
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,830
What I probably like

258
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,190
is this simple and pure you.

259
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,370
♫  To embrace the rising storm  ♫

260
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,000
You don't need to understand this world.

261
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,300
You only need to remember this,

262
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,990
you love me,

263
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,390
and I love you. That's enough.

264
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,830
Okay.

265
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,420
I promise you.

266
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,390
I want you to feed me.

267
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,520
Okay.

268
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,470
If I even need me to feed you when you eat,

269
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,960
does this mean I'm in charge of this household?

270
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,230
You want to be in charge?

271
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,100
Sure.

272
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,920
What are you so boring? You must say, no way.

273
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,400
Okay. No way.

274
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,450
No way, but it's still the case nonetheless.

275
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,630
Remember you set up a lot of rules for me when I first came?

276
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,700
It's my turn now.

277
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,230
Are you revenging against me?

278
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,250
You just realized?

279
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:06,000
However, I'm much kinder than you. You set up so many rules for me, but I only have one for you.

280
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,170
Tell me about it.

281
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,490
You just listen to me on everything.

282
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,530
Everything?

283
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,170
What's everything?

284
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,330
You are everything.

285
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,390
I like this answer.

286
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,670
You've misled me.

287
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,770
- Let's see who it is.
- You want to ambush me?

288
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,430
It's Thomas.

289
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,000
Hello, Mr. Thomas.

290
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,890
What did he say?

291
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,890
Mr. Thomas said that the committee has drafted two announcements.

292
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,020
The first statement says “Jiang Qianfan

293
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,190
has decided to withdraw from the finals due to his blindness."

294
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,310
The second is, "despite losing his sight, Jiang Qianfan

295
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,480
has decided to join the finals." He is asking you which one you'd choose.

296
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,860
Tell him not to ask if he already knows the answer.

297
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,600
Is he looking for an excuse to ask about my well-being?

298
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,960
Mr. Thomas, Mr. Jiang...

299
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,010
Okay. Don't worry.

300
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,860
Why are you so smart?

301
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,630
You are right. He told me to take good care of you.

302
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,620
I was going to kiss you.

303
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,630
Why did you aim so right?

304
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,170
I think I can see some light.

305
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,550
This is really a miracle.

306
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,530
I thought your blindness is irreversible.

307
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,930
I didn't expect you to restore your sense of light.

308
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,900
If this continues, it won't take long

309
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,740
before you restore your sight.

310
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,860
If it really works out, it's wonderful.

311
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,680
Can you tell me what you've experienced?

312
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,530
Kesong, can you tell him?

313
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:58,270
♫  Love is the food for the living heart  ♫

314
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:06,520
♫  Love is the food for the living heart  ♫

315
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,560
♫  Love  ♫

316
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,650
Hello, how are you?

317
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,050
Hello. Are you Miss Lin Kesong?

318
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:25,480
- Yes, I am.
- I am the President of Hyatt Restaurant. I am Xiao Hua.

319
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,960
Hello. I think I've heard of your restaurant.

320
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,680
- It's our honor. Our restaurant is opening our first branch in Shanghai.

321
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,520
We are recruiting talents.

322
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,290
We really hope that you will join us.

323
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,090
Me?

324
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,720
Aren't you looking for Mr. Jiang?

325
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,000
It's because you are Mr. Jiang's apprentice.

326
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,820
Also, in the Mueller's Future Star Culinary Competition,

327
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,530
you have already entered the finals. Your strength is clearly visible.

328
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,030
I have to thank you for your affirmation.

329
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,940
But, my strength isn't as good as you think.

330
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,300
If you aren't looking for Mr. Jiang, I'll hang up now.

331
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,180
Then, you are thinking of going to Yuxuan?

332
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:10,700
My goals is to learn culinary arts from Mr. Jiang.

333
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,530
And then bring more delicious foods to people.

334
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,860
Okay. Goodbye.

335
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,840
Qianfan, how is it? Did you hear?

336
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,060
I heard.

337
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,120
She couldn't tell, did she?

338
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,770
Don't worry. She didn't.

339
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,120
That's it for now. Rest well.

340
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,040
I'm back!

341
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,790
What are you doing?

342
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,720
I was just testing the oil temperature. Why are you so nervous?

343
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,320
But you shouldn't test with your hand.

344
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,350
I just don't want to keep waiting for death.

345
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,490
Why are you so anxious?

346
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,030
A lifetime is long. I'll just stay with you and test together, right?

347
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,580
Lin Kesong.

348
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,960
I'm sorry.

349
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,420
Why sorry?

350
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,490
Didn't you just get a phone call?

351
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,330
I asked someone to call you.

352
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,450
What do you mean?

353
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,020
I just wanted to hear the truth from you. I tested you.

354
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,120
Didn't I already tell you everything?

355
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,920
Don't you trust me?

356
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,390
Tell me, what else can I trust now?

357
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,600
I'm useless now. I can only sit and wait for death.

358
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,660
But you? You are growing up every day, getting more fierce every day.

359
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,830
How do I know if you really want to stay with me, or maybe there's a motive?

360
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,450
Jiang Qianfan.

361
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,740
Are you done?

362
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,520
Do you understand what love is?

363
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,880
Love means, when I stay with you to eat sugar and chew vegetables,

364
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,480
when I go to the mountain of blades and sea of flame, but I still feel happy.

365
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,830
I trusted you so much.

366
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,790
Until today, you'd actually get someone to test me in secret.

367
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,730
You don't trust me?

368
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,130
Okay, starting today,

369
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,500
I won't intervene what you do. You can do whatever you want to do.

370
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,890
Lin Kesong.

371
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,060
Lin Kesong.

372
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,280
Kesong.

373
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,330
This way.

374
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,170
Come.

375
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,660
Sit over there.

376
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:55,320
If everything turned out like what I imagined, how wonderful would it be?

377
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,900
Too bad that reality isn't what I dreamed.

378
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,800
The more beautiful the dream, the reality is so helpless.

379
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,220
And you can't help but accept it.

380
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,660
Luck, when will you knock on the door?

381
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,990
What are you doing here?

382
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,930
Hello, Miss Lin.

383
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,620
I'm sorry that I'm bothering you.

384
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,630
I'm looking for Mr. Jiang. I have some stuff for him.

385
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,850
- We don't...
- Let him come in.

386
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,900
You don't look much good this way.

387
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,980
Are you satisfied?

388
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,380
I brought you this.

389
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,150
What is it?

390
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,450
It's the last page in Montgomery's notebook.

391
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,610
What do you mean?

392
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,440
Please read the last sentence to you.

393
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,280
[But, I am sugar.]

394
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,280
But, I am sugar.

395
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,300
[I hate sugar, but I'm sugar.]

396
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:52,330
I hate sugar, but I am sugar.

397
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:57,430
After Montgomery's accident, I received the notice

398
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:01,030
and rushed to his home. None of you were there.

399
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,040
You went to the seaside to wait for news on the rescue.

400
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:10,730
The notebook was open, right on the counter.

401
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,590
I guessed that Montgomery was making a dessert.

402
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,800
He didn't have any inspiration, that's why he went out to the sea.

403
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:24,000
To revenge against you, I tore off a piece and left.

404
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:31,170
I know that you're very loyal, especially to Montgomery.

405
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,790
If you knew, his last words to you were "I hate sugar",

406
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,850
you definitely wouldn't touch sugar every again.

407
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:42,320
In this way, not only would you be further away from happiness,

408
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,440
you'd also be at a greater disadvantage.

409
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,090
You'd never be able to reach the top with your cooking.

410
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:58,700
Unfortunately, I was only half right.

411
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,000
You were indeed no longer happy.

412
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,690
But your dishes

413
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,220
stayed amazing.

414
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,460
You chose to tell me this now

415
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,490
because I'm no longer your opponent.

416
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,570
Right?

417
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,350
No.

418
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,990
I decided to tell you this now

419
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,160
because I only just came to understand

420
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,690
that I was wrong.

421
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,800
I tried everything I could to strike you down.

422
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,730
But as a result,

423
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,660
I ended up being even more miserable than you.

424
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,010
If I keep living like this,

425
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,920
my life would be meaningless.

426
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,800
I'm sorry, Qianfan.

427
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:22,750
This is all the sugar I've collected from all over the world.

428
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,390
I'm giving it to you.

429
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,320
Teach Lin Kesong well.

430
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,380
I should get going now.

431
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,160
But can I say a few words

432
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,150
to Jiang Qianfan before I go?

433
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,920
Just say whatever it is you have to say with me here.

434
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,820
Head to your room for now.

435
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,940
Go inside.

436
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,590
I'm leaving soon.

437
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,030
I'm going to be a chef on a cruise.

438
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:27,290
This cruise trip travels in the North Atlantic all year long.

439
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,460
It's even closer to Montgomery.

440
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:35,260
Do you still want to stay here in your current state?

441
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,450
Why don't you come with me?

442
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,100
Work as my assistant. I can arrange it for you.

443
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,750
Call me

444
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,060
when you've decided.

445
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,800
Goodbye. Take care.

446
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,920
Boris.

447
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,970
I'll go with you.

448
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,720
Perhaps this is a better choice

449
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,000
for me.

450
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,740
He left?

451
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,740
Yes.

452
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,570
Are you going to forgive him?

453
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,780
I hate Boris,

454
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,360
but I am Boris.

455
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,990
I'll never be able to be at peace with myself if I don't forgive him.

456
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,570
Thomas?

457
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,570
Hello, Mr. Thomas.

458
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,710
What is he saying?

459
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:15,310
Mr. Thomas said that the committee has drafted two announcements.

460
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:20,200
The first statement is "Jiang Qianfan has decided to withdraw from the finals due to his blindness."

461
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,010
The second is, "despite losing his sight, Jiang Qianfan

462
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:31,490
s decided to join the finals." He is asking you which one you'd choose.

463
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:42,300
Why is he asking when he already knows the answer? Tell him to stop finding excuses to show sympathy to me.

464
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,950
Thomas—

465
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,770
Alright.

466
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,360
How are you so smart? You guessed it.

467
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,240
He told me to take good care of you.

468
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:17,630
It's exactly the same. From Thomas' words to Jiang Qianfan's current expression,

469
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:22,740
my imagination perfectly coincided with reality.

470
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,720
I'm at a loss for words.

471
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,850
Perhaps reality is not so helpless after all.

472
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,980
If your wishes are strong and powerful enough, hope really will be there.

[The Statement Regarding Competition Mentor, Mr. Jiang Qianfan]

474
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,510
Mom, you're back.

475
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:00,430
Thomas just released a statement that Jiang Qianfan is not only competing in the finals, but he's making dessert as well.

476
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,250
Why does he suddenly not hate sugar anymore?

477
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,910
I don't know. Perhaps he never really hated it in the first place.

478
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,030
Go pour me a glass of water.

479
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,830
Mom, did you drink?

480
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,410
It's still daytime.

481
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,550
Your troubles aren't worried about whether it's day or night.

482
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,740
I'm going to get changed. I'll teach you to make dessert in a bit.

483
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,030
When sugar and water reach a temperature of 160° C,

484
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,120
we'll get the effect we want.

What's on your mind?

493
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,990
The same as your reason for drinking. Mom,

494
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,150
is Elise in even more serious trouble?

495
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:22,830
♫ You are the stranger I want to know ♫

496
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,850
♫ Don't let me go ♫

497
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:31,080
♫ I will do little tricks for you ♫

498
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:37,160
♫ Don't bury your secret heart ♫

499
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,270
♫ Show them who you are ♫

500
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:45,390
♫ We sing a song for love ♫

501
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,130
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart ♫
