to relax and not be nervous before the competition.

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,240
I don't like to drink. I simply dislike the taste of alcohol.

15
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,130
I don't see the point of drinking alcohol.

Great. As for the alcohol,

Then... What other hobbies do you have besides cooking?

26
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,540
Developing a hobby will affect one's focus.

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,900
I don't think so. In my opinion, if one has a hobby,

Besides, what if Chu Ting doesn't accept my proposal? That'll be so embarrassing.

How do you want to celebrate then?

154
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:56,200
I'll just celebrate with Chu Ting. I'll take her

155
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,830
to a very nice meal, then I'll shower her with romantic words

156

and take out the diamond ring to propose to her at the right time.

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,810
Brother, I really have to get going now.

159
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,350
Go ahead.

160
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,300
Hello, judges and audience.

161
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,630
Welcome to the third round of the Mueller's Future Star Culinary Competition.

162
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,830
The theme of this competition is fermentation.

163
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,480
Of course, Chairman Thomas has added new restrictions to this round of the competition.

164
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,350
Let's welcome our chairman, Thomas.

165
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,780
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

166
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,350
I've prepared three restrictions today,

167
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,190
but now I'm having difficulty choosing between the three.

168
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,610
I don't know which one to use

169
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,000
to make things harder for our contestants.

170
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,680
Let's have the host draw one for them.

171
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,420
I'll draw one randomly.

172
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,870
[Fruit]

173
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,720
Fruit.

174
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm sure everyone also wants to know what's in the other two envelopes.

175
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,630
I can tell you now.

176
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,710
They're both also fruit.

177
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,790
That means that the contestants will not only have

178
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,930
to interpret the theme of fermentation in their dishes today,

179
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,430
but they'll also have to use at least one fruit as their ingredients.

180
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,890
Let's begin.

181
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,630
Just when I hopelessly thought I was done for in this round,

182
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,110
I suddenly saw it and was so excited I wanted to cry.

183
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:00,640
Jiang Qianfan said, "Do you still remember that rainy night?" Of course, I do.

184
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,410
My story is hidden in this inconspicuous hawthorn.

185
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,160
I decided that I was going to make the taste

186
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,390
of the torn feeling I had that night.

187
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,310
Exciting! How exciting!

188
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,780
Everyone who knows of Jiang Qianfan

189
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,150
knows that he extremely hates sugar.

190
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,180
To what extent does he hate it?

191
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,770
Not only does his restaurant not serve dessert,

192
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,220
but sugar is not even allowed.

193
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,450
That's how insane it is.

194
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,900
But as you can see,

195
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,110
his dear apprentice is using sugar.

196
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,430
It'll be fine if she loses, but if she wins…

197
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,270
How humiliating will that be for Jiang Qianfan?

198
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,860
I'll go ask him.

199
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,190
Jiang Qianfan, tell everyone

200
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,000
what your apprentice is making.

201
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,340
Can't you tell?

202
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,160
Of course I can, but I can't understand

203
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,120
why your dear apprentice is publicly rebelling against you

204
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,070
when you hate sugar so much.

205
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,750
How does that make you feel?

206
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,690
All I know is that your apprentice will be defeated.

207
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,790
Shouldn't you pay more attention to her?

208
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,430
Nonsense.

209
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,530
When Lin Xiaoyu added yogurt to the fruit,

210
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,980
the temperature exceeded 43 degrees.

211
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:28,640
Is Jiang Qianfan really like what Boris said?

212
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,000
Yes.

213
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,560
All I know is that his apprentice will be miserable.

two, one. Time's up!

230
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,910
Fermentation is all about the story of time. Let's see, out of so many dishes,

231
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,520
is there any story in them? Blu, what does your dish represent?

232
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,790
This is a bird's nest. It represents me.

233
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,990
I want to hug a particiular person.

234
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,550
I hope she can lay down her burden

235
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,960
and get along with me.

236
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,280
This dish is adorable and your story is heartwarming. All right, give it your best! Good job!

237
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,430
Let's ask our next contestant.

238
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,230
All right, let's talk to Victor. Does your dish have a story?

239
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,420
No.

240
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,690
Wow, a proud youngster indeed. Let's interview our next contestant.

241
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,970
Lin Kesong, your dish looks like Tanghulu.

242
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,340
There are sugar and hawthorn berries.

243
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,930
Hawthorn berries are sour, but where is the element of fermentation?

244
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,000
The outer shell of the hawthorn berries

245
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,990
has yogurt, sweet vinegar, and red wine.

246
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,810
Is there a story to your dish?

247
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,040
The feeling when you like someone is like eating Tanghulu.

248
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,840
The first bite is sweet

249
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,980
but as you continue, it becomes bitter and tart.

250
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,420
As time passes,

251
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,070
the flavor changes too.

252
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,410
I incorporated my understanding of having a crush into this dish.

253
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:37,530
It sounds wonderful. There's a hint of sweetness in it.

254
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,660
Let's take a look at the next contestant's dish.

255
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,800
What does she mean by this?

256
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,160
Who did she have a crush on?

257
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,500
What do you think?

258
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,590
If you as a mother don't know, how will I know?

259
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,030
I... I didn't know.

260
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,560
If you knew, would it still be a crush?

261

[Lin Kesong, Tanghulu]

269
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,050
We now have the scores. Eight contestants did their best

270
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,830
and cooked some interesting and delicious dishes.

271
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,840
Next, let me announce the results.

272
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,190
The first place goes to Victor Quentin.

273
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,400
The seemingly ordinary tuna dish is composed

274
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,920
with conntrasting sourness,

275
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,470
the lactic acid in sour cream,

276
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,060
the acetic acid in Japanese ginger, and the citric acid in lemon,

277
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,130
all the refreshing flavors neutralize the greasiness of the tuna

278
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,930
and create layers of taste. Let's congratulate him!

279
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,230
In the second place, her dish consists of yogurt that had been fermented for days,

280
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,940
aged sweet vinegar, and 10-year-old wine.

281
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,330
Three different sourness with different fermentation lengths

282
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,960
are combined with the sourness of hawthorn berries.

283
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,940
Covered in sugar coating and chocolate,

284
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,030
it gives you layers of enjoyment and aftertaste.

285
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,720
The contestant has her understanding of

286
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,660
fermentation time. It allows you to immerse in it and just can't stop eating.

287
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,190
This is Lin Kesong's dish, Crush of Tanghulu. Congratulations!

She made it to second place! That wasn't easy!

290
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,250
Even the judges said that our Kesong has her own understanding

291
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,870
of the time.

292
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,240
She has put in the effort.

293
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,570
Yes, yes. Tell me, how much suffering that this child has to endure in her heart?

294
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,260
Third place, Lin Xiaoyu.

295
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,220
Total score, 18 points.

296
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,870
Higher points than Xiaoyu!

297
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,050
She endured more hardship than Xiaoyu.

298
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,470
Any parent will feel bad for their child.

299
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,440
Yes, it's not easy for this child.

300
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,590
Child, Mr. Jiang has already left.

Congratulations, Lin Kesong.

Winning over your sister by stepping on Jiang Qianfan's restricted area.

303
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,780
I guess the good days for you two have come to an end.

304
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,780
Old Lin, congratulations.

305
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,970
You're here. Did you see Jiang Qianfan?

306
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,620
No.

307
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,180
What's going on? You are so frantic.

308
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,120
I've provoked him.

309
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,930
What exactly happened?

310
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,860
Old Lin, what's going on exactly?

311
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,260
I think I've really provoked him.

312
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,170
Isn't it just that you didn't listen to him? It's right that you didn't listen to him,

313
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,000
your result was so good. Where are you going? I'll take you.

314
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,560
If your result is poor, do you still remember what will be waiting for you?

315
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,900
If you forgot, I'll remind you. It's purgatory!

00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,790
I would have already hit you.

318
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:18,060
Lin Xiaoyu, I don't know what you are proud of!

319
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,750
You got first place once, and you think you are great.

320
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:26,190
You even underestimated your enemy!

321
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,440
I didn't.

322
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,330
You think you are a pink strawberry,

323
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,900
peach? Who made you so gentle?

324
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,290
Mr. Boris! You want to lose your temper, lose it at me.

325
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,540
Xiaoyu cannot be blamed for this.

326
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,000
You get lost!

327
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,050
Old Huang, what are you doing?

328
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,770
You want to use your tai chi to gesture at me?

329
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,130
I don't care when you scold your apprentice.

330
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:55,180
You attacked my apprentice, not acceptable.

331
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,950
Okay.

332
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,760
Considering that you're an elder, I won't argue with you.

333
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,410
Be more polite when you talk!

334
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,100
Okay, Old Huang, let the person who can't afford to lose go.

335
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,190
Blu, Xiaoyu is his apprentice.

336
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,370
As her mentor, Boris educates his apprentice.

337
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,360
Of course, whatever he says is right. We don't interfere.

338
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,420
Blu, this is not your fault. Go.

339
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,670
Blu, follow me. Come.

340
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,160
Let's go and drink tea.

341
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,480
Boris, I slacked off.

342
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,910
Tell me what to do. I'll go and do it.

343
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,250
In two hours, go to my Jellyfish Bar.

344
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,090
Late for 1 minute, and you are finished!

345
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,960
Yes.

346
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,850
Old Lin.

347
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,060
So you had a secret crush.

348
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,850
No, I made it up.

349
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,590
Don't fool me.

350
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,180
I knew you didn't make it up from the tone of your voice.

351
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,620
After all, we've known each other for ten years.

352
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,680
You must like someone or used to like someone.

353
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,090
Can't you tell me?

354
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,750
No.

355
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,290
Fine.

356
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,350
[Hello, the number you dialed is turned off.]

357
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,730
♫  I cannot afford to be kind  ♫

358
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:46,340
♫  Floating moods I can’t keep in control  ♫

359
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,120
I'm going.

360
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,510
♫  In control  ♫

361
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,160
Aren't you having your birthday soon?

362
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,540
Are you holding a party? Should I prepare some food in advance?

363
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,460
No need. I don't like parties anymore. They're boring.

364
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,510
Just prepare for the competition with peace of mind.

365
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:08,800
I'll wish you a happy birthday in advance then.

366
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,390
I'm going.

367
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,050
♫  My hungry mind  ♫

368
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,120
♫  My hungry mind  ♫

369
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,370
I've packed up your luggage.

370
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,120
You can leave.

371
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,140
Where am I going?

372
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,760
As you wish.

373
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,250
Don't make a fuss.

374
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,540
Don't you understand yet?

375
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,280
I have nothing to teach you anymore.

376
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,820
You can leave.

377
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,970
You really got angry?

378
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,430
Do you have to?

379
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,510
Isn't it just a sweet? Why this way?

380
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,600
You've done everything right,

381
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,060
and they are good,

382
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,170
so I don't want to see you anymore.

383
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,510
Just leave, okay?

384
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,870
DIdn't you teach me that cooking is telling someone's story.

385
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,580
This is mine, not yours.

386
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,050
Yeah,

387
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:52,480
I shouldn't use sugar, but it doesn't taste good without sugar.

388
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,790
See? I saved one especially for you.

389
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,080
Lin Kesong.

390
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,690
Aren't you disgusting?

391
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:26,030
Around me every day, you talk about what's sour, what's sweet, about love, about Song Yiran...

392
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,310
Aren't you childish?

393
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,400
How old are you now?

394
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,510
Do you think I'm like you?

395
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,550
Let me tell you.

396
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,060
Someone who tells these disgusting stories and stuff

397
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,830
does not deserve to stay in my kitchen, and even more, not by my side.

398
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:47,350
How many times do you want me to say? Aren't you shameless?

399
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,390
You... How am I disgusting?

400
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,730
You clearly knew this is the competition's rule? Haven't you ever made sweets?

401
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,450
How did you win if you didn't make sweets?

402
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,180
That was the old me.

403
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,070
I don't want to remember that person.

404
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,240
I remember that I've said,

405
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,370
no sweets are allowed wherever I am.

406
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:14,530
This is my bottomline. No one, including you, must touch it.

407
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,090
Go away, right now.

408
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,950
I really don't want to see you anymore.

409
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,660
Li Yan left too.

410
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,980
Nina left too.

411
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,400
Now I'm leaving.

412
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,790
Just stay all alone by yourself then.

413
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,950
[Elise]

414
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,180
[Elise]

415
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,830
I kicked out Lin Kesong.

416
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,550
So she won't continue to compete in the competition?

417
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,200
Okay, I get it. I'll announce it under Yuxuan's name.

418
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,670
Oliver, don't be so angry. It's not worth it for Lin Kesong.

419
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,750
Okay? Take good care of yourself.

420
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,480
Mom, it looks like you guessed it right.

421
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,310
What is it?

422
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:19,090
Mom guessed that Oliver would kick out Lin Kesong?

423
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,680
Yeah.

424
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,660
Certainly there isn't another possibile outcome.

425
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,800
This is Oliver's temper.

426
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,080
Mom.

427
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,140
- Aren't I right every time?
- You're always right.

428
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,920
Clean it up. Not a single fish scale is allowed to be left.

429
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,930
Good.

430
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,480
Thirty seconds. Just as I expected.

431
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,740
Two fish, one minute.

432
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,620
The fish here,

433
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,130
also here, and here.

434
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,440
And there.

435
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,130
All these fish, if you start now,

436
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,460
without eating and drinking, without your hands slowing down,

437
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,210
you should be able to complete in 16 hours.

438
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,330
But I'm only giving you 15 hours.

439
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:53,340
Tomorrw morning at five o'clock, someone will come get the fish.

440
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,630
If you aren't finished by then,

441
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,800
even if it's only half a fish left,

442
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,850
Lin Xiaoyu, I'll make you

443
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,820
eat all these fish,

444
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,940
including the tails and bones.

445
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,560
Won't you hurry up and start?

446
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,530
Let's go check out the specialty stores.

447
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,660
How about matching these?

448
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,550
It's really nice. Sister, you really have a good eye.

449
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:32,270
Sister, what's the perfume on you? It smells great.

450
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,760
I'm not using perfume.

451
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,120
It's probably the shampoo's smell.

452
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,060
It really is.

453
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,760
Wait a moment.

454
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,380
I just bought this set. You can have it.

455
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,780
Thanks, Sister Ting.

456
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:04,200
Chu Ting! What do you think of these flowers?

457
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,450
Chang Yuan, close the door.

458
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,150
Well...

459
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,470
Ah...

460
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,880
No, Chu Ting, I came here today to sincerely apologize.

461
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,790
Chang Yuan, didn't you hear what I said?

462
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,820
Brother Yiran, sorry, we're closed.

463
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,080
Chu Ting, can't you give me a chance today?

464
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,170
Brother Yiran, I don't know what happened between you,

465
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:33,060
but you'd better leave now. Wait till Sister Chu Ting's anger is gone.

466
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,600
Please give her these flowers for me.

467
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,360
Chang Yuan, don't you know I'm allergic to pollen?

468
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,740
Huh?

469
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,130
All right then.

470
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,210
Brother Yiran, bye.

471
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,250
Following this road, I can reach the long-distance bus station.

472
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,170
If I buy a ticket, it'll take only two hours to get home,

473
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:16,000
but what will I tell Mom and Dad?

474
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,550
I don't want to tell them that Jiang Qianfan is bad,

475
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,570
but if I don't say it, I won't be able to explain why I was kicked out.

476
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,530
It's so hard.

477
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,600
Let's stay for one more day then. When the next round of the competition starts

478
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,210
and I can't conceal it anymore, then I'll go home.

00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:53,030
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,860
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:01,090
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,160
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

483
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,290
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

484
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:15,530
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

485
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,170
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
