[Episode 7]

9
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,220
Abalone boiled in soup. It's the most traditional way of cooking it.

10
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,510
The soup is rich, which means you have some fundamental skills.

11
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,310
But the soup has not completely seeped into the abalone,

12
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,750
which means you're not very good with timing yet.

13
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,030
The coupling with asparagus is also very old-fashioned.

14
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,420
You just simply put the two ingredients together. It lacks imagination.

15
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,390
My imagination is for the competition.

16
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,860
Certain people deserve to eat certain kinds of dishes. You're not worth even a bit of my time.

17
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,650
Is that so? Or did you get scared by the price of the ingredients?

18
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,370
You were worried that you would make a bad dish, so you used the most traditional way to cook it.

19
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,940
Sure, I got scared by an abalone. Are you satisfied?

20
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,940
I don't think you're a dragon at all. You're just a weakling. Bye.

21
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,610
Stop!

22
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,220
You're here for Lin Kesong?

23
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,910
What? Did I get the wrong person? You are?

24
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,760
I'm Lin Xiaoyu. Boris' apprentice.

25
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,070
Why don't you show me what you're made of since you're so arrogant?

26
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,380
That's just what I wanted to hear.

27
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,500
Get started.

28
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,450
You have flour and butter, right?

29
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,210
Of course.

30
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,230
Chopsticks!

31
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,360
Hey, hey! Isn't that ready, too?

32
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,530
Come on!

33
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,250
- Our dish is tasty, right?
- It's very tasty!

34
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,840
Just a bit hot.

35
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,740
This is a custard bun! Of course it's hot! The filling is flowing out!

36
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,250
So delicious.

37
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,810
Go back to work now!

38
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,380
Sir, your job is pretty cool.

39
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,310
Do you guys shoot guns there? I'm a good shot.

40
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,720
How far is it? I need to go to the bathroom.

41
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,690
Make standard movements!

42
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,030
Here!

43
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,800
Squat!

44
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,580
Rise!

45
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,400
Wake up. You've arrived.

46
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,880
Rise!

47
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,110
Squat! Rise.

48
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,600
Squat! Rise.

49
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,330
Squat!

50
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,880
Rise. Squat! Rise.

51
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,990
Rise. Squat!

52
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,270
This is your dormitory.

53
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,920
Next one.

54
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,990
Be careful.

55
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,660
Next one.

56
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,020
The players who participated in the competition have made great progress,

57
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,000
but I have not yet taken the first step.

58
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,760
It's been three days. I repeated the same movement every day, but still can't do it well.

59
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,500
I'm really irritable, desperate and devastated.

60
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,280
And I have reluctantly accepted the reality that I don't know anything.

61
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,830
Something wonderful happened.

62
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,260
I surprisingly started to move steadily towards success.

63
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:49,220
I've measured correctly at once so many times, can't you praise me?

64
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,950
No, because it's not worth it.

65
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,400
So what you did was worth it?

66
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,020
Yes.

67
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,750
What are you doing?

68
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,660
I'm experimenting with the tea that goes with the dish. Yuxuan has to develop new dishes every quarter.

69
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,970
Mr. Jiang,

70
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,390
this is the dessert Li Yan sent.

71
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,710
Put it there.

72
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,550
Dessert.

73
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,350
May I try?

74
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,380
You are so greedy.

75
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,890
My tea is going with Yuxuan's dishes.

76
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,010
These desserts are from Yuxuan? No wonder they are so delicious.

77
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,530
I love desserts.

78
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,750
What did you say?

79
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,340
I said I love desserts.

80
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,130
This taste of osmanthus, brown sugar, and coconut milk mixed together.

81
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,020
- It's so—
- Go back to your room!

82
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,640
Copy the basic cooking principles five times!

83
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,260
Why?

84
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,350
No reason, do it right away.

85
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,970
Oliver.

86
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,530
- Mr. Jiang.
- Mr. Jiang.

87
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,800
Stop!

88
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,090
What is this?

89
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,470
What is this?

90
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:57,890
I asked them to put it in because the sweetness makes it more delicious. Guests also like it better...

91
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,850
I just want to ask, why didn't you tell me?

92
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,840
Why should I tell you when you react like this?

93
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,150
This is my restaurant.

94
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:13,040
All dishes require my approval. I don't need to say more about this.

95
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,170
Lin Kesong told you that?

96
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,860
Yes!

97
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,940
Tell me, what else did you change?

98
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,660
Nothing else, just this. I didn't let you know because I didn't want to hurt you.

99
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,620
I'm warning you for the last time.

100
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,860
Don't touch my dishes again.

101
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,710
Even if there is a mistake, I, Jiang Qianfan, am responsible.

102
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,540
There will be no sugar where I am.

103
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,900
The lad is here. Are you here to eat, or to find Xiaoyu?

104
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,750
I'm looking for Xiaoyu. You must be Xiaoyu's father.

105
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,290
Yes.

106
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,750
Which country are you from?

107
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,340
- I'm from Canada.
- Oh, Canada.

108
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,150
- Henry Bethune's hometown.
- Who?

109
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,500
A doctor. Dr. Bethune, who operated on the guerrillas.

110
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,810
- Dr. Bethune!
- Right.

111
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,460
Not bad. Not many young people know about Bethune nowadays.

112
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,560
That's why I was interested in China since I was a child and learned Chinese. It's been five years since I came to China.

113
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,500
No wonder.

114
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,600
How old are you?

115
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,410
I'm 22.

116
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,320
What have you been doing in China?

117
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,670
I studied ink painting at the Academy of Fine Arts.

118
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,790
How did Xiaoyu know you as a student of ink painting?

119
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,230
I also like cooking. I'm participating in the cooking competition.

120
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:05,350
The Future Star competition. Like Xiaoyu, I also made it to the top eight.

121
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,740
You like cooking! That's nice.

122
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,140
The boy who likes to cook is reliable.

123
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,040
Fine. Xiaoyu is in the kitchen. You can go looking for her.

124
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,280
Do you know how to get there? Turn left outside the door, and turn left again.

125
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,380
Okay. Thank you.

126
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:31,170
Uncle Lin, this little brother looks quite smart but speaks quite silly.

127
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,140
Silly?

128
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,050
Xiaoyu is very strong. She needs to find someone who's obedient.

129
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,560
That's true.

130
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,920
Sister Yu's temper will make him suffer.

131
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
Go to work.

132
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,640
I'm leaving.

133
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,620
Hello Xiaoyu!

134
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,900
Why are you frozen?

135
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,790
Abalone pastry?

136
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,300
How does your restaurant know how to make these?

137
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,200
Victor was here.

138
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,660
Do you know him?

139
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,120
The European and North American food scene knows about him, the genius.

140
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,240
Showing off his cooking skills in someone else's kitchen.

141
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,950
One-on-one, then declare victory.

142
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,530
But he's also really good.

143
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,450
What are you doing here today?

144
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:40,050
You have been selected by the mentor, so I came to congratulate you. By the way, I also made it to the top eight.

145
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,990
My mentor is Mr. Huang Shi. Have you heard of him?

146
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,100
No!

147
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,280
You came here to give me a hard time, right? You said he was good, which means I am not good.

148
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,180
That's not what I meant.

149
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,820
- Just that you are not as good as him now. You will—
- Say that again.

150
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,320
You are not good enough now.

151
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,890
Get out.

152
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,320
- What's the matter?
- Get out!

153
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,970
What? Why?

[Arduous Training]

Faster, faster, faster!

156
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,990
I am harsh and stern. You won't like me for that!

157
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,120
But the more you hate me, the more you'll learn!

158

I do not despise southerners or northerners!

Urban soldiers or rural soldiers!

Here, you are all treated equally, as worthless new recruits!

Therefore, you have no right to have contact with the outside world!

00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,450
Get up!

165
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,520
- Sit down and rest for a while.
- Thank you.

166
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,170
Take a seat.

167
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,350
Old Li.

168
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,280
Thanks.

169
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,580
Here.

170
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,210
Jiang Qianfan, if I don't take revenge on you when I get back,

171
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,770
then my last name is not Song.

172
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,400
You look nice.

173
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,440
Why give me a dress all of a sudden?

174
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,630
Are you ashamed of bullying me?

175
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,170
You are overthinking. These are work clothes.

176
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,080
Work clothes?

177
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,330
How can I cook in this dress?

178
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,620
Nobody asked you to cook. I want to send you to Yuxuan for dinner.

179
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,000
Really? I thought you didn't mean what you said.

180
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,600
I always keep my word

181
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,370
but I'm not going with you. You are going on your own.

182
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,020
That's right.

183
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,470
You've eaten there so many times.

184
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,250
Wait for me, I'll get my bag!

185
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,810
You got snubbed, right?

186
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,910
Snubbed?

187
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,810
Your mandarin is not good enough.

188
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,610
She kicked you out, which means you got snubbed.

189
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,320
Pick up chopsticks and eat.

190
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,030
Give me the bowl.

191
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,320
You are so mindless.

192
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,500
Is your mentor Chinese or a foreigner?

193
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,270
He is Chinese, Huang Shi.

194
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,260
I went to see him yesterday. He took me fishing for the whole day.

195
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,280
Your mentor is really not doing his job.

196
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,620
Mr. Huang Shi is very capricious. He wanted to cook fish and had to go fishing by himself.

197
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,040
He won't cook until he catches his own fish.

198
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,530
Doesn't his store have a menu?

199
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,150
Not really. What he cooks every day depends on his mood.

200
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,830
It's basically Huaiyang cuisine. You have to book six months in advance.

201
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,800
That's dashing.

202
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,180
Will he be able to participate in the competition with this temper?

203
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,830
Mr. Huang Shi said that the competition is not important,

204
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,140
and that the purpose is to watch and learn how your peer cooks. I think he is right.

205
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,100
Very true. Young man, you are sensible.

206
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,750
Remember it well.

207
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,050
Okay, don't just talk. Start eating.

208
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,830
Thanks, Uncle.

209
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,090
The rice is so good.

210
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,620
Xiaoyu purchased this rice cooker recently.

211
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,590
The rice cooks well as the one cooked with firewood, very delicious.

212
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,090
Eat more if you like.

213
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,760
Thank you, Uncle.

214
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,450
You can have as much as you want.

215
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,410
What floor?

216
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,160
Third floor.

217
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,770
Welcome in. Do you have a reservation?

218
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,990
Yes, for Chu Ting.

219
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,760
Please wait.

220
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,460
Miss Chu, this way, please.

Hello? Miss Elise.

237
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,280
A food critic seems to have come to the restaurant.

238
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,510
I've never seen her here before. She's taking notes on her phone as she eats.

239
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,500
Okay, I got it.

240
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,860
Please enjoy your dessert.

241
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,810
Thank you.

242
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,820
Is the food not good?

243
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,970
Aren't you at an event?

244
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,120
It seems that you know my schedule very well.

245
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,470
I'm done eating. I'm just about to pack the rest to go.

246
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,590
That's perfect. I want to see Oliver, too.

247
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,710
You sent Lin Kesong in for a taste test while I was gone.

248
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,260
How much do you not trust me? Do you trust her that much?

249
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,610
I only trust the truth. If nothing's wrong, I'll apologize to you. Otherwise, you can apologize to me!

250
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,630
Lin Kesong, what was different between what you ate and what I described to you?

251
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,620
I tasted bell peppers and shallots in the octopus.

252
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,760
I remember you told me it had green peppers.

253
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,250
Are you going to explain?

254
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,910
Your apprentice's sense of taste sure is amazing.

255
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,930
This dish had bell peppers and shallots

256
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,060
when we ate it together in Spain.

257
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,400
I remember that. You don't need to remind me. I replaced the bell peppers

258
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,830
for green pepper powder, and got rid of the shallots because I didn't like the taste!

259
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,350
Why did you add them back in?

260
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,110
For the memories, Oliver.

261
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,030
Our memories.

- Cheers for Yuxuan!

267
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,430
Elise, Yuxuan wouldn't be what it is today

268
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,590
without you. We also wouldn't have a Michelin three-star restaurant.

269
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,580
Three stars!

270
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,820
- Three stars.
- Okay, let's drink three glasses of wine.

271
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,700
Three glasses of wine. No, no, no.

272
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,060
- You're gonna finish the drink. One, two, three.
- Drink.

273
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,290
- And one more.
- Okay. One, two, three. Drink!

274
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,390
Hurry. Before he finds out.

275
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,190

281
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,730
Goodnight.

282
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,020
Elise, what are you doing here?

283
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,640
Oliver, why didn't you answer my calls?

284
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,020
My mom and brother have been waiting for you for two hours.

285
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,160
And you're still in the kitchen? How can you do this?

286
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,590
I'm sorry. I didn't hear it ring.

287
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,530
I told you about this before.

288
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,930
I know. I won't do this again. I'll go get changed now, okay?

289
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,460
Here we go again, Oliver. You keep saying next time.

290
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,040
It's been a hundred times! How am I supposed to trust you?

291
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,910
This is my brother and my mom we're talking about. It's their first time in China and this is how you treat them?

292
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,890
You only care about your dishes. You don't care about me at all!

293
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,230
Are you done? Let's just forget it and break up!

Sister Nina, I can't fall asleep.

Sister Nina, why is Mr. Jiang and Elise's relationship so strange?

305
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,570
It's a long story.

306
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,990
Were they lovers?

307
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,910
They got together for a bit when London's Yuxuan became a three-star restaurant,

308
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,640
but they broke up before Shanghai's Yuxuan opened for business.

309
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,760
Mr. Jiang broke it off.

310
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,650
Elise is so beautiful and competent.

311
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,700
How could Mr. Jiang be willing to break up with her?

312
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,960
You have no idea.

313
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,860
Elise is usually very calm,

314
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,630
but she's didn't act like herself when she dated him.

315
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,730
She got very possessive.

316
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,700
When she was living with us, she clung to Mr. Jiang very much.

317
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,390
She wanted to be with him for 25 hours a day. He also had to keep saying that he loved her.

318
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,700
I thought she would be a strong woman.

319
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,920
I didn't expect her to be so insecure.

320
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,990
Couldn't Mr. Jiang stand it?

321
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,340
He couldn't. Oliver spent all his energy cooking.

322
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,020
He often neglected Elise's feelings,

323
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,510
so they had endless arguments.

324
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,640
The most intense argument they had, Elise destroyed the kitchen.

325
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,540
That's not what a good relationship is. It depleted all of their energy.

326
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,420
Oliver couldn't focus on work at all, so he broke up with Elise.

327
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:59,420
What's strange is that Elise was very calm when she left him.

328
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,230
Sister Nina.

329
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,960
How long have you known Mr. Jiang?

330
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,560
It's been ten years.

331
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,260
Ten years ago, I was working for Montgomery.

332
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,590
One day, Montgomery brought home a young man.

333
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,820
He said that he discovered him in a small restaurant in London's Chinatown

334
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,220
and that he must take him in as his apprentice.

335
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,980
The young man was Oliver.

336
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:34,340
Four years ago, Montgomery passed away, and I started working for Oliver.

337
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,070
It's about time.

338
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,800
I'm going to rest. You should go to bed early, too.

339
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,210
Good night, Sister Nina!

340
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,820
Good night.

341
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:01,020
Jiang Qianfan and Elise's love is horrifying.

342
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,390
Sister Nina said that's bad love.

343
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:08,730
What does good love look like?

344
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,250
Hey, wake up.

345
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,760
Hey.

346
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,940
What's the matter?

347
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,100
Why are you sleeping here?

348
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,530
What time is it?

349
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,500
It's two o'clock.

350
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,290
Good night, Mr. Jiang.

351
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,750
I'll give you five minutes to brush your teeth, wash your face and change your clothes. See you at the door.

352
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,010
What are you going to do now?

353
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,850
Where are we going exactly?

354
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,850
Hurry up.

355
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,150
Taking you for training. Hands.

356
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:18,430
What training? It's so late.

357
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,360
Cut the crap.

358
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,820
Don't you want to learn the secret recipe?

359
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,210
Who wants to learn secrets at two o'clock in the morning?

360
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,200
I'm taking you to find the ingredients.

361
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,390
If we wait until you wake up, the secrets will be all gone.

362
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,830
Buck up.

363
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,530
Today is training, what were the first two days?

364
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,990
The first two days were a warm-up.

365
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,920
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

366
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,020
You're impatient. A warm-up removes your impatience and gets you to zero.

367
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,150
That way you can learn new things. Understand?

368
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,120
Wake up.

369
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,720
Wake up.

370
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,300
Time to eat!

371
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,420
Where are we?

372
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,120
Organic farm.

373
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,230
Here.

374
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,620
Wake up.

375
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,060
- Good morning, Mr. Jiang.
- Morning.

376
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,370
They are all Yuxuan's cooks.

377
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,030
It's too early to choose the ingredients, they are sick.

378
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,500
Here, taste it.

379
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,320
You're joking. It's too early for this. My stomach will be burnt.

380
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,760
I'm not joking. Eat it.

381
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,360
It's not spicy. It's sweet.

382
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,060
This is not quite the same as the kind we usually eat, right?

383
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,640
This green pepper is exactly the kind we usually eat.

384
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,070
Green peppers are at their sweetest

385
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,300
from 3:10 a.m. to 3:30 a.m.

386
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,570
But from the moment they pick them up,

387
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,340
the sweetness is rapidly decreasing at a rate of 15% per hour.

388
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:04,640
The ingredients we buy in the market taste so much different from their original flavor.

389
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,330
How do you keep them fresh?

390
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,670
Because of this, I never use green peppers in my dishes.

391
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,660
Green peppers are just one-eighth of the many dipping sauces available at Yuxian.

392
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,960
If you have to use green peppers, you should only make it into the sauce when it is at its sweetest,

393
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,700
and then put it in a bag with Nitrogen to prevent it from oxidizing.

394
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,930
It's such a hassle to get just an eighth of the dipping sauce. This guy is paranoid.

395
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,470
What did you say?

396
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,060
You better start getting to know me fast.

397
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,830
Take this.

398
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,690
Take the one you just ate as a benchmark and pick the best ones for me.

399
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,140
You have to eat the wrong ones.

400
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,230
You heard me right. Now go.

401
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,830
On your right.

402
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,840
Just ate five green peppers at 3:30 a.m. I now look like green pepper.

403
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,730
If you hadn't eaten five green peppers for vitamins and water,

404
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,700
would you have the strength to whine to me now?

405
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,350
Thank you so much.

406
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,020
You are welcome.

407
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,630
Where are we going?

408
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,700
Looking for snails.

409
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,770
Do snails eat green peppers? I'll give them to snails.

410
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,860
Snails eat things that contain water, like your brain.

411
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,970
Are we there yet?

412
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,020
Why aren't they moving?

413
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,700
The snail sleeps for six months out of the year.

414
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,570
During this time, they do not eat or grow.

415
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,520
The ones you are looking at are almost a year old.

416
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,350
They're all sleeping, so what are we doing, Mr. Jiang?

417
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,670
Snails are afraid of sunlight. Are you afraid of sunlight?

418
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,610
They will not wake up during the day even if they are put in water.

419
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,730
Even if they wake up, the efficiency of water absorption is not high, and the meat will not be delicate.

420
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,370
Same as me. If I don't sleep for 24 hours a day,

421
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,370
I don't think my flesh is delicate either.

422
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:17,550
Right, so when you choose your kind as ingredients,

423
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:22,450
choose the ones with two fingers wide, smooth body shape, not deformed, not oversized.

424
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,460
Hold out your hand.

425
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,680
What are you doing?

426
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,120
Put it in your hand and weigh it, it is heavy enough for its flesh to be good.

427
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,770
Go find them.

428
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,710
If I found the wrong ones,

429
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,490
may I keep them as pets?

430
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,380
If you got the wrong ones, I'll put them on your forehead.

431
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,810
Let's go!

432
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,400
Let me help you.

433
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,040
Who are you looking for to buy fish this early? The Sea Dragon King?

434
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,910
There really is a Sea Dragon King. Look closely.

435
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,630
See? That is the Sea Dragon King.

436
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,690
His name is Ao Rixin. His fish were caught one by one.

437
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,320
If you use a net to catch fish, the fish will collide with each other in the net,

438
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,530
their skin will be injured and the texture will be bad.

439
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,970
Another paranoia.

440
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,490
He is worse than me.

441
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,890
He sells what he catches. No reservation.

442
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,600
Morning, Captain!

443
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,520
Morning, Mr. Jiang. Good haul today. It's just a shame that

444
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,580
all the fish were sold.

445
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:13,460
How come? Aren't we the first guests you see ashore?

446
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,520
Are you sure?

447
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,760
What are you doing here?

448
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,590
Morning, Oliver. I knew you were coming this morning, so I got on the boat last night.

449
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,110
I bought whatever Captain Ao caught.

450
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,920
These fish are all mine now.

451
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,350
How could you do this? If you bought them all, what will others buy?

452
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:35,660
You can have fish if you want, Lin Kesong, if you make a bet with me.

453
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,340
How did you know my name?

454
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,800
Of course, Princess Evil Dragon.

455
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,840
Because I am the winner of this year's Future Star Culinary Competition.

456
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,540
Elise's younger brother, Victor.

457
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,050
The competition hasn't started yet, and yet you're the winner?

458
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,450
- Fine!
- Victor what?

459
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,120
What's the bet?

460
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:13,070
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

461
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,120
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

462
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,500
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

463
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:27,290
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

464
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,510
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

465
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:34,620
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

466
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:40,280
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
