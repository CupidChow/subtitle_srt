[Episode 17]

9
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,510
Great. Your fight was amazing to watch.

10
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,450
Although freestyle fighting is fun to watch,

11
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,780
I must remind you that this is a cooking competition

12
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,790
and that you guys are also the mentors of all these young chefs.

13
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,820
He's right.

14
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,450
We'll see each other at the competition.

15
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,340
Thank you.

16
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,710
For what?

17
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,410
For fighting?

18
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,120
This is the first time a man has fought for me.

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,410
You're happy about that?

20
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,650
What's there to be happy about? You would actually get hurt if you kept going.

21
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,830
Are you worried that I might lose to him? I'll fight him again.

22
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,670
Enough.

23
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,960
I'm just joking. I'm not that senseless.

24
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,210
Come on. Eat the food you made.

25
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,020
Recall the steps.

26
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,280
Who made this? It's so delicious.

27
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,190
Did you lose your mind?

28
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,730
Hurry and eat.

29
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,860
Here, you can become famous overnight or suffer a great loss.

30
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,000
No one will remember the second most delicious dish, nor the chef who comes in second place.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Welcome to the Future Star Culinary Competition's opening match.

32
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,910
First, let's welcome the chairman of the competition committee, Mr. Thomas.

33
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,470
This way.

34
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,580
What are you doing? Don't touch my stuff!

35
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,620
So, it is really Okinawa spinach.

36
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,700
How did you know?

37
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,250
Contestants, please enter.

38
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,840
Please wait, I'll rush them immediately.

39
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,770
Xiao Lin, hurry with our dishes too!

40
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,010
I apologize. Continue to enjoy your meal. I'll rush them.

41
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,200
All right, the Mueller's Future Star Culinary Competition's opening competition

42
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,980
that everyone has been looking forward to for a long time is about to begin.

43
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,530
The theme of this competition is Wild Greens.

44
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,330
Every contestant has a paper bag with our logo in front of them.

45
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,880
It holds the fresh ingredients they gathered from around the world.

46
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,780
I announce that the competition officially begins now.

47
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,520
What should I do? I've only ever eaten my mom's Shepherd's Purse Wontons.

48
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,650
Shepherd's Purse mixed with pork.

49
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,850
I'll just make that.

50
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,780
Boil for a long time in water.

51
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,590
[What Victor is doing is inappropriate.]

52
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,800
[Yeah, I was surprised too.]

53
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,800
Mr. Jiang, here's the needle and thread you asked for.

54
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,840
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

55
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,050
Change the channel.

56
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,360
They're not making any sense. Change it to a legal channel or something.

57
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,420
Why change it to a legal channel?

58
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,060
And that was your breakthrough?

59
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,810
This cooking channel works too.

60
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,930
- This one?
- Let's watch.

61
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,900
Doesn't that girl look like Lin Feng's daughter, Xiaoyu?

62
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,280
That is Xiaoyu. Her name is at the bottom.

63
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Isn't that right.

64
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,340
Call Lin Feng right away to congratulate him.

65
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,960
Why should I call? To congratulate him that Xiaoyu is better than Kesong?

66
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,030
You're so petty.

67
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,760
That's our daughter, right?

68
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,210
If I'm not watching this contestant cook with water hyacinth,

69
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,960
I wouldn't be sure if it was edible.

70
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,790
It seems like our contestants are all utilizing their strengths.

71
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,950
Let's go over to the contestant known as the young genius, Victor.

72
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,980
He is indeed unique.

73
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,660
The ingredients he picked out should be quail and Okinawa spinach.

74
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,300
Very interesting.

75
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,990
Houteng Feiniao is making cod.

76
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,730
Isn't the theme of the competition wild greens?

77
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,270
I'll make the schizonepeta with agar-agar.

78
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,170
- Just wait and see.
- It sounds very high-tech.

79
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,500
It seems like each of our contestants has very unique skills.

80
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,120
Next, let's interview Contestant Lin Kesong.

81
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,380
You're chopping the meat so vigorously. What dish will you present to us?

82
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,570
It seems like she's really in the zone right now. Let's not disturb her and move on to the next contestant.

83
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,450
Is she making Shepherd's Purse Wontons?

84
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,430
It seems like it.

85
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,950
It'll take forever for her to finish chopping that meat. She should've used egg.

86
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,940
You're talking about using egg now,

87
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,110
but why didn't you make Shepherd's purse with egg for her when she asked while she was home?

88
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,780
Xiaoyu is almost done.

89
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,090
But Kesong has just finished rolling out her wrappings. It doesn't look like she'll finish in time.

90
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,710
She will. It'll take two minutes for the filling, one minute to wrap, three minutes to cook,

91
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,240
and one minute to plate. She has more than enough time,

92
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,140
but Shepherd's Purse…

93
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,470
A reminder to all the contestants, you have ten seconds left.

94
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,940
Ten.

95
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,340
Nine.

96
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,830
Eight.

97
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,020
Seven.

98
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,320
Six.

99
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,600
Five.

100
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,020
Four.

101
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,350
Three.

102
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,520
Two.

103
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,580
One.

104
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,430
Time's up!

105
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,740
She got her clumsiness from you.

106
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,280
Mr. Song, I got it.

107
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,220
Amazing. Thanks!

108
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,830
I'm sure our eight contestants just had the most nerve-wracking hour of their lives.

109
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,110
However, it's nothing compared to what's next.

110
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,050
Next, please present your work for the assessment

111
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,670
of the world's most professional judges.

112
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,030
Let's take a look at Blu's work.

113
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,230
Can you introduce your dish to us?

114
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,390
It's Pontederia Crassipes, braised lion's head meatball. Commonly known as braised lion's head meatball with water hyacinth.

115
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,650
Pontederia Crassipes is the scientific name.

116
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,890
Mr. Huang taught me that water hyacinth has a slightly bitter taste that can reduce internal body heat and detoxify.

117
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,880
The bitterness can balance out the greasiness of the lion's head.

118
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,980
As we can see, in the hands of the right person,

119
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,120
wild greens can give be perceived as herbal medicine.

120
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,200
Thank you. Let's take a look at our next contestant.

121
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,700
This is Victor's dish.

122
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,250
That's right, he made Okinawa spinach and quail.

123
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,770
Can you give us an introduction to your dish?

124
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,950
Water spinach has a slightly bitter taste, but it also has a faint fruity aroma,

125
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,720
so I used sour, sweet, and salty tastes to balance out the bitterness of the water spinach.

126
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,640
It also allows the bitterness to better blend with the quail breast.

127
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,930
It sounds very interesting. Let's anticipate our next contestant.

128
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,900
Houteng Feiniao, your dish looks just like a work of art. Can you tell us its name?

129
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,980
This is cold cod with schizonepeta. I named it Refreshing Ocean.

130
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,880
It does have an ocean vibe to it. Where does the refreshing come in?

131
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,150
The cod was cooked slowly at a low temperature and the sauce is made

132
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,480
of schizonepeta and agar-agar in liquid nitrogen. It's definitely tasty and refreshing.

133
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,520
It sounds very appetizing. Let's move on to our next contestant.

134
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,210
Next, let's take a look at Lin Kesong's dish.

135
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:41,480
Fair Maiden Princess, where's your dish?

136
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,390
I wanted to make Shepherd's Purse Wontons.

137
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,280
But…

138
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,130
I'm afraid I can only say I'm really sorry.

139
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,890
Let's look at Joanna's.

140
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,850
Embarrassing.

141
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,710
What are they laughing at? That's my daughter!

142
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,400
She's not for you to ridicule! I'm so angry.

143
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,900
She's already there. What's the use in saying all of this?

144
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,320
We tell this child to not do such things,

145
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,100
yet she still went on such a TV program.

146
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,850
How embarrassing! She's embarrassing us on TV.

147
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,800
I don't think a program she can get on will have many viewers. Not many people will know about this.

148
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,800
That's right. Look at all those youngsters.

149
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,430
You would even do better than them if you went on there.

150
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,130
It'd be a piece of cake for me,

151
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,230
but to be honest, I still think Xiaoyu is better than Kesong.

152
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,560
Not by much.

153
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,770
The judges are currently having a heated discussion.

154
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,920
They'll be tasting the dishes in a bit. Let's look forward to the results of the competition.

155
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,020
Still not coming?

156
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,260
Bear it.

157
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,710
Bear it.

158
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,620
You just wait.

159
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,430
You just wait.

160
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,300
Why did you switch out my ingredients?

161
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,690
Because you're not qualified to make Okinawa spinach.

162
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,670
What do you mean?

163
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,910
Because my sister specially planted Okinawa spinach for Jiang Qianfan.

164
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,320
To be exact, my sister sowed the seeds with a drone.

165
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,470
The same with Shepherd's Purse. She planted the Okinawa spinach for Jiang Qianfan only. You're not qualified to use it,

166
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,720
but I didn't expect you to not know how to make Shepherd's Purse.

167
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,460
Sorry.

168
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,690
Look at Kesong standing there.

169
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,180
The most exciting moment is here.

170
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,460
Let me announce the results of the Future Star Cooking Competition's first round.

171
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,630
In first place… I'll read the judge's comments first.

172
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,490
Among the eight contestants, the ingredients he picked were the most bitter.

173
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,570
Bitterness itself will naturally cause displeasure,

174
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,140
but in the hands of this British young man, the bitterness became tender and sweet.

175
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,690
It transformed into a unique flavor.

176
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,320
It brings us peace and harmony on this summer day.

177
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,830
In the first place is Victor Quentin. Congratulations!

178
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,570
In second place… The judge's comments are…

179
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,220
Her dish includes goji berries and silkworms,

180
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,330
both crispy after deep frying. It's crispy upon bite and leaves a sweet aftertaste.

181
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:10,350
This is a dish with unique Eastern characteristics. Congratulations, Lin Xiaoyu.

182
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,160
Xiaoyu got second place! Eastern characteristics!

183
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,340
A casual dish you make has Eastern characteristics.

184
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,790
It's been so long. What place did Kesong come in exactly?

185
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,760
In eighth place, Lin Kesong. Because you didn't finish your dish,

186
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,090
the judges didn't have any comments for you, just a score.

187
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,040
Your score is zero. It's such a pity.

188
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,220
Thank you, everyone. The first round of the Future Star Culinary Competition has come to an end.

189
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,430
Let's look forward to the next round. Thank you.

190
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,660
Jiang Qianfan, you made me miserable.

191
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,120
I really thought you tasted it from the stream.

192
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,260
I can't believe you were leading me by the nose. You put on a great show.

193
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,030
I'm sorry. It's my fault for not teaching you to make other dishes.

194
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,950
I don't want to see you.

195
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,450
Old Lin! Old Lin, I just saw the competition.

196
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,140
You looked very cute when you turned on the stove. It's true.

197
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,990
Are you mocking me?

198
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,040
I'm not.

199
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,660
Don't cry, Old Lin. It's not a big deal. It's just a competition.

200
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,790
I can just hold another one for you!

201
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,010
You are really a good comforter.

202
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,560
I haven't settled the score with you yet. Old Lin's cooking wasn't like this before.

203
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,570
It got worse after you started teaching her. Don't lead your apprentice astray.

204
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,410
- Continue.
- What are you doing?

205
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,920
- Why are you taking pictures? Give me your phone. You can't do that!
- Why?

206
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,280
- What are you doing? Go away.
- Give me the phone!

207
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,780
Are you done messing around?

208
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,260
Isn't it already humiliating for me?

209
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,190
You're still taking pictures? Give me the phone!

210
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,890
Lin Kesong.

211
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,340
Lin Kesong!

212
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,490
Lin Kesong!

213
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,870
Lin Kesong! Where are you going?

214
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,740
You're too frivolous!

215
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,980
Are you a princess who has been spoiled all her life?

216
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,020
I told you that even if you were going after the sweet aftertaste,

217
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,560
it still needs to be covered with bitterness!

218
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,030
That's how life truly tastes. Bitter and tough!

219
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,820
If life was as lighthearted as you made your dish,

220
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,900
that is heaven!

221
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,820
But I got second place.

222
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,820
Little sloth, what are you doing?

223
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,820
I'm looking for Xiaoyu.

224
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,740
You tag-along bug.

225
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,350
From morning to night, you eat, drink, and have fun.

226
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:58,060
You still won fourth place. Are you... very happy?

227
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,680
You're right, but Xiaoyu is the amazing one.

228
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,490
She won second place in the first round.

229
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:09,780
I'm prepared to take her out to a celebratory meal.

230
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,940
She can't go anywhere!

231
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,300
Do you think second place is glamorous? Huh?

232
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,040
- You're right. Yes.
- No!

233
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,520
It's extremely humiliating!

234
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,250
Besides the first place, other places mean nothing.

235
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,460
Because this world is only fit for first place!

236
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,420
You better leave.

237
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,040
He's crazy. Let's leave.

238
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,070
I'm not going.

239
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,640
Leave!

240
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,090
Boris, from now on,

241
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,370
I'll stay in the kitchen 24/7.

242
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,740
That's what I like to hear.

243
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,050
Xiaoyu!

244
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,260
Dad.

245
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,350
Come home with me!

246
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,300
You still want to manage her? No way!

247
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,820
Get out of the way! She's my daughter.

248
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,950
- Are you kidding? Are you going to compete or not?
- What is he going on about?

249
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,930
I'm fine. He was just hit by Jiang Qianfan.

250
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,590
He deserves it!

251
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,490

[Xiaoyu's Private Kitchen]

253
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,890
Dad, did you just see Lin Kesong embarrassing herself?

254
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,070
Someone like her still wants to compete with me? She asked for it.

255
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,830
Dad! Why are you ignoring me?

256
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,510
Are you unhappy with my performance? Boris is also unhappy with my performance.

257
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,250
This time, I just didn't use my full potential. Next time, I'll get first place for sure.

258
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,650
I see that you still haven't realized your mistake.

259
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,420
I just got a bit too carried away with my training,

260
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,720
but to succeed, it's necessary to give up something.

261
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,270
What else will you give up? Give up familial relationships?

262
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,020
Or will you give up your responsibilities?

263
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,720
Dad, it's not that serious.

264
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,020
You can't prevent me from competing.

265
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,230
Depending on your behavior!

266
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,450
Are you tired?

267
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,290
Lin Kesong.

268
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,640
Can you stop being mad? Listen to me. Quit it, Lin Kesong!

269
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,880
How far are you going to walk? What's wrong with you?

270
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:23,300
Old Lin, I made Kesong's bed and packed everything.

271
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,730
You better don't go. Let me pick her up and bring her back?

272
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,060
If I don't go, then who will drive you there?

273
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,550
Furthermore, if I don't go, you'll be soft-hearted.

274
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,660
I… I've lost all my face, how can I still be soft-hearted?

275
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,150
Correct. Both the address and name are correct.

276
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,710
Remember, it's 20 bouquets and five baskets.

277
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,060
Make sure the flowers in the bouquets and baskets aren't the same. Leave a card in each one.

Hello, baby.

280
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,420
Yiran, why am I getting messages from the Future Star Competition?

281
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,280
It says that the registration was unsuccessful.

282
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,110
I wanted to cheer for Old Lin,

283
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,270
so I registered all my friends' phone numbers online, including yours.

284
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,350
But I saw the message you left for her. It's pretty touching.

285
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,780
I did leave a voicemail.

286
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,190
I left it because I felt sorry for her.

287
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,700
Darling, I just did something really awesome.

288
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,160
I just went online and bought a lot of flowers for Old Lin,

289
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,780
but I didn't put my name.

290
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,120
- You're pushing your luck.
- What?

291
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,090
That's good.

292
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,690
Then, what do you want to eat tonight. I'll treat you.

293
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,040
I don't have time tonight. I'm keeping a friend company.

294
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,540
Friend? What friend? Do I know this friend?

295
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,860
A friend I've known for many years. He's a male model. You don't know him.

296
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,000
He's heartbroken and wants a heart-to-heart talk.

297
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,800
Male model. Heartbroken and wants to talk to you?

298
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,820
- Didn't you say that it's important to draw lines?
- I was influenced by you.

299
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,490
I feel that there needs to be heart and effort between friends. It's the same for men and women.

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,360
Because Jiang Qianfan set me up and lied to me.

318
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Especially because I know he lost his sense of taste, but still needs to fight head-on.

319
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:38,140
Thinking of it makes my heart hurt.

320
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:52,850
Dear classmate, Lin Kesong.

321
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,000
My Idol, Lin Kesong.

322
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,170
Classmate.

323
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,850
- Hurry up.
- Coming!

324
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,750
You're all late.

325
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,690
Mr. Jiang, let me explain.

326
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,320
We saw online that someone was making fun of Ms. Lin Kesong.

327
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,090
- We thought making fun of Ms. Lin is making fun of you, and thus Yuxuan Restaurant. We can't let that happen, right?
- Right.

328
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,650
So we were arguing back and forth.

329
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,380
Thanks for caring about Yuxuan Restaurant.

330
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,800
- Yichao.
- Yes.

331
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,570
You are overwhelmed with washing piles of vegetables these days, right?

332
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,800
We consistently process 75 kg of vegetables a day.

333
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,310
I'll assign one more person to help you.

334
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,690
- Da Mai
- Yes.

335
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,410
- You go.
- Huh?

336
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,690
That's it for today's meeting. Keep up the good work. Thank you.

337
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,460
- B-but...
- Why Da Mai?

338
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,390
That's right. This...

339
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,480
- Hey, Da Mai!
- Da Mai!

340
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,590
Da Mai! Da Mai!

341
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,740
Oliver, a word?

342
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,120
If it's about Da Mai, then save your breath.

343
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,970
If you allow him to be one minute late today,

344
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,360
he may be two minutes late tomorrow,

345
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,600
and who knows what else he'll do the day after?

346
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,250
Yuxuan Restaurant needs your decisiveness.

347
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,520
I'm not against your decision.

348
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,120
I want to ask you about the competition.

349
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,440
Everything that was said before, came true.

350
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,380
You've also seen everyone's response.

351
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,120
Lin Kesong has challenged your authority.

352
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,980
If she's still coming in last, it'll be a big problem.

353
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,400
Did Victor know we grew Shepherd's Purse and the Okinawa spinach ourselves?

354
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,680
Uh..

355
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,140
My mom told him.

356
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,790
No wonder.

357
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,210
He must have told Lin Kesong,

358
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,380
or else she wouldn't have told me she hated me immediately after the competition.

359
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,520
We've never kept it from her.

360
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,020
No,

361
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:35,200
but what Boris did that day at the event must have led her to doubt my taste buds.

362
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,060
She's not good at hiding her feelings. Although she didn't say anything,

363
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,910
it's written all over her face.

364
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,280
I just want to tell her I found the wild greens by taste.

365
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,260
Oh my god, what should we do if she asks?

366
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,040
I don't know.

367
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,240
Thank you. Please come again.

368
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,740
Turn the car off.

369
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,920
Welcome. Please come in. A table for two?

370
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,530
- No, go get your boss.
- Okay.

371
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,330
- Uncle Lin! Uncle Lin!
- Yes?

372
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,170
For you.

373
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,800
Eldest Brother! Sister-in-Law!

374
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,230
You guys, why didn't you let me know you're coming?

375
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,620
You still have the nerve.

376
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,030
Don't mind your brother. We're here

377
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,750
to see Kesong. Is she here?

378
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,630
She... Kesong went grocery shopping.

379
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,310
You didn't call her?

380
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,400
No, we didn't.

381
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,550
We just want to see her real situation.

382
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,700
Um... Xiao Feng,

383
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,040
we watched the competition.

384
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,850
- What?
- Hey!

385
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,090
Uncle, Auntie, you're here.

386
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,190
What do you want to eat? I'll cook for you.

387
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,180
Oh, we... we're not hungry.

388
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,250
I saw you on TV.

389
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,030
You're amazing!

390
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,630
Can... Can I ask you,

391
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,710
why is Kesong there as well

392
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,250
and in last place?

393
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,800
- That...
- Why is she there? That's the question.

394
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,250
- I have to go back to work.
- Come back!

395
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,010
What are you implying? Tell us.

396
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:18,030
Uncle, it's a long story, but my sister is smart

397
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,980
and has enough brains. Don't worry about her. As for me, I'm just busy with my professional work.

398
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,090
- Right, right. Go, go back to your professional work.
- You keep quiet!

399
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,000
Xiao Yu, keep going.

400
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,610
There is not much to say.

401
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,780
I just hope when my sister gets rich one day,

402
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,110
she won't forget us, her poor relatives.

403
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:40,000
Xiao Yu, you're making me even more confused. How is she getting rich?

404
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,460
With Jiang Qianfan, of course! He's a masterchef.

405
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,040
- He has two Michelin restaurants!
- Xiao Yu!

406
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,820
No, Dad! Why do you keep hiding? What are you hiding for my sister?

407
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,020
Me? Hiding? What am I hiding?

408
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,070
She moved to Jiang Qianfan's place a long time ago.

409
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,630
She moved there since coming to Shanghai.

410
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,400
Mo-moved to his place? For what?

411
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,070
It's called pri-private training.

412
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,960
Xiao Feng, this is serious. Why didn't you tell us?

413
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,230
No... Eldest bro... I was afraid you guys wouldn't be okay with it.

414
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,650
Where's Kesong now?

415
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,650
I can ask.

416
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,690
Go ask. We need to see what she's up to!

417
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,660
No one is allowed to inform her in advance.

418
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,390
- Okay. I'll watch my dad.
- You!

419
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,980
Xiao Yu, go now.

420
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,160
- Xiao Feng, what can I say?
- Come on.

421
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,980
No, it's not what you think.

422
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,410
That's enough. Wait and see.

423
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:40,360
[Perseverance is the warm breeze and rain that melts a glacier. Perseverance is putting your mind to forging ahead. May success find you! Work hard!]

424
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,810
[Old Lin, there is an article on the official website of the competition written by your fans. It's very well written. I am forwarding it to you.]

425
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:20,090

00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,820
Why are you guys here?

430
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,210
Why can't we be here?

431
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,670
Xiao Yu told us the address.

432
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,190
Seriously,

433
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,730
why didn't you tell us you moved out? Look how angry your dad is, huh?

434
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,700
What is dad doing?

435
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,190
Come on, you know your dad. Hold your tongue.

436

Dad, what are you doing?

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,140
Where's the guy?

438
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,670
What do you mean by "that guy"?

439
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,090
Mr. Jiang went to work!

440
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,740
Pack your stuff now and come home with me.

441
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,240
What are you talking about? I've got another competition coming up.

442
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,660
Kesong, you are old enough to have a boyfriend. Your dad and I are fine with that,

443
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,240
but you've got to let us know before starting a relationship.

444
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,630
I'm not in a relationship!

445
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,840
Furthermore,

446
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,600
don't you know what you are capable of?

447
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,960
And you go make a fool of yourself on TV.

448
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,360
Are you telling the whole world you and that Jiang guy are together?

449
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,070
We are not together!

450
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,170
Stop denying it. Xiao Yu told me everything!

451
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,370
Pack your stuff, let's go home!

452
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,100
Stop fooling around! Give your mom a break!

453
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,310
At least let me explain to him before I leave!

454
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,530
What are you trying to say?

455
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,440
So there's someone to back you up now? You're trying to negotiate?

456
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,450
Go pack!

457
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:47,760
All right, all right. Calm down. Can't you talk to her nicely?

458
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,960
Yelling at her like that doesn't help.

459
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,350
Will she listen if I talk nicely?

460
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,360
- You...
- Go help her, hurry.

461
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,310
You are using me as an excuse to yell at her.

462
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,700
Hey, come look at this!

463
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,820
These flowers are all for our daughter.

464
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,610
Gosh, there are so many of them.

465
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,600
Come look, hurry.

466
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,210
Obviously, there are so many flowers in the house. Is there a memorial service?

467
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,690
Watch your tongue!

468
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,300
Mom cares about who sent the flowers.

469
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,640
Dad cares about how close I am to Jiang Qianfan's bedroom.

470
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,730
As for me, I lost the ability to make my voice heard

471
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,470
in front of my parents long ago.

472
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,810
All I can think of is to see Jiang Qianfan one more time.

473
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,150
Say goodbye to him.

474
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,160
I'm very worried about him. I want to see him again.

475
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,540
I insisted, and my parents agreed.

476
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,450
You are staying in this room?

477
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,490
It doesn't even have a door.

478
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,370
That guy can come in whenever he wants.

479
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,430
Cut it out.

480
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:17,750
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

481
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,570
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

482
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,900
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

483
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:32,300
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

484
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,100
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

485
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:40,360
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

486
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,050
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
