[Episode 37]

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,810
Got it?

10
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,430
What's on your mind?

11
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,080
The same as your reason for drinking. Mom,

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,400
is Elise in even more serious trouble?

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,980
What's with this nonsense?

14
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,810
Jiang Qianfan is blind. It has something to do with her, right?

15
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,980
He only lost his sense of taste. It was only a minor injury.

16
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,800
But if he turns blind...

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,120
It's from the side effect of the drug he takes. It has nothing to do with your sister.

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,430
Don't overthink it.

19
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,130
What you need to do right now is to prepare yourself

20
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,940
for the final round.

21
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,240
Mom, is there even a cliffhanger for this competition?

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,940
On the official poster of Mueller's Future Star, you are the queen and I'm the genius.

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,470
And we are working together to compete with Lin Kesong and a blind guy.

24
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,100
Even if Jiang QIanfan agrees to make dessert,

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,250
what's the point of getting the trophy anyway?

26
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,550
I better off quit the competition

27
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,010
and hand the trophy over to Jiang Qianfan and Lin Kesong.

28
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,660
After all, my sister cause the damage.

29
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,160
Shut up!

30
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,640
Remember, Victor,

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,140
you have no idea what happened between your sister and Jiang Qianfan. How many times do I have to tell you?

32
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,440
Cooking competitions are serious and sacred. How could you quit whenever you feel like it?

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,560
The meaning of competing the final round is not about whether if you beat Lin Kesong or not.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,080
It is about presenting your best and let the world know about your skills.

35
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,120
I tell you what. I will not allow you to give up.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,520
Mom, why are you so mad?

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,620
I don't know anything. I will be ready for the competition. Alright?

38
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,970
That's more like it.

39
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,110
Let's sprinkle some sugar powder on top.

40
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,540
Yes.

41
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,930
Just a little bit.

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,980
So many kinds, isn't it?

43
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,620
Yes.

44
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,680
The taste of sweet is the taste of sugar and honey.

45
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,340
It's the kind of taste that makes people feel happy immediately.

46
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,730
Everywhere in the world, sweet represents happiness and content.

47
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,040
You see, Boris brought many kinds of sugar.

48
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,540
It's Big Head.

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,060
Take it.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,990
Hello, what's up?

51
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,040
What are you up to?

52
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,030
I'm training. Spit it out.

53
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,650
Training? I thought Jiang Qianfan is blind.

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,650
It doesn't affect anything. I have to go. Bye.

55
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,520
What did Song Yiran say?

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,360
Nothing. He's just bored. Continue.

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,170
They are training. He's fine.

58
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,420
So fast? He's already recovered?

59
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,160
They are something else.

60
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,370
I can't believe they can get over such a big thing so quickly. I admire them more by the day.

61
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,510

64

What are you doing here?

67
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,090
Elise, isn't it enough for you to make Mr. Jiang lose his sense of taste?

68
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,980
And you want him blind now. When is it going to be enough for you?

69
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,810
No, this is not what I intended to do.

70
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,270
Didn't you say you are throwing all the poison away?

71
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,880
Did you poison him again?

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't. I really didn't!

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,470
What is really going on?

74
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,680
Who else could it be besides you?

75
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,540
You are an evil witch.

76
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,790
I am calling the police right now.

77
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,230
No. Oliver was too impatient.

78
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,200
He took too many drugs to detox.

79
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,460
It was the side effect caused by the poison and the drug.

80
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,840
I'm telling the truth. If you don't believe me, call Jun Bin and ask him right now.

81
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,530
Alright.

82
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,240
I will believe you one last time.

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,960
I think Mr. Jiang probably already give you Yuxuan.

84
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,730
I will hang in there for the while,

85
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,720
but let me tell you. I'm not doing this for you.

86
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm doing this for Mr. Jiang and Yuxuan.

87
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,230

I didn't touch the money. I will pay you back later.

The person who sold me the drug.

104
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,600
He said this drug can cure Oliver's sight and sense of taste. Is it true?

105
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,150
Here's the thing.

106
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,600
This drug what people call Hope #1

107
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,290
forces dead or closed-off nerves to open.

108
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,950
However, this drug has not past the animal testing yet.

109
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,070
Also, its side effects

110
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,520
is that it affects all nerves.

111
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,650
It will cause pain to the whole body.

112
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,620
Ordinary people can't tolerate the pain.

113
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,520
So, it can't be used on a person.

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,470
Have as much coke as you want too.

165
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,690
Thank you, Uncle.

166
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,190
Dad, he still has a can.

167
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,140
Listen. You're not allowed to get free meals from here.

168
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,380
You have to work for your meals.

169
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,350
- I got it.
- Red Bean Buns are here.

170
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,210
- Take this.
- Come.

171
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,660
Listen, I'm not trying to brag, but this red bean paste…

172
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,740
The red bean paste I made is just the right amount of sweet.

173
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,050
It's true.

174
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,790
The Red Bean Bun Brother Fatty made

175
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,010
is better than something even Victor can make.

176
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,840
Aunty, have one.

177
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,860
Aunty, have one.

178
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,220
I won't eat this one. I'll bring it to Kesong later,

179
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,770
so she can try it too.

180
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:21,190
Xiao Jiang isn't able to teach Kesong to make dessert now that he's blind.

181
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,200
Right.

182
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,190
He can't see nor taste.

183
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,570
What can we do?

184
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,070
How about this? I'll make a few of my best desserts

185
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,430
after we're done eating

186
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:36,370
to send over to my cousin. You can record it for her. I think she'll be able to learn it quickly

187
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,050
- with her current skill level.
- Great idea.

188
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,820
- That's a great idea.
- Let's do it.

189
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,110
I can make some too. Whoever can make desserts should make some.

190
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,300
Give Kesong some variety

191
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,960
so that she can come up with some ideas.

192
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,270
Who knows what difficulties she'll have to overcome at the finals?

193
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,910
- That's a great idea, Fatty.
- I'll help out too.

194
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,340
I can't cook very well, but I'm good at making Yanzhi Rice Cakes.

195
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,610
My girlfriend enjoys it anyway.

196
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,010
Don't get yourself involved in this!

197
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,210
Let's dig in!

198
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,600
Kesong.

199
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,720
There are a few key points to making custard.

200
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,440
You have to remember to stir quickly after adding the granulated sugar

201
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,030
because there's no water content in the yolk.

202
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,240
Otherwise, it'll cluster up.

203
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,840
Also, be careful to not let the temperature of the milk get too high when cooking it. Do you remember that?

204
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,710
When we were making the milk slush, I told you the temperature couldn't exceed 80 degrees.

205
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,370
Pouring the milk into the eggs while not cooking them is another point.

206
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,360
Slow down. I can't keep up.

207
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,250
Am I able to do it? No.

208
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,570
- The tragic divine chef could only rely on using his words.
- When the cream is exposed to air…

209
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,380
to teach me the basic skills of making dessert.

210
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,370
I feel upset

211
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,230
seeing him like this.

212
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,830
I want to ask fate why

213
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,160
but he seems to have already accepted his fate.

214
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,090
His calmness confuses me.

215
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,510
Stir it well.

216
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,230
Taste it after stirring.

217
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,940
Is it delicious?

218
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,520
You have to be in a good mood when making dessert for it to taste good.

219
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,510
I haven't used sugar in four years, but I'm clear that

220
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,050
even if I did use it, I wouldn't be able to use it to the best of my ability.

221
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,720
Sugar and sweetness can directly give people a pleasant feeling.

222
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,160
But that's just the basic chemistry of sweet taste.

223
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,880
A chef must put their feelings and emotions

224
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,120
into the dessert when using sugar.

225
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,050
Dessert made in this way will be touching and special.

226
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,870
It's so much work.

227
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,820
Not at all.

228
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,100
A chef must leave all their negative emotions behind before entering the kitchen.

229
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,870
They must focus on the food and cooking

230
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,630
upon entering the kitchen. That's the basic qualities a chef should have.

231
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,150
You got this. You can do it.

232
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,080
Are you in a better mood now?

233
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,100
I'll be in a good mood if you do a good job.

234
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,530
Xiaoyu, say something to your cousin.

235
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,980
Hi, sis. I'll make something for you.

236
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,900
Next is Blu.

237
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,350
Hi Kesong.

238
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,650
What is Blu making?

239
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,550
Steamed Lotus Root with Sticky Rice.

240
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,760
Looks great!

241
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,820
Xiao Lin.

242
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,080
Sister Kesong, this is my best dish, Yanzhi Rice Cake!

243
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,280
Great.

244
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,470
Where's Brother Fatty? Brother Fatty.

245
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,190
Kesong, look at what's in my hands.

246
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,580
- Can you guess what I'll be making?
- Brother Fatty, the dish you're making is the same size as you.

247
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,380
Here we go.

248
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,290
This is your dad. Say something to your daughter.

249
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,520
Daughter, look at the sugar water chestnuts

250
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,590
I'm making you. It's your favorite.

251
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,410
It's made of love. Alright.

252
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,700
Let's get

253
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,200

What are you doing here?

264
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,880
This is for you, Sister Kesong.

Sister Yu said she'd tell you. I have to get going. We're still busy at the restaurant.

267
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,880
Where are you going? What is this?

268
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,160

00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,310
What is this?

275
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,570
It's the desserts we made.

276
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,160
Take a look when you have time.

277
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,360
We just want to help you. That's all.

278
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,010
I don't know if we'd be of any help though.

279
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,330
Good luck.

280
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,550
What's going on with you? Why are you suddenly being so sentimental?

281
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,230
My dad recorded us making the desserts.

282
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,750
Blu already sent the video to Mr. Jiang's phone.

283
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,410
Watch it when you have time. Let's have a chat after the competition.

286
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,570
Thank them for me.

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,530
This one should be sugar water chestnut.

292
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,400
This one is Yanzhi Rice Cake.

293

This is Steamed Lotus Root with Sticky Rice.

294

There's also lotus cake.

This is Rose Taro.

This is Durian Cake.

297

They brought me these

298
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,800
because they think I still have a lot to learn.

299
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,120
Don't worry. I didn't think much about it.

300
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,210
It's been four years since I touched desserts.

301
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,130
I can't make any of the desserts they brought over.

303

Blu sent a video to you. Hurry and watch it to learn how to make these.

304
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,770
Are you really not mad?

305
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:02,560
Everyone is doing their best to help you. I couldn't be happier. Why would I be mad?

That's good.

311
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,810
Hey.

How about this? Taste these for your favorites.

And I'll make the ones you like first.

314
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,710
You can decide. I can't taste anything now. It'll be a waste for me to eat it.

What are you talking about? Cut to the chase.

320
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,820
Boss, didn't you get a phone call to work for another restaurant? I even got a call.

321
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,370
I'll stick with you.

322

You're talking about that? I've already gotten a dozen calls this month.

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,430
Do you really think I'm that easily convinced?

324
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,360
Hey!

325
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,320
Listen up.

326
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,090
If you want to stick with me, stay here at Yuxuan.

327
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,780
Stop thinking about this nonsense. Got it?

328
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,320
Boss, we're losing customers by the day.

329
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,020
Is there anymore hope for Yuxuan?

330
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,570
Listen up. Of course there is!

331
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,380
Boss, someone is trying to get Xiao Pa to work for them. He's requesting double his current salary.

332
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,000
It seems like the other party has agreed.

333
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,840
Who told you this?

334
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,750
Xiao Pa was on the phone outside. I overheard it when I passed by.

335
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,420
That was the basic idea.

336
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,750
He was also asking when is the latest time for he to reply?

337
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,110
- He is still on the phone outside?
- Yeah.

338
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,670
- That little brat.
- Let's check it out.

339
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,500
Mr. Pa.

340
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,360
I heard that you found a great offer. And they are offering double pay.

341
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,870
It looks like Yuxuan's little joint can't keep you anymore.

342
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,530
I will tell you later.

343
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,610
If you hang up now, the conversation is open.

344
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,330
I'm telling you to hang up!

345
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,160
Mr. Zhao, I have to go right now. I will call you later.

346
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,660
Yes. Okay.

347
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,570
Stay or not is my personal decision. It's none of your business.

348
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,550
Stop right there.

349
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,180
Listen carefully. As long as it's Yuxuan's business,

350
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,440
it has everything to do with me.

351
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,760
This is the toughest time for Yuxuan.

352
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,690
Our spirit has been shaky.

353
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,560
I thought you are the steadiest one.

354
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,950
It turns out, when something happens, you are the first one to jump ship.

355
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,410
This is not your place to say that to me, isn't it?

356
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,390
It is my place.

357
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,550
Think about it. Everything you have today is all thanks to Miss Elise.

358
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,130
How many favors did she do for you?

359
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,750
All this time everyone has been really good to you. Do you know what your behavior is called?

360
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,870
It's called being ungrateful and heartless!

361
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,070
What did I even do to deserve this label?

362
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,050
Could you be a little reasonable? Mr. Zhao called me.

363
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,830
He asked me how much do I want, so I told him. Isn't it normal?

364
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,130
Do you still have any conscience? You shouldn't have even pick up the phone, not to mention talking about the offer.

365
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,970
If you even talked about it with him, you don't have any heart!

366
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,220
Gosh.

367
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,630
Da Mai, I love Yuxuan.

368
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,160
And I can stick with my job with all seriousness.

369
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,420
But the thing is, what if Yuxuan shuts down? Do I have to go down with it?

370
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,630
Can't I find a way out? If I do, why am I being heartless?

371
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,030
Let me make it clear to you. Staying in Yuxuan is out of courtesy.

372
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:39,160
Leaving Yuxuan is not unreasonable. If you want to be in charge, there's no need for you to drag everyone down!

373
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,290
Okay! Good one, Xiao Pa.

374
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,490
Let's ask everyone.

375
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,620
Who also seconds his idea?

376
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,000
Do you agree with what he just said?

377
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,980
- I don't agree.
- Me neither.

378
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,950
I don't agree.

379
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,130
I don't agree, either.

380
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,610
You need a heart

381
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,230
to be a decent person.

382
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,880
I've heard everything.

383
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,750
Don't but upset, Miss Elise.

384
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,370
He was only lost for a second. We were just joking around.

385
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,330
I know that some of you all, like Da Mai,

386
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,930
treats Yuxuan as his career.

387
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:30,790
Some, like Xiao Pa,

388
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,110
treats working at Yuxuan as a job.

389
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,450
I understand both and I welcome both.

390
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,830
I don't want any of you guys to leave,

391
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,780
but I'm just like you guys, I need to face the truth.

392
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,370
I will try my best to bring Yuxuan back on track.

393
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,010
And I promise will not lower your payments.

394
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:54,250
I'm sorry, Miss Elise. I haven't decided to leave yet.

395
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:58,610
But I have a question for you, and we all want to know the answer.

396
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,060
What's the question?

397
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,750
Yuxuan in London is not affected.

398
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:08,280
But Yuxuan in Shanghai gets fewer and fewer reservations. There are almost none coming in. Do we still have a chance?

399
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:16,080
Here's the thing. Yuxuan in London has opened for almost four years.

400
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,670
They've built the trust with their customers.

401
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,750
Also, their relationships are steady, so they are not affected.

402
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,590
But Yuxuan Shanghai can't achieve it yet.

403
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,770
Reputation and trust is built bit by bit.

404
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,560
Other than trying our best to do our job well,

405
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,360
and to recover others' trust in Yuxuan, there are no other ways.

406
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,150
Are you satisfied with my answer?

407
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,580
- Yes, that's good.
- Okay.

408
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,580
Of course, if you are not confident in me, I won't stop you from leaving.

409
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,260
Let's skip the morning meeting for today.

410
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,000
Tell everyone to start working. Thanks.

411
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,960
- Let's go.
- Why is it happening?

412
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,320
- Let's go.
- Let's not talk about it.

413
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,790
- Let's go.
- Wait.

414
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,550
I have something to say.

415
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,770
Miss Elise has made herself clear.

416
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,100
Trust and reputation

417
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,090
are built bit by bit.

418
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,970
Comparing to the Yuxuan in London,

419
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,330
we are only losing at time.

420
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:30,430
We all know that this is the darkest time for Yuxuan.

421
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,050
But I believe that

422
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:36,740
as long as we work hard and work together, we will get through it.

423
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,700
Also, don't forget, Mr. Jiang said that

424
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:45,920
everyone here is the pillar of Yuxuan.

425
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,670
What is a pillar?

426
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,690
It's when the sky falls upon us, we can hold on to it. That's what makes us pillars.

427
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,360
So, I, Da Mai, have to manifest this here tonight.

428
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,750
I will not give up on Yuxuan.

429
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,150
Unless Mr. Jiang gives up on himself.

430
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,760
Xiao Pa, Miss Elise looks at the big picture.

431
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,240
She understands you, but I can't.

432
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,770
If we will be seeing each other in Yuxuan,

433
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,520
you better not cross me.

00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,650
Don't worry. I'm at the bar.

441
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,630
I'm at the bar because it's the final round tomorrow.

442
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,660
This is the best way to spend the night before the final.

443

Alright, I can't talk anymore. I'm singing. I'm singing for you, alright?

In the afternoon, he brought Sam and Blu to take a walk in the construction site.

451
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,630
Sarah is sleeping at home. He was going to let Blu stay.

452
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,330
But his loud protest will wake Sarah up.

453
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,640
So he says to himself,

454
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,360
it's unlikely for Blu to find stray cats in the construction site.

455
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,460
Ever since the summer from three years ago,

456
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,470
after God played a prank on us,

457
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,570
the worry has been with him.

458
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,850
At that time...

459
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,250
What are you thinking?

460
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,610
Nothing. I'm listening to you read.

461
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,180
Are you nervous about the competition tomorrow?

462
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,860
This is my first time seeing you getting nervous.

463
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,410
- Come here. Let me take another look.
- How could I be nervous?

464
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,890
Hey, what time is it?

465
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,830
It's past ten.

466
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,510
Could you take me outside for a breather?

467
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,220
Let's go.

468
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,420
I can do it myself.

469
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,980
Just admit you are nervous.

470
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,020
I am.

471
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,300
I lost my basic skills.

472
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,740
How can I compete like this?

473
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,200
In order to win the final round,

474
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,470
we need to add our points.

475
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,210
I'm afraid that I will have low score

476
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,060
and drag you down.

477
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,180
Drag me down to where?

478
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,010
Are you afraid that I won't win?

479
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,450
Even if you are completely normal and performed your skills,

480
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,640
and beat Mrs. Quentin by a mile,

481
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,710
can you make up what I lose to Victor?

482
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,750
Mrs. Quentin is the queen of dessert.

483
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:25,240
Even when Montgomery was here, he couldn't have beat her.

484
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,900
Don't even mention me.

485
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,370
So what are you afraid of?

486
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,690
I felt bad as I kept thinking about it.

487
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,220
You know me. I don't like to lose.

488
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,920
Do you remember once, before the competition, you told me

489
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,340
that competition is about making the dish you want to make.

490
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:54,130
Since it's the dish you want to make, there shouldn't be any win or loss.

491
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,780
When I said that to you at that time,

492
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,390
it was actually to help you win.

493
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,340
Now, you say the same thing to encourage me.

494
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,200
It's especially suitable.

495
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,710
Sure. I'll listen to you.

496
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,810
Let us get on stage together tomorrow, and be ourselves.

497
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,390
Okay?

498
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,220
Let me tell you something.

499
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,400
Don't laugh at me.

500
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,060
Are you still afraid of being laughed at by me?

501
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,330
Hey, that's the real laughable thing.

502
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,880
Okay, say it.

503
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,850
Actually, to reach this step,

504
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,800
I've been particularly nervous.

505
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,320
All of those contestants who never reached this step,

506
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,660
is there anyone who isn't better than I am,

507
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:01,190
or work harder than I do? I think Heaven has given me special blessings

508
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,320
to let me enter the finals,

509
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,410
and let me meet you.

510
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,730
I've always wanted to achieve something,

511
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,400
but I didnt' know what I could do.

512
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:39,250
I know what you can do. Thank your parents

513
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,240
to have raised such a good person as you.

514
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,930
If it were anyone else, they would have given up already.

515
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,500
Because of your kindness

516
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,260
and your persistence, that's why you've reached this step.

517
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,000
But there could be another possibility.

518
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:06,400
It could be that Heaven has given you a special blessing.

519
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,650
Do you know why?

520
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,410
Why?

521
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,200
Because I am god.

522
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,590
- You're sick.
- Hey, I am a patient.

523
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,230
To tell you the truth,

524
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,820
it's because you are an angel.

525
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,470
Are you satisfied with this answer?

526
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:43,360
What? Do you think I'm as adorable as an angel?

527
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,660
Aren't you shameless? You've been the same all along.

528
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:58,270
I said you are like an angel, it's because I can't imagine

529
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,690
why you are so good to me.

530
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,920
Want to know why?

531
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,420
Yes... But keep it to yourself.

532
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,310
- You said you wanted to know!
- Wait. Wait.

533
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,650
Slowly. Slowly. There is light. There is light.

534
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,630
- You said you wanted to know.
- Don't. Don't.

535
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,630
- Want to know?
- Yes, I do.

536
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,440
Can you be a little bit quiet?

537
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,890
Let's go.

538
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:57,010
Mr. Huang Shi, who will you support the most in the competition today?

539
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:02,100
Both sides are my friends. It's really difficult for me to choose.

540
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,530
Okay. Let me ask another question. What difficulties do you think Mr. Jiang Qianfan

541
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:12,060
will have to overcome in order to challenge Madam Quentin and Victor successfully?

542
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:17,090
Qianfan probably has been through special training in his familiar own kitchen.

543
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:22,830
However, the competitive venue is an unfamiliar environment to him,

544
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:26,170
but he doesn't have to time to get familiar with it.

545
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,100
When it comes to a highly difficult dish,

546
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:34,400
if one condiment isn't put in correctly, or even one minute of cooking isn't controlled well,

547
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,490
it could be possible to ruin everything.

548
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:42,680
I hope Qianfan can overcome these difficulties.

549
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,500
However, it will be difficult.

550
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,430
Look. That's her classmate.

551
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,530
- Hello, Uncle and Auntie.
- Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

552
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,920
Hello. Hello.

553
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,950
Why are you nervous?

554
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,390
She can come. Even if she loses, she still wins.

555
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,790
It's not that. I'm worried about Xiao Jiang.

556
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,750
He can't see anything,

557
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,570
and he is competing in front of all these people.

558
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,420
Don't you think it's difficult?

559
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,760
- It should start soon.
- Yes, it's difficult for him.

560
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,450
Da Mai.

561
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,880
Xiaoyu, are you okay now?

562
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,580
If I say I'm okay, I'm a little...

563
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,070
but I'll be fine.

564
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:15,970
I was just wondering whose seat this one belongs to.

565
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,600
If I didn't come, Jiang Qianfan wouldn't do well.

566
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,960
[Mueller's Future Star Culinary Competition]

567
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,480
Hello to the live audience and all the TV viewers.

568
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,030
The final round of the Mueller's Future Star Culinary Competition has arrived.

569
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:42,350
Next, we will invite Chairman Thomas and the three judges to be seated.

570
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:58,570
Next, we will invite the two mentors and the two contestants to come on stage.

571
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,410
Okay. The two teams of contestants are ready. Let's get to know them again.

572
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,460
To my left is mentor Madam Quentin, Queen of Desserts

573
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,750
and her apprentice, the young genius Victor. Welcome.

574
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,100
To my right is mentor, Chinese Cooking God,

575
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,660
Mr. Jiang Qianfan and his apprentice,

576
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,320
the one who transformed from an evil dragon princess to a dragon slayer princess,

577
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,980
Lin Kesong. Welcome.

578
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,090
- Sister, cheers!
- Cheers!

579
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,740
Kesong, cheers!

580
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,810
Good! Mr. Jiang, cheers!

581
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,860
Mentor, do your best!

582
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:18,380
Hello. Didn't we agree to contact at 10 o'clock today?

583
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,550
I am too rushed. It's already shipped here?

584
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:26,160
Good. This is great. Thanks.

585
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,450
Thanks. Thank you, everyone.

586
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,840
Actually, when I was on my way here today,

587
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,790
I was very worried that the atmosphere would be depressing at the competition.

588
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,790
So I prepared a joke when I was at home.

589
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,380
I wanted to bring it here to relieve everyone's pressure.

590
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,450
But, after being touched just now, I've forgotten what it is.

591
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,660
Okay, back to the main topic.

592
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,990
All the audience here, as well as viewers in front of the TV, regardless if you are new or old friends,

593
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,220
hello everyone. I am Thomas.

594
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,270
Today, we are competing on sweet cuisine.

595
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:08,820
The topic is called, "Original Intent". Let's take a look at the big screen.

596
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,090
♫  Love  ♫

597
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,160
♫  Love  ♫

598
