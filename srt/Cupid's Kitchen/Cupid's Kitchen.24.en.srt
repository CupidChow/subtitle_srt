Older Brother, Chu Ting didn't forgive me. Let's forget about doing this.

10
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,820
Sure. Starting today,

11
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,720
your car and house are all confiscated. The credit card is frozen.

12
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,890
Brother, you can't play it like this.

13
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,570
Do you know how Chu Ting treated me today? She kicked me out of the store and even shut the door.

14
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,030
She has blocked my phone and WeChat. I can't contact her anymore.

Song Yiran, you aren't kidding, right?

For the past years, you haven't done anything except hanging around girls.

18

Do you need me to show you how to coax a girl?

19
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,980
No, Brother. When have I ever hung around girls? It's always the girls hanging around me.

20
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,140
You figure it out.

Weren't you taking me to see a zither master?

That master lives in an alley

41
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,320
that is meandering. I'm afraid that you can't find it. That's why we are meeting here first.

Wait a moment. I'll take you there after sending this message.

Sorry, I'm disrupting your work.

It's that stupid apprentice of mine.

He's lovesick.

I'm teaching him how to avoid Boris to date Xiaoyu.

I thought you didn't like her.

48
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,860
Mainly it's because Blue likes her. What can I do?

49
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,400
Everything has its own conqueror. She has conquered Blu completely.

Everything has its own conqueror? Well said.

51

You're still single at your advanced age.

52
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,480
That's because you haven't met your conqueror?

You haven't learned to play the zither yet,

160
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,250
You keep all your worries to yourself.

161
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,500
It makes me feel uneasy knowing that.

162
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,650
Stop it. It's not like that.

163
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,370
I'll think it's my fault if she keeps going.

164
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,970
Kesong, you don't tell us about anything

165
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,830
and you don't communicate with us.

166
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,760
You've gone through so many upsetting things on your own.

167
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,830
Your mom and I are both relieved

168
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,910
and sad after knowing about this.

169
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,100
I do like someone.

170
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,360
I've liked him for a long time now,

171
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,600
but he's proposing to his girlfriend tomorrow.

172
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,690
But I'm not sad about it at all. I'm happy for him.

173
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,730
What? He's proposing to someone else?

174
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,660
Tell me who he is. I'll go talk to him!

175
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,700
See. This is why I didn't tell you.

176
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,500
Now that I'm saying it to you, it means it's in the past now.

177
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,560
I'm also very happy that you're both being very understanding.

178
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,130
All right. That's all.

179
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,940
I still have to get back to practicing. Bye.

180
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,690
All right. Go ahead.

181
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,890
Take care of your health!

182
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm sure you know your sense of taste is very special. Have you ever thought about becoming a chef?

183
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,160
If you didn't choose me,

184
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,230
I would've probably spent my entire life washing dishes at my uncle's restaurant.

185
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,280
So you traveled all this way because you were worried that Shanghai residents wouldn't be able to wash dishes?

186
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,680
- I came for Song Yiran.
- I'll teach you until you can cook just as well.

187
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,690
All encounters are made up of thousands of accidental meetings.

188
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,510
We should cherish these moments.

189
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,690
Elise, cheers.

190
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,670
Yuxuan's dining area does so well all thanks to you.

191
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,250
Thank you too. I had a great time today.

192
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,870
Why?

193
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,470
I'm not telling you.

194
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,180
- Victor.
- Elise.

195
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,620
- You came. I brought Oliver to show our support.
- Elise.

196
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,020
I don't need it.

197
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,340
All right.

198
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,150
Next, let's welcome our talented chef, Victor, on stage!

199
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,240
- That's you.
- See you.

200
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,690
He has a bad temper. Don't take offense.

201
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,170
That's all right. That's just our relationship.

202
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,470
Plus, I'm here with you today.

203
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,090

Of course not. When I was young, my dad would make these noodles for me when I was upset.

224
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,510
These are my favorite noodles.

I don't want you to bottle up your emotions,

so if you feel that you're being wronged and want to cry, please cry out loud.

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,890
If you want to laugh, laugh so I can hear you.

233
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,460
Have you seen such a cute little pig?

234
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,600
Honey, don't worry. I'll definitely help you.

235
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,460
Have I ever said "Honey"?

236
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,300
Honey, I'll teach you.

237
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,500
You better keep your word.

238
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,120
Why are you blushing?

239
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,390
What are you talking about? Why would I be blushing looking at you?

You're blushing here and here.

Tighten your handkerchief before entering the kitchen.

This is one way to avoid letting dirty things into the customers' food.

It's not easy to achieve perfection.

258
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:20,390
So, from the deepest of my heart, I really want to become a good chef now.

259
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,430
This way, I can also cook for other people the same good food that I've tasted.

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,630
It is really late and I'm worried that you are seeing him by yourself.

00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,670
- I'm going crazy. Let's hurry and go.
- Go.

278
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,590
Where is the money?

279
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,280
Here.

280
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,120
There is ¥20,000 here?

281
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,270
Yes.

282
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,000
This is probably not enough.

283
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,160
I can't help it.

284
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,570
I'm really out of money. Let's use this money to hold off for a few days.

285
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,420
I'll work on getting the rest.

286
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,510
I have ¥30,000 here. Take it first.

287
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,670
No. How can I use your money?

288
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,590
At such time, you are still deciding what's yours and what's mine?

289
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,090
Stall him first.

290
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,090
Thank you.

291
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,980
I'll definitely repay you the money.

292
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,650
It's fine.

293
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,330
Oh, yes, when we get there, I won't get in at first.

294
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,100
I don't want to scare him and he'll do something outrageous.

295
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,470
Okay. I'm much more at ease with you around.

296
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,940

Miss Quentin, you have many friends and connections.

307
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,280
Borrowing money should be easy for you.

308
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,120
You are also capable and can quickly repay it.

309
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,420
I'm your scapegoat for the rest of my life, and you will make money for me this whole life.

310
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,890
Isn't this quite fair? Right?

311

00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,810
Don't bother her, but bother you?

Yes, come to me.

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,520
You've emptied out all of her money.

317
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,180
If you want more money,

318
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,270
come ask me.

319
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,420
Junbin, don't. This has nothing to do with you.

320
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,740
Don't interfere.

321
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,660
It's fine. It's fine.

322
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,660
That's enough. Don't playact anymore.

323
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,460
I can see it clearly. You don't want to pay? Fine.

324
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,270
I'll have to go to Mr. Jiang then.

325
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,660
Listen.

326
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,530
- Were you discovered?
- I almost got discovered by Mr. Jian, but it's okay.

327
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,270
Li Yan, I'm gathering the money. I don't know why you're in such a rush.

328
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:26,760
Miss Quentin, this is your voice, isn't it?

329
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,450
Dr. Xie, this isn't good, is it?

330
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:36,090
We've given you the money. What else do you want? Give me the cellphone.

331
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,160
Give me the cellphone!

332
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,770
Junbin!

333
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,490
Are you all right? Junbin!

334
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,790
Are you all right?

335
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,150
Junbin, are you okay?

336
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,860
- I'm okay.
- I'm okay too. I'm okay.

337
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,310
Should we go to the hospital?

338
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:56,060
- Junbin.
- It's fine. I'm okay.

339
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,030
Be careful.

340
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,890
Are you sure you don't need to let other doctors see you?

341
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:32,040
It's okay. This kind of wound just needs a little ointment, and it'll heal in a couple of days.

342
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,900
Too bad that I couldn't get your recording back this time.

343
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Sorry.

344
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,950
Don't say sorry. I'm the one who should say sorry.

345
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,560
If something bad had happened,

346
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,640
I don't know what I would do.

347
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,220
It's okay.

348
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,090
It's not a big deal to get hurt on the leg.

349
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,180
Do you know why?

350
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,680
Why?

351
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,520
Because I don't wear skirts.

352
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,240
Look at you. You can still tell jokes now?

353
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,410
I'm really sorry.

354
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,050
It's okay.

What's the matter?

You can go home.

360
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:09,350
I'm sure you've had a great 15 hours. If you still don't think it's enough,

362
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,890
No.

- Good morning, Sister Yu.

366
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,360
I'm home.

367
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,450
You didn't come home last night?

368
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,100
Yes.

369
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,680
I was practicing.

370
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,960
- Practicing?
- What were you practicing? What happened to you?

371
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,330
I was killing fish.

372
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,390
Killing fish? It looks like you were killing people.

373
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,120
Dad, let's end the conversation here.

374

Dad, I just killed fish the entire night.

380
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:52,820
It's not a big deal. I just lost. This is normal!

381
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,380
It's common to lose every once in a while.

382

Is Boris a monster? I don't even do that to my own daughter. What gives him the right?

383

Dad, he's just doing it for my own good. I don't want to keep losing.

Xiaoyu, you've participated in a lot of competitions.

385
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,690
Do you have to overwork yourself? Can't you stop competing?

386
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,290
Dad! You're asking me to quit at this stage? And lose to Lin Kesong? No way!

It's me, your brother. Open the door.

00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,960
Open the door.

Brother, why are you here so early?

396
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,320
Is it early? I've already been working for three hours.

397
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,810
What are you here for this time?

398
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,440
I took care of the billboard for you.

399
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,340
Here.

400
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:38,400
It's from 12 to 1 p.m. Think about what you're going to say on it and send it to that person.

401
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,940
Twelve… Why is it only an hour?

402
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,480
Do you know why it's left vacant? Because it's too expensive.

403
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,900
What if Chu Ting isn't at the store in that one hour and she can't see it? What should I do?

404
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,850
Don't worry about that. Just worry about what you're going to put on there.

405
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,700
What's there to think about? I'll just write,

406
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,890
"Chu Ting, I'm sorry. Song Yiran," and it's done.

407
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,360
What goes on in your head?

408
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,410
You're just writing that one sentence in such an expensive space?

409
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,800
What else would I write?

410
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,450
Aren't you worried that Chu Ting won't accept your proposal?

411
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,880
You might as well propose on the billboard.

412
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,740
Brother, we're currently exes with a broken relationship.

413
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,360
Less than or equal to strangers.

414
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,630
Isn't it a bit too abrupt to go from that to proposing?

415
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,960
I don't think so. On the contrary, it'll be better.

416
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,150
To be honest, I don't trust you at all.

417
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,970
I'm worried that you'll again screw this up the moment I let you out of my sight!

418
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,800
Brother, when have I ever screwed things up?

419
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,990
I've only ever told you to do one thing, which was to deal with your relationship with Chu Ting, and how have you been doing with that?

420
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,480
Fine, I'll do as you say.

421
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,970
Start thinking about what you're going to say immediately and send it to this person by noon.

422
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,690
Wait.

423
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,820
By 11 a.m.

424
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,290
Chu Ting, will you be at the store this afternoon?

425
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:04,940
I want to go over to buy some clothes.

426
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,980
Okay, see you later.

427
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,210
- Oliver.
- You're here.

428
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,350
Did you tell me to come because you thought of some ideas?

429
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,610
Yes. I'm making a Chinese dish. Wait a moment.

430
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,660
That's great.

431
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:16,660
By the way, I've sent Thomas the withdrawal application.

432
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,910
I sent you the withdrawal announcement on Yuxuan's official site to your phone. Did you see it?

433
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,470
Not yet.

434
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,390
It's very simple. It won't take up much of your time.

435
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,520
I'll take a look at it after I finish this, okay?

436
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,990
Okay.

437
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,230
Give it a taste.

438
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,370
What do you think?

439
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,900
It's delicious. Really.

440
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,210
Elise, I understand your expressions too well.

441
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,820
Just directly tell me what the problem is.

442
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,670
I can't keep anything from you.

443
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,670
I'm just so excited that I'm the first one to try your new dishes again, so I think it's really delicious.

444
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,020
Elise, please be more professional.

445
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,600
All right.

446
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,070
I can taste the savory flavor of the oysters in the stuffing, and the taste of the different layers of ingredients is great.

447
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,630
The wrapping is thin and the presentation looks great.

448
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,060
Can you get to the point?

449
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,780
Overall, it lacks a bit.

450
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,880
The problem should be in the seasoning, but I'm not sure.

451
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,230
I'll help you come up with some combinations to try.

452
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:45,570
I've been working on this for so long and it still lacks. How great!

453
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,630
You don't have to help me. Fill this out instead.

454
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,700
What is this?

455
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,480
It's a taste chart. Look.

456
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,610
This is sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, savory, salty.

457
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:02,970
Set them all to one and compare them to the ingredients in the dish.

458
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:06,810
This is how I made the orange-stuffed crab.

459
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:09,610
Lin Kesong filled it out for you, right?

460
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,130
Yes.

461
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,350
All right.

462
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,370
I'm really sorry, Oli.

463
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:39,510
I can't accurately taste how much more savory it is compared to a boiled egg.

464
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:42,650
I can't fill out this chart.

465
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,620
Let's just get a feel for it.

466
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:52,110
No. I can't judge how the final dish will come out without this chart.

467
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,270
I'm sorry, Oliver.

468
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:59,360
I made it seem too simple just now. I'm also very upset that I can't be of help to you.

469
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,950
I'm sorry too.

470
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,070
Let's just leave it at that today. Thanks.

471
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,880
Oliver!

472
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,370
I think you should still take a look at the announcement.

473
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,200
- I can read it to you.
- Let's just do that another time.

474
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,350
- Wait!
- I don't know.

475
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,260
Oliver, do you still remember the question you asked me?

476
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,660
I do.

477
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,920
I'll answer you now.

478
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,300
I want to give it another shot.

479
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,670
Okay.

480
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,150
But under one condition.

481
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,260
Let me hear it.

482
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,790
Let me post the announcement.

483
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:54,990
♫ You are the stranger I want to know ♫

484
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,850
♫ Don't let me go ♫

485
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,050
♫ I will do little tricks for you ♫

486
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,190
♫ Don't bury your secret heart ♫

487
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,340
♫ Show them who you are ♫

488
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:17,320
♫ We sing a song for love ♫

489
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:22,980
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart ♫
