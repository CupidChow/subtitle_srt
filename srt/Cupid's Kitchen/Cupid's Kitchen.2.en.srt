00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,270
The ancient secret of spicy grilled fish. Please enjoy.

10
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,370
I can't wait! I have been craving for this.

11
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,080
Me too. I don't know why but whenever I'm here,

12
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,970
my stomach is a bottomless pit.

13
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,780
Sometimes, I feel like this in other places too.

14
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,380
Yes, I can testify to that.

15
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,980
Be quiet. Even delicious food can't shut your mouth.

16
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,280
I can taste Sansho (Japanese) pepper,

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,960
green pepper, red pepper,

18
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,450
and Sichuan peppercorns, as well as fermented black beans.

19
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,570
There are scallions, gingers, and garlic too,

20
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,120
plus the flavors of dark and light soy sauce. A total of 10 kinds of seasonings.

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,470
There's one more that I can't figure out.

22
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,000
You won't be able to figure it out.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,490
What is it?

24
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,920
Food additive.

25
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,420
What?

26
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,680
How is that possible? I've been here many times. Impossible.

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,220
Mr. Jiang, you might not know this,

28
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,270
but that's illegal here.

29
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,700
Fine. Let's report to the police.

30
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,590
You need evidence to report to the police.

31
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,320
To make it tasty and to remove the fishy odor,

32
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,490
the chef rubs on some seasoning onto the fish and fries it.

33
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,790
The fish skin will turn golden brown after being fried,

34
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,500
but the fish meat will become either light golden or white.

35
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,480
Take a look at the color of fish meat.

36
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,890
I can't tell.

37
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,520
The other side.

38
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,870
When deep-frying the fish, the oil temperature is around 130 degrees,

39
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,680
but adding food additives will change the color to pink at 110 degrees.

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,240
But we have eaten this many times and we are fine.

41
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,220
Because there's only a small amount, it's easy to metabolize.

42
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,200
The average person's taste buds is very ordinary and can't tell the difference.

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,250
It's pink, so pink means it's tender.

44
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,690
As a master chef, how can you be so petty?

45
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,690
Is it that hard to admit that the place I chose serves great food?

46
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,900
I think so too. I don't think they would dare do this.

47
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,270
Suit yourselves. Eat has much as you like.

48
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,530
I'm furious. The more I think about it, the more I think you're talking nonsense.

49
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,230
Why don't we have a bet?

50
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,910
On what?

51
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:20,170
This place closes at 10 p.m. Let's investigate the kitchen after they close.

52
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,450
If the evidence can be found, I will give Lin Kesong ¥1,000 (approximately $157.41 USD).

53
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,020
If it can't be found, you will give Lin Kesong ¥$1,000. What do you think?

54
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,490
- Fine. I will add another ¥$1,000.
- Okay.

55
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,190
Wow...

56
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,390
¥$2,000 (approximately $314.82 USD).

57
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,200
¥$2,000. Oh my gosh!

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,500
Slow down, slow down!

59
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,800
- Let's go.
- It's shaky here.

Oh my goodness.

61

Slow down! You're so heavy!

Scared me to death.

64
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,160
Is this worth ¥$2,000 (approximately $314.82 USD)?

65
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,320
Lower yourself. Don't let anyone see you.

66

Wasn't he with you just now?

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,760
He chickened out.

71
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,050
Is he really a master chef?

72
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,770
If he has left, why are we still going there?

73
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,710
Of course, we must go.

74
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,090
We must go to the kitchen, prove it to him and win that ¥$2,000 bet from him.

75
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,320
Is this necessary?

76
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,820
Of course, it's necessary! Let's go.

77
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,420

78
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,360

There's a loose fence at the gate. How did you get in?

82
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,580
The kitchen is over there. Let's go.

83
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,750
Hold on. Be on the look-out.

84
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,800

- Someone's coming. Let's find a place to hide now.

Why is the kitchen door locked? It's usually not locked.

That's right. Is there really a thief here?

163
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,690
How did you know that the evidence was in the pond?

164
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,680
Who says it was a wild guess? I tasted it.

165
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,260
Even if there were traces left, how could you taste it in such a big pond?

166
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,530
How could I not taste it?

167
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,610
The taste from the pond is exactly like the taste that I couldn't pick out

168
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,020
from the Spicy Grilled Fish we ate.

169
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,410
I thought you don't listen to music.

170
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,410
Listening to music should match the mood. I listen when I feel like it.

171
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,130
What are your plans for tomorrow?

172
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,890
No plans. It all depends on my mood.

173
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,610
I can't be late. I can't be late.

174
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,040
How come you're so early? I woke up especially early today.

175
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,920
You're finally taking this job seriously.

176
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,540
- I value good food.
- Let's go. I'm hungry.

[Green Tea]

191
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,770
Have you been to this restaurant before?

192
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,660
Of course!

193
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,440
Otherwise, why would I bring you here?

194
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,680
Hello. Excuse me. Here's your aromatic tofu fish soup.

195
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,910
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

196
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,550
Since you're in Hangzhou now, you must eat freshwater fish from the lake.

197
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,730
The ingredients in this aromatic tofu fish soup

198
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,500
includes bamboo shoots, fish, and this brined tofu.

199
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,110
The most amazing ingredient is this tofu.

200
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,760
They make this tofu fresh every day, so it's really fresh.

201
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,980
Furthermore, let me tell you, it has a really beautiful name.

202
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,590
It's called "Fish Tears in the Heart".

203
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,310
What does that mean?

204
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,850
Well, you know that little fish live in water.

205
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,290
So when they cry, their tears will disappear into the water.

206
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,450
You can't tell if they were crying or not,

207
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,470
but the river knows

208
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,580
because the little fish's tears flow into its heart.

209
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,970
Sounds like a girl came up with this name. It's not this restaurant's style.

210
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,920
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

211
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,510
That's because I made it up just now.

212
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,000
Come on, let's eat.

213
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,870
Look, they prepared the crucian carp pretty well,

214
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,480
but maybe because they wanted to keep the fish tender, they didn't marinate it long enough.

215
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,520
This caused the tofu to be unevenly marinated.

216
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,730
This dish is originally pretty good, but they were overly cautious. What a pity.

217
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,690
You haven't even tried it. How can you can tell by just looking at it?

218
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,500
Are you looking at a painting?

219
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,320
How about we play a little game?

220
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,590
These four cubes of tofu are lined up from left to right,

221
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,560
mild to strong, according to the intensity of the flavor.

222
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,330
Here, try it.

223
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,190
See if I'm right.

224
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,700
Well?

225
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,620
- This is your line up?
- Yes.

226
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,390
- Yes! I'm going to beat you for once.

227
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,880
These two are in the wrong order.

228
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,960
This one actually has a lighter flavor,

229
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,650
and that one has a stronger flavor.

230
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,110
Still, you're pretty good. You're able to line up the tofu just by looking at them.

231
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,610
Oh,

232
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,650
- so I got it wrong?
-Yes.

233
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,830
Check your phone first.

234
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,570
[The middle two pieces are in the wrong order.]

235
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,990
- I lost again?
- Yes.

236
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,090
How is this possible? They are all from the same pot.

237
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,310
Why do some have a stronger flavor than others?

238
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,350
Is it because they are in different areas of the pot?

239
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,830
It's not that simple.

240
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,490
Hurry up and eat.

241
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,370
- Mr. Jiang
- Yes?

242
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,630
I really admire your willpower. Even with all that good food in front of you,

243
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,110
you weren't tempted at all.

244
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,050
I admire you too.

245
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,470
You'd die for food. There's no stopping you.

246
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,510
Three days went by quickly.

247
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,920
Besides eating non-stop, he would ask me what my future plans were.

248
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,820
Later, I realized that from that moment on,

249
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,160
he was intentionally guiding me

250
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,800
on my journey of becoming a chef.

251
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,560
All right!

252
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,070
Mr. Jiang, the three-day tour guide service ends here.

253
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,310
I'll look for you again.

254
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,590
If that's the case, I'm meeting up with some friends now.

255
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,950
If it's on the way, perhaps you can take me there?

256
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,440
It's actually nearby!

257
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,430
Hello?

258
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,620
Older Sister?

259
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,800
- Xiaoyu?
- Huh?

260
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
- What's up?
- Older Sister?

261
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,330
- Kesong, you are finally here!
- It's really loud over there.

262
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,320
- We're all waiting for you.
- Hold on, I'm at my friend's place.

263
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,840
What's up?

264
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,480
I didn't have time to reply to you a couple of days ago.

265
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,140
Didn't you say you were helping a British chef look for local delicacies?

266
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,150
Who is it? Tell me. I may know him.

267
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,060
He's called... His name is Jiang Qianfan.

268
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,490
Jiang Qianfan!

269
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,960
Oh my gosh! He's my only idol.

270
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,660
- Really?
- How did he find you?

271
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,250
He... He found me... No, he didn't find me.

272
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,620
It was... It was at our hotel..

273
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,180
No... Not my hotel...

274
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,570
I mean at Song Yiran's hotel, I served him.

275
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,950
You are so lucky!

276
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,140
Then, can you do me a favor?

277
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,680
What... What is it?

278
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,960
Can you print out my resume

279
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,860
- and give it to him in person?
- Okay.

280
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,950
Sure. Sure, sure.

281
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,340
I love you so much, Older Sister!

282
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,800
You are my favorite little croissant.
(TN: the direct translation of croissant in Chinese sounds like Kesong)

283
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,550
I... I... I... I love you too!

284
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,880
- Okay, I got to go now. I'm busy now.
 - Okay, okay.

285
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,840
- Bye-bye!
 - Bye-bye!

286
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,810
Kesong! When did you get here?

287
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,030
I just got here. I was inside taking a phone call.

288
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,440
What would you like to drink?

289
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,840
- I... I'm fine with anything.
- How about some cake first?

290
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,870
- Okay.
- How about this one?

291
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,790
I apologize for the last time.

292
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,530
I suddenly took Yiran away. You don't mind, do you?

293
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,130
It's fine. You're both dating.

294
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,560
Old Lin. Why didn't you tell me you'd arrived?

295
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,870
We were waiting for you. Chu Ting, come here.

296
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,040
Everyone! Settle down and listen to me.

297
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,620
I have a very special announcement to make.

298
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,740
Well, Chu Ting's second boutique will soon have its grand opening

299
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,090
- in Shanghai's Jing'an District!
- Congratulations!

300
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,370
And I'm about to take a very important step in my life.

301
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,310
I'm going to move to Shanghai and live with my darling.

302
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,200
You're both being lovey-dovey.

303
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,910
I'm not finished yet.

304
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:13,850
My eldest brother got me a position

305
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,530
at Bellagio Shanghai

306
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,410
after he found out about this. I'll be managing the hotel.

307
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,090
So, if you still want to go for drinks with me,

308
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,340
you're all welcome to visit me in Shanghai. Let's continue the party there! Come on, cheers!

309
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,930
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

310
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,870
One more thing, I have to apologize to all the ladies present here.

311
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,160
To show my loyalty to my darling,

312
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,520
I deleted you all on WeChat a while back.

313
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,100
What?

314
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,700
However, don't be mad.

315
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,000
If there's anything, I'll add you back in the future. Right, darling?

316
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,410
No adding them back.

317
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,580
So, today is actually a farewell party.

318
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,770
Let's paint the town red.

319
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,760
Let's get wasted tonight. Cheers!

320
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,680
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

321
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,150
What's the matter? Sad because you can't see me anymore?

322
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,110
Why are you out here drinking alone?

323
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,770
Stop messing around!

324
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,270
What's there to be sad about? You're just going to Shanghai. Two hours isn't that far away.

325
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,850
Why does it sound like you don't care about me at all?

326
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,120
Anyways,

327
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,830
I arranged a job position for you.

328
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,250
It's at my eldest brother's company. It's the executive assistant position you applied for before.

329
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,870
No thanks.

330
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,970
I'm returning to my hometown tomorrow. My parents found a job for me there.

331
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,540
Would you be able to stay in your hometown for long?

332
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,820
Why wouldn't I be able to?

333
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,460
This kind of stable job also suits me well.

334
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,690
Besides, I can be with my parents.

335
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,490
Yiran, Kesong! Come over to take some photos!

336
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,300
Coming!

337

Have you had Tanghulu before?

00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,890
- Miss Lin.
- Do you know why everyone likes to eat Tanghulu?

363
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,290
Because the outside layer of sugar waves at us.

364
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,680
It's like having a crush on someone.

365
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,590
It's sweet when you first start eating it,

366
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,530
but it becomes more bitter and sour with every bite.

Okay? I still have to work. Come on!

- Yes.

- Go home?
- Yes.

373
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,110
- I'm going home!
- Wait!

374
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,060
I can walk on my own.

375
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,690
I can walk on my own. Let go of me.

376
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,680
This is the most beautiful place in Hangzhou!

377
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,330
Our hotel is the most beautiful.

00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,580
Sure. It's beautiful.

I just know that it's about to rain soon. Come on. Let's go inside.

380
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,110
I know that I'm an ugly duckling,

381
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,530
but even so,

382
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,470
I wanted to be the most special one by his side.

383
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,770
I studied the types of girls that he likes.

384
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,110
I applied for his favorite major,

385
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,460
but the only thing I didn't do was confess to him!

386
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,060
I'm so pathetic.

387
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:43,390
You even dare tell me this much. Why don't you directly tell him?

388
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,580
I don't want to tell him!

389
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,550
Don't they say that friendships last the longest?

390
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:54,620
What if he doesn't like me after I've confessed to him?

391
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,890
He can still live without me, but I can't live without him.

392
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,790
I'm so pathetic.

393
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,470
Let me ask you. Tell me!

394
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,460
Is the guy Song Yiran?

395
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,920
He's a child who hasn't grown up yet. Is he worth crying over?

396
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,990
Yes!

397
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,220
Do you even understand what love is?

398
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,080
I can still live without him. No,

399
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,910
he can still live without me, but I can't live without him.

400
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,000
Let me tell you.

401
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,430
I don't understand. I just know that it's not worth wasting your time on things like that,

402
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,850
and I also know that it's starting to rain.

403
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,690
If you want to punish yourself in the rain, I'll head inside.

404
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,350
Come back!

405
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,890
My crush is like this Tanghulu.

406
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,120
It's sour yet sweet.

407
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:03,560
There's one last piece left. Do you want it?

408
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,140
I'll eat it if you don't want it.

409
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,680

What are "Dumplings with Fish Tears in your Heart"?

422
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,670
Try it. It's a new dish that I developed yesterday.

423
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,100
It's delicious, Mr. Jiang.

424
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,110
The dishes you make aren't Chinese dishes, but they're filled with Jiangnan flavors
(TN: Jiangnan is a region in China)

425
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,370
There's... fish broth inside?

Yes.

Lin Kesong took me to try a dish–

428
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,220
I don't like this taste.

429
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,180
Excuse me, I'm going to the restroom.

430
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,920
Elise.

431
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,030
You haven't tried the entire filling.

432
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,440
I don't need to try it. Yuxuan has Italian dumplings anyway.

433
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,730
By adding the fish broth,

434
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,680
the consistency of the dish is ruined.

435

The Michelin secret inspector will come to Yuxuan at any time.

436

I can't allow something recommended by Lin Kesong

Elise. It's been three years.

Every time I develop a new dish, you're always the first to try it.

00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,280
You've always been fair and objective in your evaluation, but what's wrong today?

There isn't one. My apologies.

I let her sleep here.

447

So, is this why you took such great effort to look for her?

00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,500
Yes.

449
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,050
Stop being noisy.

Is it raining again?

00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,970
Hello? Jun Bin?

453
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,720
Elise. Did you know that Qianfan has a fever?

454
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,700
I was just with him and didn't notice anything.

455
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,550
He probably got it from getting soaked in the rain last night. Serves him right.

456
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,740
Hurry and help him naturally cool his body temperature down. He mustn't take any medication, got it?

457
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:18,040
Yes. What's the big fuss over a cold or fever?

458
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,880
I'll tell you honestly.

459
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,900
A problem has occurred in his nervous system.

460
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,240
I'm worried that a fever will worsen the condition.

461
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,900
What do you mean? A problem in his nervous system?

462
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,230
He has lost his sense of taste.

463
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,300
- Since when?
- A few months ago, I think.

464
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,780
Yuxuan had just opened, and he came to Shanghai.

465
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,710
It's primarily that his sensitivity to sweetness has deteriorated, but after arriving in Hangzhou,

466
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,180
he said that he completely lost all ability to taste sweet things.

467
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,800
I conducted an examination on him,

468
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,980
and found nothing wrong with his taste bud cells, but his brain wasn't responding to signals of sweet taste.

469
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,310
So, the nerve pathways must be blocked.

470
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,150
Is it only the sweet taste?

471
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,550
For the time being, yes.

472
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:08,760
But as the condition progresses, I can't be sure if it'll get worse.

473
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,470
Listen. Don't let anyone know of Mr. Jiang's condition.

474
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,700
You can be assured of this.

475
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,700
Okay. Bye.

00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,170
Why are you here again?

477
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,610
I'm not here for myself.

478
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,290
This is my younger sister's resume.

479
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,980
She really admires Mr. Jiang and wants to become his pupil.

480
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,500
Are you and your sister set on Mr. Jiang?

481
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,600
What do you mean?

482
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,340
No, my younger sister really is impressive.

483
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,300
If you don't believe me, see for yourself!

484
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,670
Mr. Jiang became famous at a young age.

485
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,650
I've seen lots of overconfident women throw themselves at him,

486
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,460
but none of them succeeded.

487
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,940
Mr. Jiang only cares about culinary skills.

488
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,690
I hope you know what's good for you.

489
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,240
Do you have to be so rude?

490
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,280
I'm a young girl and haven't even been in a real relationship!

491
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,720
It's me that should be worried Mr. Jiang would take away my innocence!

492
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,760
It's great that you think that way.

493
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,840
Your three days of work has ended. Thank you for your hard work.

494
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,650
Mr. Jiang wanted me to tell you,

495
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,880
don't speak about him to other people.

496
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,900
Delete his phone number

497
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,570
and stop contacting him. Goodbye.

498
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,070
Who wants to contact him?

499
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,630
What‘s so great about Jiang Qianfan? Delete. Delete immediately.

500
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,660
How infuriating!

501
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,740
Hello, Xiaoyu?

502
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,600
I'm sorry, I couldn't deliver on my promise.

503
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,290
I went to look for Jiang Qianfan,

504
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,980
but there's an ugly witch by his side who wouldn't let me in.

505
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:15,850
Xiaoyu told me that Elise is not only Mr. Jiang's partner but also his ex-girlfriend.

506
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,720
With her around, not even female mosquitoes can get close to Mr. Jiang.

507
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,330
Everyone in the culinary world knows this.

508
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:25,500
Xiaoyu doesn't blame me, but I feel really guilty.

509
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,300
I can't even do a simple thing for my younger sister. What more becoming a powerful woman?

510
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,720
I should just accept my fate and return to Wuzhen.

511
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,270
I'll talk to you later, okay?

512
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,670
Why didn't you tell me?

513
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,160
It wasn't the right time yet.

514
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,240
So, going around looking for disciples was fake.

515
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,200
In reality, you're looking for a suitable crutch, right?

516
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,510
Yes.

517
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,790
I thought I wouldn't be able to find one,

518
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,980
but it's a good thing that I met Lin Kesong.

519
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,160
Does she know?

520
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,460
I haven't told her,

521
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,990
but even if she doesn't agree, I'll find a way to get her to agree.

522
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,330
Yuxuan needs her. And I need her.

523
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,440
You've lost your sense of taste,

524
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,230
yet the person you need isn't me

525
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:37,460
but that girl who got drunk in the middle of the night and passed out in your room?

526
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,300
Sorry.

527
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,750
But she's a genius.

528
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:06,130
I returned home, at Wuzhen, and went to the interview at the firm my parents told me about.

529
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,990
I didn't get the job, but even if I did, so what?

530
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,070
I would just be drinking tea and reading the news every day with the aunties and uncles.

531
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,950
The pay would be average, the workload would be average,

532
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:21,590
and I'd be neither too far, nor too near from home. It'd be a predictable life from start to finish.

533
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:27,030
Do I have to say goodbye to my Song Yiran and the life I've dreamed of?

534
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,910
I won't accept it.

535
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,760
Don't go, go. Don't go, go.

536
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,370
Don't go.

537
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,260
Let's do it again.

538
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,780
Go!

539
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,860
Don't go.

540
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,200
Go, don't go.

541
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,210
Try again.

542
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,280
Go.

543
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,390
Don't go.

544
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,440
Go, don't go.

545
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,260
Go,

546
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,670
don't go. Go,

547
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,310
don't go.

548
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,100
Go!

549
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,220
In the end, it was Xiaoyu who encourage me.

550
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,240
She said, since confessing to Song Yiran is my biggest wish,

551
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,370
then why shouldn't I do it? Even if I get rejected.

552
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,010
Shanghai, here I come!

553
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:43,390
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

554
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,340
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

555
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,450
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

556
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:57,540
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

557
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,840
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

558
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,850
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

559
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:11,420
♫  Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
