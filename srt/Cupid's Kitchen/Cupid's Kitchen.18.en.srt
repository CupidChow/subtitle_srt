00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,480
Hurry. Hurry, hurry!

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,920
- Hurry. Pay careful attention.
- Okay.

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,700
- Turn the meat over. Quickly.
- Okay.

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,330
Hurry.

13
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,100
- Too thick. Make them thinner.
- Yes, sir.

14
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,940
- Is it ready or not?
- Ready.

15
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,610
Here.

16
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,860
Service.

17
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,680
Mr. Jiang. My father and mother.

18
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,700
Welcome Mrs. Lin, Mr. Lin.

19
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,470
Kesong, take your parents to that vacant table.

20
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,460
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

21
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,230
- This is the guy?
- Hurry.

22
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,120
There, there. Sit here.

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,430
- Sit here?
- You two sit here.

24
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,370
Here.

25
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,560
Um... Dad, Mom,

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,200
Wait here for me here. I'm going to see Mr. Jiang for a minute. I'll be right back.

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,760
Okay. Hurry back.

28
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,820
Old Lin...

29
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,160
Good evening. This is our menu.

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,450
- Take a look.
- Thank you.

31
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,930
I think that guy back there was very handsome.

32
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,590
- Sir.
- What kind of judgment is that? Much less than when I was young.

33
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,790
Look at this price. It's robbery.

34
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,170
Lower your voice.

35
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,220
Doesn't this "Michelin" sell tires?
[Michelin rates the quality of fine restaurants. The Michelin Tire Company also sells tires.]

36
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,030
That's right.

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,580
Maybe they opened a restaurant too. Started a new branch.

38
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,550
My parents saw the competition. They want me to go back home.

39
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,120
About the contract...

40
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,030
Do you want to go back?

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,780
They won't listen to me.

42
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,800
If you want someone to listen to you, you can't just beat on their shoulders.

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,920
You have to show them why.

44
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,170
I also have Okinawa spinach here. Go change into your uniform.

45
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,900
Cook something for them yourself. Only after they eat, they'll see that you're not in as bad a position as they think,

46
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,170
and you'll have the chance to tell them what's in your heart.

47
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,820
Okay?

48
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,370
Okay.

49
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,240
More than the Okinawa spinach,

50
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,750
I want to cook all I can for them.

51
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,090
She's not back yet.

52
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm going to look for her.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,120
Enough. She'll be back in a bit.

54
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,440
Daughter.

55
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,440
You've only been here for a little over a month, how can you have learned to cook such good food?

56
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,230
It's really good.

57
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,530
All of this is what Mr. Jiang has taught me.

58
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,970
So I want to tell you, you can misunderstand me, but you shouldn't get him wrong.

59
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,580
Our relationship isn't what you were thinking.

60
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,930
He really only holds cooking dear to his heart.

61
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,330
Again, your daughter here

62
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,680
is quite stupid, quite lazy. You know that, right?

63
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,480
Even though my foundation isn't good, Mr. Jiang never gave up on me.

64
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,030
I want to stay

65
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,840
not only because at this point I really love cooking.

66
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,300
I still want to fight for glory.

67
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,180
At least as long as I'm not being eliminated, I want to compete.

68
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,490
Your skills have grown. You've really grown up.

69
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,070
It's only been a little over one month, and the change has been very great.

70
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,490
In addition, she can think for herself.

71
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,880
It appears that your mother and I were overthinking things earlier.

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,350
Especially your mother, she's always afraid that you'll be taken advantage of in something.

73
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,930
What are you spouting?

74
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,040
Now...

75
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,630
Let me tell you something.

76
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,570
Others can say what they want. Your father and I trust you.

77
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,460
My darling daughter has grown up.

78
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,710
Okay, okay. Don't cry.

79
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,870
Don't cry. You go your own way and let them talk.

80
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,940
Why are you starting to scare me?

81
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,890
Okay, enough. We were wrong.

82
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,870
Hello, Eldest Brother.

83
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,600
This is your sister-in-law. Your brother asked me to call you. We're going home.

84
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,020
Wait for a minute! Your brother wants to say something. Here.

85
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,790
I don't have anything to say.

86
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,600
What's going on? Why are you hurrying home so late at night?

87
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
Did you see Kesong?

88
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,270
We saw Kesong.

89
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,580
That child really has grown up.

90
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,750
What we were worried about... was really not necessary.

91
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,620
I can relax if you've seen her. I'll be waiting for your return, so you can continue your comments on my teaching.

92
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,640
Hey. What's this about commenting on your teaching? Your sister-in-law and I should be learning from you.

93
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,750
The two of us just think this child has grown up. We should let go when the time is right.

94
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,730
We can't always look after her.

95
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,350
I won't talk anymore, I'm driving.

96
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,620
It looks like that's over.

97
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:53,100
Your parents left in a hurry. Otherwise, I wanted to let them try my cooking.

98
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,130
Don't think I don't hate you since I come back with you.

99
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,070
That doesn't matter. It's okay as long as you're staying.

100
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,030
Why don't we go back and analyze what happened before?

101
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,750
No need. You don't know why I lost,

102
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,560
and I don't plan to tell you.

103
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,490
Okay, then.

104
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,750
You keep your little secret.

105
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,560
Miss Quentin, these are the newest reservations for this coming week. I think you need to take a look.

106
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,190
- Are there any customers we need to pay particular attention to?
- Boris.

107
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,480
Boris?

108
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,180
Even though Mr. Jiang said we should welcome him, I think...

109
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,290
Okay, I understand. Thank you, Xiao Pa. You're very attentive.

110
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,430
- Okay. Then, take care.
- Okay.

[Did Lin Kesong ask you?]

112
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,970
[No. She chose not to ask. I didn't say anything either.]

113

I just want to take you out to relax.

159
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,280
Don't think about these useless things.

160
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,930
Look. I usually don't drink soft drinks,

161
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,100
but I drank all of it.

162
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,710
You are quite interesting.

163
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,060
You sound so old-fashioned.

164
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,690
If you don't want to drink it, then why did you drink it?

165
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,850
Because I think that you're a pretty good person, and I want to be friends with you.

166
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,970
And you went out of your way to buy Cola.

167
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,300
Since you already said that we're friends,

168
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,040
then can you take

169
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,700
your praises for me?

170
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,040
No way.

171
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,610
Mama!

172
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,220
This is giving me a bit of a headache. Can you help me think of a solution?

173
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,080
Here.

174
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,240
Oliver is too stubborn. No matter what I say, he won't listen.

175
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,580
These two chefs are seeking justice.

176
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,960
It's only the first round, and they're talking about it like this.

177
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,240
You know this is the Future Star Competition.

178
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,650
Everyone is already questioning his authority.

179
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,580
For Yuxuan's sake, I can't let this continue.

180
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,470
Isn't this perfect?

181
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,260
Perfect?

182
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,260
Jiang's slide is just beginning.

183
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,360
Yuxuan is an empire that you worked hard to build.

184
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,050
You can't let it fall apart in his hands.

185
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,970
[Equity Transfer Agreement]

186
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,960
Transfer agreement?

187
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,820
Didn't you say that he wants to transfer Yuxuan to you?

188
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,210
But without Oliver, will Yuxuan still be Yuxuan?

189
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,060
Even without him,

190
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,160
with our abilities,

191
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,750
Yuxuan can get three stars.

192
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,460
After the competition ends, Victor will make a name for himself.

193
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,330
Let him be the lead chef. Can we be worse than Jiang?

194
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,140
But...

195
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,980
Elise, don't forget what you did.

196
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,020
Don't think because it is peaceful now, things have passed.

197
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,020
Even for my sake,

198
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,150
you need to grasp your advantages tightly, okay?

199
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,120
How did you get in?

200
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,930
Oliver didn't tell you that I have keys?

201
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,380
He went out. He's not here.

202
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,750
I know. I'm looking for you.

203
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,790
He actually used crawfish.

204
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,210
What?

205
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,460
If he says it tastes good, then it tastes good.

206
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,070
You don't sound like you agree 100%.

207
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,700
Don't worry. I asked you because this dish is getting bad feedback.

208
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,910
I also think there's a problem.

209
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,780
Then what did he say?

210
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,020
I understand Oliver's ability to taste.

211
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,720
No one can compare, including you.

212
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,940
But his extraordinary sense of taste can bring some trouble.

213
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,610
Sometimes he'll come up with flavors that are difficult for most people to accept.

214
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,650
Seems like Elise doesn't know that Jiang Qianfan lost his sense of taste.

215
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,970
I can't tell her.

216
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,310
Then what can we do?

217
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,900
Mr. Jiang himself is the standard.

218
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,480
Yes, I know, but Boris and his people will come at any time.

219
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,380
If they come to make trouble, then we won't be able to get three Michelin stars.

220
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,640
But this is very important to him.

221
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,250
Yes, and your little sister,

222
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,160
her mentor made a dinner reservation at Yuxuan tonight.

223
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,410
He's not coming to eat dinner, he's coming to find faults.

224
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:22,080
If anything goes wrong, no matter how Oliver explains,

225
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,450
he'll talk nonsense on his live stream.

226
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,870
It will affect Yuxuan badly.

227
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,730
Why is this Boris so despicable?

228
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,660
He always makes trouble for Mr. Jiang.

229
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,360
Since you already know that it's bad,

230
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,040
then quickly think of a way to change it.

231
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,220
But this is not an ordinary change.

232
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,570
Oliver can't know, so we can't change the menu.

233
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,530
We can't use alcohol because he'll know by smell.

234
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,590
We can only use tea.

235
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,790
For something this difficult, I can only hand it to you.

236
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,760
You need to remember that this is not for me.

237
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,900
This is for Yuxuan.

238
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,700
This is for Oliver.

239
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,050
Actually, using tea can be doable,

240
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,750
but the taste of green tea is too bland.

241
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,330
You can use Lapsang Souchong or Pu'er Tea.

242
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,180
Yes, right, but there's another problem.

243
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,900
Even though the tea water can absorb the fishy odor,

244
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,630
it doesn't help in the deeper layer.

245
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,010
If there's another way. For example,

246
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,990
through something like gas or vapor?

247
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,420
Something that can go deeply into the crayfish. I think that will work.

248
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,470
Gas or vapor that can go deeply inside.

249
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,690
What about smoking?

250
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,300
In the past, I drank a type of wine.

251
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,030
This wine was covered up,

252
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,240
and inside the cover, it was full of the smoke from burning.

253
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,280
And then the wine will absorb all the smoke from the burnt fruit wood.

254
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,560
Will this work?

255
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,060
Sure. Do you have a cover here?

256
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,150
There should be.

257
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,030
Okay, then we'll try it. I brought ingredients.

258
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,000
Hurry and try it.

259
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,820
It works!

260
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,090
The smoke has indeed absorbed the fishy odor completely.

261
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,860
The effect is better than I thought it would be.

262
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,950
This way, the crayfish's fishy odor will be completely removed.

263
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,350
If this method works,

264
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,660
you should handle the beef the same way, just in case.

265
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,480
Okay. This way, the taste will be uniform.

266
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,290
It can also decrease the oily flavor. Good suggestion.

267
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,810
But if we also add beef,

268
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,580
this cover will be enough.

269
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,780
Not a problem.

270
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,620
Yuxuan has a professional cold smoker.

271
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,480
As long as the smoke method works,

272
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,400
I can arrange for someone to do it.

273
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,310
It won't draw attention.

274
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,420
Then that works.

275
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,050
Thank you.

276
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,660
I know you made this.

277
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,650
I will give you credit for it.

278
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,030
Don't be so polite. I'm not used to it.

279
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,490
I'm doing this for Mr. Jiang.

280
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,150
If you say this, then we're even.

281
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,040
Chef Mai, Chef Mai!

282
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,310
I'll do it. Just let me do it.

283
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,200
You only need to do a little bit. How can you do this work?

284
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,360
You say that, but if I don't do the work, will it be enough for Jiang Qianfan?

285
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,520
Isn't he something?

286
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,490
Forget about his stinky temper. Everyone knows about it and we're used to it,

287
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,730
but his cooking tastes horrible now. Look at that apprentice.

288
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,050
What kind of act is she putting on?

289
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,740
Don't talk anymore. It's not good if Mr. Jiang hears it.

290
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,580
What am I? Look at the time. Boris is about to be here.

291
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,030
He will talk a lot more uglily than I did!

292
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,870
- Besides, if he's afraid of people talking, then don't cook such bad-tasting stuff.
 - Say that again!

293
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,190
Sure. I'll say it again then.

294
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,140
Mr. Jiang, I've reported this problem more than once or twice.

295
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:37,590
That dish of yours, Wagyu Sirloin and Red Crayfish, really has a big problem. First of all, the crayfish's fishy odor isn't removed.

296
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,570
Every customer who ate it found it unacceptable.

297
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:43,090
Let me tell you. You are the first one who doesn't understand my cooking!

298
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,840
- Chef Mai, don't talk anymore. Calm down.
- No, I'm saying what's right. What am I afraid of?

299
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,580
I am definitely not the first one and won't be the last one. As it looks now, the entire chef team thinks the same way.

300
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,420
Da Mai, I'll say it again.

301
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,950
Yuxuan is Jiang Xianfan's restaurant. Jiang Xianfan is the standard.

302
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,830
Elise, no need to say it anymore!

303
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,570
Sure. Everyone heard it too. Mr. Jiang is the standard.

304
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,390
This is what they mean by, "What lowly people say count little."

305
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,710
It's useless for us little people to give any suggestion.

306
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,350
Boris should be here soon. I sure would like to see what he'll say.

307
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,590
Fine. Just you wait!

308
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,530
What are you looking at? Get to work!

309
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,800
Forget it, forget it!

310
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,290
Elise, come inside!

311
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,200
Da Mai has told you before?

312
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,350
- He has.
- Why didn't you tell me?

313
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,410
Once Boris has eaten and finished the livestream, it'll be too late.

314
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,810
Is it because you think I won't change even after telling me? Right?

315
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,140
Yes.

316
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,360
Fine. All of you are right.

317
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,500
I won't change it! Cook this dish my way!

318
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,330
Anyone watching my livestream today

319
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,540
has really found treasure.

320
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,160
Boris's Michelin Blacklist is here again.

321
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,480
This place is Yuxuan in Shanghai.

322
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,330
I've been here before,

323
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,160
but I also said,

324
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,800
I'd come here again when the new seasonal dishes are out.

325
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,790
That's why I'm here today.

326
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:49,510
Everyone has seen the first round of the Future Star Culinary Competition.

327
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,930
Jiang's achievement...

328
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,680
Did he have an achievement?

329
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,260
Somehow, I don't remember.

330
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,030
Mr. Jiang.

331
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,230
Xiao Yang!

332
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,780
What is this? Burnt Pu'er tea's stalks?

333
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,250
This... Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

334
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,240
Whose idea was this?

335
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,290
What idea?

336
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:07,870
You burnt the tea and used the smoking method to remove the fish odor from the beef and crayfish, right?

337
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,090
You are right. Sure enough, nothing escapes your eyes.

338
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,290
It was Lin Kesong's idea.

339
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,670
What do you mean?

340
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,010
Lin Kesong called me and told me to go there for something important.

341
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,090
She said the online reviews all said Wagyu Beef and Red Crayfish didn't taste good,

342
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,390
so she thought of a way to improve it. If you don't believe, look here.

343
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,870
I don't want to look at it. Why did you listen to her?

344
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,320
Because she showed you how to eat the crayfish.

345
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,030
She knows more and understands more.

346
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,870
Besides, you trust her, so I trust her too.

347
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,300
We are doing it for your sake.

348
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,730
For my sake? Do you know what disgusts me the most?

349
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,430
Great, Chef Jiang.

350
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,740
personally delivers the dish to me.

351
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,900
You want to help me get more fans? No.

352
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,280
You are afraid of me. Are you afraid of me?

353
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,060
I just want to see your satisfied expression in person.

354
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,420
I'll consider what you say as a compliment to me.

355
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,790
Because Boris' dedication to food

356
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,030
is incomparable.

357
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,040
My pickiness and ruthlessness on food

358
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,810
is also incomparable.

359
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,600
Is there any way of escape?

360
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,170
No way.

361
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,280
Have you been bewitched lately?

362
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,740
"Meeting of Two Seasons" really tastes terrible.

363
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,770
Red crayfish and steak. The idea sounds good,

364
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,730
but when I eat it,

365
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:55,010
the inner fishy odor of the crayfish isn't removed at all.

366
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,830
Adding that with the fat from the Wagyu beef,

367
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,690
it's like putting a hydrogen bomb on the tip of the tongue.

368
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,870
Jiang, can you really not tell how bad it tastes?

369
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,900
What a joke. I think there is only one reason that you don't like it.

370
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,450
You have too much fat in your body.

371
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,700
If it doesn't taste good, you only blame other people, so I can only eat it if I lose weight?

372
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,600
Jiang, you got a zero in the competition,

373
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,950
but you are still so arrogant. Don't you feel embarrassed?

374
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:33,810
Don't you think this is the best way to get attention? Enjoy it slowly.

375
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,970
Let me tell you all.

376
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,660
This dish really tastes awful.

377
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,630
He has disappointed me too much.

378
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:57,900
Yuxuan restaurant... Garbage!

379
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,770
[Jiang Qianfan]

380
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,040
Lin Kesong, come to Yuxuan. Now!

381
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,530
What is this?

382
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,900
Please come again. Goodbye.

383
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,070
Miss Lin? Why are you here?

384
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:33,250
- Mr. Jiang told me to come.
- Mr. Jiang is in a bad mood today. Be careful.

385
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,490
I'm going in then.

386
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,820
Mr. Jiang, I'm here.

387
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,260
Lin Kesong, how long have I been teaching you?

388
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,320
About a month?

389
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,730
Exactly how long?

390
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,200
Isn't a month about 30—

391
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,560
No need to count!

392
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,440
Therefore, you are awesome now and don't need to learn from me anymore!

393
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,400
What do you mean?

394
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,840
What do I mean? You are so awesome that you can change my dish!

395
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,970
Anyone who doesn't understand my food is stupid! Whoever changes my dishes is an enemy!

396
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,850
You are awesome. Right now,

397
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,540
you clean up the front, back kitchen, fresh produce handling room, and the restroom!

398
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,050
Xiao Pa!

399
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,720
You are in charge of monitoring! Everyone else can leave!

400
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,710
Why didn't you explain it clearly to Mr. Jiang?

401
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,650
Sorry, Miss Lin. I did explain.

402
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,160
You better do what Oliver says.

403
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,360
Yuxuan is large. I advise you to start right away.

404
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,230
♫  I just wait for this moment  ♫

405
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,930
♫  Feel the air  ♫

406
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,850
Why are you here?

407
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,540
I've been here for a while.

408
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,460
I watched you for a long time. Oliver, don't drink anymore.

409
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,120
You are drinking too much.

410
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,520
♫  I tell myself there is nothing bad  ♫

411
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,860
♫  Falling  ♫

412
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,690
Am I being ludicrous?

413
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,170
I...

414
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,980
♫  Seeing  ♫

415
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,940
Jiang Qianfan...

416
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,650
♫  Something happen  ♫

417
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,900
Michelin three-star chef...

418
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,370
♫  How can  ♫

419
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,610
Has lost the sense of taste.

420
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:35,900
♫  You said, don't be afraid  ♫

421
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,920
Am I doomed?

422
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,550
Of course not. You still have me.

423
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,310
I like eating.

424
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,650
Thank you.

425
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,450
Even now, you are still consoling me.

426
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,010
But I know it myself.

427
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,940
If Michelin's secret scout has already visited,

428
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,740
then everything will be ruined.

429
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,930
Oliver,

430
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,960
I've said it many times. Michelin isn't important to me.

431
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,010
You don't have to be sorry to me.

432
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:26,110
No matter what, I'm happy to be with you. Even if the entire world is on the other side, I will stay by you.

433
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,990
Why?

434
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,930
Why are you still so good to me?

435
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,550
Because...

436
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,370
This is how I am, Oliver.

437
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,950
I know that

438
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,700
I am a pretty unlikable person.

439
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,590
I've made it where no one likes me.

440
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,240
Why are you still here?

441
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,520
What do you really want?

442
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,670
Forget it.

443
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,540
Let's not talk about these things today.

444
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,060
I don't want to go home early. Come,

445
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,880
let's drink together.

446
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,790
No, I can't drink. I don't want to make the same mistake as last time.

447
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,330
Cheers.

448
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,710
I'm so aggrieved.

449
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,210
In front of everyone in public, did he even consider my feelings?

450
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,140
Do I want to lose face?

451
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,830
I almost shouted. If his sense of taste was fine, he would know why I had to make the change.

452
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,960
Miss Lin, you should hurry and go back. I called a car for you, and it'll be here soon.

453
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,370
No need.

454
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,410
Mr. Jiang left a long time go and he won't come back. You should hurry and go back to rest.

455
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:17,710
This is nothing. We're used to being scolded. Don't take it to heart.

456
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,420
I want to go back.

457
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,790
Come.

458
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,840
Careful. Take it easy.

459
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,060
Careful with the head. Careful with the head.

460
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,760
- Come drink!
- Thanks. Thank you.

461
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,820
Come for a drink.

462
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,240
I really can't persist anymore.

463
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,660
He scolded his disciple in front of everyone today. What does he mean? Isn't it for us to hear?

464
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,030
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

465
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,840
What kind of place is Yuxuan?

466
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,140
It's his territory. Will he let you get an upper hand?

467
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,770
We have to be reasonable on everything, right?

468
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,530
Am I wrong when I criticize Jiang Qianfan?

469
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:46,320
Didn't I guess it right? Later on, Boris said even worse and it was livestreamed. Isn't it embarrassing?

470
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,220
He deserved it. All day long, he's so arrogant.

471
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,260
I've seen him in the restaurant. I said, "Hello," but he pretended not to hear.

472
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,500
But on the other hand,

473
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:00,530
when Boris did that, it's Yuxuan that got embarrassed.

474
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,840
What? Do you really think of Yuxuan as your family?

475
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,650
How else? After all, I am Yuxuan's lead chef. If Yuxuan loses face, I lose face too.

476
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,440
Here.

477
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,820
Let me tell you this way.

478
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,520
I'm already discussing with the next one.

479
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,560
You're good.

480
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,510
Aren't you the best actor? Not a trace at all.

481
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,660
Which restaurant?

482
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,490
Fuli. Do you know about it?

483
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,470
Sure! An old restaurant.

484
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:37,290
They are recruiting now. How about it? The two of us can go there together.

485
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:41,350
I'll chat with them. You'll definitely be the executive chef when you go there.

486
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,580
Da Mai.

487
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,800
Do you really think this incident with Jiang Qianfan is over?

488
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,590
He'll be humble tomorrow and apologize to you?

489
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,370
That's impossible. I've never seen any man being so broadminded.

490
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,810
It's even more impossible for Jiang Qianfan?

491
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,560
He can do this to you today,

492
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,000
he can do it to the others tomorrow.

493
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,220
This doesn't sound good, but

494
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,410
there's no telling how long we can stay in Yuxuan.

495
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:15,370
Enough now. No more talking! One more drink.

496
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,260
Come.

497
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,440
What's going on?

498
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,530
Lin Kesong, come help!

499
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,590
The steps.

500
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,140
Open the door.

501
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:01,540
Don't leave me. I don't want to be alone.

502
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,570
Okay, Oliver. I won't leave. I'll stay here and not go anywhere.

503
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,060
You must be tired.

504
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,450
Still feeling aggrieved?

505
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,120
What do you think?

506
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,940
Sorry, Lin Kesong. I'll apologize to you on his behalf.

507
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,630
So sorry, my dear.

508
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,220
Oliver is really like a devil sometimes.

509
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,440
He can make you feel like it's better to be dead than alive.

510
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,480
I'll answer this call.

511
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,800
Not yet, Mom. He is in a bad mood today, so I couldn't say it.

512
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,510
When it's time to be ruthless, you are actually kind. You can't be this way.

513
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,800
Are you still with him now?

514
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,170
Yes, he's drunk. I just brought him back home.

515
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,060
He won't let me leave.

516
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,490
This is a great opportunity.

517
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:43,420
While he is drunk, make him sign the contract, regardless of what trick you use.

518
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,250
I don't believe he will deny it afterwards.

519
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,400
I'll wait for your good news.

520
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:14,340
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

521
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,200
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

522
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,320
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

523
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:29,460
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

524
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,530
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

525
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:36,700
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

526
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:43,340
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
