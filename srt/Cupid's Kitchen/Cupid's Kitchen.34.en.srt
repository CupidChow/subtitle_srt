That's the girl.

She's Kesong's uncle's daughter, Xiaoyu.

11
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,330
She's always thought

12
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,770
that she was better than Kesong.

13

I wonder where she gets her confidence from.

Lin Kesong, how are you going to respond to that?

I don't have a specific plan. I'll just do my best.

Do you see that? Do you see the way that Xiaoyu looks at Kesong?

39

She looks at her as if she were her enemy.

40
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,260
She's such a sore loser. So typical of you Lins.

You should try to understand Xiao Feng.

It's not easy for him to raise Xiaoyu alone.

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,830
He has to play the role of both the mother and the father and he's not in great health.

Listen. If Kesong loses, then that's that.

But if she wins, don't go boasting about it to others.

For the first round, we prepared hilsa herring, one of the three delicacies of the Yangtze river.

55
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,210
The hilsa herring will swim back to the Yangtze river when summer comes.

56
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,360
In order to lay eggs, thick fat accumulates underneath their scales.

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,330
So, summer is when the hilsa herring is the fattest.

58
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,750
This match will be a competition of this delicacy from the water.

Remember,

60

To be honest, I really wouldn't have been able to come up with such an idea.

Jiang, you have to believe me. I don't want to do that anymore.

68

using her rich experience and skilled craftsmanship.

70

She doesn't want to give her any chances.

This idea is indeed very cruel.

Jiang, you're definitely losing.

73
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,220
Don't you think that Lin Xiaoyu is overly excited?

74
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,470
Being overly excited does lead to mistakes.

75
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,440
But even if she doesn't perform to her standard,

76
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,480
she is more than capable of beating Lin Kesong

when making the same dishes.

78
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,730
After all, Lin Kesong isn't able

79
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,800
to make difficult dishes.

80
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,460
I can see Lin Xiaoyu's strategy clearly.

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,460
She prepared the same ingredients as Lin Kesong

82
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,260
and is following all of Lin Kesong's steps.

83
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,950
I'd like to ask our committee chairman, Thomas. Is this allowed?

84
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,100
It's actually not breaking any rules of the competition.

85
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,760
Even if they make the same dishes,

86
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,820
I believe the taste will still be different.

87
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,080
This will actually put the contestants' skills to the test even more.

88

But I still wish to see

89

the competitors present more abundant

90

and diverse dishes on the competition stage.

At the same time, it lacks professionalism.

You keep staring at the screen, unwilling to take your eyes off it.

97
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,980
Are you worried about never being able to see your little princess again?

98
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,530
Yes.

99
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,480
I worry about not being able to see her again.

100
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,080
Is it because she'll leave you after she loses the competition?

101
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,200
Using the blow torch to crisp the skin is a good idea.

102
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,270
But isn't it too dangerous to use the high-alcohol Baijiu?

103

What is she doing?

104

She is awake, but she didn't let me stay with her.

The motive is very simple. Meet some friends with common interests.

164
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,240
Share more.

165
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,870
Xiaoyu is my biggest gain in this competition.

166
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,730
Even though she became more and more scary,

167
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,860
but I still worry about her.

168
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,800
Since you still worry about her, then stay with her,

169
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,210
protect her. If she is in a bad mood and wants you to leave, go ahead and leave.

170
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,790
Walk around outside the room and come back.

171
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,200
Did you leave? Yes, you did.

172
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,020
But the direction turned, and you came back.

173
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,660
Okay, I'll remember that.

174
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,820
Blue, I am especially pleased that I have you as an apprentice.

175
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:58,150
You are also the kindest kid that I've met.

176
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,830
After this competition, if you wish,

177
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,750
I will continue to teach you cooking.

178
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,220
Thank you.

179
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,390
Old Huang, I will be your apprentice for life.

180
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,030
I'm not trying to coddle you.

181
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,450
But what happened isn't your fault.

182
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,050
It is my fault.

183
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,980
She wouldn't be like this if I didn't come to Shanghai and participate in the competition.

184
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,860
If you really want to put it that way,

185
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,550
then if I didn't go looking for you, and you didn't participate in the competition,

186
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,890
then none of this would've happened.

187
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,430
She's been cooking for so many years. How could she do something so dangerous?

188
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,630
It's because Xiaoyu really wanted to win.

189
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,340
What's going to happen now? Can she still win?

190
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,430
The competition requires three dishes and each dish is scored.

191
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,310
She doesn't even have any scores now. How is she going to win?

192
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,770
What if I drop out of the competition? Can't she compete if I drop out?

193
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,550
Are you a fool? Pity will only make things worse.

194
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,540
What should I do then?

195
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,270
Alright, it'll be okay.

196
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,360
What's wrong?

197
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,490
Did you lose your vision again?

198
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,750
I'm fine.

199
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,270
I said I was fine. It's probably because I've been too tired lately.

200
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,490
What?

201
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,670
Don't be so worried. I'm really fine.

202
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,790
Old Huang made this himself.

203
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,060
Have a whiff. Doesn't it smell nice?

204
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,970
Eat it yourself.

205
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,430
- At least try it.
- I don't want it.

206
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,970
Blu, don't make her eat it if she doesn't want to.

207
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,770
She'll have an appetite once she gets enough sleep.

208
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,090
Do you want to play some games? I downloaded a lot for you.

209
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,020
- Xiao Feng.
- Brother, Sister-in-law.

210
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,960
Why do you still come here?

211
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,930
How can we not come after the accident?

212
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,430
- Thank you. Blu, please.
- I got it.

213
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,040
She looks badly hurt.

214
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,590
She was cooking close to the fire. It was inevitable.

215
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,100
Xiaoyu, your uncle and aunt are here to see you.

216
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,340
Xiaoyu.

217
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,260
Don't. Leave her to sleep.

218
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,260
She was just awake. How did she fall asleep so quickly?

219
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,170
Leave her to sleep.

220
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,160
Brother, Sister-in-law, have a seat.

221
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,500
Sister-in-law, have a seat.

222
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,540
Uncle, have a seat.

223
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,320
- I'll get going now.
- Alright. Thank you.

224
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,520
She looks worse than you said.

225
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,460
Right. It hurts my heart to see her like this.

226
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,670
This isn't anybody's fault.

227
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,710
Xiaoyu is just so competitive.

228
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,230
That's true.

229
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,320
We used to use Xiaoyu as an example to teach Kesong a lesson.

230
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,760
And if I remember correctly,

231
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,610
she was first place every time.

232
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,490
She wasn't always like this.

233
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,310
She was a naughty child.

234
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,740
She'd be goofing around and climbing up trees with the boys.

235
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,660
Ever since her mom left,

236
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,150
she changed overnight. She became…

237
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,950
She suddenly became very mature.

238
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,620
She no longer went outside to play.

239
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,630
She would come back from school and study

240
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,680
and even started doing some chores.

241
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,100
Right. I can't remember what grade she was in.

242
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,370
We brought Kesong to visit.

243
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,440
It just so happened that Xiaoyu had just gotten home from an exam.

244
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,610
She was wiping her tears and I thought she did poorly. But when I asked,

245
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,950
she was crying because she got a 99%.

246
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,090
But look at Kesong.

247
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,830
She got a 78%

248
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,180
and she was ecstatic and started asking for things.

249
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,190
I got so angry, I gave her a beating.

250
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,610
You didn't end up giving her a beating because of Xiaoyu.

251
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,970
- That's right. I couldn't give her a beating because Xiaoyu was standing up for her.
- Right?

252
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,780
When Xiaoyu and Kesong are together,

253
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,900
it feels that Xiaoyu is the older sister.

254
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,940
She's such a mature kid.

255
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,300
Too mature indeed.

256
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,300
She even took charge of our household.

257
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,920
When we arrived in Shanghai, I wouldn't have been able to open up my restaurant

258
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,370
- without Xiaoyu.
- Right.

259
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,960
If you were to pick someone as an understanding and mature daughter,

260
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,110
it would be Xiaoyu.

261
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,470
I'm proud to say

262
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,940
that Xiaoyu is a blessing from God.

263
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,200
- Yes.
- But she always believed

264
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,810
that her mom left us because she wasn't good enough.

265
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,330
I tried explaining to her that it wasn't about her not being good enough, but me not being good enough.

266
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,050
But she wouldn't listen.

267
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,960
She always had to be the best at everything.

268
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,440
Seeing her like this, my...

269
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,710
my heart hurts.

270
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,580
Alright.

271
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,690
Yes, Xiaoyu is really competitive.

272
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,590
It must be hard for her to want to be the best all the time.

273
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,680
We actually didn't want…

274
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,420
Kesong to be overly competitive. We didn't even want her to leave Wuzhen.

275
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,700
We thought that her being safe and sound was the most important thing.

276
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,260
How did things end up like this?

277
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:07,080
By the way, I should thank Kesong.

278
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,860
She's an amazing kid. It was such a huge fire,

279
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,930
but she jumped in without hesitation, not even worrying about how dangerous it was.

280
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,250
That's an outlandish thing to say. It's what Kesong should've done.

281
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,740
Then competing against each other didn't matter.

282
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,180
If Xiaoyu were in that situation, she would rush in too.

283
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,270
Hurry!

284
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,310
Take this.

285
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,960
Brother, what are you doing? You're not much better off than me.

286
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,970
It's not about that. Whose money are you going to spend during these times if not your brother's?

287
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,900
We're a family.

288
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,230
That's right. It's just a little help from us.

289
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,600
Mr. Sentimental, I heard you dropped out of the competition.

290
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,110
You're my only competitor in this match.

291
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,150
I'm so lonely now that you've dropped out.

292
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,920
[I'm sorry, Bro. Have you heard the phrase "Dates Before Mates"? That's me!]

293
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,630
[Alright. I wish you a cabinet soon.]

294
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,880
[It's children! But don't let your guard down. Let's compete at the Chef's Competition in Hong Kong in December.]

295
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,200
[Awesome! Be there or be square.]

296
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,850
[Hiring Sales Associate]

297
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,900
You're hiring? Where's Chang Yuan?

298
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,240
She's pregnant and will stay home to get ready for the baby. Are you looking for her or me?

299
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,220
I'm here for my book.

300
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,020
One second.

301
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,600
You can see yourself out.

302
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,560
- Can I discuss something with you?
- No.

303
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,770
I didn't even say what it was yet.

304
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,060
I rented my place out, right? I'm looking for a place to stay.

305
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,740
How about I set up a camp bed on the second floor here?

306
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,900
I'll watch over the store for you as my rent payment.

307
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,110
I knew you would think of that.

308
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,650
Sorry. We're not looking for a guard.

309
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,910
It's fine if you want to stay here. Considering the environment and size of my shop,

310
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,040
I'll just charge you ¥10,000 a month.

311
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,860
That's a scam. Don't forget that I'm your ex-boyfriend.

312
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,490
I almost forgot we had such a relationship before.

313
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,430
I should be charging you ¥12,000.

314
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,050
You're such a bad friend. I'm leaving.

315
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,250
Looking forward to your next visit.

316
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,730
Hello, are you hiring?

317
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,770
- Yes.
- I saw the poster on the door

318
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,970
and wanted to ask for more details.

319
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,680
Are you looking for part-time or full-time work?

320
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,400
Full-time.

321
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,380
- You can fill out the form over there.
- Okay.

322
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,310
Do you have similar work experience?

323
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,500
I worked as a sales associate at a boutique called Xiu for two years.

324
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,850
Hey Mister, are you here for an interview?

325
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,460
Yes. You are…?

326
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,960
You came too late. This place isn't hiring anymore. They found someone.

327
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,920
We forgot to take down the poster. Sorry about that. You may leave.

328
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,660
Sorry.

329
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,920
No worries.

330
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,210
What's your problem?

331
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,420
He's obviously not fit for the job.

332
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,200
Is he because he's more handsome and manly than you?

333
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,430
How is he more handsome and manly than me?

334
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,090
He's just slightly taller than me.

335
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,790
And perhaps he's a bit younger than me.

336
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,010
Other than that, what other qualities does he have?

337
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,350
Besides, having such a guy in your shop,

338
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,670
aren't you worried about developing feelings for him? As your official ex-boyfriend,

339
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,310
I can't watch that happen and not do anything about it.

340
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,360
Thank you for your warmth and care like that of a relative.

341
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,180
Too bad. I'm not worried.

342
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,590
We're both single. Perhaps developing feelings for each other can be a good thing. I'm looking forward to it.

343
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,820
Are you hiring or looking for a husband?

344
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,530
The right person can appear at any place and time.

345
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,830
Please see yourself out.

346
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,990
How about this? I'll take over Chang Yuan's position.

347
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,500
Fine.

348
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,460
- Name.
- What?

349
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,280
Song Yiran. Nickname, Ran Ran. Online name, Joker.

350
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,350
Age.

351
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,400
24. One year younger than you.

352
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,570
- Married?
- No. I was dumped by my ex-girlfriend.

353
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,930
Liar.

354
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,300
I'm not. I was dumped by you.

355
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,360
Mister, is there something wrong with your memory?

356
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,500
In this case, I have doubts about whether or not you're fit for this job.

357
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,910
I'll give you another chance. Think about it carefully.

358
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,650
Fine. It's because I wasn't sure what I wanted.

359
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,600
[I'm here. Take your time.]

360
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,570
[I still need ten minutes.]

361
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,990
Girls…

362
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,910
Girls all use this, right?

363
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:04,890
Will the ice in the milk tea melt when she gets here?

364
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,900
Although girls all like to drink milk tea,

365
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:24,830
what about her? Why do I feel that she'd enjoy an iced Americano more?

366
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,690
Right. Let's switch to an iced Americano. It's bitter and cooler.

367
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,400
Will buying two cups of coffee in advance make me seem too eager?

368
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,760
No, no. I should just buy some water. It's simple and refreshing.

369
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,590
That's right.

370
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,390
Does my outfit not match?

371
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,730
Should I have worn other shoes with these pants?

372
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,150
What should I do? It's too late now.

373
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,850
[What are you nervous about?]

374
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,160
[Why do you look so nervous?]

375
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,320
[Why are you blushing?]

376
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,130
What is this?

377
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,670
The transfer agreement for London's Yuxuan.

378
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,980
You're transferring London's Yuxuan over to me?

379
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,210
Why? Where are you going?

380
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,490
Where can I even go?

381
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:40,630
My condition is getting worse. I won't be able to go anywhere soon.

382
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,260
But Yuxuan is like my child.

383
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,030
I wish to try my best to do something for it

384
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,630
in these last moments.

385
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,970
Elise, you're the most capable person I know.

386
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,070
You'll take good care of it for me, right?

387
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,640
And this one. It's the contract for Shanghai's Yuxuan.

388
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,300
The transfer of equity for London's Yuxuan is relatively simple.

389
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,600
I just have to sign the agreement.

390
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,960
But half of the equity of Shanghai's Yuxuan belongs to the Quentin Group.

391
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,890
It'll need your mom's signature.

392
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,020
Keep these two contracts and show them to her.

393
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,790
If there isn't anything else,

394
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,730
I want to get back to work.

395
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,160
We're almost out of coriander oil. Remember to get more later.

396
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,330
Got it, Mr. Jiang.

397
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,300
Add a bit more butter. You need to add 3% more butter to this batch.

398
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,130
Okay, Mr. Jiang.

399
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:40,550
♫ Rainclouds float above my head ♫

400
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,460
♫ Wait for lightning come and go ♫

401
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:57,170
♫ To embrace the rising storm ♫

402
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:04,930
♫ You will find the treasure of your life ♫

403
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:11,710
♫ You will find the treasure of your life ♫

404
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,310
Mom, I want to talk to you.

405
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,970
Come on. Congratulations on passing your interview.

406
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,920
I officially welcome you on behalf of the boutique's shareholders.

407
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,400
On behalf of… It seems that I'm not representative of anyone.

408
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,660
Anyways, let's work well together. Don't be late with my paychecks.

409
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,950
That will depend on your performance.

410
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,360
Try their crayfish. I've been here before.

411
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,810
Their crayfish is really delicious. I think their potatoes stewed with chicken is good too.

412
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,750
It is pretty good. Have some more of this.

413
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,640
Hello? Old Jiang, what's up?

414
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,870
What's up with Kesong?

415
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:10,200
Don't worry. I'll drop by to see her in a bit.

416
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,690
What's the matter? Old Jiang is asking you to pay Kesong a visit?

417
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,550
Yes.

418
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,330
They went to visit her cousin at the hospital.

419
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,160
And she caught the flu.

420
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,440
What? What are we waiting for then? Let's go.

421
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,090
Boss, the check, please. And some boxes to go.

422
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,960
Alright. Coming.

423
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,250
We're here.

424
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,790
Do you want to head up? It's been a while since you've seen her.

425
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,440
- That's alright. I still have stuff to do.
- Alright.

426
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,790
Thank you for giving me a ride.

427
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,260
It's me. Open the door.

428
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,250
Did you learn to do fortune-telling? How did you know I caught a cold? You even brought cold medicine.

429
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,550
Old Jiang told me. I can't believe you.

430
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,240
You don't like my WeChat moments nor reply to my messages.

431
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,340
Didn't he tell you he got me another phone?

432
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,720
I can't even receive your WeChat messages.

433
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,540
Aren't you being too hard on yourself?

434
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,440
It's all for the competition. He said I need to live a minimalist lifestyle.

435
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,810
Alright. So you cut me off.

436
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,950
Here you go. Drink some to warm yourself up.

437
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,770
This is great! He's handing everything over willingly.

438
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,330
This is consistent with all of the clauses

439
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,160
of my previous contract.

440
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,490
It's just with different transferee. One is you, and the other is me.

441
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:12,570
But the two Yuxuan restaurants are already in my name, so these contracts are meaningless.

442
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,290
Mom, do you really have the heart to take away the two Yuxuan restaurants,

443
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,040
leaving Oliver with nothing?

444
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,940
He arranged for this himself.

445
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:27,230
Yes, I know you were uneasy about the two contracts that had the fingerprints.

446
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,570
You feel like you cheated him and stole from him.

447
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,490
He's giving it all up himself now. You should be at ease.

448
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,130
Mom, how can you be so cold-hearted?

449
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,090
Cold-hearted isn't the right term.

450
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,410
I'm just not as emotionally driven as you. I did what I had to.

451
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:47,990
Look, Jiang Qianfan has lost his sense of taste. Very soon, he'll lose his sight, too.

452
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,350
I'm sure you know about the situation you're in.

453
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,440
The future is unclear. With the two of you like this,

454
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,260
handing the management of Yuxuan to me is the best option.

455
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,280
No.

456
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:04,960
Yuxuan belongs to Oliver. Even if it's going down, it should do so in his hands.

457
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,510
Elise, calm down.

458
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,160
I'm sure you know better than I do that it wasn't easy for Yuxuan to become all that it is today.

459
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,870
Are you really going

460
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,760
to watch it die like this?

461
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,780
Whether these two contracts are valid or not, I have no intentions to accept it.

462
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,000
I just wanted to show you them so you can see what Oliver's doing.

463
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,590
I'm hoping that you'd get moved by his actions so that you'll give me back the contracts you have.

464
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:34,160
I asked Lawyer Goodman. He said you still had the contracts.

465
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,890
You originally said that getting those two contracts signed were for my safety.

466
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,450
But now you're seeing what Oliver is deciding to do.

467
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,360
I don't need your protection.

468
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,250
I just want to be fair to him.

469
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,180
You know how much I'm suffering inside.

470
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:53,090
Why can't you consider the consequences of this matter standing in my shoes?

471
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,010
I know you feel bad.

472
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:58,360
But this is not the time to be blinded by emotions.

473
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,450
Alright. Let's not talk about this.

474
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,950
Anyways, I won't be giving you the contracts.

00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,980
Fine. If you're insistent on having Oliver lose Yuxuan,

476
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,670
you'll have to lose me too.

477
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,500
Hello? Is this the criminal police unit? I'm looking for Officer Han.

478
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,070
Yes, the one in charge of Li Yan's case. I'm Elise Quentin.

479
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,980
Okay. I'll wait.

480
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,250
Hi, Officer Han. I'm Elise Quentin.

481
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,280
I want to…

482
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:58,290
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

483
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,090
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

484
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:06,400
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

485
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:12,610
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

486
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,630
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

487
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:20,640
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

488
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:26,990
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
