It's ridiculous.

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,520
The tea flavor didn't seep into the shrimp

163
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,160
and absorb the excess flavors.

164
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,110
What does that mean?

165
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,360
What does it mean?

166
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,160
It means he didn't taste it.

167
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,540
He used his imagination and derrived.

168
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,990
But...

169
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,010
we don't have direct proof.

170
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,700
Instructor for the Future Star Culinary Competition

171
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,330
hides the fact that he lost his sense of taste.

172
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,380
This is huge!

173
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:49,020
Who knows, Thomas may even disqualify him as an instructor.

174
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,050
This may also

175
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,450
lead to his downfall.

176
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,060
This...

177
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,330
is more gratifying than defeating him in the competition.

178
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,200
Understood.

179
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Thus, warring with him, we cannot lose onstage and offstage.

180
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,950
Let's go. I'll show you

181
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,350
the dishes for the second round of the competition.

182

Foie gras?

183
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,220
Correct.

184
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,060
Chili gives foie gras a rich flavor.

185
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,880

189

190

You left them at my place.

191

I went to your restaurant, you weren't there,

192
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,540

193

It's okay, I don't need them anymore.

194

- Hi, Boris.

198

199
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,020

205
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,710
No, I can't go. I need to prepare for the competition tomorrow.

209

213
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,180
Sure. Take your time. I'll let you know when you've saved enough money.

214

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,440
Yes, Darling. What are you doing? Need anything?

218
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,920
Good writing skills. Rainbow Middle School alumni.

219
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,940
Did you read that article too? That author is really good at writing.

220
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,980
Him not being a writer is a great loss to Chinese literature.

221
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,180
I think he's good enough to be immortalized.

222

What a coincidence. I was also pulled in by someone else.

227
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,250
Really? I've never heard of a group member pulling a group leader in.

Song Yiran, you promised me not to have private contact with her.

You've forgotten all this, haven't you?

230
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,980
We are friends. How can it be considered private contact?

Why did you disband the group chat?

236
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,980
I've shown generosity.

237
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,060
I bought flowers for Lin Kesong and I cheered her on.

238
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,310
Why did you write to her online behind my back?

239
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,310
I felt sorry for her and wanted to encourage her.

240
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,950
Encourage? I think that's a love letter, almost like writing, "I love you."

241
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,150
Chu Ting, you don't have to do this. Why are you misinterpreting what I did?

242
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,500
It's obvious that you have feelings for her, and you said that I forced you to.

243
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,650
Don't you think you're shameless?

244
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,300
Chu Ting, are you crazy? We argued over and over again about Old Lin.

245
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,580
- What did she ever do to you?
- You're defending her, aren't you?

246
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,950
You don't even think about why we're fighting over her over and over again.

247
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,010
What woman can tolerate her boyfriend having another woman in his heart?

248
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,590
Let me tell you, I, Chu Ting, can't stand it! Bye!

249
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,220
Fine. Never see you again! So annoying!

250

Coach Qian, have a can of drink to replenish your energy.

251
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,390
You have something to ask me, right?

252
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,330
Here's the thing, I have a friend

253
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,370
who wrote a letter to his schoolmate.

254
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:52,980
He asked me if the letter looked like a love letter. I don't think so, what do you think?

255
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,820
I think it looks like a love letter.

256
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,100
For real. You see?

257
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,990
This letter was written with great affection and heart.

258
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,370
If this isn't a love letter, then what is it?

259
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,790
And I think it's a particularly subtle love letter.

260
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:18,420
Gives the impression that he cares about the girl a lot.

261
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,660
Your friend didn't realize it himself?

262
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,120
He really didn't realize it.

263
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,660
Okay. Thanks!

264
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,170
Spicy is the most exciting taste experience.

265
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,500
It is not a taste but a sense of pain.

266
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,810
Spice stimulates the human brain

267
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,790
and secretes...

268
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,180
Secretes many hormones.

269
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,720
By mediating body temperature, cardiovascular and respiration,

270
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,260
it creates a variety of different emotional responses.

271
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,720
In other words, if the spiciness is exquisitely controlled,

272
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,420
it can lead to a very different emotional experience.

273
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,530
It makes the sweet sweeter and the bitter more bitter.

274
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,980
Double the happiness, or sadness, or halve it.

275
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,420
Do you understand? Can you give me some reaction?

276
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,190
There are many types of spicy.

277

You can choose a favorite or familiar one to get started.

00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,930
She's too narrow-minded.

322
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,750
Did you hook up with another girl again?

323
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,290
Hook up? Can you change for a better word?

324
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,800
Let's go! I'm hungry.

325
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,380
- Old Lin, what are you—
- Stop!

326
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,480
What's the matter?

327
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,360
Scared the hell out of me.

328
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,790
I almost forgot that Mr. Jiang doesn't allow other people into his kitchen.

329
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,600
I've been in the kitchen when you weren't there.

330
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,720
Still not okay.

331
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,830
You can wait for me right there. I'll be quick.

332
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,670
Fine. I'll wait for you by the door.

333
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,590
Try it.

334
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,590
Old Lin.

335
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,890
This is the first time you cooked for me after learning how to cook from Jiang Qianfan, right?

336
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,660
Yeah.

337
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,840
How is it?

338
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,200
It's tasty.

339
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,250
Just a little too spicy.

340
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,490
- Really?
- Yes.

341
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,960
Don't eat it. I'll redo it for you.

342
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,660
Wait. Let me take a picture first.

343
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,010
No. I need this for the Culinary Competition.

344
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,830
I won't take pictures of the dishes. I'm taking a picture of you.

345
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:43,040
Retouch the picture for me. Make my face slimmer.

346
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,930
Wait for me!

347
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,450
This little girl once ate chili peppers for 200 yuan.

348
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,700
She ate until she passed out and was taken to the emergency room in my arms.

349
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,600
Now she's all grown up.

350
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,310
Although she still looks like a little girl,

351
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:11,690
she stands in the kitchen like a big woman who can do anything.

352
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,520
I'm touched, for the record.

353
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,340
[post]

354
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,300
Sister Ting, I admire you so much.

355
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,280
No wonder you were able to subdue Song Yiran.

356
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,960
Sister Ting?

357
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,590
What are you thinking about?

358
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,520
Nothing. What did you say?

359
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,230
Didn't you read his friends' circle?

360
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,460
He asked me about it. I had no problem with it and let him post it that way.

361
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,650
You are so generous!

362
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:53,700
If my boyfriend complimented another girl like that, I would kill him.

363
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,870
What's wrong with that?

364
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,540
A girl who ate chili for 200 yuan until she passed out

365
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,880
must have a brain problem. What do I have to worry about?

366
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,210
You are so wise, Sister Ting.

367
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,520
[Song Yiran]

368
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,900
[delete contact]

369
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:33,330
Now the weather is hot and the restaurant is relatively cold,

370
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,790
so I prepared some shawls. If any guest needs one,

371
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:40,620
especially when it comes to female guests wearing dresses with cold shoulders,

372
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,990
ask them in a timely manner and help them.

373
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:48,190
Various colors are available. You can let guests pick their favorite.

374
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,530
All right, Oliver?

375
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,380
Damai, keep washing vegetables. Others can go back to their position. Dismiss.

376
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:07,270
Okay! Keep washing vegetables!

377
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,910
Forget it.

378
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,510
Don't you think he is sick?

379
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:36,390
Elise, I want to talk about what happened last night.

380
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:42,670
Oliver, I think what happens outside of work should be said outside of work.

381
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,980
You are right. I'll go.

382
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,240
Wow.

383
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,720
[I didn't have the heart to ask just now. You are not in love with Jiang Qianfan, right?]

384
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,550
[That's not possible.]

385
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,790
[He belongs to Elise.]

386
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,720
[Why are you asking this all of a sudden?]

387
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,940
[I thought you became this way because of him. I'm glad it's not. Let's work hard together.]

388
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,030
Tonight, we are offering a choice of two wines.

389
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:07,230
Both of these wines are very good. The first is a Pinot Noir from Central Otago.

390
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,750
It is not your typical Pinot Noir. It has...

391
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,390
- Miss, here's your dish.
- A very light fruity aroma, but

392
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,710
the taste is very good. Not too sweet.

393
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,760
The other one is

394
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,620
a type of Chateau from non-terroir regions in France.

395
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,610
[Can you still stand it?]

396
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:50,740
[I won't leave like this.]

397
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,160
Are you waiting for me?

398
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,430
Yes. I just now realized

399
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,010
you leave work so much later than me every day.

400
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,370
Thanks for your hard work.

401
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,820
Because it's all for Yuxuan, it's not hard.

402
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,680
Do you want to talk to me about last night?

403
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,110
I watched the surveillance.

404
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,170
You were gone before dawn.

405
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:40,640
Although I can't remember what happened last night.

406
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,930
I know you've been having a rough time lately.

407
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:47,160
- No, no. I do not have—
- I'm sorry.

408
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,400
I'm such a jerk. I hurt you over and over again.

409
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,820
Elise.

410
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,860
Everything that happened between us,

411
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,870
I am willing to take on.

412
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,680
I'll be with you

413
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,490
I'll be with you.

414
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,710
Do you know how long I've been waiting for that, Oliver?

415
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:27,360
So long that it's too late.

416
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,060
- Elise...
- Don't.

417
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,050
What happened?

418
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,380
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

419
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,930
Just give me some time to think about it, okay?

420
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,520
Oliver, goodbye.
