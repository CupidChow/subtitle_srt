9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,320
Oliver, do you still remember the question you asked me?

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,000
I do.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,580
I'll answer you now. I want to give it another shot.

12
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,970
Okay.

13
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,230
But under one condition.

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,250
Let me hear it.

15
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,970
Let me post the announcement.

16
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,830
I can't let you do that.

17
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,300
Oliver, Lin Kesong offended you before the public.

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,820
I know that, but you can't use that as your bargaining chip.

19
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,750
Elise, you should be professional, right?

20
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,280
Oliver.

21
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:49,580
Don't you think you're asking too much of me?

22
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,220
Let's not argue about this.

23
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,090
You're welcome to move your stuff in whenever you're ready.

24
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,740
That won't be necessary.

25
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,380
I'm too exhausted. I'll get going now.

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,020
Bye.

27
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,510
- Who is it?
- Hello, this is the reception desk. Will you be extending your stay?

28
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,670
I won't. I'll check out in a bit.

29
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,220
Thank you.

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,020
After I calmed down, I realized that I stayed

31
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,710
not because I didn't know how to explain this to my parents,

32
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,290
but because I was waiting for Jiang Qianfan to find me and take me back.

33
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,670
I felt very ashamed after realizing my true feelings.

34
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,010
I couldn't get over Jiang Qianfan like I couldn't get over Song Yiran.

35
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,850
Lin Kesong, haven't you learned your lesson yet?

36
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,510
- The results are out.
- Boss!

37
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,120
Isn't this that black chicken guy?

38
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,600
No wonder he looked so arrogant. Turns out, he's pretty impressive!

39
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,250
The seemingly mundane tuna is made of different types of acid.

40
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,730
- The lactic acid in yogurt, the acetic acid in myoga...
- It's pretty good.

41
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,310
And the citric acid of the lemon.

42
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,380
The refreshing taste balances out the greasiness of the tuna,

43
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,580
creating a rich taste. Let's congratulate him.

44
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,200
In second place, her dish consists of yogurt that has been fermented for several days,

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,890
aged sweet vinegar, and ten-year-old fine wine.

46
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:08,560
Three kinds of acidic flavors fermented for different amounts of time, and the sour flavor of hawthorns.

47
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,980
You just need to have a good diet and proper exercise. I can create a plan for you.

48
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,320
Contract your shoulder blades.

49
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,410
Exhale. Inhale.

50
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,880
Last one.

51
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,620
That's good for today.

52
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,470
Your mind seems to be somewhere else. It's easy for you to hurt yourself like that.

53
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,280
Coach, how does it feel with your wedding ring on?

54
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,000
I feel very happy.

55
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,850
I envy you.

56
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,590
Have a good rest.

57
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,920
Blu! Blu?

58
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,350
What are you doing just standing here? Aren't you going in?

59
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,020
Xiaoyu won't see me, and she said she won't be seeing me ever again.

60
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,080
How did you upset her?

61
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,480
She spent the entire day at my place the day before the competition.

62
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,000
As Boris put it, "I distracted her will to fight."

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,650
That's why she lost.

64
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,100
Why do you have your luggage? Where are you going?

65
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,250
You'll know soon.

66
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,540
Okay. Your cousin is very angry right now.

67
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,630
I wish you luck. Bye.

68
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,060
- Is it good?
- It's great.

69
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,090
Hurry!

70
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,820
Uncle.

71
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,520
Kesong. What are you doing here?

72
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,180
Why do you have your luggage?

73
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,860
What's the matter, child?

74
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,280
It's okay.

75
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,520
What's the matter?

76
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,470
Don't cry.

77
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,420
You're really dropping out of the competition?

78
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,620
Why would I lie about this?

79
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,600
I'm here to say goodbye.

80
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,940
You're going back to Wuzhen? Will you not be coming back anymore?

81
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,320
If that's the case,

82
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,470
we can be sisters again!

83
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,040
How are you so quick to change your attitude?

84
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,410
Wait.

85
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,650
This time you two are making up, why does it seem different?

86
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,720
Lin Xiaoyu, be honest with me.

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,350
Were you fooling me last time?

88
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,370
Yes, Dad.

89
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,030
You wicked girl!

90
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,510
You wicked girl! Look at how shocked you got Uncle Lin!

91
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,990
I'm in a great mood right now. I won't be mad no matter what you say.

92
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,990
All right, go wash your hands and get ready to eat.

93
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,380
Okay.

[Did you send your words to the advertising agency yet?]

97
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,710
Eldest Brother, look at these shirts.

98
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,450
You're in such good shape, you should try out different styles.

99
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,780
They look great.

100
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,320
It's very appropriate for today's weather. It's so hot out.

101
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,020
Look, the sun is blazing.

102
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,070
You're right. It has been really hot the past few days.

103
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,170
Chu Ting, look to the southeast in the morning and to the northwest in the evening.

104
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,100
Let's see if it'll rain tonight.

105
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,660
You're not here to look to the northwest.

106
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,150
Eldest Brother, what exactly are you trying to say?

107
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,540
I'm just mentioning it.

108
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,620
Isn't there a saying that states you should stop to see the scenery

109
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,880
no matter how busy you are?

110
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,090
You're trying to say that I should look at the billboard across from here no matter how busy I am, right?

111
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,470
Is it that obvious?

112
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,110
You do so much for Yiran,

113
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,380
but he'll never grow up if you keep doing things for him.

114
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,430
Chu Ting, I wouldn't have to worry so much about him if he was even half as smart as you are.

115
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,500
Yiran is actually extremely smart. He's just really lazy.

116
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,130
Just tell me what time the billboard will be up.

117
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,160
12-1 p.m. It's already been three minutes.

118
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,560
Yes.

119
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,810
I appreciate your kind intentions,

120
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,520
but I still have to let Yiran suffer a bit.

121

Hasn't the time passed anyways? Come and try on the clothes.

What the hell is going on with you?

123
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,730
Can't you just do one thing right for me?

124
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,240
What the hell are you thinking? Tell me!

125
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,210
Answer me!

126
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,980
- Answer me! Why aren't you responding?
- Brother.

127
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,700
You can stop yelling.

128
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,410
I'm going to say a few words to Chu Ting. Wait for me here.

129
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,090
Chu Ting, I want to speak to you.

130
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,870
Go ahead. Don't take too long.

131
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,840
My brother wanted me to propose to you through that billboard.

132
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,830
So?

133
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,630
I agreed. I even thought of the words to put on there,

134
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,320
but just when I was about to send it out,

135
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,760
I hesitated. I thought that the words "Marry Me," were too heavy for me.

136
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,890
I'm not ready yet, so I'm sorry.

137
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,850
Why did you assume that I was ready?

138
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,230
What?

139
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,950
I'm more at ease now that you said that.

140
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,850
I actually think that I'm really stupid. I'm afraid of hurting you.

141
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,470
Whether I accept your proposal is my business, and whether you propose is your business.

142
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,660
You did hurt me.

143
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,410
I'm sorry. I've actually been asking myself the past few days

144
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,290
if I would even be with you if it wasn't for my brother.

145
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,150
What's the answer?

146
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,420
I don't know.

147
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,190
Song Yiran, I really don't know what to say to you.

148
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:35,510
I'm very mad. This isn't just something that can be solved with an apology,

149
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,320
but I also admire you at the same time.

150
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,360
You're able to be honest with yourself

151
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,720
and you don't mix up your feelings.

152
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,260
I feel even worse now that you said that.

153
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,020
You should feel bad.

154
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,060
Go back and have a good think about what the answer to the problem is.

155
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,990
Come and see me after you have an answer

156
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,870
or don't come to see me at all.

157
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,300
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,520
Will you wait for me?

159
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,590
That's hard to say.

160
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,580
The door won't always be open.

161
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,400
Unless you knock on it again.

162
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,710
Brother, I didn't propose to Chu Ting.

163
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,450
Why not?

164
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,960
I'm sorry. Yell at me if you want. I don't want to explain myself.

165
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,250
You probably won't understand even if I told you.

166
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,360
Get out of here.

167
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,500
I'll leave then, Brother. I'll talk to you after you calm down.

168
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,150
Hello, where's Old Lin?

169
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,310
She's not here. Are you looking for her?

170
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,460
I'll get going then, since she's not here.

171
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,810
Let me ask you something.

172
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:31,020
Did Old Lin ever tell you about the person she has had a crush on for ten years?

173
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,480
She mentioned it.

174
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,960
It's me, right?

175
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,560
Yes.

176
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,500
What's wrong?

177
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,700
It's nothing really.

178
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,080
My brother wanted me to propose to Chu Ting for business, but I didn't.

179
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,220
I messed everything up.

180
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,670
Because of Lin Kesong?

181
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,350
That's part of it. I just realized

182
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,110
that Lin Kesong has always had a place in my heart,

183
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,250
and she also…

184
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,720
But I really like Chu Ting.

185
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,560
How can I like two people at the same time?

186
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,430
I still haven't figured out what to do about getting married.

187
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,270
I think I need to figure this out before I know what to do.

188
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,030
You're being honest.

189
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,220
You're making fun of me?

190
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,350
I'm serious.

191
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,640
You're brave enough to face your true feelings.

192
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,850
I don't compare to you in that aspect.

193
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,800
You're older than me. You should be more experienced with this than I am.

194
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,560
Not at all.

195
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,600
Why don't you teach me?

196
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,380
How am I supposed to teach you when I'm confused?

197
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,660
I'll get going then.

198
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,690
Don't tell Old Lin I came.

199
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,420
Thank you.

200
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,090
Has Jiang Qianfan ever punished you?

201
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:19,320
Of course, he has. He has starved me, had me do sit-ups,

202
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,420
planks, and cleaned the floors of Yuxuan.

203
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,460
Your punishments are nothing compared to mine.

204
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,200
I dissected hundreds of jins of crucians yesterday.

205
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,570
I didn't get a break for the entire 15 hours.

206
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,750
I had to wash my hair multiple times.

207
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,160
Otherwise, you would've been suffocated by the smell.

208
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,300
Boris is insane.

209
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,120
Isn't Jiang Qianfan?

210
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,750
At least he looks normal.

211
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,980
Hundreds of jins of crucians.

212
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,760
I think your hair smells pretty nice.

213
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,950
Are you still using the shampoo I got you?

214
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,540
Yes.

215
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,750
Here.

216
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,370
Why did you keep so much of it?

217
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,760
It does smell pretty good.

218
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:15,090
Look at how foolish we are.

219
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,560
I hit you for him.

220
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,120
Just the opposite. I was the one who hit you for him.

221
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,790
The food's ready. Get ready to eat.

222
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,460
Who's calling?

223
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,130
Jiang Qianfan, do I answer?

224
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,500
Hurry and answer it.

225
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,110
Answer it.

226
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,590
What?

227
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,590
Are you still in Shanghai?

228
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,320
What's the matter?

229
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,520
It's nothing. It's just...

230
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,520
that I put two bottles of wine on the table. If you...

231
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,350
I don't want it!

232
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,070
It's not for you. It's for your parents.

233
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,970
Just think of it…

234
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,790
Just think of it as an apology from me. You can decide.

235
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,530
I'm not home anyways. I put the key under the door.

236
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:27,150
Come get it yourself if you can. Okay?

237
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,200
You heard that right? Do I go?

238
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,110
It's up to you.

239
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,550
I think that Jiang Qianfan is being pretty sincere.

240
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,610
Go get it. It's for your parents, not for you.

241
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,100
- Right?
- Yes.

242
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,800
Go get it after you eat. Go downstairs to eat first.

243
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,700
You're right. It'll just sit there if I don't take it anyways.

244
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,960
¥1,000. Don't push me!

245
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,200
Buddy.

246
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,400
Do you know how much overtime our boss worked

247
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,750
to fix your bike?

248
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,720
¥1,000? Stop dreaming.

249
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,420
Something as simple as fixing a rear wheel needs overtime?

250
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,050
Since when did incompetence become valued?

251
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,870
I looked up your bike. It had defects since production.

252
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,480
The frame is too heavy, the design of the pedal is not fit for riders,

253
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,490
and the width of both wheels is too narrow.

254
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,890
You wobble around every time you try to act cool, right?

255
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,130
But don't worry, I fixed all of that for you.

256
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,210
The next owner of this bike will be extremely satisfied.

257
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,720
No wonder the brain circuit is that strange.

258
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,900
Is your brain lacking nutrition because of your diet?

259
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,250
Don't you know that you can get diseases from eating too much?

260
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,830
It seems that you have a big misunderstanding about food. Some people may never get a chance to have a bite of my food ever in their lives,

261
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,200
let alone eat too much of it.

262
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,970
Boss, you do have a misunderstanding about food, but we don't!

263
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,160
How about this? If you can cook a dish

264
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,690
- that we sincerely enjoy...
- That we sincerely enjoy...

265
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,060
We'll give you back the bike. We'll even gift the three of us to you.

266
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,050
No problem. Don't get too excited that you'll want to hand over your store to me too.

267
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,960
The black chicken guy is done for. I've never seen our boss interested in any kind of food.

268
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,250
She's not interested in food at all.

269
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,890
Didn't you say you weren't home?

270
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,040
Did I say that?

271
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,440
- Where's the wine?
- What wine?

272
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,800
I won't ever trust you again.

273
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,390
No need to look around, I locked the doors.

274
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,260
I also locked all the exits out of here.

275
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,590
Hello? Mom.

276
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,670
Kesong, I just received two bottles of wine.

277
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,000
What wine?

278
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,990
They're from Mr. Jiang.

279
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,200
Thank him for us, immediately, this wine must be expensive.

280
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,330
By the way, ask Mr. Jiang how we should keep the wine.

281
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,300
Give me a second.

282
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,810
My parents asked you how to preserve the wine.

283
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,600
Keep it in a shady place and avoid direct sunlight.

284
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,540
It's the best constant temperature.

285
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,100
Dad, why don't you drink it as soon as possible? This should be consumed soon.

286
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,790
Anyway, there are lots of them here. I will send it to you again.

287
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,130
Thank Mr. Jiang immediately.

288
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,730
Okay, I'm hanging up.

289
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,260
My parents said to thank you.

290
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,240
Don't mention it.

291
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,370
I'm leaving. Open the door for me.

292
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,140
Hold on.

293
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,950
We are starting our training. Where are you going out for fun?

294
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,710
Bye!

295
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,740
Don't leave, Lin Kesong.

296
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,530
I know that I'm bad with words.

297
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,800
Can I take them back?

298
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,000
Sorry.

299
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,840
Let me make it up to you, okay?

300
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,890
What will happen if you bully me and kick me out again?

301
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,100
I will do my best.

302
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,800
"Do your best?"

303
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,810
No, I'm saying I will do my best not to make you angry.

304
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,390
I will respect your past feelings

305
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,800
and what you like. Although I don't understand,

306
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,640
I will respect them.

307
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,830
If I make you angry again in the future, I will...

308
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,900
What will you do?

309
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:55,010
I will apologize to you on Boris' livestream, okay?

310
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,340
And you have to do wok tossing 2,000 times every day,

311
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,540
and treat me to crayfish every day too. Cook what I want to eat every day.

312
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,530
Fine.

313
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,290
I'm rather thirsty.

314
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,590
Is water okay?

315
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,600
How to open this?

316
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,190
Like this. Here!

317
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,950
I'm rather hungry too.

318
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,750
Look at the time now.

319
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,640
Do you have any objections?

320
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,930
No, it's normal to be hungry. Besides, you are still developing.

321
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,460
Why don't we do this?

322
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,560
I'm about to cook salt-baked chicken. Interested to check it out?

323
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,660
I'm just taking a look, I didn't forgive you.

324
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:59,770
[Xiaoyu, Mr. Jiang apologized. I will continue training with him.]

325
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,930
Who are you? Do I know you?

326
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,310
What did she say?

327
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,740
"Sorry? Do we know each other?"

328
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,200
I just reconciled with her. What should I do?

329
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,580
You can only be the weak party and a loser

330
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,360
so that she will reconcile with you. You need to do this.

331
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,560
No way.

332
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,690
That's right. You shouldn't be the one to adjust.

333
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,480
It's her.

334
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:50,690
Let's not waste our time thinking about this. Focus on your training, okay?

335
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,200
Hurry up. This is the most important step. Take a look.

336
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,850
After this,

337
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,050
we must dry the chicken inside out.

338
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,390
If it's too moist, it will absorb too much salt.

339
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:07,230
It will taste too salty.

340
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,230
Hence, before we spread spring onion oil on it,

341
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,370
- we must...
- Okay, I'm back.

342
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:17,320
It's still this familiar person and familiar scent.

343
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,820
Did I agree too fast?

344
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,050
But I can't wait any longer.

345
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,110
So, when you...

346
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,620
The moment he apologized, I realized

347
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,380
there's actually someone I can't give up.

348
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,500
Some people are worth waiting for.

349
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,030
As long as you wait for that right person, he will reciprocate,

350
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,230
and also give you warmth when you least expect it.

351
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,620
After spreading the spring onion oil on the chicken, we use our hands to gently massage it.

352
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,150
Next, we wrap the chicken in a lotus leaf.

353
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,690
Be careful when wrapping it in a lotus leaf. Don't break the lotus leaf.

354
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,860
The use of salt for this dish is very effective.

355
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,260
When we season and bake the ingredients, we use this.

356
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,140
Next, add anise, cinnamon,

357
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,680
and cloves. Use medium and slow fire for frying.

358
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,160
Skill in frying the salt is also very important

359
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,350
to bring out the scent of the spices and the flavors at the same time.

360
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,210
Xiaoyu?

361
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,920
Lin Kesong was recalled by Jian Qianfan.

362
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,820
What's wrong? You seem very surprised.

363
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,410
That's right, she went back that soon?

364
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,790
Jiang Qianfan is amazing.

365
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,570
I think the one who's amazing is Lin Kesong instead.

366
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,040
She deceived my sympathy.

367
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,060
No, she's not the amazing one.

368
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,100
Jiang Qianfan is giving a signal by letting her go back.

369
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,000
It clearly shows that his restrictions on conventions have started to loosen.

370
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,740
For a chef, sugar might not be a must, but it is necessary.

371
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,600
He can still be called a "god" even when he doesn't use sugar.

372
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,770
If he uses sugar one day,

373
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:30,560
he will be tenfold more amazing than now.

374
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:38,560
Thomas, my apologies. I would like to retract and withdraw my application for the competition.

375
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,690
Do you think I organize competitions where anyone can join and withdraw at their will?

376
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,150
Sorry, I will only accept Elise's withdrawal from the competition.

377
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,960
Thomas, I'm sorry. You know that I have never used sugar.

378
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,020
I have never taught Lin Kesong this too, but she...

379
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,390
You let her win the competition.

380
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,890
That wonderful sweet flavored dish, it's still engraved in my mind.

381
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,420
You must get this straight. It's impossible for a person who has a grudge against sweetness to create this flavor.

382
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,860
That was ten years ago.

383
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,060
Thomas, everything is different now.

384
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,110
How can it be different?

385
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,930
If you have any statement which can convince me today, I can consider

386
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,860
to retract your statement and let you continue to participate in the competition,

387
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,850
but let me make this clear first.

388
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,430
With a personality like mine, if you want me to understand the convention you planned for yourself,

389
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,760
it would probably be very difficult.

390
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,020
This is four years ago. After Montgomery was found in the shipwreck,

391
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,250
I went back to help him handle his remnants and found this.

392
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,820
"I hate sugar."

393
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,430
Are these the last words written by Montgomery?

394
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,150
I think they are, and this is the last page.

395
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,090
There's nothing in it.

396
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,610
Even if I want to ask him what happened then, I can't do it too.

397
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:10,400
I only know that he said he hated sugar.

398
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,060
It was sugar that trapped him and took away his life,

399
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,430
so that's the reason why I hate sugar more.

400
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,290
Qianfan, you should know that

401
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,260
sugar didn't take away Montgomery's life. It was a disaster.

402
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,170
Thomas, you are the most optimistic person I have met, and also, the most interesting person.

403
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:37,400
But I'm different from you, I can't do what you did!

404
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,660
After my parents passed away in a car accident,

405
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,570
I met Montgomery. I thought I grabbed driftwood, but what happened in the end?

406
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,220
In the end, the same thing happened to Montgomery.

407
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,790
Perhaps, the taste of sweetness relaxes others.

408
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,060
Sweetness and happiness.

409
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,570
They are unreal to me!

410
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,430
It's like a dream which can only be sustained by pain.

411
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:06,260
Yes, perhaps sweetness can give happiness to others,

412
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,700
but to me, it's the contrary.

413
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,090
It was the sweetness that took everything away from me. That's why I don't use sugar in my food!

414
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,230
I respect your attitude towards life.

415
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:22,620
You can dislike sugar, but have you ever thought of this? As a mentor,

416
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,860
by doing this to Lin Kesong, is it fair?

417
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,270
Also, do you remember what's my objective for conducting this competition?

418
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,720
I do.

419
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,060
It's to let more young people like cuisine,

420
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,160
and provide young people with the opportunity to become talented chefs.

421
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,890
Hence, you are not allowed to hate sugar. This is your problem.

422
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,060
These young people have the right to train

423
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,290
and develop themselves too. If Lin Kesong reaches the finals of the competition

424
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,820
and she wants to compete in sweetness, she will need to go on stage with you too.

425
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,270
By then, what do you want her to do?

426
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,550
Withdraw from the competition

427
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,830
or rely on herself?

428
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,860
I have never imagined that she will get into the finals.

429
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,870
With her current performance, it's possible that she may get into the finals.

430
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,870
If you don't want to participate in this competition, please withdraw immediately.

431
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,720
Also, don't follow me.

432
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,220
If you follow me, you will mess up my rhythm.

433
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,330
Lin Kesong is back?

434
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,660
Lin Kesong used the sugar Jiang Qianfan hates the most,

435
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,640
which really touched his boundary. How can she be invited back?

436
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,250
He's the master. Of course, he is in charge of it.

437
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,250
It's not that simple, right? I remember you told me that

438
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,530
you just put a tiny bit of brown sugar in his dessert,

439
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,320
and he almost bombed the kitchen.

440
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,810
Now that Lin Kesong did it in front of everyone

441
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,010
and there are no consequences for her, why?

442
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:28,600
I got it. He set his boundaries for you.

443
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,650
Not really.

444
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,140
Of course, and everyone else he doesn't love.

445
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,080
Hello?

446
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,560
So fast? All right, I'm on my way. Okay.

447
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,430
[Send]

448
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,370
Sorry for the long wait.

449
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:23,560
It's not long at all. It's the perfect amount of waiting.

450
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,890
Such an exquisite greeting.

451
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,150
This is a nice place.

452
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,800
If you like it, come often. I will close the shop for you every time.

453
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,180
That's not what I meant.

454
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,820
I meant close the shop, so others won't come.

455
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,120
You are the only VIP here.

456
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,140
You are so good at pleasing people.

457
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,440
- Please, sit.
- All right.

458
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,830
Anything to drink? Tea? Coffee?

459
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,470
- Coffee, please and thank you.
- Got it.

460
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,650
Oh, right. I don't have coffee here.

461
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:12,750
You are so funny. Why give me the option then?

462
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,110
- Tea then.
- All right.

463
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:20,090
Right, I almost forgot the important thing here.

464
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,460
This is for you.

465
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,290
Wow, so pretty!

466
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,920
I can't wait to try it on.

467
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,210
You may try it on now. Please.

468
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,990
How do I look?

469
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,420
Beautiful. Beautiful.

470
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,920
Qipao is made for a woman to wear.

471
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,740
It fits you perfectly. The measurements you gave me are very accurate.

472
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,600
- It fits just right.
- Wonderful.

473
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,900
My tailor made this.

474
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,160
I have a shirt with the same fabric.

475
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,880
Hey, who allowed you to make a couple's outfit for me?

476
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,150
I didn't...

477
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,860
This... is not a couple's outfit.

478
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,140
Look at how scared you are. As long as we don't wear them together.

479
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,900
Please help me put this on. I want to see if it matches the dress.

480
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,930
Old Huang, I'm back!

481
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,790
- I'm sorry.
- B*stard! Come back!

482
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,790
The gold chain should face forward.

483
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,480
I didn't see anything.

484
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,760
Hey, what's with your vision? How can you not see such a pretty qipao?

485
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,430
That's right. The qipao is nice.

486
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,830
Are you two busy? I will leave you guys to it.

487
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,970
- All right, let me walk you out.
- Sure.

488
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,620
Goodbye, Ms. Quentin.

489
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,900
Keep it up.

490
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,850
Old Huang, you did well for yourself.

491
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,070
Not bad.

492
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,260
Shut up, kid.

493
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,330
Did I say anything?

494
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,410
Hurry up. We are about to open.

495
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,830
- Hello?
- Lin Kesong.

496
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:51,600
What happened to you today? Why did go on "do not disturb"? Are you all right?

497
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,870
Nothing had happened.

498
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:57,040
Wait, is there still internet?

499
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,960
There's no internet here.

500
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,180
I think it's the router.

501
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,180
The router is on the first floor. Go downstairs, I will teach you.

502
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,060
One second. Going down right now.

503
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,700
[New text]

504
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,220
[I have an appointment with Mr. Jiang, Ms. Quentin. This is your last chance. Give me two million and I will be gone. Or else, I will tell him everything.]

505
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,700
[Do not tell him. I beg you.]

506
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,670
Yiyan?

507
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,620
Yiyan?

508
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,650
No, wait!

509
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,560
Lin Kesong!

510
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,470
- Miss Lin, I am leaving right now!
- Don't come near me!

511
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,410
Don't worry. I'm not here to steal things!

512
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,690
Don't leave! Come back!

513
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,180
Lin Kesong, I'm coming back right now.

514
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,130
Hello?

515
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,730
Lin Kesong!

516
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,410
Lin Kesong!

517
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,270
Lin Kesong!

518
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,640
Lin Kesong! Lin Kesong!

519
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,870
You are finally back.

520
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,500
Thank God you are back. If he comes back, I...

521
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,830
I'm here. Nothing will happen to you. Nothing.

522
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,260
You're okay. You're okay.
