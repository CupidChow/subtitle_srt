Nina,

10
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,590
there's one thing that I've always wanted to apologize to you for.

11
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,830
That time I chased you out,

12
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,890
actually, I've always felt guilty about it.

13
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,390
From the bottom of my heart, I've never thought that you wanted to harm me.

14
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,050
But in that situation then, I can't believe anybody.

15
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,730
I only wanted to find people who are beside me to vent.

16
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,390
Actually, there were several times when I wanted to call you.

17

But I didn't lower my head.

18

Sorry.

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,990
Mr. Jiang, don't say that.

20
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,340
I've already known you for 10 years. I know you better than you know yourself.

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,120
If I say that I wasn't sad when I left then, that would be fake.

But I don't feel aggrieved.

I called Nina's phone in her hometown.

Even I was not exempted.

34

In the end, she was even more out of line.

35
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,450
She even chased me out of my room and told me to sleep in the study room.

36
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,610
What's wrong with the study room? It's not good?

37

Didn't you tell me to sleep in the study room previously too?

38

- No—
- Besides, aren't you sleeping back at your room now?

39
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,270
Yes, I'm sleeping in my room now, but aren't you sleeping in my room too?

You know toothaches, right. The most painful tooth pains

There are ten billion! Once this medicine is used,

128
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,160
these ten billion nerve cells will react within your body at the same time

00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,460
don't do dumb things.

164
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,960
Believe in me.

165
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,530
Elise.

166
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,140
I won't give it to you,

167
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,140
and I won't give it to Oliver.

168
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,260
I will keep it for myself.

169
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,950
What will you keep it for?

170
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,480
Just to commemorate it.

171
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,670
Sorry, I'm tired. I will go home.

172
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,400
Boris.

173
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,400
Speak.

174
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,140
Hello, it's me.

175
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,480
Sorry, I will have to stand you up.

176
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,290
You will have to go out to the sea by yourself tomorrow.

177
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,910
What?

178
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,710
You can't let Lin Kesong go again, right?

179
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
Yes.

180
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,640
I'm worried about her.

181
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,810
Alright, you take care.

182
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,860
Okay Baozi, you take care too.

183
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,200
Hello?

184
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,000
Where are you?

185
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,000
Don't move, I'll go over to find you right now.

186
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,630
Why do you always like to come here?

187
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,940
There is wind.

188
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,940
Do you know?

189
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,770
When I first came back to Shanghai,

190
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,070
I was looking for houses nearby.

191
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,000
Every time I passed by Suzhou Creek, I would think of London's Thames River.

192
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,590
At that time, I always thought how good it would have been

193
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,120
if I could sit here when I was tired.

194
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,200
There wasn't once when I wanted to get up.

195
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,900
For me,

196
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,600
I really liked the valley where you brought me to dig up wild greens.

197
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,130
It is quiet and comfortable over there.

198
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,200
I wouldn't think it's annoying even if I stayed there for 10,000 years.

199
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,960
But someone must go with me.

200
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,280
Really?

201
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,040
Who do you want to ask to go with you?

202
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,320
- Can I ask you?
- Why?

203
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,500
Because when I'm with you,

204
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,430
it's noisy and happy.

205
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,210
We also always have never-ending things to talk about.

206
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,670
How about you?

207
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,230
If you were to go, who would you pick?

208
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,790
You already picked me,

209
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,900
I can still pick someone else?

210
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,300
- You can't.
- Then that's right.

211
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,110
You don't think I'm annoying?

212
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,350
You really are annoying,

213
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,170
but I don't mind it.

214
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,200
Because I—

215
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,260
With you by my side,

216
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,680
I am at ease.

217
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,410
What are you talking about?

218
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,760
Aren't Elise and Doctor Xie both your good friends?

219
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,070
They love you.

220
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,410
Don't worry, I'll always stay with you.

221
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,420
Let me ask you a question.

222
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,560
If...

223
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,230
I'm just saying if.

224
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:09,330
If there's a chance that will allow me to get back everything I lost,

225
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:16,300
and maybe my vision, but at a big cost,

226
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,390
would you try it if it were you?

227
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,070
A very big cost? How big?

228
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,940
Maybe death.

229
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,070
What?

230
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm just randomly asking. Answer me randomly.

231
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,260
Hurry.

232
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,060
You also said,

233
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,550
you might die.

234
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,750
I also don't want to die.

235
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,560
But I still have to do something.

236
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,450
Lin Kesong.

237
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,750
You grew up. I taught you.

238
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,540
Yeah.

239
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,170
If it wasn't you,

240
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,760
how would it be possible for me to say these words right now?

241
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,330
Do you believe,

242
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,420
I don't have to see you right now,

243
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,380
and I know that you are moping.

244
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,300
I'll take you to watch a movie.

245
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,700
Okay?

246
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,900
What?

247
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,700
Watch a movie.

248
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,820
I can listen.

249
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,440
Go with me.

250
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,440
What's happened? Why are you crying?

251
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Two people love each other,

252
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,510
but they can't be together, so I feel so sad.

253
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,500
Are you an idiot? What's in the movie is fake.

254
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,590
But they are still pitiful.

255
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,010
Going from strangers to knowing each other,

256
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,570
then until they're together,

257
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,180
they must've gone through many challenges.

258
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,350
Yet they still can't be together. It's so pitiful.

259
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,350
Okay.

260
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,520
Don't cry anymore, I'll gift you something.

261
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,200
What?

262
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,020
Here.

263
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,960
Where did you get this from?

264
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,710
Do you like it?

265
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,070
I like it.

266
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,590
I picked it up from the seat next to me.

267
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,310
This is my first time receiving roses.

268
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,990
You can't say you prepared this for me?

269
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,550
Come here.

270
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,390
I don't believe that someone would throw away a rose.

271
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,950
But, I am willing to believe

272
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,220
that this rose prepared for you by God.

273
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,790
You aren't usually romantic,

274
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,160
but when you are...

275
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:47,320
♫  Falling until the end ♫

276
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:54,660
♫ How can I escape it ♫

277
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:01,960
♫ You said don't be afraid ♫

278
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,290
Did the sun rise?

279
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,130
Yes, it's rising!

280
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,150
It's so beautiful.

281
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,360
I want to see it with you too.

282
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,120
It's actually not that pretty.

283
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,690
The vegetable garden and ocean we went to together

284
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,180
is prettier than this.

285
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,420
Just remember those.

286
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,820
I still remember right now.

287
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,000
But I will forget them one day. I will forget that on Earth there is light,

288
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,450
day and night,

289
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,180
and even the things I want to deeply engrain in my mind,

290
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,570
will be forgotten one by one.

291
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,860
Including what you look like.

292
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,460
If you forget what I look like,

293
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,570
I'll just help you remember.

294
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,910
I'll definitely see you with my own eyes again.

295
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,770
I promise you.

296
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,600
Victor, how are the preparations going?

297
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000
It's almost ready, mom.

298
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,930
Wait!

299
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,270
You're going to leave?

300
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,390
Yes, what else would it be?

301
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:38,290
You are right, what else would it be?

302
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,810
This.

303
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,370
What is this?

304
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,590
Endless Knot.

305
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,440
This knot has no start or end.

306
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,080
It represents endlessness.

307
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,120
If you have a chance to wear Qipao in England, don't forget

308
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,490
to wear it on your neck.

309
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,190
It's pretty.

310
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:03,150
What kind of endlessness does it represent?

311
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:08,070
Friendship. Don't forget that your friends are still here.

312
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,520
If you have time, come back and visit.

313
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,930
Okay, thank you, my old friend.

314
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,880
I wish you a smooth...

315
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,370
a safe journey.

316
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,170
A safe journey.

317
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,970
♫ Someone steals your heart ♫

318
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,470
♫ The silence you can't find  ♫

319
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,320
♫ Look into your eyes ♫

320
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,600
Pick me up next Tuesday.

321
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,990
What? Where should I pick you up?

322
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,480
Of course, it's the airport. Elise is busy, so she can't pick me up.

323
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,030
You're still coming back?

324
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,660
Of course, I'm coming back. Elise and Victor are both in China.

325
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,300
I will come back often.

326
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,490
I thought... see what this has turned into.

327
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,080
Then I won't return this to you.

328
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,000
Look at what you're saying. You look pretty when you wear it.

329
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,460
What time should I pick you up on Tuesday?

330
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:13,270
First think about what this represents. I think friendship is not correct.

331
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,580
♫ You're the special one ♫

332
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,710
Bye-bye.

333
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,400
Bye-bye.

334
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,500
♫ You're the special one for me ♫

335
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,340
If I leave, are you okay on your own?

336
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,780
I'm going to bring gifts back for you.

337
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,590
Don't worry, I'll be here for you to come back.

338
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,330
I'm just going to apply for a visa. I'll be back soon.

339
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,900
I'm leaving.

340
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,220
Little Bun, Mr. Jiang asked me to prepare this for you.

341
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,330
There is hot soy milk and juice. Drink it on your way.

342
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,230
Okay.

343
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,170
Mr. Jiang, I'll send her off.

344
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,700
Sister Nina, take good care of him.

345
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,670
Don't worry. Stay safe on your way.

346
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,610
There's already so much! I can't take more.

347
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,460
- T-T-This... Don't let them bring more.
- Uncle, there's still more in the back.

348
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,360
Yes, yes, don't bring anymore. Oh my gosh, this is too much!

349
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,040
We're going to have to eat it until Chinese New Year.

350
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,810
I don't care when you'll finish them. Just eat, and that's it.

351
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,480
I'm telling you, some things were made by ourselves.

352
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,700
Some are the local special products. You can't miss any of them.

353
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,980
Then won't I eat until I become fat?

354
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,310
That's a blessing!

355
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,390
Even this you're so particular, it's a blessing to be skinny when a person is old.

356
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:12,580
Sister, when you're in France, don't bring me any

357
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,920
make-up, clothes, or bags. You must not bring me back any.

358
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,670
Okay, just tell me what you want, and I'll bring it back for you.

359
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,260
Actually, I'm worried the most about you. Everything else is not important.

360
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:28,180
When you're there, you have to attend classes and take care of Mr. Jiang.

361
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,190
Can you do it? If you can't, call me and I'll help you.

362
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,220
You're underestimating your sister.

363
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,920
Right now, it is passed the hardest times. That time, I had to prepare for the final round

364
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,620
and take care of him. Also, he wasn't in a good mood at that time,

365
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,350
and coincidentally, it was that time of the month when my mood wasn't good either.

366
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,790
Then can you handle it?

367
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,420
I can't, but I still have to hold on.

368
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,750
I'm bringing all of them.

369
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,160
Give them to me.

370
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,010
Here, here. I'll leave them all for you.

371
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,470
- All for you.
- Slow down.

372
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,900
You're fighting even for this thing?

373
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
You're giving them to me?

374
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,910
Learn cooking well. Once I come back,

375
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,870
I'm going to open up a restaurant right across from yours and steal all your business.

376
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,090
You're not scared that I'll beat you? I'll buy your restaurant

377
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,660
and then hire you to be the front desk manager.

378
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,280
I'll never let you enter the kitchen.

379
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,180
- I'll see how you can be arrogant.
- Right?

380
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,890
Hurry up and go wash your hair. Bye!

381
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,020
I can't take it.

382
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,150
- I'm leaving.
- Bye!

383
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,530
Be obedient, okay?

384
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,450
Mr Jiang. The peppermint water is ready.

385
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,710
What would you like for dinner?

386
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,950
Mr Jiang. Are you in there?

387
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,960
I'm coming in.

388
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,990
Mr. Jiang.

389
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,360
Dongpo Pork is here!

390
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,420
Okay!

391
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,050
Here. Put it here.

392
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,890
Why aren't uncle and auntie here yet?

393
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,560
Who knows? Give them a call now.

394
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,990
- I'll make the soup then. - Okay.

395
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,110
They said they would be here soon.

396
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,210
Give them a call now!

397
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,660
Kesong, someone is calling you!

398
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,770
Coming in a second!

399
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,380
Who is it?

400
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,770
Hello Sister Nina, what is it?

401
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:02,930
Little Bun. I have searched everywhere. I didn't see Oliver.

402
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,720
What do you mean?

403
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,910
Oliver is gone!

404
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,790
Sister Nina, don't worry.

405
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,990
Go check the security camera footage.

406
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,320
See when he left.

407
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,400
Check if he got in any car. Then give me a call back.

408
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,380
Okay.

409
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,470
What happened? Xiao Jiang disappeared?

410
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:30,490
Sister Nina said Mr Jiang disappeared. He's not answering his phone either.

411
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,050
Sorry, the user you're calling is not available right now.

412
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,570
He's really not reachable.

413
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,010
Sister Nina.

414
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,230
I checked the security camera footage. He left on his own.

415
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,420
He got into a taxi. But I looked at the time.

416
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,020
It's been three hours already.

417
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,210
Sister Nina. It's fine. Three hours is not that long.

418
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,170
He went out on his own last night too.

419
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,160
You wait for him at home. I'll go look for him. Okay?

420
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,140
Don't worry. I'll hang up now.

421
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,860
He is blind. He's been gone for three hours. That's not urgent to you?

422
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,990
I was just comforting her. I'll take off now.

423
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,100
Eat something before you go!

424
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:09,640
You are not familiar with this car. How about I come with you?

425
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,980
Kesong. Here are some snacks for the road.

426
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,580
Got it!

427
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,150
Slow down.

428
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,440
I'm going.

429
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,280
The hand brake!

430
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,410
My daughter. Will you be okay?

431
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,130
Hello, Little Bun.

432
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,170
Sorry. Is Mr. Jiang with you?

433
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:50,290
He asked me not to tell you, but he stood me up.

434
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,820
We were supposed to go out to the sea together today.

435
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,470
He called me last night saying he was not going.

436
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,130
So, he's prepared to leave.

437
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,530
He is not reachable by phone. That means he wants to avoid everyone.

438
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,900
He must have gone to an isolated place.

439
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,950
It must be a place he's familiar with. Even if he can't see, he could find it.

440
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,790
There is only one place.

441
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,710
I just want to find a place with water.

442
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:17,280
Plants are simple. They grow well as long as there's water.

443
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,710
There's water there.

444
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,700
The bitterness of Okinawa Spinach

445
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,720
cannot be compared with the bitterness of life.

446
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:29,090
I really like the valley where you took me to dig wild greens.

447
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,010
Freeze!

448
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,860
Police!

449
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,060
Don't move! What's your name?

450
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,600
Li Yan.

451
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,650
Come with us.

452
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,340
Hello? Detective Han.

453
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,800
You caught Li Yan?

454
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,970
That's great. Thank you for letting me know.

455
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,790
Okay.

456
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,350
Goodbye.
