00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,140
Hello, Police? I'm looking for Officer Han.

10
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,750
Yes, it's Officer Han who is in charge of the case on Li Yan.

11
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,900
Okay, I'll wait.

12
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,450
Hello, Office Han, I am Elise Quentin.

13
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,640
I want to...

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,920
You win.

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,990
Yes, I wanted to ask you about the latest progress. We are all very concerned.

16
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,910
Okay.

17
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,570
Thanks.

18
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,380
Take it then. It's in the nightstand's drawer to the left of my bed.

19
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,420
Thanks.

20
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,230
It's not a big problem. Just take the medicine regularly.

21
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,530
It's only been a few days out of contact, I didn't expect so many things would happen to you.

22
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,010
Isn't it the same with you? So many things happened between you and Chu Ting.

23
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,690
On the other hand, I really admire you.

24
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,490
You are willing to return to your original form. Very aggressive.

25
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,900
Isn't it because you are here, Idol?

26
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,750
It's not because of me.

27
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,960
I've been dragged along by Mr. Jiang this whole way.

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,630
Unlike you, you discovered your own issues and have the courage to correct them.

29
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,270
Okay, don't praise me anymore. You know I can't stand them.

30
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,190
I know.

31
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,150
Let's go.

32
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,590
Here. I won't walk you upstairs.

33
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,850
Once I've moved, you can come visit.

34
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,990
But this time, there won't be a house-warming party.

35
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,050
I put up a bed in Chu Ting's shop.

36
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,950
Also, I don't have the interested in playing with those stuff anymore.

37
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,610
You and Chu Ting circle around and have come back to be under the same roof.

38
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,300
It's fate. You should cherish it.

39
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,820
Okay.

40
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,530
I'm going up.

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,560
Same with you. Be well.

42
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,600
What's going on with Xiaoyu?

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,240
Kesong, she is changing bandages now.

44
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,320
May I ask, who is the patient's family?

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,560
- I am.
- I am.

46
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,160
Okay, come in with me.

47
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,190
- Mom and Dad, why are you here?
- Quick, let me see you.

48
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,560
- It's serious. Does it hurt?
- Why didn't you tell me that you were coming?

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,430
I asked you if it's painful. Don't worry about that.

50
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm okay.

51
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,310
Xiaoyu's wound is a lot more serious than mine.

52
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,640
Who says it's not serious? Look at this. It will leave a scar.

53
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,610
Look at you, kid. Why did you have to be so brave?

54
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,980
It was fire. Why did you throw yourself upon the fire?

55
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,520
What if...

56
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,120
I still had to do something. Besides, she is my younger sister.

57
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,250
That's right. Even though she knows it's dangerous, she still had to rush toward it. It's a real bond.

58
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,740
How can you say that? Isn't she your own daughter?

59
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,440
It's because she is my own daughter, that's why I said that.

60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,480
Your heart doesn't ache, but mine does.

61
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,040
That's enough, Mom and Dad.

62
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,050
I make this soup for Xiaoyu. Please give it to her.

63
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,460
I won't go inside.

64
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,140
Okay. I'll give it to her for you.

65
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,550
If you go inside, it will actually irritate her. She can't participate in the competition anyway.

66
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,850
What are you saying?

67
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,610
Okay. I'll leave first.

68
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,530
- Be careful. Don't touch water.
- Be careful.

69
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,420
My heart really aches for her.

70
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,670
[Congratulations to that lady, for winning second place at Future Star.]

71
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,420
[Congratulations to you. I'll treat you a meal!]

72
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,700
[Your inspiration is about to be useful.]

73
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,860
[Reply to V: Won second place, don't come and see me!]

74
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,410
Boss, you've been staring at the phone with a silly smile for an hour.

75
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,720
I think I smell the sour stink of love.

76
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,760
Are you two trying to scare me to death?

77
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,370
Have you mopped the floor? Fixed the bikes?

78
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,380
Watered the waters at the door? Separated the trash?

79
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,060
Go away.

80
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,650
They say a woman in love changes.

81
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,350
I didn't know our boss would become a landlady.

82
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,360
I'm back!

83
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,320
What's the matter?

84
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,470
You don't have to get this angry just because you can't cook.

85
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,220
I can't see.

86
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,070
No. It must be like last time. You're just too tired.

87
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,260
It's different this time.

88
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,760
It's been a while already.

89
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,080
At least half an hour.

90
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,150
I won't recover this time.

91
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,020
That's impossible.

92
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,200
Why would this happen?

93
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,970
How would I know?

94
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,760
Elise, where are you going so late at night?

95
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,150
Oliver is blind.

96
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,410
Where is he?

97
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,380
The study.

98
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,870
I don't care who just came in.

99
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,140
Please leave.

100
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,060
I want to be quiet by myself.

101
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,560
Oliver, it's me and Junbin.

102
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,910
We are worried about you.

103
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,740
What is there to worry?

104
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,030
It can't be worse.

105
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,770
These are the transfer agreements you gave me.

106
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,880
Neither my mom nor I agree to sign it.

107
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,190
What is this?

108
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,870
Are you pitying me?

109
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,150
- No, I–
- Please leave.

110
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,790
Leave. I beg you.

111
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,870
You did well

112
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,000
by burning that contract.

113
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,180
Thank you

114
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,980
for trusting me with something so humiliating.

115
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,420
I…

116
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,790
I didn't listen to my mom. She…

117
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,200
must be heartbroken.

118
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,590
I understand that she's doing all of this for me.

119
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,920
But none of that is any of my concern anymore.

120
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,770
I made a huge mistake.

121
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,920
I can't keep making these mistakes and leave him with nothing.

122
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,360
Yuxuan has to be Oliver's.

123
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,880
I won't let anyone that it away from him.

124
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,880
But Yuxuan is Qianfan's life.

125
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,570
He's even giving up on Yuxuan. What is it that he wants?

126
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,820
I don't know. Or what?

127
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,210
My conscience can't take this anymore.

128
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,660
I don't want to drag this out any longer.

129
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,810
Every second I drag this out

130
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,530
is another second of suffering for me.

131
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,150
I'm telling Oliver everything.

132
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,480
And then I'll disappear

133
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,590
so that no one can find me.

134
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,000
But I didn't expect for him to lose his sight so soon.

135
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,520
The only thing I can do for him now

136
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,370
is to manage Yuxuan well,

137
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,790
so that it can survive and live strongly.

138
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,820
To be honest, Elise,

139
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,500
I had wishful thinking at first too.

140
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,790
But I really didn't expect

141
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,730
for all of this to happen so quickly.

142
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,490
It's all so sudden.

143
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,900
Elise.

144
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:33,360
I know that you're in a really tough position right now, but trust me.

145
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,300
No matter what happens,

146
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,520
I'll always be by your side.

147
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,020
Thank you, Junbin.

148
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,460
It turns out that silence

149
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,290
is more terrifying than hysterical venting.

150
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,360
To let the pain crush your heart bit by bit.

151
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,860
He lost his sight after he lost his taste.

152
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,000
What could be more despairing than that?

153
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,800
Perhaps this is what hell on earth is like.

154
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,920
It pains me so much

155
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,600
to see him suffer like this.

156
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,860
I really want to burst out crying, but I can't.

157
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,660
I told myself that I need to be strong

158
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,910
because he needs me.

159
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,460
Alright.

160
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,800
Drink some water.

161
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,560
Don't I look ridiculous like this?

162
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,860
Don't say that about yourself.

163
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,240
If you want to see me miserable,

164
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,040
take a good look.

165
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,200
Leave after you're done.

166
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,990
I won't blame you.

167
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,650
Stop talking nonsense.

168
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,090
I'm just being honest.

169
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,420
But don't worry.

170
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,240
No matter what,

171
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,840
I'll be with you until you're done with the competition.

172
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,040
I won't get you disqualified.

173
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,770
That's the only thing I'm worried about.

174
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:52,190
I thought I was the only thing you'd be worried about.

175
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,290
You have family,

176
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,720
a bright future ahead of you, and…

177
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,460
And Song Yiran.

178
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,930
You'll keep growing from here.

179
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,470
How can I grow without you?

180
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,980
Stop talking about it.

181
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,250
We should both get back to our lives

182
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,260
after the competition.

183
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,710
So what you mean is…

184
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,920
You don't need me

185
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,320
in your life. Right?

186
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,680
But I can't live without you.

187
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,330
I've finally come to understand

188
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,850
that I don't just like you.

189
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,850
I've fallen in love with you.

190
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,810
I stuck by your side when you lost your sense of taste.

191
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,120
And I'll still stay by your side when you can't see me.

192
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,180
Whether you like it or not,

193
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,860
I'll always be by your side and protecting you.

194
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,490
I really appreciate your kindness to me.

195
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,220
But I can take care of myself.

196
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,720
And you deserve someone much better.

197
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,010
Most importantly,

198
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,340
I really don't have any feelings for—

199
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,070
♫ I tell myself there is nothing bad ♫

200
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,840
♫ Falling until the end ♫

201
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:03,320
♫ Seeing something happen ♫

202
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,300
You're trying to tell me you don't have feelings for me, right?

203
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,760
I don't believe you.

204
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,260
You can't break the rules you've set.

205
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,200
It's time. I'm going to make breakfast.

206
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,660
Give me a moment.

207
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,390
Have a seat here.

208
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:36,760
♫ Seeing something happen ♫

209
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:45,320
♫ How can I escape? ♫

210
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:53,800
♫ You said "Don't be afraid" ♫

211
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:18,300
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

212
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,230
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

213
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,300
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

214
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,910
♫  Only for you ♫

215
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:34,520
♫  Love is the food for the living heart  ♫

216
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,600
♫  It makes me glow  ♫

217
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,810
♫  I will do silly things for you  ♫

218
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,830
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

219
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,130
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

220
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:57,020
♫  Don't hide your feelings for love  ♫

221
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,300
♫  Like a lonely star  ♫

222
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,240
♫  We play the notes of love  ♫

223
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,510
♫  Like a work of art  ♫

224
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,550
♫  We sing the songs of love  ♫

225
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,090
♫  Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫

226
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,310
Boiled pork liver congee. Good for the eyes. Open your mouth.

227
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,050
I'm not eating.

228
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,230
Do you think I want you to eat for your sake?

229
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,440
It's for my own sake.

230
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,590
You are going to the competition with me.

231
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,120
If your body collapses, what will I do?

232
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,220
I'm not eating. I...

233
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,230
Does it taste good?

234
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,550
Have another spoonful.

235
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,410
Don't move. Sit down. Sit down.

236
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,010
Don't get scalded.

237
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,560
I'm going to wipe it.

238
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,910
I made a whole pot of it anyway.

239
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,470
If you spill it, I'll refill it.

240
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,740
If it's gone, I'll make more.

241
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,730
Let's see who will win.

242
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,160
- Winter Melon...
- I'll take a look.
- Chives,

243
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,760
King oyster mushrooms, fresh ginger...

244
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,310
- You've got everything?
- Yes. Peppercorn and star anise are all here.

245
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,490
- Yes, yes.
- Now we just need two racks of meat.

246
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,980
Why buy two racks of meat?

247
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,630
I think two racks aren't enough.

248
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,940
Don't you and Xiaoyu love eating my Red Braised Ribs?

249
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,520
Yes, we do.

250
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,170
When I put it in Xiao Feng's restaurant,

251
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,280
it will all be gone.

252
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,250
When you cook your spare ribs, you put so much scallions, ginger, and garlic.

253
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,210
It's fine in the north, and also fine at our home.

254
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,600
But if you put your spare ribs in Xiaoyu's Private Kitchen, it won't do.

255
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,560
No one will eat it.

256
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,260
When something is good, it doesn't matter the region. If you don't believe it, let's have a bet.

257
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,150
Sure. Let's bet!

258
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,160
Nothing will be left. If there is anything left, I'll eat it. I'll even eat the bones.

259
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,030
You're really bragging.

260
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,790
Oh yes, Xiaoyu needs to be supplemented too. Let's get another rack.

261
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,530
You... Give you an inch, you take a mile. Your stomach's going to burst open.

262
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,380
Come. Wash it.

263
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,710
Come, give us a hand.

264
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,670
Coming.

265
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,990
There's more here.

266
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,540
Xiaoyu needs blood?

267
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,830
I can't find it in such a short time.

268
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,120
Then, let's try to buy it.

269
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,060
Did you hear that just now?

270
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,760
Xiao Feng said blood.

271
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
- Who?
- Xiaoyu needs blood.

272
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,890
- That's right.
- I am type O. Take mine.

273
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,760
- I am also type O.
- No, no. Uncle and Aunt.

274
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,640
How can they draw your blood? I'm young and strong, draw mine.

275
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,570
Xiao Yu has type B. I am also type B. It can be used right away.

276
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,180
Uncle, let's go now.

277
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,090
You two step aside. Draw mine.

278
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,890
My arm is four times bigger than yours. Draw mine.

279
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,830
It's up to the doctor to decide whose blood to draw.

280
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,200
Let's do this. Let's all go to the hospital for a check-up.

281
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,630
- Go. Go.
- Wait! Wait!

282
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,810
Where are you going?

283
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,610
To give blood.

284
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,020
Xiaoyu wants to eat blood.

285
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,080
Duck blood. The kind that is stir-fried with chili peppers.

286
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,980
You were talking while breathing heavily. Were you trying to scare us to death?

287
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,180
You're really good. I could die from anger.

288
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,340
This, this, you all...

289
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,190
With you around, I'm not afraid.

290
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,510
Boss, you are too formal.

291
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,790
That's right, Uncle. We are one family.

292
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,510
- That's right.
- How can we ignore our own family?

293
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,910
Boss, new employee Xiao Song reports to duty.

294
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:01,090
You're late the first day of work. Pretty daring.

295
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:05,540
You didn't tell me when to come to work and when to leave. I didn't know.

296
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,470
If I didn't say it, couldn't you ask?

297
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,110
Besides, you are in a trial period.

298
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,960
Don't make me regret that I hired you.

299
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,040
Follow me.

300
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,270
You can sleep in the fitting room at night.

301
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,690
The folding bed is in the warehouse. After the store is closed, remember to shut the doors and the windows.

302
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,580
Remember to turn on the infrared security system. I'll show you how to use it.

303
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,630
You don't need to teach me. I can figure it out right away.

304
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,220
Is that right? If you don't do it right, and the alarm keeps blaring, you are the one who can't stand it.

305
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,430
Also, remember to turn off all the lights and the A/C in the store.

306
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,600
Check the water and electricity every day. Do not waste energy.

307
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,470
Put away your bedding every morning before 9 am.

308
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,170
Open the door half an hour before opening to vent. The floor must be mopped spotless.

309
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,570
There cannot be any trace of your living here in the store.

310
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,240
I have to mop the floor myself?

311
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,810
I've never mopped the floor. Can we hire a cleaning lady or an hourly gig worker?

312
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,400
Sure. The fee will be deducted from your wages.

313
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,680
I think it's better to mop it myself.

314
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,640
What I've said above, if you can't accomplish even one of them,

315
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,610
I'll deduct 20% of your wages for the month.

316
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:13,470
So I can only make five mistakes in a month. Isn't it too harsh?

317
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,650
Let's deduct 25% then.

318
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,670
It's a deal, Boss.

319
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,020
But, why didn't you tell me about this before?

That's not all. Mr. Jiang lost his taste too.

I'm not sure about anything else.

Isn't our restaurant hopeless after he's down?

00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:12,530
This is how I liked to eat it when I was young. I also drank wine with it.

434
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:16,070
Sometimes I'd get drunk after a few drinks.

435
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:20,820
Wine is cold, but your heart warms when you drink it.

00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,440
It gives you the power to deal with all your troubles.

I don't want to keep anything from you all.

442
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,730
Because of the news that Mr. Jiang lost his taste,

443
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:51,740
our customer attendance rate and reservation rate have decreased by 10% to 15% respectively compared to our normal numbers.

00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:56,260
And it'll keep decreasing now that Mr. Jiang can't come in at all.

445
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,880
For a restaurant to suddenly lose their executive chef, the blow will definitely be fatal.

446
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,920
It can be said that Yuxuan is now in extreme danger.

447
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:11,900
The problem Yuxuan faces now is no longer whether or not we can obtain three Michelin stars,

448
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,330
but the question of survival.

449
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,940
Will we survive or fall to ruins?

450
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,220
I hope that everyone here can stand in solidarity with Mr. Jiang and I

451
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,510
to overcome our difficulties and keep Yuxuan running

452
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:31,000
while we wait for Mr. Jiang's prompt return to the kitchen.

453
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,210
Is there any news from the hospital? How's Mr. Jiang recovering?

454
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:39,520
I'm not sure. It might be a while.

455
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,800
It'll also be very hard for us, so I already discussed this with Mr. Jiang.

456
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,890
We'll be very grateful if you're all willing to stay,

457
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,640
but you're also free to go if you don't have confidence in Yuxuan.

458
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,420
Yuxuan won't force anyone to stay.

459
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,410
I wish everyone the best.

460
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,940
That's all from me. I'll be waiting for your decisions.

461
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,870
Thank you.

Especially your red braised spareribs, Uncle. They specifically asked for more for dinner.

Do you hear that?

472

I told her to get two of them, and she said it was too much.

00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,950
Come.

477
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,890
Come.

478
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,790
It's a video of Sister Yu eating.

479
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,440
Xiaoyu is recovering well!

480
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,770
She looks great! She's even smiling.

481
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,980
Has Blu been there the entire time?

482
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,220
Of course. He doesn't let her out of his sight.

483
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,830
Let's have a welcome home dinner.

484
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:12,430
Sure. But what isn't she allowed to eat with those injuries?

485
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,490
She can eat what's delicious and not eat what's not.

486
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,420
She's a foodie.

487
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,810
We're now broadcasting news we just received.

488
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,140
Yuxuan just announced

489
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,830
that executive chef, Jiang Qianfan suddenly went blind and has completely lost his eyesight.

490
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:34,990
Jiang Qianfan holds the position as Lin Kesong's mentor in the Mueller's Future Star Culinary Competition.

491
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:41,090
During the semi-finals, Lin Xiaoyu failed to complete her dishes due to an unexpected accident. Lin Kesong advances to the finals.

492
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:45,360
What will happen now that her mentor suddenly loses his sight before the finals?

493
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,350
The news station will continue to follow up.

494
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,610
Yuxuan's official website published an announcement.

495
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:53,850
What's going on?

496
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:58,230
He lost his sense of taste and now he can't see.

497
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,720
What's going on here?

498
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,320
- Kesong didn't tell you?
- No.

499
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,050
Sister Kesong must be feeling terrible right now.

500
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,890
It's still nothing compared to how Xiao Jiang is feeling.

501
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,710
This won't do. I have to call her.

502
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,380
Don't you think it's inappropriate to call now?

503
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:20,740
- Why?
- Kesong must be with Xiao Jiang right now. He'll read too much into it if you call her now.

504
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,300
Send her a message and tell her to come here immediately.

505
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,170
Alright.

506
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:07,810
I'm putting the water on the bedside table for you. It's easily reachable.

507
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,910
I set your phone to read aloud to you.

508
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,670
You can call me by holding this key.

509
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,440
I'm heading out for a bit. I'll be back soon.

510
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:55,540
♫ You are the stranger I want to know ♫

511
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,470
♫ Don't let me go ♫

512
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:02,750
♫ I will do little tricks for you ♫

513
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:09,010
♫ Don't bury your secret heart ♫

514
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,870
♫ Show them who you are ♫

515
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:17,170
♫ We sing a song for love ♫

516
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,070
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart ♫
