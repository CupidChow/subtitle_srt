00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,180
Ah!

168
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,110
Lin Kesong?

169
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,710
Lin Ke—

170
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,080
Are you okay?

171
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,730
What are you, a kitten or a puppy? Is it that scary?

172
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,450
There, there. Don't be afraid.

173
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,270
I'm right here.

174
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,210
I'm tall and I'm a baddie. The lightening will strike me first.

175
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,620
Nobody should get struck.

176
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,330
Fine, nobody gets struck. Don't worry.

177
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,410
I'll be here with you, okay?

178
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,760
It's alright.

179
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,230
Hey.

180
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,070
I say, are you comfortable sleeping here?

181
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,350
It's not and you said nothing?

182
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,750
What if you send me to another room?

183
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,830
Silly girl.

184
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:04,070
Can't I change the mattress without switching the room?

185
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,690
No more worries?

186
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,820
Let me ask you something.

187
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,000
I meant to ask you just now.

188
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,070
The two guys in your uncle's kitchen are quite nice.

189
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,810
But there's huge room for their improvement.

190
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:35,530
I thought their methods were wrong. After spending a day with them, now I know it's a matter of competence.

191
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,980
If your uncle gets better chefs instead, the business might do better.

192
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,600
They've been with him for more than a decade.

193
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,950
Probably since I was ten.

194
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,860
My aunt ran away with someone else.

195
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,660
My uncle didn't want to stay in Wuzhen, so he brought Xiaoyu to Shanghai.

196
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,090
And those chefs have been with him since then.

197
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:05,460
They are like family now, after so many years.

198
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,290
For my uncle, bonding is more important than cooking.

199
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,450
Huh?

200
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,770
Besides, they are not that bad.

201
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,130
Compared to Yuxuan, there are still miles in between.

202
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,510
That's why it's Xiaoyu's Private Kitchen, not Yuxuan's.

203
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,270
Yuxuan wants delicacy.

204
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,430
And Xiaoyu's Private Kitchen is where you feel like home.

205
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:38,420
In all seriousness, not everyone's dinner table is as fine as Yuxuan's.

206
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,770
Why do people enjoy eating at home?

207
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,610
Because it's relaxing and cosy.

208
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,480
If my uncle treats those chefs badly,

209
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,510
how will their dishes taste like home?

210
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,720
As for Xiaoyu...

211
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,650
She cooks well, so she could be the head chef.

212
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,750
She earns it.

213
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,650
But if they fire those two...

214
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,800
As far as I could remember,

215
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,580
whoever goes in that kitchen will always stay.

216
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,920
That explains it...

217
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,050
No wonder when I was helping out there,

218
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,150
everyone looked so motivated.

219
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,960
And when they cooked,

220
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,500
they all had a smile on their face.

221
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,880
I feel so stupid now, talking about management and whatever.

222
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,330
From now on, I will try to be like your uncle.

223
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,470
Who could it be?

224
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,900
It's late at night, and it's raining.

225
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,960
My phone is in my room. And I really don't want to move.

226
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,910
You stay here, I'll go and take a look.

227
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,800
It's okay. It's not that scary.

228
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,160
I'm coming with you.

229
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,400
How dangerous could it be?

230
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,940
I'm worried about you.

231
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,110
Fine. You'll back me up.

232
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,040
Let's go.

233
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,530
Wait... let me put my shoes on.

234
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,480
So much fuss... Here.

235
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,500
Here we go.

236
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,460
Let's go.

237
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,580
Who is it?

238
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,230
Open up.

239
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,720
Boris.

240
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,680
Good evening.

241
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,000
Surprised?

242
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,520
This is unexpected, isn't it?

243
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,210
What thunder struck you here?

244
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,990
Kitchen high up there.

245
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,270
Very you, indeed.

246
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,180
What do you want to drink?

247
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,530
You know I only drink alcohol.

248
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,270
Exactly, what kind?

249
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,810
No thanks, not today. I need a clear head.

250
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,010
Let me treat you to a movie.

251
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,340
What is this? A horror movie?

252
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,280
For you...

253
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,200
It is.

254
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,160
Usually this amount of alkali when eaten,

255
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,280
will be very bitter for people.

256
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,830
This is for Jiang Qianfan.

257
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,620
Let's see how he reacts.

258
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,880
Xiaoyu's fried rice is nicely done.

259
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,990
Every granule of the rice is well simmered with the XO sauce.

260
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,590
You even added pine nuts to increase the taste. It's really delicious.

261
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,850
Boris, what have you been poisoning her mind with?

262
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,920
You go back in first.

263
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,720
Go.

264
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,420
Any thoughts?

265
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,120
This is it?

266
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,940
Unexpected, though understandable.

267
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,200
Yet no horror at all.

268
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,240
What a shame.

269
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,460
What you don't see

270
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,400
is the best part?

271
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,020
Your facial expression,

272
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:24,000
how desperately you tried to hide it.

273
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,750
This is why I am here.

274
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:34,020
Jiang, I want to watch you break down.

275
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:42,950
Jiang, the more you struggle, the more charming you look.

276
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,590
If I were a girl, I would have fallen for you.

277
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,860
I suppose now you are obsessed with me to the brink of madness.

278
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,950
If you have to put it like that, I won't object.

279
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,960
Next, you will see

280
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,380
how I ruin the thing

281
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,010
I'm obsessed with.

282
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,760
I will put this video online.

283
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,170
What description do you think should I add

284
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,530
so you will suffer to death?

285
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,840
I thought a lot.

286
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,560
Nothing inspiring comes up. Throw me an idea.

287
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,110
My suggestion?

288
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,760
I've been competing with him for 10 years.

289
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,540
Finally, I manage one victory with tricks.

290
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,470
Or, better still, a victory outside the game.

291
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,930
It will do. I'm fine with that.

292
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,570
Jiang Qianfan,

293
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,460
tough as always.

294
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,110
Why don't you negotiate?

295
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,330
Admit your defeat.

296
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,280
This video

297
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,800
I might withhold it.

298
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,730
For example, if you bow to me...

299
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,420
and say, "forgive me, Boris,"

300
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,590
"for sending you that box years ago."

301
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,320
"I knew what it meant to you."

302
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,120
"Yet I sent it nonetheless."

303
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,290
"I'm a serpent."

304
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:36,310
"Please don't bring yourself down to my level."

305
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:40,200
And then, I will

306
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,390
delete this video right in front of you. How's that?

307
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,670
Your senior has been kind to you, hasn't he?

308
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,550
Indeed, very kind.

309
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,560
So?

310
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,360
So, of course, it will never happen.

311
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,320
I, too, will never forgive you

312
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,390
for the things you've done to me over the past 10 years.

313
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,660
You are still the Jiang Qianfan I know.

314
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,790
Of course, I am still that Boris.

315
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,490
Even if you do apologize,

316
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,010
I won't delete the video.

317
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,660
Goodbye.

318
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,160
See yourself out.

319
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,530
And one more thing.

320
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,710
I feel sorry for you.

321
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,470
What he fears the most is for others to feel sorry for him,

322
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,000
let alone his own rival.

323
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,320
It hurts more than a punch in the face.

324
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,330
If only I could give him my sense of taste.

325
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,120
I want to protect him, yet I can do nothing.

326
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,410
Hey.

327
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,810
It's okay.

328
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,030
I've been waiting for this to happen.

329
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,990
And now I'm finally relieved.

330
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,420
Hey.

331
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,520
How did it go? Did he bow down?

332
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,820
I don't want him to bow down.

333
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,330
I want to watch him break down.

334
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,550
It's 2 am. Nobody watches live-streaming at this time.

335
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,330
I can't wait anymore.

336
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,190
If you release the video,

337
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,420
does that mean Jiang Qianfan won't be able to compete?

338
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,490
Otherwise, why would I release the video?

339
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,330
What about Lin Kesong? Can she still compete?

340
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:11,050
Not likely. She will probably quit just to support Jiang.

341
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:15,390
So, that means, I can't compete against her anymore?

342
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,310
And you are sorry for that?

343
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:22,200
Yes. In fact, I really want to crush her in the competition.

344
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,490
Do you really think you can win?

345
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,060
She beat four people to come this far.

346
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,280
- So what?
- You simple thing.

347
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,390
You know, fate is blind.

348
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,260
It always blesses those posers.

349
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,390
Give them chances, give them luck.

350
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,950
Let them profit by other's toil.

351
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,820
And all you can do is watch.

352
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,900
I can't let this happen again. I must do something.

353
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,390
I will eliminate all their hope to win.

354
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,360
Greetings, night owls!

355
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,990
It is 2:30 am.

356
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,390
And I am here to give you a treat.

357
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,160
I vouch for the video you just saw.

358
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,330
I took the video myself. And there has been no editing.

359
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,410
How about that, Jiang Qianfan?

360
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:26,530
Where is that integrity of yours? During the press conference at Cloud Crown Manor

361
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,680
you said you were all good.

362
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,460
How is it related to integrity?

363
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,710
It might if he says so.

364
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,400
What do we do now?

365
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,040
We admit it. What else?

366
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,650
Don't worry. Go back to sleep.

367
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,890
I'm fine. Don't worry.

368
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,170
Go to sleep.

369
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,960
[Elise]

370
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,540
Elise, it's me.

371
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:30,650
Oliver, what happened?

372
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,810
Boris released some evidence of my taste loss.

373
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,490
It's okay. Nothing to worry about. But I need a favor.

374
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,650
Please release the statement.

375
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,190
Thanks.

376
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,530
Jiang, I know you are watching.

377
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:02,000
Have you figured out how to cover your lie?

378
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,880
Elise!

379
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,390
Elise, are you okay?

380
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,980
What happened? Elise.

381
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,350
Help her back into the room.

382
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,810
Okay. Here, Elise.

383
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,710
Victor, could you give me that freeze spray?

384
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,110
Okay.

385
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,440
Were you going to see Jiang Qianfan?

386
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,500
Yes. You saw that.

387
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,490
Yes.

388
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,570
Saw what?

389
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,130
The spray.

390
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,400
You go on back. I want to talk to her about something.

391
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,920
Okay, then.

392
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,790
He's got to be in despair right now. I want to be with him.

393
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,860
He won't be in worse despair than he was when he first lost his sense of taste.

394
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,670
Elise, the most urgent matter for you currently isn't going to comfort Jiang Qianfan.

395
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:22,950
Instead, it's thinking up some way to remove the unfavorable effect this could have on Yuxuan.

396
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,940
True. You're right.

397
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,780
I'm sure that you have a backup plan.

398
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,130
I do.

399
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,890
Then, just carry it out.

400
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,060
Actually, I originally also thought that

401
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,900
it was Boris who should participate in the competition.

402
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,260
He was with Montgomery a year before I was.

403
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,530
He did better than me. He should be considered as my senior brother.

404
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,530
Most importantly, he was 28 years old that year.

405
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,530
He was at the upper limit of the age requirements for participating in future major competitions.

406
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,880
That was his last opportunity.

407
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,590
But Monty believed that cooking skills should be the first consideration.

408
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:34,250
When faced with an opportunity, everyone is equal.

409
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,220
So he insisted that both of us participate in the selection.

410
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,460
Then looking at the results of the selection before deciding who should participate in the competition.

411
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,960
What's most amusing is that sometimes fate plays tricks on people.

412
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,560
I placed ahead of him in the selection.

413
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,600
Because of this, Boris had a big fight with Monty when he went back.

414
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,170
He said he wanted to compete with me.

415
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,360
Then, Monty agreed to that.

416
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,580
On the day of the competition,

417
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,740
Boris used an excuse that he hadn't brought salt.

418
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,110
He came to me to borrow a saltshaker.

419
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,970
In the saltshaker he brought back to me,

420
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,420
he'd added some lemon powder.

421
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,720
That's an acid.

422
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,220
How could he be so careless?

423
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,820
Of course, he was careful. I also took precautions.

424
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,430
But he's very clever. He added a layer of salt

425
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,780
on top of the lemon powder.

426
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,890
As soon as he brought the saltshaker back, I used the tip of my finger to moisten it a little. I didn't see any problem.

427
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,770
On the day of the competition,

428
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,930
I scooped out some salt. It was all infected.

429
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:37,490
While I was figuring this out, my dish had already lost its shape.

430
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:41,660
Even though I tried out some remedies, it was still flawed.

431
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,630
But the way I see it, what was fortunate is that

432
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,860
when Monty watched the broadcast later, he felt something was odd.

433
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,020
So he went and asked Boris about it. He realized that he was the one who was behind it.

434
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,840
In the end, I was the one sent to participate in the competition.

435
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,780
So, your break with him was because of that?

436
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,540
After participating in the competition, I easily won the championship.

437
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,930
And the conflict with Boris gradually got worse.

438
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:11,370
After I won the championship, I became ambitious and arrogant.

439
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,650
I wanted to give Boris a piece of my mind.

440
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,730
So I gave the empty box from the championship trophy to him.

441
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:22,720
I even wrote a card and put it inside. I wished him a lifetime without winning a trophy.

442
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,950
I don't want to say this. But it is really sarcastic.

443
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,860
So, in a fit of anger, Boris started a big fight with me.

444
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,830
It was an intense fight and turned everything upside down in Monty's back kitchen and rooftop.

445
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,820
Of course when Monty found out, he was furious and lectured the two of us.

446
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,040
But Boris's was still furious.

447
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,790
That day, he gathered his things and left.

448
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:47,610
Okay. No problem. Then have fun abroad. Thank you. Goodbye.

449
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,960
Hello, Mr. Zhao. Good morning. This is Elise from Yuxuan.

450
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,170
Did you see? That's right.

451
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,450
This afternoon at 3 pm. I've arranged for a press conference at Yuxuan.

452
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:05,030
I hope you can come. Good. No problem. Okay. Thank you so much.

453
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,120
[Not available]

454
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,520
Hello, Mr. Liu. This is Elise from Yuxuan.

455
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,360
This afternoon at 3 pm I've arranged for a press conference at Yuxuan. I hope that you can come.

456
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,080
Over the following years, there was no news about him.

457
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,810
Monty once tried to find him, but he never found him.

458
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,970
Afterwards, I found out that he wasn't a chef at any restaurant.

459
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,600
Instead, he was wandering around the world.

460
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,160
North America, Europe, China.

461
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,800
In each place, he was teaching class at cooking schools.

462
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,590
But he didn't stay anywhere very long. In the end,

463
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,910
he was placed on the anti-list of the gourmet world.

464
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:44,700
He got on what they call a blacklist, so that now no one wants him.

465
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,170
How could he let this happen?

466
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,830
Actually, when I think about it now,

467
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,690
back then, I hurt him very deeply. Later, there were many times

468
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:59,670
that I wanted to apologize to him. But he wouldn't accept it.

469
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,120
I think... Boris was my destiny.

470
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,910
I can't hide from it.

471
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,450
Then, what's the worst thing that could happen now?

472
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,130
Not being able to compete.

473
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,500
The restaurant goes bankrupt.

474
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,820
I'm a person who provokes a hue and cry from the people.

475
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,660
What's that? Don't you still have me?

476
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,810
I have something to give you.

477
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,300
Take it.

478
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,690
This is a recommendation letter to Headmaster Ruan of the Cordon Bleu cooking school in France.

479
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,530
I taught there for several years; you could say we're friends.

480
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,570
The point is that this is the finest cooking school in the world.

481
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,420
If you go there for advanced studies, once you graduate,

482
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,200
every restaurant in the world will be recruiting you.

483
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,840
What?

484
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,050
You suspect I'm too stupid, so you don't want to teach me anymore.

485
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,610
Lin Kesong. I don't like the look of yours.

486
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,860
Actually, I think that in all these circumstances,

487
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,620
you're being lied to, was the cruelest. Even though so much has happened,

488
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,110
and you chose to stay beside me,

489
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,800
I'm already very grateful.

490
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,260
But I truly, truly hope

491
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,690
that you can realize your dream; become an even better chef.

492
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:32,960
♫  I will keep you warm and fine  ♫

493
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,450
About my becoming a good chef...

494
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:43,860
Don't worry. I won't find someone else to mentor me.

495
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,820
Also, don't worry about this.

496
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,660
If you really want to do more advanced study.

497
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,520
You go yourself.

498
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,350
♫  You will find the treasure of your life  ♫

499
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:04,260
♫  You will find the treasure of your life  ♫

500
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,960
Mama, I should still say this.

501
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,830
I know that you're trying not to show how bad you feel.

502
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,860
Jiang Qianfan's loss of his sense of taste... did my sister do this?

503
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,290
Nonsense.

504
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,620
Mama, I'm not a kid anymore. I need to know exactly what's happened in this family.

505
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,130
Victor, you need to trust that your sister isn't a bad person.

506
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,000
Of course, I know that. I just can't tolerate Jiang Qianfan.

507
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
He's both short-tempered and conceited. I really can't see why my sister likes him.

508
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,690
My sister is so good to him. But him?

509
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:45,550
he keeps hurting my sister. What he's getting today... it's all well-deserved.

510
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:49,120
I have no idea what you're talking about. Just eat.

511
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:07,390
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

512
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,300
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

513
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,680
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

514
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:21,510
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

515
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,730
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

516
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:28,840
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

517
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:35,000
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
