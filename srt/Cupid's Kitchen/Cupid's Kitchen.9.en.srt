I believe Dr. Xie got you this gift.

This friend of yours sure is practical. Other people got you flowers and perfume,

but he got you several of this brand's air purifiers.

149
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,820
The kid is allergic to crab meat, so we must not let him find out that what he's eating is different than that of the adults.

All right. Don't worry about that. I can handle it.

00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,950
Little Bun. Where are you going?

160
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,590
Home. I don't want to learn from him anymore.

161
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,250
Little Bun.

162
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,900
Little Bun.

163
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,380
Just excuse Oliver's behavior for today's incident.

164
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,300
He can't stand others talking about his parents.

165
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,360
His parents have gone to heaven.

166
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,890
Oliver's parents passed away in a car accident before he even graduated middle school.

167
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,880
That's so sad.

168
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,570
Yes. It's not easy for Oliver.

169
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,730
His mentor isn't alive anymore

170
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,920
and his parents aren't alive anymore.

171
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,530
You're the closest person to him.

172
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,900
I've been with Oliver for years,

173
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,790
but we've never had many heart-to-heart conversations.

174
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,150
He keeps almost everything to himself. He's never willing to open himself up to others.

175
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:01,660
Little Bun, you haven't been here for long, but I feel that he's already on close terms with you.

176
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,890
He's a good person. Don't blame him.

177
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,820
But he's so erratic.

178
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,590
Whenever I start to put my trust in him, he does something to make me lose my trust in him again. Who can stand that?

179
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,620
Do you trust me?

180
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,460
Of course, I do.

181
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,790
Here's your phone, Little Bread. Call your family.

182
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,880
What if he finds out?

183
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,410
He won't. I'll be on the lookout for you. Here.

184
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,480
Nina.

185
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,540
I'm leaving.

186
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,020
Mr. Jiang.

187
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,390
I'll go freshen up first. I'll need to develop a new dish later.

188
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,530
Don't let anyone disturb me for half an hour.

189
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,680
Okay.

190
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,060
Little Bun, you heard what Mr. Jiang said.

191
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,660
You should call your family now.

192
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,910
I can't.

193
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,010
My parents know what my uncle's house looks like.

194
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,720
It's not the same here.

195
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,750
What do you mean?

196
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:09,080
In fact, my uncle and I haven't told my parents that I'm learning to cook.

197
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,700
Why don't you say so? Wouldn't that be a good thing?

198
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,370
Maybe it's because the ordinary me

199
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,240
was chosen by the extraordinary him.

200
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,310
And to enter some kind of cooking competition.

201
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,420
Not to mention my parents,

202
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,550
it took me a long time to believe it myself.

203
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,730
What are you talking about? This is really happening to you.

204
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,010
If the same thing happened to my younger cousin,

205
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,500
they probably would believe it.

206
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,730
Besides, if they knew I was living in a man's house,

207
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,950
they would have to come over and break my legs.

208
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,490
How could they?

209
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,200
You can go to the terrace and call them.

210
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,460
Won't he find out?

211
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,430
No, I'll keep an eye on him for you.

212
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,170
Okay.

213
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,690
I'll do that.

214
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,600
Why isn't this kid answering her phone?

215
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,290
Don't pace, sit down.

216
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,830
She's calling!

217
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,660
Mom! Dad!

218
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,600
My dear, we've finally found you.

219
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,990
You can't turn off your phone like that. We need to be able to reach you at all times, okay?

220
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,180
I didn't mean to turn off my phone. My phone ran out of battery.

221
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,370
Where are you now?

222
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:47,420
I'm on a mountain. I'm lying on the grass. I'm helping my uncle stock up.

223
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,030
I'm at an old grandpa's house in the mountains.

224
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:54,430
This mountain is a bit far. You have to walk for three to four hours to get up here.

225
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,250
Mom, the signal seems to be weak here...

226
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,290
Hello? Mom?

227
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,730
The signal is really bad!

228
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,670
She froze.

229
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,910
- Kesong?
- It's disconnected.

230
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,350
I'm exhausted.

231
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,160
She's at an old grandpa's house.

232
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,210
My back.

233
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,730
Hey.

234
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,760
- Mom.
- Why was there a bit of a lag?

235
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,870
Didn't I tell you the signal was bad in the mountains?

236
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:34,370
You seem to have lost weight. Did you not eat properly?

237
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,700
Of course, I'm eating well.

238
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,090
How about you?

239
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:42,870
We're both fine. How come Xiaoyu didn't go with you?

240
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,500
She's busy with the cooking competition. She's training with her mentor.

241
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,560
Kesong, look how well Xiaoyu is doing.

242
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,260
You have to learn from her.

243
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,290
I also participated in the cooking competition, and I have a mentor.

244
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,600
Are you really in that competition?

245
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,640
What did your mentor see in you? Is he scamming you?

246
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,300
Why is it scamming when it comes to me?

247
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,590
Your mom and I know you too well.

248
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:16,080
Fine, I didn't participate. I was kidding.

249
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,000
Kesong.

250
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,300
You should hurry back after seeing around Shanghai.

251
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,070
Our neighbor arranged a blind date for you.

252
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:31,000
He works in the telecommunications bureau, very tall and handsome!

253
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,300
Okay, I can't hear you clearly.

254
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,350
I'll hang up now.

255
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,160
Take care of yourself!

256
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,780
She hung up again.

257
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,190
I shouldn't have called.

258
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,510
Where is Lin Kesong?

259
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,410
I'm here!

260
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,130
Sit down. Let's talk.

261
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,330
Come.

262
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,440
I have three demands that you have to agree to.

263
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,490
Or else?

264
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:49,500
Or I will flee to a place so far away that you will never find me again.

265
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,880
Do you think that's possible?

266
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,030
All right, tell me about it.

267
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,720
Firstly, you shouldn't lose your temper easily.

268
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,690
How do you define "easily"?

269
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,380
Just don't lose your temper at all.

270
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,350
No can do.

271
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:18,800
Fine. You could lose your temper when I made a mistake.

272
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,550
Like just now, I didn't know your parents were gone.

273
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,910
It's my fault that

274
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,470
I said those things.

275
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,980
But you're not allowed to lecture me if I didn't make a mistake.

276
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,030
So was that a mistake or not?

277
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,410
That would be considered saying the wrong thing.

278
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,120
You could have just told me. There's no need to break things.

279
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,180
What about the second thing?

280
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,890
Secondly...

281
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,970
I messed up the order.

282
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,480
Let me see.

283
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:10,460
Secondly, don't...

284
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,080
break things at will.

285
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,760
Thirdly, my phone must be returned.

286
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,450
Brackets can be waived.

287
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,650
Why did you write it down if it's waivable?

288
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,450
How do I know if I don't try?

289
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:33,140
These two in front of you are not ordinary oranges.

290
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,620
Let me show you.

291
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,190
These are called Roe Crab Meat Stuffed in Orange.

292
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,150
This is my special recipe using

293
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,920
Yangcheng Lake Hairy crab and minced Iberico meat.

294
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,280
I can agree to your three demands, but you are not allowed to eat these two oranges.

295
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,730
If you want to eat them...

296
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,750
I am a very principled person.

297
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,550
I see. What a pity.

298
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,880
I didn't say that I didn't want to eat them.

299
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,150
What about your three demands?

300
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,840
I was joking. I have no demands.

301
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,490
It's delicious.

302
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,360
Little Lin.

303
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,370
- You are here.
- How have you been?

304
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,920
- Take a seat.
- Here, here, here.

305
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,000
- What do you want to eat today?
- Squid with black bean sauce.

306
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,210
Okay.

307
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:45,490
Shiitake mushroom with green vegetables and Xiaoyu's special fried rice.

308
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,330
Of course, Xiaoyu has to fry the rice herself.

309
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,760
I can tell the difference.

310
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,420
Understood! Just a moment.

311
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,660
Sister Yu, he ordered the special fried rice that's hand-made by you.

312
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,510
Wow, you seem very angry.

313
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,280
You're such a pain in the as*.

314
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,200
Please, take a seat.

315
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,210
Why?

316
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,900
I need to tell you something.

317
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:29,060
I can't paint the beauty that exists in your eyes no matter how many times I try.

318
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,960
- What's wrong with you?
- Hold on! Hold on.

319
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,180
Let me look at you for a bit longer.

320
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,060
You're such a nuisance. I'll call the police on you if you do this again!

321
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,300
She's like that because I spoiled her too much.

322
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,070
Not at all. Not at all.

323
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,640
I think there's a special kind of oriental charm to her bad temper.

324
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,920
I like it a lot.

325
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,970
We have many great things that have an oriental charm to it.

326
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,210
Can you like some more positive things?

327
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,390
For example what?

328
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,260
For example?

329
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,620
For example oriental…

330
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,640
The Oriental Pearl Tower! Silly kid.

331
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,260
- Will that be enough?
- I think that'll be good, sir.

332
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,200
The Oriental Pearl Tower?

333
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,310
Pearl?

334
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,430
Is this dish different from the one just now?

335
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,980
Although this is also tasty,

336
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,730
this doesn't seem like a crab.

337
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,670
Mushroom?

338
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,600
That's right. That one is made of mushrooms.

339

Write down a score for the taste of the two dishes you just had according to the form you were filling out this morning.

340
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,990
Okay.

341
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,290
Li Yan, I sent you the list of fungi.

342
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,920
Yes. Remember to deliver it over here.

343
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,410
Also, it has to be produced from the place I told you. Make sure to double-check it.

344
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,460
You're back. Was training camp fun?

345
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,780
It was amazing. How could what you recommended to me not be good?

346
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,970
By the way, Old Jiang, I also brought you a gift.

347
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,700
A gift?

348
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,260
Do you know what we do in the wild to increase our sugar levels?

349
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,270
Wild honeycombs. The training camp taught you that.

350
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,430
That's right. I brought it back just for you!

351
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,650
- How dare you to cause trouble!
- Nina!

352
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,590
Don't hit his head! Sister, hit his waist!

353
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,710
- That honeycomb doesn't have any bees!
- You can't see the bruises if they're on his waist! Lower!

354
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,690
A bit lower!

355
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,650
Stop hitting him!

356
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:21,460
You're so childish, Song Yiran. Is there something wrong with you?

357
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,260
I'm just messing around. I didn't expect to get attacked.

358
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,280
Stop laughing.

359
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,480
By the way, how have you been doing lately?

360
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,210
The same as you. It's sheer luck that I'm still alive.

361
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,800
Jiang Qianfan, did you bully her again?

362
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,500
Did I?

363
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,360
Did you?

364
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,050
Shouldn't you two know if he did or not?

365
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,220
- Are you really doing okay?
- I'm starting to like cooking.

366
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:09,560
All right then. Do your best to learn from Old Jiang. I'll come to visit you another time.

367
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,920
In fact, it's good to push yourself sometimes. You'll learn some practical skills.

368
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,360
My abs even got stronger while I was at the military camp.

369

Quit talking and get going.

- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

371
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:31,350
I didn't process what was going on until I watched his car drive away.

372
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,730
What?

373
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:36,830
To my own surprise, I asked Song Yiran to visit me less often,

374
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,350
but that's exactly what I wanted.

375
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:45,020
Recently, I started thinking about him less often. I didn't even notice it myself.

376
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,040
Have I changed?

377
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,830
Welcome to Bellagio Shanghai. What can I do for you?

378
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,700
Arrange a suite for me.

379
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,400
- Okay. Please wait.
- Thank you.

380
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,540
Mr. Jiang, here's the mushroom you asked for. There's a total of 23 types.

381
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,010
Great. Take it out and show me.

382
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:58,260
In such a short period of time, we couldn't get them delivered from our refrigeration.

383
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,970
So I got the goods delivered according to the place of production and quality of the product you asked for.

384
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,760
I verified them. They're high quality. Check it over.

00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,860
- What about the lurid bolete?
- At the bottom.

388
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,920
All right.

389
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,290
I bought their products according to your standards. They were originally transferred from Yunnan.

390
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,630
They're very fresh.

391
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,510
Thank you for the hard work. You can head back to rest.

392
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,020
All right.

393
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,880
- There are so many mushrooms. Are they all edible?
- Of course.

394
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,920
Come on. Let's begin. Help me take it over there.

Someone's calling for you.

398
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,690
- Why are they calling you?
- I don't know either.

399
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,200
Hello? Who is it?

400
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,950
I knew you were at the spa.

401
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,850
Chu Ting is already at the hotel!

402
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,590
Well...

403
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,660
I promised to pick her up from the airport.

404
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,010
I fell asleep.

405
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,560
Brother, how did you know about this? Did she call you?

406
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,310
I know everything about you.

407
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,260
I know everything including when you leave the house, when you come home, and how many friends you bring over!

Brother, do you have remote surveillance?

00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,400
I'm already 24.

Thank god I'm monitoring you.

411

If I wasn't, you'd mess everything up for me!

Right, right, right. You're right about everything.

So it's my darling.

What's the matter? Are you mad?

417
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,250
I came to apologize. Don't be mad.

Savory rating of 6.3.

426
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,140
It's still not quite the same as the real crab dish.

427
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:58,920
So that's how you use that secret? Why can't you just give it a taste yourself?

428
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,540
Li Yan, bring me some brown beech mushrooms.

429
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,830
Can the brown beech mushroom replace the taste of the crab?

430
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,360
Of course not.

431
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,720
You still have to steam the red meat and shallot with the chicken for two hours after blanching.

432
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,410
The brown beech mushroom will slowly absorb the savory soup, bringing out the taste of crab meat,

433
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,160
but we still have to experiment with exactly how to do it.

434
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,630
That's so much work.

435
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,900
Would you rather it be a lot of work or it not taste good?

436
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,180
A bit of work is nothing as long as it tastes good.
