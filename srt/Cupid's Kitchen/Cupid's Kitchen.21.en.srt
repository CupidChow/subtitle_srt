9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,780
No way we're making up.

10
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,550
Dad, we made up now. Don't be angry anymore.

11
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,450
Kesong, what do you say?

12
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,020
Don't be angry with her anymore.

13
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,090
There we go!

14
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,740
Get back over there!

15
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,930
It's normal for you to have conflicts

16
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,880
but you need to talk it out.

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,900
Family doesn't scheme against each other.

18
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,490
Just like Kesong's dad and I. We take care of each other

19
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,990
and live a good life. That's what matters the most, all right?

20
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,430
Remember that.

21
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,250
It's all right to bicker,

22
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,200
but if you fight each other again, I'll expose you on your competition's official site!

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,770
I'll post the photos of you two wetting the bed as children!

24
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,700
- What?
- Do you hear me?

25
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,240
Hello? Brother, Sister-in-law.

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,210
Are you still there?

27
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,950
You heard that, right?

28
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,480
How do you think I did? It was just, fair, and open.

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,680
- Are you satisfied?
- Yes, it was fair. We're satisfied.

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,220
Don't post the photos of them wetting the bed as children.

31
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,750
- Right.
- Our daughters still need to marry.

32
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,780
I'm not posting anything. I don't have those photos. It was just to scare them.

33
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,720
I'll hang up then, if that's all. I have to get back to work.

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,520
Okay.

35
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,910
I think Mr. Jiang is very protective of Kesong.

36
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,550
That makes me relieved.

37
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,980
He just said one sentence. That's nothing.

38
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,740
Why didn't you tell the truth about what happened?

39
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,750
If someone were to say that about my parents, I wouldn't let them off so easily.

40
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,040
I did tell the truth. I did hit her,

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,570
but it's not necessary for me to tell my uncle why I hit her.

42
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,960
My uncle would feel very awkward if he knew.

43
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,660
He'll then talk to my dad about it and they'll have an argument. This will never come to an end.

44
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,740
This can just stay between Xiaoyu and me.

45
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,740
We've been arguing since we were children. I'm used to it.

46
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,360
Besides, it wasn't that painful, to begin with.

47
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,210
I learned to cook from Montgomery when I was a kid and I don't really have many other relatives,

48
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,440
so I'm afraid I can't understand your concerns,

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,990
but it's rare to see someone your age so thoughtful.

50
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,260
Thank you, Mr. Jiang. I'm very touched to hear you compliment me in such a way.

51
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,630
- Crab roe soup dumplings.
- Thank you.

52
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,660
Please enjoy.

53
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,980
Lin Kesong, let's get down to business.

54
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,210
Your overall rank is currently at sixth place. Victor, Blu,

55
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,420
and Lin Xiaoyu are all currently doing better than you.

56
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,020
They also have higher scores than you. The other contestants are similar in ranking as you. They have their good and bad days.

57
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,040
You have to be well-prepared and do well in the next sour topic.

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,090
Where do I start?

59
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,710
From the soup dumpling in your mouth.

60
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,280
The one you just had was dipped in vinegar, right?

61
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,520
Try one without the vinegar.

62
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,150
What do you think? Can you taste the difference?

63
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,050
The crab soup dumplings aren't fishy.

64
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,990
They added yellow rice wine to both the stuffing and soup.

65
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,510
If I had known I could get rid of the fishiness like this, I would've…

66
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,350
You would've what? I'm asking you about the difference in the taste with and without vinegar.

67
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,780
Why are you talking about the fishiness?

68
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,590
It's nothing.

69
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,890
Are you keeping something from me?

70
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,230
You can't eat until you tell me.

71
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,960
Are you going to say it?

72
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,240
Last time Elise came over,

73
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,150
she told me the crayfish and beef

74
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,130
both had a fishy taste, but we couldn't tell you.

75
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,860
So she asked me to find a way to teach her.

76
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,150
I didn't know this method of getting rid of the fishiness,

77
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,320
so I smoked the crayfish in Pu'er

78
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,290
instead of soaking them in green tea.

79
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,480
So you were innocent when I punished you to clean Yuxuan's floors that day.

80
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,930
I suppose.

81
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,730
Do you hate me?

82
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,740
A bit.

83
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,620
All right then. How do you want me to make it up to you?

84
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,250
How would you make it up to me? You're the teacher anyway.

85
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,700
I can't tell you to clean Yuxuan's floors.

86
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,320
It's a deal.

87
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,340
Elise.

88
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,880
Elise, what are you doing?

89
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Watch Mom for me.

90
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,820
What are you doing exactly?

91
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,450
What is that?

92
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,520
Elise, what on earth are you looking for?

93
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,390
Mom.

94
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,920
No need to keep looking. It's with Lawyer Goodman.

95
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,010
Mom, please.

96
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,760
I think of one word when I see you. Pathetic.

97
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,870
Elise.

98
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,360
What's going on? Why did mom say that about you? I don't want to see you like this.

99
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,930
That's just what Mom thinks of me. I don't think that about myself. I'll be fine.

100
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,890
But it's been such a long time since I saw you smile.

101
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,330
I'm just under a lot of pressure. I'll be fine after this is over.

102
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,780
What's the document you're looking for? If you need help,

103
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,000
you know I'm always by your side.

104
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,240
You've had peppers on their own, but would you eat a lemon on its own?

105
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,500
Of course not.

106
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,130
That's because the sourness of the lemon

107
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,170
can stimulate your senses of taste and smell.

108
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,460
It causes you to want to resist it,

109
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,800
but just the right amount of sour can improve the flavor of your food

110
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,660
and improve your appetite.

111
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,580
For example, hot and sour, and sweet and sour.

112
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,990
So when a chef adds the right amount of sour to their food,

113
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,700
it changes the sweetness and flavor of the dish.

114
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,130
With that being said,

115
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,700
the most difficult thing is also to figure out what the right amount of sour is

116
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,000
to allow the flavors of the ingredients to blend well together.

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,560
Therefore, the sour taste

118
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,890
is the most difficult to understand and master

119
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,560
of the five tastes. Got it?

120
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,320
That's why I don't like sour food. It's so much work. Sweet food is the best.

121
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,530
How many times do I have to tell you that I don't like sweet food?

122
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,790
Also, there's something I have to tell you.

123
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,130
I'm going to start having Elise over often. Prepare yourself.

124
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,960
Let's continue the lesson.

125
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,030
What does he mean Elise will be coming here often?

126
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,090
I wanted to say no,

127
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,120
but I know exactly where I stand.

128
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,390
Why do I still feel so sour about it?

129
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,960
Lin Kesong. Lin Kesong! What are you thinking about?

130
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,650
Come over here.

131
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,150
We'll start learning about how to use sourness in food. Before we begin,

132
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,490
you must first understand what exactly the sour taste is.

133
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,690
The sour taste is the taste of hydrogen ions dissolved in water.

134
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,540
Look closely.

135
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,120
Hydrogen ions are actually just protons, an elementary particle in physics.

136
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,550
In this sense, sour is a very micro taste.

137
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,060
There are many substances that can produce the hydrogen ion.

138
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,050
And among the ingredients, those that can be acidulants are

139
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,820
phosphate, lactic acid, acetic acid,

140
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,060
malic acid, citric acid.

141
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,260
These things can soften the protein.

142
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,370
In other words, if we use fruits as the base

143
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,490
to make sauces when marinating meats,

144
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,530
it will make the meats tender with a special flavor.

145
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:27,090
Next, I'll teach you how to pick out apples and lemons.

146
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,110
- Hello?
 - Hello, Old Lin? Property management called to tell me that my house is leaking.

147
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,400
Chu Ting is on a business trip and I'm unable to make it home.

148
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,660
Go to my house and wait for property management.

149
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,660
The code is four 5's and the pound key.

150
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,630
Thanks.

151
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,120
Sure. I'll be there in a second.

152
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,820
Surprise!

153
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,490
What is this?

154
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,450
What's going on?

155
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,180
What else could it be? It's a celebration.

156
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,220
Old Lin, I lied to you. It's actually my champagne that's leaking.

157
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,090
We're waiting for you to drink it

158
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,690

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,250
Why do you suddenly ask this?

320
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,510
Today my muscles are a little painful,

321
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,890
then I ate one of Mr. Jiang's aspirins.

322
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,190
I tasted a sour flavor.

323
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:56,470
It's similar to the sour flavor in a bowl of porridge that I ate.

324
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,450
Dr. Xie?

325

Are you still there?

326
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,710
I'm here. I'm here.

327
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,160
Did you say that it's Qianfan's aspirin?

328
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,250
Is it the one in the green bottle?

329
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,090
Can you describe in detail the type of porridge that he made?

330
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:26,580
Actually, that day I accidentally drank the porridge that Elise made for Mr. Jiang,

331
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,790
but at that time I had figured out all the seasoning inside.

332
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,170
There's a flavor inside that I can't figure out, no matter how I taste it,

333
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,930
but when I took Mr. Jiang's medicine,

334
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,730
I felt that the sour taste was similar.

335
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,840
It's like this... that... Miss Lin...

336
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,450
Regarding how the taste of chemical substances and food ingredients are the same,

337
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,270
I'm really not an expert on this.

338
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,990
But it has the same taste as the porridge made by Elise,

339
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,320
I guess that it's probably a coincidence.

340
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,980
Okay, thank you.

341
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,030
Okay, then that's all for now.

Hello, Jun Bin, what's wrong?

Any new update on Oliver's illness?

356

Have you seen this medicine before?

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,450
No.

358
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:36,210
After Ollie lost his sense of taste, you made porridge for him once. Right?

359
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,820
Ollie told you?

360
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,860
Lin Kesong told me.

361
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,210
She tasted something in your porridge that tasted exactly like this medicine.

362
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,270
That's nonsense. Too ridiculous.

363
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:53,600
How can she taste it? Does she really think that her tongue is as sharp a dog's nose?

364
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,430
She was simply trying to frame. It's so outrageous.

This medicine is used to neutralize into the toxin of the essential oil.

366
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,060
The active ingredient in it can't be found in the natural environment, it's a chemical substance,

367
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,930
and it should not be showing up in the porridge that you cook.

368
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:17,480
Only you, Li Yan, and Nina handled the essential oil with poison.

369
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,870
And now it showed up in the porridge that you made.

370
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,160
Isn't this too much of a coincidence?

371
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,090
Someone told me that

372
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,340
the poison in the essential oil is not so bad. Medicine can be used to neutralize it,

373
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,310
so... I believed it.

374
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:23,400
I just wanted to teach Ollie a lesson. Have him lose his sense of taste, so that he would need to rely on me.

375
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,480
Unable to leave me. Junbin, you know that

I want to be with him, no matter how,

378
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,880
but I didn't expect him to meet Lin Kesong and her extraordinary sense of taste.

379
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,420
He started to rely on her. I broke down.

380
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,800
The toxin in this essential oil can act on a person's nervous system,

381
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,730
but if it continues to encroach,

382
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,400
I'm afraid that Ollie will lose

383
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,770
more than his sense of taste.

384
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,820
That doesn't matter. I can accompany him.

385

but do you need to do this?

What's going on with Li Yan then?

391

I am willing to believe you.

Thank you, Junbin.

I immediately fell apart.

All this time, he has been very good to me, aside from not loving me.

How can you ask Li Yan to do something so important?

477
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,420
Hurry up, why are you so slow?

478
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,390
What's going on?

479
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,120
Go in.

480
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,230
- What's going on?
- Come here.

481
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,610
What are you doing?

482
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,350
Here.

483
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,100
Come, sit.

484
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,400
Sit down. Wait for me here.

485
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,670
No.

486
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,430
What did I do wrong again?

487
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,590
Mr. Jiang.

488
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,000
Mr. Jiang.

489
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,730
Next program,

490
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,720
talented Head Chef mopping the floor.

491
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,810
What are you laughing at?

492
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,180
Are you really mopping or not?

493
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,640
I'm really mopping. I always keep to my word.

494
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,720
Mop then.

495
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,800
Okay, Boss Lin. Come.

496
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,710
Mop from where, Boss Lin?

497
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,540
- Where? How about here?
- Let me think.

498
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,660
Over there, over there.

499
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,960
There, quick. Three, two, one.

500
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,140
There's still a time limit?

501
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,630
- Come, come, where else, tell me?
- Here, here.

502
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,480
- Quick, quick.
- I'm here.
- Too much work.

503
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,210
Here, right? Sorry, make way, make way.

504
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:13,460
- Below you.
- You are disturbing the customer, you go there.
- Below you. Your leg.

505
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,900
Here. Customer, customer, lift your leg up, lift it up.

506
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,070
- Go there and mop!
- Where?

507
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,340
- Where, where?
- There.

508
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,500
- There?
- Quick. Three, two, one.

509
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,960
- Quick!
- I'm going.

510
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,030
Here, here. It's not very clean! Quick, quick!

511
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:28,560
- Wasn't that just mopped?
- Quick, quick.

512
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,570
Why is this not moving?

513
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,870
Hey.

514
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,450
- Quick, come back.
- Coming back.

515
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:37,380
- Quick!
- I'm back!

516
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,390
Morning.

517
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,860
Morning.

518
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,720
After we came home late last night, I thought you were not coming.

519
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,910
You really underestimated me.

520
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,510
The sour theme is fermentation, have you seen it?

521
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,440
I saw it.

522
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,400
What are you planning to teach me today?

523
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,220
Today, we'll go to Yuxuan's vegetable facility.

524
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,120
Really?

525
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,410
Really.

526
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,040
I can go out and play again. I'll go get changed. See you!

527
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,000
Come up. Come back!

528
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,300
I'll go get changed!

529
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,700
Come back!

530
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,720
♫  Someone steals your heart  ♫

531
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,380
♫ The silence you can't find ♫

532
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:29,280
I didn't look at it properly the other time. Turns out it's so beautiful.

533
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,350
There's a swing!

534
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:33,800
♫  My daydream is changing  ♫

535
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,530
♫ I wanna let you in  ♫

536
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:42,430

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,480

Play yourself.

542
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,440
You can't win over me!

543
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,850
What?

544
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,550
♫  I wanna let you in  ♫

545
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,660
♫ You're the special one for me ♫

546
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,210
Let's compete.

547
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,340
- Who wants to compete with you?
- See who is higher.

548
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,550
Ready, start!

549
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:18,750
♫  Save my broken soul  ♫

550
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:25,110
♫  Save me from a disappointing night  ♫

551
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,770
♫  You have magic touch  ♫

552
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,260
♫ You're the special one ♫

553
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,830
♫  Take me to the light  ♫

554
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:43,560
♫ You're the special one for me ♫

555
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,130
This is the time tunnel you talked about?

556
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,720
Yes.

557
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,390
This is the place where Yuxuan specially handles the vegetables fermentation and marination. Look.

558
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:02,030
All the temperatures are constant. After we pick the vegetables, they will be sent here for processing.

559
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,000
I picked this just now. Try it.

560
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,590
Isn't it just normal tomatoes?

561
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,820
It is a normal tomato because it hasn't been processed.

562
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,080
Next, we'll add salt and wine. It'll then be like this.

563
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,030
When we open the cover, we can smell the fermented sour fragrance.

564
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,060
Immediately after, we'll add garlic and ginger. Let the garlic taste

565
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,380
and flavor produce a chemosynthetic effect.

566
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,660
This is three days. This is five days.

567
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,900
This is seven days. This is 15 days.

568
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,640
And this is one month.

569
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:43,580
Come, taste it. See how it's different.

570
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,230
- Is it edible?
- Yes.

571
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:05,160
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

572
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,930
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

573
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:12,360
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

574
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,340
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

575
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,600
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

576
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,600
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

577
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,090
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
