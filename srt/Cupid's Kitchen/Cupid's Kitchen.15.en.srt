Hello! Delivery for Lin Xiaoyu.

Oh, you can leave it out front.

Do you know what you did wrong?

- Hello, this way.
- Thanks.

you are with another girl?

I'm not. She's talking about Lin Kesong.

I've always been good friends with Old Lin. We are not dating.

Chu Ting, I know this girl.

101
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,020
If there's something between them, they would've been dating each other a long time ago.

Don't worry about this.

Director Song, I want to hear it from him.

My eldest brother has said what I wanted to say.

If you can't accept his words, there's nothing I can do.

What's that supposed to mean?

Are you trying to negotiate with me?

109
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,690
I cannot accept a guy who already has a girlfriend.

What are you talking about? How could you?

111

How could I what? Be a disgrace like you?

- Shut up!

I know you are offended.

As a bystander, I feel the same way.

And you,

118
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,010
as a man, how could you keep arguing with Chu Ting?

119
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,800
- How is it my fault?
- What's wrong with you?

120
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,420
Chu Ting, I apologize for Ran Ran.

121
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,830
It's my fault he's a brat.

122
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,550
Can you do me, as a brother, a favor?

123
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,560
Director Song, since you put it that way,

124
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,800
I can't refuse.

125
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,590
But I have to make this clear,

126
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,350
I'm older than Yiran.

127
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,140
I've always told myself, I need to give him room and let him mature.

128
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,280
Everything will be fine.

129
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,920
I didn't expect by giving him too much space

130
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,230
would cause him to be trapped.

131
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,450
Hear that?

132
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,510
See how mature Chu Ting is.

133
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,360
Look at yourself.

134
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,020
Chu Ting is only one year older than you.

135
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,020
I heard it.

136
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,600
And?

137
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:48,220
Actually, we weren't really mad at each other.

138
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,020
Right, baby?

139
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,080

You guys haven't eaten yet, right?

Let's go eat, baby.

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,710
Come on, baby. Let's go eat.

Go, go, go.

144
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,780
Why are you here?

145
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,960
I thought you said you wanted to meet?

146
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,540
When did I say that?

147
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,290
Jiang Qianfan asked my sister to tell me. Why?

148
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,540
Why? Are you scared to see me?

149
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,630
Why would I be scared?

150
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,260
Not scared? That's great.

151
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,090
Let's compete today.

152
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,940
You can pick any challenge. Deal?

153
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,910
I'm too busy to compete today.

154
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,690
Tomorrow then.

155
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,290
I have things to do tomorrow!

156
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,980
If you want to challenge me, wait for the competition.

157
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,960
And you say you're not scared of me?

158
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,860
I thought after a month, you would be awesome.

159
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,560
But you are just the same.

160
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,440
What a waste of time talking to you.

161
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,900
Don't worry. I won't let you win.

162
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,310
See you.

163
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,790
Evil Dragon Princess, seems you are not that smart.

164
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,530
Sure you've used a knife before?

165
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,520
If you want people to listen to you, it's not enough to just tap them on the shoulder.

166
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,610
You have to be strong. You have to be the winner.

167

However, when Boris found out, he banned me from eating them.

He said that sweet foods will cause secretion of dopamine

214
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,770
which will generate feelings of happiness. It will kill the fighting spirit.

215

Hence, he banned me from eating them.

Shouldn't a chef make people happy?

217

But a chef doesn't necessarily need to be happy.

But it's not because I'm not good enough,

490
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,930
Mr. Thomas, to give a speech. A warm applause, please.

491
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,880
Thank you.

492
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,220
Thank you, everyone.

493
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,010
Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen

494
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,060
for being with us today.

495
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,590
This morning, I spent 10 minutes

496
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,140
just to put on my necktie.

497
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:52,280
After seeing this, my wife said, "Dear, don't be nervous."

498
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,550
"You are not even a contestant."

499
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,380
"You are the Chairperson of the Judging Panel."

500
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,650
After hearing this, I relaxed and took a breath. She was right.

501
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,480
Thank God that I'm not a contestant in this competition.

502
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,470
Hence, I don't need to face the harsh scoring of the evaluation of the eight judges.

503
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,130
Because that is really living, which is no better than death.

504
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,740
Okay, I won't take too much of your time here.

505
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,040
Please display on screen

506
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,840
the eight judges for this competition.

507
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,100
Thank you.

508
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,300
[Eight judges of the Judging Panel]

509
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,500
Okay. Everyone, based on the tradition of this competition. At every competition,

510
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,480
we will choose a kind of taste for the competition.

511
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,860
The sequence is bitter, spicy, sour, salty, fresh, and sweet.

512
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,910
Our first four competitions will be based on points system.

513
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,420
The total points for the top four will enter the semi-finals.

514
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,840
The decision of the semi-finals will be based on votings

515
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,160
for the two last contestants. For the finals,

516
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,080
our mentors and apprentices will compete in the competition.

517
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,940
Hence, Evil Dragon Princess, don't be

518
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:15,030
a knock-out from the competition. I'm going to get rid of your partner.

519
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,960
To put it simply, every apprentices...

520
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,420
Better don't mention your past slip-ups.

521
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,090
Let everyone announce their challenge statements.

522
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:27,270
Next, let's feel the imposing manners of the young people.

523
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,500
Please look at the screen.

524
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,830
Did I record this?

525
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,240
I'm Victor.

526
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,210
What do you think?

527
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,490
Next, let's invite...

528
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,140
I didn't record anything. I don't need to talk, right?

529
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,660
Dream on.

530
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,790
Hello, everyone. I'm Blu. I'm here to make friends.

531
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,090
I'm Lin Xiaoyu. I'm here to take the trophy.

532
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,630
I hope that another person with the family name, Lin, won't be too embarrassed.

533
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,960
Cooking is an art and more than a science.

534
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,040
It's a thousand times repetitions of oxidations and reductions.

535
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,820
I, Zhou Dawen, am a nutritionist.

536
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,310
Boss, why are you leaving? Kesong is not out yet.

537
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:10,210
What is there to see? A competition has caused a feud between family members.

538
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,960
Stop watching! Go back to work.

539
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,090
Okay. Go back to work. Let's go.

540
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,940
My director was backstage just now.

541
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,400
He couldn't find Lin Kesong.

542
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,830
Let's let Miss Lin Kesong go on stage

543
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,990
to say her challenge statement.

544
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,550
No. I don't need to say anything.

545
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:34,710
This won't do, Miss Lin. Every contestant must make their challenge statements.

546
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,270
What should I say?

547
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:45,010
Okay, audience. Please give a warm applause

548
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,260
and invite Miss Lin to the stage to say her challenge statement. Okay?

549
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,010
Okay.

550
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,710
Just say whatever is in your heart. It's fine as long as it's sincere.

551
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,270
Go now.

552
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:16,550
Okay. Please invite Miss Lin to the stage. Please.

553
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:26,100
Okay, Miss Lin. You can make

554
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,070
your challenge statement to a single contestant

555
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:31,730
and issue a challenge to all contestants too.

556
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,620
I don't want to challenge.

557
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,540
Seems like Miss Lin

558
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,110
really has nothing to say.

559
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,430
Fine. Let' invite...

560
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,430
I do.

561
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,780
What?

562
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,600
Hello, everyone.

563
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,890
I'm Lin Kesong.

564
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,770
I don't want to be Evil Dragon Princess.

565
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,280
I want to be Grand Dragon Princess!

566
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,460
- Great.
- Great.

567
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,960
Excellent.

568
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,990
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

569
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,970
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

570
00:41:54,970 --> 00:42:00,290
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

571
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:08,430
♫  Don't bury your secret heart. Show them who you are  ♫

572
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:14,460
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

573
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,820
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
