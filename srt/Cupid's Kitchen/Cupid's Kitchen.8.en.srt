[Episode 8]

9
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,320
If you can slice the fish to a thickness of 0.1mm,

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,290
I'll return these fish to Yuxuan.

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,290
Are you kidding?

12
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,060
0.1 mm per slice? How are you going to measure it?

13
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,350
You're not so smart after all, Evil Dragon Princess.

14
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,040
Watch carefully.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,800
1 cm long. Do you want to measure it?

16
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,820
Close enough. Close enough.

17
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,000
Check and see if the slices are 0.1 mm thick?

18
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,540
It's your turn.

19
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,760
Are you certain that you've used a knife before?

20
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,060
Here, Victor just demonstrated the slant cut.

21
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,830
You have to hold the ingredient with one hand, then

22
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,810
cut the fish slantways with your other hand, one slice at a time.

23
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,990
This is not hard. Just make sure you use consistent force and cut evenly.

24
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,840
Check and see if this is 0.1 mm thick.

25
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,480
How old is Victor? How is he so accomplished?

26
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,550
He's 22 this year.

27
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,900
When he was in junior high, his schoolmates all

28
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,750
thought the school cook made terrible food.

29
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,350
They insisted for Victor to prepare their food. He was only 13-years-old at the time.

30
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,250
From then on, he spent more time in the kitchen than Elise.

31
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,390
He's been cooking since junior high?

32
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,320
Then, he's been developing his cooking skills for over a decade.

33
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,310
He's so talented and so hardworking. What should I do?

34
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,980
I'll go back and practice my knife skills.

35
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,040
Sure, but one month is not enough. You need to practice for a longer time.

36
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,070
Then, what should I do?

37
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,890
How about I join the competition next time?

38
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,320
Are you so confident that I would choose you again?

39
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,230
No.

40
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,750
What should I do?

41
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,490
Sit tight.

42
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,600
Today, we are going to cook this fish six different ways.

43
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,470
The belly has the most fat and will be used for sashimi.

44
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,430
The back meat gives fleshy thick cuts. We can make fried fillets.

45
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,600
The skin is full of collagen. We'll turn it into salt and pepper crisps.

46
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,480
The fish maw can be thinly sliced and made into a salad with dressing.

47
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,970
We can use the remaining meat for "dim sum".

48
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,870
The head and bones can be blandly stewed. Understand?

49
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,550
Yes.

50
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,520
♫  We play the notes of love ♫

51
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,580
♫ Like work of art ♫

52
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,720
♫ We sing the song for love ♫

53
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,770

♫ Don't hide your feelings for love ♫

♫ Like lonely star, lonely star ♫

58
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,980
- Did you watch and learn?
- Yes.

59
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,860
Your turn to prepare this half.

60
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,280
Give it a go.

61
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,040
♫ We play the notes of love ♫

62
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,840
Wait.

63
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,030
You should only make one cut at a time with the knife.

64
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,420
One cut at a time. No moving back and forth.

65
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,180
One cut at a time.

66
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,040
Then, cut here along the spine.

67
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,430
Look at the fish!

68
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,760
♫ Show them who you are ♫

69
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,760

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,180
♫ Listen to your heart ♫

72
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,110
♫ Listen to your heart ♫

73
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,330
♫ Listen to your heart ♫

74
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,020
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart ♫

75
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,110
Hey, wait.

76
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,340
Guess a Chinese idiom before you eat.

77
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,770
- A Chinese idiom?
- Yes.

78
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,340
“A blind person to touch the fish.”
(TN: A blind man trying to fish)

79
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,060
Touch your own head. Be serious.

80
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,870
- "A beauty captivating even the birds and beasts."
- I...

81
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,160
I'm really going to hit you.

82
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,250
Give me a hint.

83
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,230
If we deep fry the sashimi,

84
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:58,090
use the fish maw for soup, and make sashimi with the tail, what would happen?

85
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,590
Then, you'll make lots of money.

86
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,960
Hey, I know! You want me to say, "make the most of everything".

87
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,020
Yes.

88
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,920
This refers to ingredients as well as people. We need to play to our strengths

89
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,090
and make up for our shortcomings.

90
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,270
But most important of all, find the skills that best suits you.

91
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,070
- Understood. Can I eat now?
- Go ahead.

92
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,780
Delicious!

93
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,370
I'll eat this next. I'll drink this too.

94
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,760
Give me your hand.

95
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,350
Say, Victor is so young but he's already so great.

96
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,260
Is he a prodigy?

97
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,960
I guess.

98
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,350
I once wanted to take him as my apprentice.

99
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,870
Why didn't you?

100
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,560
He's too smart.

101
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,250
So you're saying I'm stupid?

102
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,100
You...

103
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,950
are perfectly stupid.

104
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:25,850
Those who are too smart will take shortcuts, which hold them back.

105
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,210
Come on, it can't hurt that much.

106
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,610
Go get me a pen and paper. I need to write my will.

107
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,760
If you want to write a will, do it yourself, though I can help engrave your tombstone.

108
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,380
I'll put...

109
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,330
A fool

110
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,770
died from her badge of honor.

111
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,700
Badge of honor? What do you mean?

112
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,250
Being a chef, we get

113
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,470
cuts,

114
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:11,330
burns, scalds. Day in and day out.

115
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,300
The wounds are our badges of honor.

116
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,700
So many wounds. As a kid, I had low pain tolerance.

117
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:31,340
But today's the first time I'm jealous of being wounded.

118
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,840
You're probably the Jiang Qianfan you are today

119
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,000
because you have them.

120
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,220
I'm going to practice with my badge of honor! Bye!

121
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,700
What am I working on?

122
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,900
Chefs devote themselves to their cooking skills, and your cooking skills depend on your knife skills.

123
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,270
We choose the appropriate cutlery and cutting techniques

124
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,760
according to the different ingredients and needs.

125
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,140
There are many cutting techniques. Chopping,

126
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,890
push slicing, pull slicing,

127
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,860
the sawing cut, and horizontal cut.

128
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,580
And whether you're dicing, slicing,

129
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,980
shredding, chopping, or cutting into any shape or form,

130
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,260
the thickness and length must be the same.

131
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,560
On one hand, it's for appearance. On the other hand,

132
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,090
it's so the ingredients get evenly cooked.

133
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,720
Wait.

134
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,810
Start at the tip of the knife.

135
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,520
Watch your fingers. Push out your middle finger.

136
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,130
Middle finger.

137
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,040
Give me the knife. I'll do it.

138
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,170
Watch.

139
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,150
The pull slice I just talked about.

140
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,820
Hold it down first. Push out your middle finger. Start with the tip of the knife.

141
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,230
Slide the knife forward and pull it back.

142
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,530
You didn't do a good job.

143
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,380
Push out your finger again. Middle finger.

144
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,500
Slide it forward.

145
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,290
Pull it backward.

146
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,130
Middle finger.

147
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,030
The thickness of the middle one is different.

148
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,500
We just talked about making sure the ingredients have the same thickness so it's all cooked evenly.

149
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,550
Try it again.

150
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,820
Like this?

151
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,790
Try it again.

152
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,400
Wait.

153
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,550
Chrysanthemum fish with pumpkin sauce.

154
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,500
Cut the fish to the bottom, but make sure to not cut the fish skin.

155
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,320
Control the oil temperature while frying and fry until crisp.

156
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,290
Most importantly, the sauce should have a shiny texture.

157
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,200
Will I learn all the cutting techniques,

158
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,930
how to fry, and to thicken the soup if I learn this dish?

159
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,430
Yes. This is the introductory dish for the chefs at Yuxuan.

160
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,100
From this dish, you can tell a chef's fundamental skills

161
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,130
and their understanding of ingredients. Give it a taste.

162
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,300
What do you think?

163
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,330
The fish is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The sauce is savory. It's delicious.

164
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,400
It's really tasty.

165
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,990
I mean what do you think about making one?

166
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,110
I have to make one myself after taking a single bite? That's not a good deal at all.

167
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,040
Cut the crap. Get on with it.

168
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,860
Heading out, Xiao Li?

169
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,630
Hey!

170
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,840
Boris, you scared me.

171
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,440
It wasn't easy to find you here.

172
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,760
How did you find my address?

173
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,250
Make sure to not put your name and phone number on a shared accommodation website

174
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,740
if you don't want others to find you.

175
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,170
Is there anything I can do for you?

176
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,900
Of course, there is. There are too many people around. Let's talk in private somewhere.

177
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,530
What do you mean?

178
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:37,090
I want to know Jiang Qianfan's current situation.

179
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,300
Boris, Mr. Jiang is good to me.

180
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,540
I won't tell you anything.

181
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,590
If he treats you well,

182
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,290
why are you living here?

183
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,800
Is there something wrong with Jiang Qianfan recently?

184
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,200
I work for Yuxuan and Mr. Jiang.

185
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,140
I'm sorry.

186
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,230
I guessed right.

187
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,990
Remember to call me

188
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,510
if Yuxuan's paycheck isn't enough for you.

189
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,830
Give it a taste.

190
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,200
This is the one you made and that's the one I made.

191
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,910
I can tell.

192
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,090
It lacks flavor. This dish is a great test of your basic skills.

193
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,180
Both the amount of salt and time you spent adding the salt

194
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,520
will affect the taste of the cooked dish. Try it for yourself.

195
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,830
That's impossible.

196
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,330
I put in the exact same amount.

197
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,930
It doesn't lack flavor.

198
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,650
It tastes the exact same as yours. Try it for yourself if you don't believe me!

199
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,800
There's no problem with it.

200
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,840
If I say it lacks flavor, then it lacks flavor! Not to even mention the other aspects of it.

201
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,270
You didn't fry it well, it's not crispy enough, and it's unacceptable how soft it is after drizzling the pumpkin sauce over it!

202
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,870
Go upstairs and remake it!

203
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,670
Go upstairs!

204
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,660
Fine, I'll remake it.

205
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,490
It clearly tasted the same.

206
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,190
Jiang Qianfan is so sensitive about his reputation. We clearly put the same amount of salt,

207
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,600
yet he still refuses to admit that he was wrong.

208
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,410
But how could he be wrong?

209
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,080
He's most likely doing this on purpose. He's testing me again.

210
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,240
Try this one. It's definitely right this time.

211
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,700
Get changed. We're going to Yuxuan.

212
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,300
Wait, try this first!

213
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,640
It only matters if you're able to taste the difference yourself.

214
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,860
Zhiqiang, Qiwen, Hu Hao. Set your work aside

215
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,450
and make a chrysanthemum fish with pumpkin sauce dish immediately.

216
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

217
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,440
Juju, come over here.

218
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,540
Yes.

219
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,620
Get the ingredients for the chrysanthemum fish with pumpkin sauce dish for Miss Lin.

220
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,020
Okay. Ms. Lin, this way, please.

221
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,490
Try it for yourself.

222
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,440
Why are you all standing here?

223
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,460
I asked them all to make a chrysanthemum fish with pumpkin sauce as an example for Lin Kesong.

224
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,840
Feed this to the cat.

225
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,520
What are you doing? You didn't even give that dish a taste.

226
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,530
That's where that dish should go.

227
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,630
You're so disrespectful towards food.

228
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,270
It's you who I don't respect.

229
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,000
Because of you, this chrysanthemum fish doesn't deserve my respect.

230
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,370
How did you know that I was the one who made it?

231
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,430
Did you not?

232
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,220
Yes, but you didn't even try it. You clearly just made a wild guess!

233
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,800
You tried them all though, right? How do you think they did in comparison to you?

234
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,500
They all made theirs better than mine.

235
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,840
Tell me. Which dish is the closest to Oliver's level of cooking?

236
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,800
They're all closer than mine.

237
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,020
Your sense of taste sure is honest.

238
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,240
Do you think you'd be able to win if they all participated in the Future Star Competition?

239
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,140
Don't worry. They won't be participating. Do you know why?

240
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,880
It's because they love Yuxuan and Oliver.

241
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,480
They value their reputation.

242
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,190
Zhiqiang, Qiwen, Hu Hao. You can get back to work.

243
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,800
Okay.

244
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,750
Wait. You still haven't told me how you knew.

245
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,400
What?

246
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,180
Oliver didn't tell you that food is more than just taste?

247
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,740
The difference between the two chrysanthemum fish dishes is like the difference between a diamond and zircon.

248
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,830
Amateurs wouldn't be able to tell the difference, but it's obvious in the eyes of experts.

249
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:13,590
It's a joke for zircon to want to become a diamond.

250
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,050
Oliver.

251
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,170
You didn't bring her to Yuxuan to only teach her a lesson, right?

252
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,340
I'm losing my ability to taste salt.

253
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,900
Why is it happening so fast this time?

254
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,230
I don't know.

255
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,160
Did you tell Junbin yet?

256
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,710
No.

257
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,170
Give it a taste!

258
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,420
How did you make this dish?

259
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:54,430
You told me earlier that food is more than just taste.

260
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,370
You're right.

261
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:02,000
So I shouldn't just think about the seasoning when cooking.

262
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,890
This chef made his dish with me.

263
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,590
He raised the oil temperature the second time he fried it,

264
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:17,190
so I think that's why his fish is the most crispy.

265
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,040
And you. If I remember correctly,

266
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,900
you added sizzling oil when making the sauce.

267
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,120
That's why your fish and sauce doesn't stick together

268
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,320
no matter how long you leave it out.

269
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,560
The last one is you.

270
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:42,070
Your fish is the chewiest. That may be because your knife skills are the best out of everyone here.

271
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,660
You preserved the fiber in the fish the best when cutting it.

272
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,300
My knife skills are inferior to yours, so you win!

273
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:59,480
Miss Quentin, zircon might not be able to become a diamond,

274
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,930
but zircon shines brightly too.

275
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,740
So you better watch out in case one day zircon reflects brightly

276
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,640
into your eyes and injures you when you're not noticing.

277
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,840
Although I still have a very long way to go,

278
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,740
I suddenly had hope when I saw him give a satisfied nod.

279
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,900
I want to receive many more positive remarks, especially his.

280
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,720
Do I get a reward?

281
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,800
Are you a dog? Do you want a bone?

282
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,930
Yes! I'm your apprentice,

283
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,670
but I still haven't had a proper meal cooked by you.

284
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,810
The time you had too much herbal flavor in your food doesn't count.

285
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,720
Okay. I promise to cook for you.

286
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,490
Why are you wearing that?

287
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,450
Is this how you're going to learn to cook?

288
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,220
You're not feminine enough!

289
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,680
I have no such apprentice! Do a hundred pushups!

290
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,030
I'm a little princess!

291
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,490
Hi!

292
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,210
What are you doing?

293
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,280
I'm rewarding Miss Lin Kesong.

294
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,170
Rewarding?

295
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,920
There's fresh flowers, candles,

296
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,480
good food, good wine, and music. Most importantly, there's a beautiful woman.

297
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,920
I'm touched.

298
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,330
Beautiful woman? You can be considered one if you're comparing yourself to broccoli.

299
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,730
Besides, my intention is not to reward you. Sit down.

300
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,110
You've been in the kitchen for so long. Are you sure you're not rewarding me?

301
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:49,080
Irrelevant personnel, can you leave me alone?

302
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,170
I don't want you to affect my dining experience.

303

even though I'm not home, as long as I eat well, she and dad won't be worried.

309
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,690
Mom,

310
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,880
I did eat well.

The food I have is so yummy, you can't imagine.

I feel loved. My heart is filled with warmth.

♫  I would do silly things for you  ♫

322
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,590
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,430
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

324
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:29,640
♫  Don't hide your feelings for love  ♫

325
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,630

♫  We play the notes of love  ♫

♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

329
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:51,050
♫  Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫

♫  Love is the food for the living heart  ♫

333

♫  All kinds of taste we gonna try  ♫

♫  Love is the food for the living heart  ♫

337
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,300

339
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:42,370
♫  All kinds of taste we gonna try  ♫

340
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,110
What's going on? What's wrong?

341
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,060
Nothing.

342
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,080
I don't know what happened. I was eating and got very emotional.

343
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,770
This is so delicious. Thank you.

344
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,040
How did you make it taste so good?

345
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,360
I may not get to eat something like this anymore.

346
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,330
Are you dumb?

347
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,330
I'm alive and well. Why won't you get food like this again?

348
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:40,000
Plus, after you learn it, you can cook for yourself.

349
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,780
Well, I can't be that good.

350
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:49,530
Hey, I'll teach you, until you are this good.

351
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,690
- Really?
- Really.

352
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,710
Then, going forward, can you stop calling me stupid and annoying?

353
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,210
You are stupid and annoying.

354
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,120
But I won't take it personally, okay?

355
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,940
Yes.

356
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,550
I'll go do the dishes.

357
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,400
You can leave them. Nina will do it.

358
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,110
There's only a few dishes.

359
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,850
Let me do it. My bowls are limited edition. Can't replace them if you break any.

360
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,160
Then you do it.

361
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,280
Actually, if you didn't pick me out,

362
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,080
I'd probably spend my whole life doing dishes at my uncle's restaurant.

363
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,630
So you are worried that people in Shanghai can't do their dishes?

364
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,450
That's why you've come all this way?

365
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,470
There's nothing embarrassing in saying this.

366
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,230
I did it for Song Yiran.

367
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,330
I already know.

368
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,490
Ten years ago, he was the center of your life.

369
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:58,990
Now, he motivates your everyday life.

370
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,510
My guess is you haven't told him the truth yet?

371
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,420
You are not that hard to guess.

372
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,340
Here, put this over there.

373
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,220
Hello.

374
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,520
Miss Elise.

375
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,570
Hi, is Oliver there? Can he talk?

376
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,560
Oliver's here. He's in the kitchen with Miss Lin, doing the dishes.

377
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,070
Do you want me to go get him?

378
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,560
Oh, no... no need

379
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,300
All right, thanks.

380
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,260
Elise, your brother and I are leaving after celebrating your birthday with you.

381
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,420
Take care of yourself, okay?

382
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,390
Oliver forgot it's my birthday today.

383
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,920
Are you surprised?

384
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,690
No, not at all.

385
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:31,510
But what hurts more is, he once said

386
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:36,640
doing the dishes is the most worthless and uncreative work.

387
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,400
Yet,

388
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,060
he is now at home doing dishes.

389
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,150
He is at home with Lin Kesong, doing dishes.

390
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,880
When two people live together, they change each other.

391
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,670
Mom, you know what I'm worried about. Say no more.

392
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,920
I heard it clearly on the phone,

393
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,190
he's happier now

394
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,870
but not because of me.

395
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,400
It's because of a... Another woman. I can't accept it.

396
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,590
You are hurting yourself.

397
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,500
Oliver is a person that only looks forward.

398
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,570
He won't waste another minute on what's gone.

399
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:17,620
Why let him upset you?

400
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,010
I want to let it go too.

401
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,230
But I can't.

402
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:28,860
Now that I think about it, I feel so stupid.

403
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,490
Holding on to this feeling I can't even explain, and being attached for so long.

404
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,200
I'm stupid.

405
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,060
You are dumb but also great.

406
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,340
Making fun of me again.

407
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,070
I'm serious.

408
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,370
Being dumb means you don't care about gains or losses.

409
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,860
You won't burden yourself with making choices.

410
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,490
You are very agreeable.

411
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,620
Rather than saying you trust everyone,

412
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,760
I'd say you've never been cynical.

413
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,940
Me? Really?

414
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,320
That sounds nice.

415
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,170
Yes, and very sincere.

416
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,070
Are you really complimenting me?

417
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,930
I thought you are teasing me again.

418
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,300
Fate is so bizarre.

419
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,980
Had I not come to Shanghai

420
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,400
and didn't go interview with Xiaoyu...

421
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,620
If I didn't go to Hangzhou and stayed at Liang She Hotel...

422
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:43,560
If you weren't interning at the hotel and didn't have a crush on him...

423
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,280
Yes.

424
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,940
That's why all encounters are a result of tens and thousands of coincidences.

425
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,820
We should cherish it.

426
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,610
I never knew what it is that I wanted.

427
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,830
That's until I ate the food you made today.

428
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:08,990
I suddenly realized there are still a lot of wonderful things for me to discover in this world.

429
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:15,110
So now, from the bottom of my heart, I really want to be a good chef.

430
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:19,850
Then I can cook for others, the delicacies I've had.

431
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,500
Seems like you've really fallen in love with cooking.

432
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:29,020
All right. I'll help you fulfill your dream.

433
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:33,300
You've been doing it all along.

434
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,430
Tomorrow's going to be a busy day. It's late. Get some rest.

435
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,990
- Good night, Mr. Jiang!
