[Episode 22]

9
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,330
Here, try it. See how it's different.

10
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,440
Is it edible?

11
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,110
Yes.

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,760
It's sour...

13
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,900
and salty.

14
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,660
It also tastes of the spiciness from ginger and garlic.

15
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,100
The main thing is, the tomato's texture has changed.

16
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,030
The fiber is gone, and it's even thicker than before.

17
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,600
That's right. The thickness that you mentioned is timing.

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,830
Fermentation is cooking's time channel.

19
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,090
It can keep the food's flavor through time.

20
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,040
It can use time to change the food's texture and flavor or the quality of the ingredients.

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,950
From one month to half a year, or even a lifetime.

22
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,970
I need to go out for a while, I got something to do.

23
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,620
Where are you going so early in the morning?

24
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,410
Elise, go after eating breakfast.

25
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,260
No. I'll eat out.

26
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,040
Elise.

27
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,240
The topic has been announced. It's fermentation.

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,600
Come back soon. Show your brother your specialty Lime Fish Fillet.

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,610
Okay.

30
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,400
I want to safeguard my top position this time. I can't let anyone's score be closely ahead of mine.

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,040
Got it, little guy. You'll be number one.

32
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
Bye.

33
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,740
Mom, it's Dr. Xie.

34
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,910
That's good.

35
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,460
I wondered why my older sister was so happy.

36
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,040
- Eat.
- Okay.

37
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,610
Wow, so sumptuous.

38
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,080
They are all Cantonese dim sum delicacies. I didn't think you'd mind.

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,480
Also this one, your favorite. Darjeeling.

40
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,090
Add some chilled milk.

41
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,640
- Right?
- Yes.

42
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,930
Wow.

43
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,310
Your memory is really good.

44
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,840
I remember that summer in London, at a friend's garden party,

45
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,440
it was the first time I saw you and Qianfan.

46
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,720
We were all drinking at the time,

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,060
but you were drinking tea.

48
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,960
That day, you wore a one-piece floral dress,

49
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,750
about like what you're wearing today, but the color was in red.

50
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,610
Your hair was tied with a ribbon.

51
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,570
Your laughter was especially vibrant.

52
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,300
I noticed you because I was attracted to your laughter.

53
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,390
Is that right?

54
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,760
I don't remember it.

55
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,720
The first thing you said to me was, "Are you a doctor?"

56
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,180
"Hurry up and check this guy next to me. Why doesn't he have any temperature?"

57
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,050
That's right.

58
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,350
Of course, you were talking about Qianfan.

59
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,100
Yes.

60
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,410
Speaking of it, it's been very many years.

61
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,860
We are old now.

62
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,600
No.

63
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,520
I think you are still the same as back then.

64
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,870
Still that young girl with a very bright laughter.

65
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,830
Not changed at all.

66
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,360
What's wrong?

67
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,100
Nothing. It's about work.

68
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,210
Brother, your underling has arrived.

69
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,160
You're here quite early.

70
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,340
I've always been early lately. If you don't believe, you can ask my co-workers.

71
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,910
It's good to be enthusiastic at work.

72
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,290
What about my assignment for you?

73
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,240
Brother, I've broken up with Chu Ting.

74
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,800
Why?

75
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,740
Because we had a huge argument.

76
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,130
You are such a fool!

77
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,360
Song Yiran.

78
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,510
I thought you've grown up,

79
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,440
and won't be like before when falling in love is like playing a game.

80
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,350
At this age, people should get married and establish a career.

81
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,190
But you? No career, no family.

82
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,270
All you know is to fool around every day.

83
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,370
Brother,

84
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,850
I already told you that you shouldn't interfere between me and Chu Ting.

85
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,050
I'm telling you, this break-up is for sure.

86
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,450
You wanted me to be nice to Chu Ting.

87
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,300
Yes, I was truly nice to her, but what happened?

88
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,110
In front of everyone at the gym, she had a big argument with me over some trivial matters!

89
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,580
She didn't give me any respect. What do you want me to do?

90
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,090
About this, I'll tell you how to resolve it.

91
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,330
- How?
- Tolerate it!

92
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,910
Why? Why should I suffer?

93
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,600
Song Yiran, let me tell you this.

94
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,600
If you offend Chu Ting's father, I guarantee that you'll regret it.

95
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,320
Why will I regret it?

96
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,040
I'm not in a relationship with Chu Ting's father and breaking up with him.

97
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,120
Brother, I think my relationship is not about me and Chu Ting, but rather about you and her father.

98
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,270
Shut up!

99
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,170
It's the fact.

100
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,090
I could tell already.

101
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:29,460
Do you dare to look into my eyes and tell me that you didn't want me to be with Chu Ting because of her family's influence? I dare you.

102
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,590
I don't dare.

103
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,450
I don't dare.

104
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,270
Why?

105
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,500
Why else?

106
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,200
They think I'm not doing a good job.

107
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,130
The traditional hotel industry is being hit hard by homestays and the sharing economy.

108
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:09,220
I originally invested all of my capital in foreign investments.

109
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,590
In order to get liquidity,

110
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,240
I've already mortgaged Liang She Hotel.

111
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,020
In the end, there still hasn't been any revenue growth.

112
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,910
The funds are all tied up.

113
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,420
Is our money frozen then?

114
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,860
What about getting a loan? We can pay more points.

115
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,010
The banks, brokerages, investment funds... I've sought all of them out.

116
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,870
Because there is no new growth in revenue, no one wants to invest in us.

117
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,720
You know about those people on the Board of Directors.

118
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,400
When you are making money, everything is good,

119
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,140
but when you are not making money, they just want to kick you out of the board.

120
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,040
Some of them even want to withdraw their shares.

121
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,790
That's why you wanted me to propose marriage.

122
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,200
Ran Ran.

123
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:09,110
If you can marry Chu Ting, everyone will believe

124
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,740
that the Chu family will be our guarantor in funding the Song Group.

125
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,340
Once we can calm people's hearts,

126
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,490
the company won't collapse.

127
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,740
We, businessmen, look prosperous on the surface,

128
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,070
but understand that

129
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,880
anyone can step on us anytime now.

130
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,790
Do you want to see the company die?

131
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,610
This vinegar has aged three years.

132
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,730
This one has aged 12 years.

133
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,020
You can see the difference in the thickness.

134
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,700
It's the effect on the vinegar by the year and the time.

135
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,000
Wow!

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,600
The different years will bring a different flavor.

137
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,560
It's this way with vinegar, and also the same with red wine.

138
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,480
A bottle with a different year will bring a different flavor

139
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,910
Smell it.

140
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,690
- How many years is this one?
- 20 years.

141
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,940
Do you smell a faint fruity aroma, with a slightly smoky smell?

142
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,600
Yes.

143
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,540
No, you are talking of vinegar, and then wine. What exactly are you doing?

144
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,720
Next, you'll make a sour-flavored dish,

145
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,960
but I won't be teaching you. Someone else does it better than I do.

146
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,240
Who is so awesome?

147
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,210
She is here.

148
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,310
Elise?

149
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,410
Yeah. This dish is her specialty.

150
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,060
It uses different sour tastes to handle squid,

151
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,900
also adding fish sauce.

152
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,420
Even though her fermentation flavor is unique,

153
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,560
it unifies the different tones of the delicious squid.

154
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,150
I used to try making this dish, but I never could be as good as she doing it.

155
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,250
Oliver, I forgot to bring my chef's uniform.

156
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,710
- Just wear mine. Mine is—
- I know. Inside the left door of the closet.

157
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,690
Oliver, can you help me?

158
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,410
Okay.

159
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,230
Aren't you afraid that I'll make it difficult for her?

160
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,690
As long as she can learn it well, do as you wish.

161
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,810
Okay! Are you ready?

162
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,360
Let's start then.

163
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,760
Lemongrass, lemon leaves,

164
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,170
bay leaf, and scallions.

165
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,190
Sprinkle some pepper.

166
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,850
Just a little bit.

167
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,960
Then, pour some red wine.

168
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,300
We'll boil it now.

169
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,110
Make three cuts. One, two, three.

170
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,800
It's still one, two, three.

171
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,610
Mash the garlic.

172
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,670
Prepare the vanilla bean.

173
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,040
Add in onions.

174
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,200
Garlic.

175
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,830
Vanilla.

176
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,550
Come.

177
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,860
Try it.

178
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,500
It's your turn.

179
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,080
Uncle Lin.

180
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,430
Blu, you are here.

181
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,460
I texted Xiaoyu a lot.

182
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,790
She never replied to any of them.

183
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,110
- What's the matter—
- She has received them. Her phone kept beeping probably 100 times.

184
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,100
Boss.

185
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,080
- Welcome. Go on inside.
- Okay.

186
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,980
Let's go outside to talk.

187
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,730
Blu.

188
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,230
This kid Xiaoyu, I brought her up by myself.

189
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,930
I pampered her, and watched her grow up bit by bit.

190
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,040
Once she grew up, she has more and more problems.

191
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,330
You just need to tolerate her more.

192
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,370
Uncle, I don't know how I've offended Xiaoyu.

193
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,560
How would I know?

194
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,680
Let me tell you. If she ignores you, then you ignore her too.

195
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,260
The more you pursue her, the more she gets carried away.

196
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,980
Do you understand that?

197
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,790
Remember that.

198
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,960
Can you give this to her then?

199
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,290
What is it?

200
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,980
It's a painting I made for her.

201
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,600
Painting? Can I see it?

202
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,760
I'm opening it here.

203
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,450
Here, give me a hand.

204
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,980
It's quite good, Blu.

205
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,320
Mountain, water, there is an artistic sense.

206
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,290
It's very good. I'll accept it for her.

207
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,510
Wait. There is more than a mountain and water. There is also Xiaoyu.

208
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,170
Xiaoyu?

209
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,030
- Where is she?
- Right here.

210
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,930
You are saying this is Xiaoyu?

211
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,130
You should draw a big tiger bearing fangs and brandishing claws. That would be Xiaoyu.

212
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,090
Tiger? Xiaoyu isn't a tiger.

213
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,120
Xiaoyu is a kitten.

214
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,570
You say Xiaoyu is a kitten?

215
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:16,670
This... You are a good-looking kid, but there's something with your eyesight.

216
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,340
This...

217
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,900
Again. Do it again.

218
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,190
Do it again.

219
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,780
Do it again.

220
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,690
Do it again.

221
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,010
Too much. That's too much.

222
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,990
Are you kidding? Do it again.

223
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,750
Your technique is wrong.

224
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,150
It's not this way.

225
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,050
Next.

226
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,660
Next.

227
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,130
Remember, you should exert more force when you mash the peppercorn.

228
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,140
Otherwise, it would be like now where the sauce is full of its odor.

229
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,560
The mixture isn't blended evenly at all.

230
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,830
I thought Elise was only good at management.

231
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,070
I didn't expect her culinary skill to be so fierce.

232
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,160
She can even play cute.

233
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,030
I used to want to become Chu Ting, now I really want to be her.

234
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,530
The more I learn, the more there is to learn.

235
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:53,160
Lin Kesong, you can't do anything. You're so bad, don't you know?

236
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,190
Is everything okay?

237
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,560
Not good.

238
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,910
Oliver, why did you insist on me teaching her this dish?

239
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,770
With her level, you can teach her well enough.

240
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,810
I mainly didn't want you to teach Victor. Sorry.

241
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,470
Is that a difficult question?

242
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,490
That's fine. I'll do as you say.

243
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,590
[Blu: I drew you.]

244
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,410
Try it.

245
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,820
Is it okay?

246
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,550
Do it again.

247
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,560
Blu!

248
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,610
Xiaoyu!

249
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,730
Where am I?

250
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,930
Aren't you right here?

251
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,860
What's this?

252
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,800
Oh, kitten!

253
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,420
If you say I'm like a kitten, you'll die for sure.

254
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,350
What's that smell?

255
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,300
Stinky tofu. Want some?

256
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,750
Why would a foreigner like eating this?

257
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,010
It's delicious.

258
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,890
Okay, okay. Let's go!

259
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,580
Where to?

260
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,050
To the studio to draw a tiger.

261
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,360
Didn't you say last time that you weren't a tigress?

262
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,090
Hush, Boris.

263
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,750
Hello, Boris. What's up?

264
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,180
Where are you? Why didn't you come here to practice?

265
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,370
Boris, you saw the topic too. It's fermentation.

266
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,190
If you want me to ferment wine or vinegar,

267
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,470
pickles, leaven dough, just let me be.

268
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,430
I've been dealing with these things since childhood. Let me get some fresh air.

269
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,450
Let me relax, and then I can welcome better challenges. Isn't that right?

270
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,350
Get fresh air?

271
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,970
On the battlefield, you tell the enemy, "Wait.

272
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,630
I want to get some fresh air.

273
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,960
I'll fight when I'm ready." What are you doing? Are you kidding me?

274
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,540
- Are you insane?
 - Okay, okay.

275
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,960
I can practice by myself. Besides, after two rounds of the competition,

276
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,200
the situation is already clear.

277
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,130
Only Victor needs to be taken seriously. Relax a little, Boris. Bye.

278
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,130
You...

279
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,370
Watch how I will deal with you!

280
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,870
You must come back here in five minutes!

281
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,000
Is it really okay that you hanged up on him like that?

282
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,300
Have you finished drawing? Let me see it.

283
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,920
Here!

284
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,250
Hello Kitty?

285
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,060
Let me draw it.

286
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,580
Now you look like Hello Kitty.

287
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,630
Do I?

288
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,170
Elise, you sure took a while to chat?

289
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,470
Mom. I was only...

290
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,140
Elise, you're finally back.

291
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,610
Hurry and taste it. Give me a score.

292
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,760
It looks good.

293
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,790
Excellent. It's much better than Lin Kesong's.

294
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:49,010
I taught her all morning, but she still made a mess.

295
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,670
What? Did you go to teach Lin Kesong?

296
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,450
Why? You promised me.

297
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,280
Sorry. It's Oliver who...

298
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,860
So, in your mind,

299
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,890
what your ex-boyfriend says means more than what your mother says?

300
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,470
Your ex-boyfriend's apprentice is more important than your own brother?

301
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,880
It's not that. Even if Lin Kesong learns it, she still won't be better than Victor.

302
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,340
Why didn't you refuse?

303
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:30,240
Mom, it's already done, so it's useless to speak about it any further,

304
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,100
but I don't want to learn the same thing as Lin Kesong does. She's not qualified.

305
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,820
I will cook three different fermented dishes right now.

306
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,420
Mom, see you in a while.

307
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,450
You've really disappointed me.

308
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,850
Sorry, Mom.

309
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,730
Where are you going in a while?

310
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,370
I haven't thought about it.

311
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,320
- Da Mai.
- Da Mai.

312
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,570
Yours.

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,020
Rheumatoid arthritis?

314
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,580
What's yours?

315
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,260
Mine too. We both have rheumatoid arthritis. Isn't this too fake?

316
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,790
Why so much useless talk?

317
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,990
I also have rheumatoid arthritis.

Let me tell you.

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,740
This is not for them to believe.

320
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,530
It's to let them know clearly but they can't say anything.

321
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,430
Blocking. Get it?

322
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,510
Let me tell you. Treat today as if it's the last day.

323
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,810
Don't make it easy for them.

324
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,090
Sure, we'll do what you say.

325
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,030
- Go on.
- Yes. Go.

[Dear Mr Jiang. Hello. You don't need to know who I am...]

328
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,280
[But there's something you need to know.]

329
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,880
An anonymous letter.

330
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,890
Oliver, I received an anonymous letter.

331
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,200
It says people in the kitchen are planning a walkout.

332
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,020
It's probably Da Mai, but not just him. What do we do?

333
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,280
Okay. We just received a batch of small wheat melons today.

334
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,560
The quality is excellent, very fresh. You can recommend them to the customers.

335
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,760
And then, everyone did a great job yesterday. Especially the floor in the front,

336
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,440
all the corners are particularly clean.

337
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,830
Da Mai, take off the apron.

338
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,860
- Why?
- Go back to the kitchen.

339
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,160
Everyone else, meeting dismissed.

340
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,720
Wait.

341
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:10,420
Mr. Jiang, I can go back to the kitchen, but at least give us an explanation.

342
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,940
You can't just make me wash vegetables whenever you say, or make me go back to the kitchen anytime. You make everyone feel unsettled. How can we do the job?

343
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,130
It's been quite a few days. You still don't know what mistake you made?

344
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,450
You tell me then. Let me see if it's the same as I thought.

345
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,890
Number 8 in the management rules, daily meetings start at 5 pm every afternoon.

346
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,550
Staff on duty cannot be late. Have you forgotten?

347
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,130
So it's because I was late for the meeting.

348
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,350
I thought it was because someone was narrow-minded,

349
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,030
and couldn't accept that I said his Wagyu SIrloin and Red Crayfish didn't taste good.

350
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,590
Da Mai, Mr. Jiang has already explained the reason.

351
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,590
You know now. Okay, everyone, let's get to work.

352
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,210
Wait.

353
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,020
The Wagyu Sirloin and Red Crayfish dish,

354
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,500
everyone has tried it. Other than Da Mai,

355
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,100
does anyone think it doesn't taste good?

356
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,960
Mr. Jiang,

357
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,650
whatever you cook is the standard.

358
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,630
We... We don't dare to have any.

359
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,760
Does anyone think it tastes bad? Just raise your hand to show me.

360
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,090
Mr. Jiang has spoken. You've all eaten that dish.

361
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,910
Anyone else?

362
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,020
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

363
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,010
I think it tastes good.

364
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,080
Sorry.

365
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,620
I also think it's not good.

366
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,390
Even though Yuxuan is mine, it also belongs to everyone here.

367
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,500
Everyone is equal when it comes to the quality of food.

368
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,380
I will withdraw this dish.

369
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:08,380
Next, I will work hard to develop new dishes, so everyone can go back to work.

370
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,370
Dismissed.

371
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,760
What's going on?

372
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,520
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

373
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,100
Haven't you heard what Mr. Jiang said?

374
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,210
Go back to work. Why are you standing here dazed?

375
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,430
Go. Go. Go.

376
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,720
I didn't know you would surrender.

377
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,010
Half of what I said is true.

378
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,780
The most important thing now is to stabilize Yuxuan's kitchen.

379
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,330
That was hard on you. If the lead chef and the two assistant chefs were really leaving,

380
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,080
the kitchen would suddenly lose three people. That's big trouble.

381
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,680
You are right. We haven't even gotten Michelin's third star,

382
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,010
we can't let Yuxuan become unstable,

383
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,370
but how did you know about this matter?

384
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,820
This is the anonymous letter.

385
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,100
Read this paragraph.

386
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,070
There is already resistance among the crew. It will definitely develop other conflicts.

387
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:12,140
It can be quite a blow to Yuxuan's plan to get the three stars.

388
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,920
That's exactly the problem.

389
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,900
Develop what other conflicts?

390
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,860
Who knew about this incident?

391
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,520
- When did you find out?
- This morning.

392
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,030
It was by a one-hour express delivery.

393
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:28,510
Why such a rush? The writer of the letter wanted us to see it before the pre-shift meeting.

394
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,790
Luckily, you are here.

395
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,420
There's another matter.

396
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,640
A restaurant headhunter came to me a few days ago.

397
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,230
He beat around the bush to ask me whether Yuxuan's staff were changing.

398
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,410
If there is an employee who didn't want to renew, I could recommend them to him. Anyone from here,

399
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,700
at any position, he would rush to have them.

400
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,050
I was curious about it. It all matches now with this letter.

401
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,930
Someone is making trouble,

402
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,930
and they've already lined up the next restaurant. The headhunter saw the resume.

403
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:55,840
So someone thought we wanted to cut down the staff and rushed to grab them.

404
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,770
Something was quite interesting just now.

405
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:03,220
You said they wanted to get anyone at any position? That means it's not just the kitchen.

406
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,960
This person must be very knowledgeable about our internal situation.

407
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,140
Elise, pay attention to the manager. He must know about it.

408
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,540
Okay.

409
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,690
I'll go check the kitchen first.

410
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,740
Da Mai, do we leave or not?

411
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,820
Well?

412
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,390
What's the situation?

413
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,340
Let me ask you.

414
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,870
Did Jiang Qianfan voluntarily withdraw his dish this time?

415
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,410
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

416
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:49,130
Jiang Qianfan voluntarily admitted his mistake. Isn't it the first time in Yuxuan?

417
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,330
- Yeah, it's the first time.
- Right.

418
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,080
Doesn't this mean that I've

419
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,280
won a total victory on this matter?

420
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,890
Yes. Yes.

421
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,120
Why should we leave then?

422
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,970
So we're not leaving?

423
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,660
- Not leaving then?
- Give me the sick-leave note.

424
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,760
Tear them up.

425
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,260
We won. Why are we leaving?

426
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,550
See? The fence-sitter.

427
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,270
- He's calling.
- Let's see what he says.

428
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,530
- Who's that?
- What's going on with you?

429
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,070
You've already signed their contract.

430
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,470
Manager?

431
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,810
What did you say? I was going to ask you something.

432
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:40,650
Do you think the Wagyu Sirloin and Red Crayfish taste good?

433
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,720
What do you mean?

434
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,890
I remember when we were giving our opinion, someone didn't raise his hand.

435
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,570
I saw everyone else had raised their hand, mine wasn't needed.

436
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,380
That's why they say you don't know someone unless you go through trouble together.

437
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,860
You are really fast to change sides. Okay.

438
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,260
I'll wish you to have a bright future. Bye-bye.

439
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,730
Fence-sitter. What is he?

440
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,560
- That's right.
- That's enough. Hurry and tidy up.

441
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,790
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

442
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,510
Traitor.

443
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,220
Old Zhou, your level is not bad.

444
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,350
- You have the potential to be the lead chef.
- Brother Mai, you're back.

445
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,150
- Go take a break.
- You do it.

446
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,030
Xiao Pa, come here.

447
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,040
[Express Delivery]

448
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,980
Have a seat.

449
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,780
Xiao Pa.

450
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,540
You were hired when Yuxuan was first established in Shanghai, right?

451
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,090
Yes.

452
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,250
A few in the front were brought in by me from London. How well do you get along?

453
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,790
These few are seniors.

454
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,720
They are more experienced, so I try to learn from them.

455
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,880
Why are you asking about this?

456
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,400
I've been self-reflecting about Da Mai.

457
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,670
I am responsible too.

458
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,410
I didn't give your suggestions to Mr. Jiang in time.

459
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,120
If something similar happens again, what do you think about collecting everyone's suggestions?

460
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,650
Mr. Jiang is an artist for the tip of the tongue.

461
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,680
You take care of his feelings.

462
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,590
I can understand you're afraid of hurting his sensitive feelings,

463
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,570
but have you ever thought the customers are concerned about this?

464
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,820
Our restaurant's customers are all high caliber.

465
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,360
Other than Boris, everyone else was too shy to give an opinion.

466
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,540
We're all afraid of sounding unprofessional,

467
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,890
so when you and the manager ask us for our opinions,

468
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,390
I don't think you'd hear much truth.

469
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,490
Then, do you have any solution?

470
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:13,610
Previously, I worked in a western-style restaurant in the Huangpu District.

471
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,270
They use a method where they

472
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,900
listed likable dishes and disliked dishes on the same questionnaire.

473
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,540
Just let people place a check mark. It's completely anonymous.

474
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,860
This way, no one is afraid to offend anyone.

475
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,500
The restaurant will give them a small gift,

476
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,360
such as a paper folded animal.

477
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,920
The customers were all happy. Do you think this is a good way?

478
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,690
It is good.

479
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:40,010
Then, what about when the staff has a bad mood?

480
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,920
Sorry, Miss Quentin.

481
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,850
I'll be bold and say this.

482
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,190
You know.

483
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,810
If you wait for the staff to tell you their opinions,

484
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,040
it means there is already an internal conflict that's getting strong.

485
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,710
There's already big trouble.

486
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,700
That's why if you want to protect Mr. Jiang, you should tell him the truth

487
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,970
because I think Mr. Jiang is the most talented chef.

488
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,360
If he knows the truth, he will definitely find a solution.

489
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,310
Isn't this another method to protect the Yuxuan restaurant?

490
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,480
That's right.

491
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,840
Thank you, Xiao Pa.

492
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,900
I didn't know you love Yuxuan so much.

493
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,780
I have one last question.

494
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,050
Do you think the management rules should be improved?

495
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,040
Not yet for now,

496
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,420
but I think there definitely will be in the future.

497
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,480
If you want to hear about it, I'll come to you to tell you.

498
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,540
There definitely will be?

499
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,170
You are misunderstanding what I'm saying.

500
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,280
I meant, that even the best system can't meet situational changes.

501
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,440
When we encounter a new situation, we'll resolve it with a new system.

502
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,880
A living system is the best system.

503
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,120
It's hopeless to stand by an inflexible rule.

504
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,780
Miss Quentin, I don't know why I have been so talkative today.

505
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,250
No, no. It's really excellent, Xiao Pa.

506
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,510
Thank you very much. You can get back to work.

507
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,180
You are being courteous.

508
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,310
Xiao Pa, come here.

509
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,200
- Manager.
- What was Elise talking to you about?

510
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,930
She was asking me how to get customers' opinions.

511
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,640
Nothing else?

512
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,780
Don't worry. I didn't say anything about that.

513
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,820
Good. Good.

514
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,440
Go to work then.

515
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,540
It's still not right.

516
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,710
Hello, Big Head.

517
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,710
Hello, are you free?

518
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,510
- I need to talk to you.
- I don't have much time now.

519
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,770
But I really have something serious.

520
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,250
Where are you? Text me the address. I'll be right there.

521
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,710
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

522
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,440
I ordered this orange juice for you.

523
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,410
What's the matter with you?

524
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,250
I wanted to tell you that I broke up with Chu Ting.

525
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,290
Didn't you tell me already about it?

526
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,330
But my older brother wants me to propose marriage to Chu Ting.

527
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,710
Do you think I should do it?

528
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,780
Why are you asking me?

529
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,570
For all my ex-girlfriends, didn't you always analyze well?

530
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,550
When I remember it now,

531
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:10,010
it seems that every one of them wasn't a good match for me, according to you. Right?

532
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,140
What's the matter with you now?

533
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,910
Old Lin,

534
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,650
I'm not that important to you anymore. Right?

535
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,940
What is this nonsense?

536
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,170
Getting married is different from dating.

537
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,350
I can't help you decide on this matter.

538
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,130
You know it.

539
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,560
When I take this step, there's no going back.

540
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,920
Answer me.

541
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,150
Do you want me to propose to Chu Ting?

542
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,420
I can only say,

543
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:01,110
I can't find any flaw in Chu Ting.

544
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,710
I get it.

545
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,590
♫  You are the stranger I want to know  ♫

546
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,510
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

547
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,810
♫  I will do little tricks for you  ♫

548
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:40,850
♫  Don't bury your secret heart  ♫

549
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,010
♫  Show them who you are  ♫

550
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:48,210
♫  We sing a song for love  ♫

551
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:53,810
♫ Listen to your heart, to your heart  ♫
